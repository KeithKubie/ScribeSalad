00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress on Washington DC.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.830
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Good
morning, I'm Stephanie Marcus,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.880
from the library's Science,
Technology, and Business Division.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.820
I'm really excited to welcome you

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.680
to the first lecture
of our 2017 series.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.120
We'll have eight more,
and this is the 11th year

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.500
of our collaboration
with NASA Goddard.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
So we're going strong, and as
you can imagine will never run

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.900
out of topics.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.540 position:56%
Our speaker today is astrophysicist,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.250
Julie McEnry, and she
is from Ireland.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.930
She was named Fermi Project
Scientist in 2009 and works

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.090
with all elements of the mission.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.780
Before that, she was the analyst --

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.460
oops, the analysis coordinator
on the large-area telescope,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.660
which is Fermi's primary
science instrument.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.570
She was named one of Fermi's
deputy scientists in 2005.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.400 position:56%
Along with her work at NASA, she has
been an adjunct professor of physics

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.870
at the University of Maryland
College Park since 2009.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.220
So she's a very busy lady.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.740
Dr. McEnry has touched down many
places during her academic career.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.370
She started off with a degree
in physics, with astrophysics,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.350
from the university of Manchester,
and then received her PhD

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.690
from University College Dublin.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.460 position:56%
She did postgraduate work in Dublin,
followed by the University of Utah.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.830 position:56%
That was quite a distance away, and
the university of Wisconsin Madison,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.490
and was a Fermi research
scientist at the University

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.300
of Maryland Baltimore County.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.880
We're really excited to have
Julie McEnry land at the Library

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.100
of Congress today to take us on a
journey into the extreme universe.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.510
Please help me welcome her.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.030
[ Applause ]

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.610
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: Thank you very
much for that nice introduction.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.770
It's really a pleasure to be here.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.510
I would first like to say
that your buildings are nicer

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.750
than our buildings at
Goddard Space Flight Center.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.580
I think it's 50s and 60s
architecture versus earlier.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.130
So what I would like to talk
about today is a snapshot of some

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.220
of the results from the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.010
that I think are exciting.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.370
I'm not going to try cover
everything, because you don't want

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.780
to be here for four or five hours.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.640
But I do think that
in the last 10 years,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.430
we've opened up an entirely new
way to look at the universe.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.860
We've found exciting new things.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.120
We answered questions that
we have, but we've also,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.570
more importantly, opened
new questions.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.870
What you see on the image there
is the map of the gamma ray sky

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.050
with an artist's sketch
of the observatory.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.200
The main instrument, the
large area-telescope,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.900
is actually that squared
box on the top.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.850
We're very much not a
traditional telescope.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.910
So let me begin.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.230
If you go out to the sky at night
and you look up, you'll see stars.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.180
At the right time of the
month, you'll see the moon.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.090
You know where to look, you
can see planets slowly moving

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.790
through the sky.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.130
And if you're in a
dark enough place,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.620
you'll see the faint glow
of our Milky Way galaxy.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.660 position:56%
But if you had gamma ray vision, and
he stood on the ground and look up,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.280
you'd see nothing, because
gamma rays don't get

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.370
through our atmosphere, but
if you could propel yourself

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.600
above our atmosphere and look
at the sky with gamma ray eyes,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.860
you would see a drastically
different place.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.580
The Milky Way, which in optical,
is faint and dim, a small glow.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.810 position:56%
In gamma rays, it's blazingly right.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.530
More than 85% of the gamma rays
we see come from the Milky Way.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.870
They're produced when particles
moving at close to the speed

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.810 position:56%
of light smash into molecules of
gas and light photons in our galaxy,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.900
producing this enormously
bright glow.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.260
This image of the sky is
an galactic coordinates.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.920
So what you're seeing is the
very bright Milky Way galaxy

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.620
across the center, and
I've scaled this image

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.820
so that it doesn't overwhelm
everything else that you see.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.240
It's very, very different.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.900
If you continued to look
at the gamma-ray sky,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.100
you'd notice that the moon is
brighter than the sun and neither

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.830
of them are really bright at all.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.040
In addition to the radiation,
the gamma rays that we see

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.160
from our galaxy, you'd also
see many point sources,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.480
individual sources of gamma rays.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.790
So one example, but I'll talk

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.380
about in a little more
details of are pulsars.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.100
These are rapidly spinning neutron
stores with enormous magnetic

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.420
and electric fields that accelerate
particles to extremely high energy

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.830 position:56%
and produce bursts of radiation that
rhythmically are beamed towards us.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.290
We also see a phenomenon
known as blazars.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.300
This is the most populous
source in the gamma ray sky.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.040
So again, if you're looking at
the sky in optical wavelengths,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.140
the kind of astronomy that
we've been doing since the time

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.360
of the Babylonians,
most of the things

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.760 position:56%
that you see are stars and galaxies.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.400
In gamma rays, most of the things
that we see are things known

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.120
as an active galaxy, where you
have a super, massive black hole

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.550
at the center of the galaxy,
and we're looking at that subset

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.280
of objects where a jet of particles
moving to close to the speed

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.790
of light is pointing in our
direction and beaming and focusing

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.850
that radiation directly at us.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.150
We see gamma ray bursts.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.380
A gamma ray burst is the most, or
at least until the LIGO discovery,

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.030
one of the most energetic
phenomenon in the universe.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.940
When we see a gamma ray
burst, we see a small flash

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.340
of gamma rays blasting
from a fraction of a second

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.170
to around 1000 seconds,
and what you're seeing

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.500
when you're seeing a gamma rays
burst is the birth of a black hole

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.420
in a very distant galaxy.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.150
And I think one of the other things
that are particularly interesting

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.420
about the gamma ray sky is a
lot of it is not well-known.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.070
At any given moment, about a
third of the things that we see

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.170
in the sky do not have
a confirmed origin.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.750
In some cases, it's because
there's several candidate options,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:55.080
and in other cases, we really just
don't know what the object is,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.190
except that it's producing
gamma rays.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.490
So it must be exciting.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.010
I'm not at all biased.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.300
So let me tell you a little
bit about what a gamma rays is.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.270
A gamma ray is the highest
energy form of life.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.830
So if you're familiar with
the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.860
you'll know that it
starts at long wavelengths

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.660
and low energies at radio.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.540
As we increase the energy
or shorten the wavelength,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.060
we pass through microwave,
and optical,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.610
and as we increase
the energies again,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.400
we get to x-ray, and
then to gamma ray.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.950
But what I think is worth pointing

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.030
out here is this is
what our eyes can see.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.630
A very, very small swath of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.220
It's very important,
because we all see it,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.400
but this is what Fermi can see.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.000
The amount of range
of wavelengths covered

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.160
by Fermi is enormously broad.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.750
So while it's all called
gamma ray, that band,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.530
that part of the electromagnetic
spectrum is extremely large.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.830
And why you care about this?

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.200
Well, if you think about it, if
you take a photograph of your hand,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.870
you have a photograph of your hand.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.440
If you take an x-ray of your
hand, you see the bones.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.970
And as you view your hand or the
universe at different energies

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.130
or different wavelengths, you
get different information,

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.980 position:56%
and it's just the same in astronomy.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.450 position:56%
That if we view the universe in
gamma rays, we see different things.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.760
We focus on different things.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.920
We learn different things than
when we make our observation

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.140
with the more traditional
x-ray and optical

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.670
and infrared and radio wavelengths.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.820
So there's two examples
on this chart.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.490
The top shows how the sun
looks in different wavelengths.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.080
The sun is actually quite
an important object for us.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.180
We see it all the time,
but when it flares,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.290
it can briefly become an
extremely bright gamma ray source.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.830 position:56%
And then on the bottom, just to
illustrate how things look different

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.600
in different wavelengths, there
are infrared to x-ray image

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.080
of something holding an iPhone.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.960
So how do we detect gamma rays?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.240
I told you we have a
really strange telescope.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.540
There's no mirrors in gamma rays,

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.130
because the gamma rays would
just go straight through them.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.600
What you have to think about is
how gamma rays actually interact

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.300
with matter, and you
might have heard

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.380
of Einstein's famous
equation E equals MC squared.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.040
And what this is telling
us is that energy

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.820
and matter are fundamentally
the same thing.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.180
C is the speed of light,
which is a very large number.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.880
So if you multiply mass by very
large number, it equals energy,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.540
but a very large amount of
energy, and what's special

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.120
about the wavelength, the energy
of the gamma rays that we looked

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.630
at in Fermi, is that there's enough
energy in each individual gamma ray

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.230
to produce an electron and
the anti-particle to electron,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.530
the positron, in our detector.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.080
So we're using this phenomenon
to detect our gamma rays,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.380
and we're using them because
we're converting the gamma rays

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.010
from energy into matter, and
then we're tracking the motion

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.620
of that matter in our detector.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.920 position:56%
So large-area telescope is this box.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.670
So what happens is a
gamma ray comes in.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.200
It's minding its own business,
and the remarkable thing

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.170
about gamma rays is that, really,

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.290
the universe is very
transparent to gamma rays.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.640
So this gamma ray, well, I mean
that's just a line on the screen,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.730
but if it was a gamma ray, it
will have gone through millions

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.030
and millions of light-years.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.950
It can go straight to our galaxy,
but as soon as it comes close

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.660
to the earth, it's
just going to go splat

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.970
because the atmosphere
will absorb it.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.310
If it hits our atmosphere
first, what will happen is

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.380
that the gamma ray will
interact to produce an electron,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.510
and the anti-particle to
the electronic, the proton,

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.500
indicated in those purple lines.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.950
Our detector contains
instrumentation

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.620
that can precisely
measure the position

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.170
of the electron and positron.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.880
So we measure the tracks of
the electron and positron,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.990
and by reconstructing where
those tracks came from,

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.270
we can figure out where the
gamma ray turned into matter

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.990
and where it must have come from.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.090
At the bottom of our detector,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.660
we have a material
node as a scintillator.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.090 position:56%
A scintillator produces an amount of
light that's related to the amount

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.940
of energy that was deposited
in it, and from that,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.160
we can measure the
energy of the gamma ray.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.590
So now we know where
the gamma ray came

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:34.690
from We know what it's energy was,
so we can, gamma ray by gamma ray,

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:41.010
build up a picture of the gamma
ray sky, one gamma ray at a time,

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.370 position:56%
making our gamma rate map deeper
and deeper and deeper with every day

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.370
that the mission continues
to make observations.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.000
It's an extraordinary instrument.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.860
We have over a million channels
of electronics, but we power it,

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.570
all of this, with something
like a hairdryer.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.600
We're an international instrument.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.540
The instruments on Fermi
were built in Japan, Sweden,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.620
Italy, France, and Germany.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.990
And the logistics of keeping
all this together while we were

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.930
under a strict schedule
was quite a challenge.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.260
So I picked a few interesting
fun facts.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.210
At the time we built the
large area telescope,

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.410 position:56%
we were the largest silicon detector
in the world, larger than anything

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.960
that was built in the particle
accelerators at CERN or Fermilab.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:47.470
This was enough silicon to make
almost a million digital cameras.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.470
We collect information from
a million different sensors,

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:55.490
several thousand times a second, so
our instrument is reading out very,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.790
very quickly all the time.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.020
It's the equivalent of an
instrument that is taking an image

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.740
of the sky thousands
of times a second.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.730
But this is all powered by
the equivalent of a hairdryer

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:12.100 position:56%
with power generated by solar
energy, and interestingly, in space,

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.030
our issue isn't actually our
ability to generate power.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.330
We have no problem with that.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.960
We've got large solar panels,
but in the vacuum of space,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.950
is challenging to get
rid of the heat.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.130
So we went to a lot of effort

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.650
to design extremely
powerful-efficient electronics.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:37.450 position:56%
And our energy range, as of already
mentioned, is extraordinarily broad.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.630
So we take the large-area
telescope, and here's a picture

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:46.880
of the instrument in
Phoenix, Arizona.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.640
It's the silver box on the top
and the spacecraft is just below.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.770
At that point, the solar
panels haven't yet been added.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.490
We then put the spacecraft
on a rocket.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.940
So this is a picture
of the spacecraft now

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:07.870
with the solar panels installed
onto the ferry in Florida.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:13.940
It's a very nerve-racking moment.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.730
You spend 10 years of
your life loving leak,

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.930
carefully putting together for size

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.070
and extremely expensive
instrumentation, and then you put

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.450
on top of an enormous amount
of extremely flammable fluid

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.750
that is uncontrollable
once it's ignited.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.730
And you cross your fingers
and hope for the best.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.660
So many of us took this photo
the night before launch,

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.480
as we couldn't sleep.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.760
So before I show you the next few
charts, to put things into context,

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:49.050 position:56%
something that we didn't realize at
the time is that there was an offset

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.960
of a couple of seconds
between the video feed

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.220
and the audio feed at launch.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.920
So we're waiting for launch,
and the countdown happens.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.740
It's five, four, three, two, one,

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.550
and we have lift off,
and we saw nothing.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:12.110
And then a couple of
seconds later we saw that,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.680
and that looks quite bad.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:20.560
So for the briefest moment, a lot
of people's hearts dropped totally

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.060
into their chest, but
then of course,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.370
it was actually completely fine.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.700
And all that was really happening
here is there was a larger

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.620
than normal amount of water
flow underneath the rocket

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.660
that you flow water underneath a
rocket at launch to stop the pad

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.860
from being destroyed,
we just happened

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.360
to have a particularly
high water supply.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.660
So that isn't smoke.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.850
It's steam.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:50.110
Okay, so let me tell you a bit
more about we've actually seen.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.620
So this is our sky above 1 GeV.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.280
I've shown it to you before.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.400 position:56%
At GeV, is a billion electron volts.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.540
A GeV is a billion electron
volt, and an electron volt is

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.600
about the energy of
normal optical photon.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.150
So what you're seeing here,
every single gamma ray

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:11.120
in this image has an energy that
is a billion times the energy

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.640
of the photons of light that
are entering our eyes right now.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:20.800 position:56%
But we got a broad energy range, so
I can also show you a map of our sky

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.010
above 50 GeV, 50 billion
electron volts.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.560
And what we see in the sky
changes slightly just as it does

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.580 position:56%
when you look at the sky in infrared
and you look at the sky in optical.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.230
Some objects go away.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.560
Some appear, but the
thing I really want you

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.270 position:56%
to notice are those two large lobes.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.360
I think I can do this.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.460
Large lobes above here
and down here.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.300
These were completely unexpected.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.360
They're unusual, because
they're appearing

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.660
at only the highest energies.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.950
That's telling us that
they're being produced

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.810
by very high energy particles
are gamma rays are produced not

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.590
by heating something up
to a very high energy,

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.970
but by accelerating charged
particles to close to the speed

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.500 position:56%
of light, and the more accelerated
particles get, the higher the energy

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.320
of gamma rays that you produce.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.680
So if we see these large,
faint lobes appearing

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.050
at the highest energies,
what it's telling us is

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.970
that there's a population of
particles of electrons or protons,

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.160
we don't know which, in our
galaxy that have accelerated

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.460
to extremely high energies.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.920
These lobes are really
quite extraordinary.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.540
They loom over above and
below the galactic center,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.660
extending for 25,000
light years above

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.310
and 25,000 light years
below the galactic plane.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:51.190 position:56%
If your eyes were sensitive to gamma
rays, the Fermi bubbles would extend

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.760
over almost half the sky.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.490
They would absolutely dominate
the sky you see at night,

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:59.440
and we had no idea that these
existed until we had Fermi,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.430
an instrument that was sensitive

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:07.590
to the photons dominantly being
produced by the Fermi lobes

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.100
over a field of view that's large
enough to map them completely.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.310
If you were to turn the
Fermi bubbles on their side,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:22.310 position:56%
they would envelop us, but they
don't, because they're perpendicular

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.660
to the plane of our galaxy, and
of course, we lie in our galaxy.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.480
So we're -- well, you can
see the label of the sun.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.910
There's lots of things
extraordinary about this.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.400
The total amount of energy in the
Fermi bubbles is equal to somewhere

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.960
between 1000 and 10,000 supernova
all going off at the same time.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.180 position:56%
The energies of the individual
gamma rays are extraordinarily high.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.940
This, I think, is one of
the most unexpected things

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.520
that we could ever have found.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.570
So what do we think it is?

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.230
Well, first, before I go to that,
let's -- another couple of --

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.850
this is one of the early maps that
we used to find the Fermi bubbles,

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.200
and there were two features.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.400
The first I've already described is

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.100
that the Fermi bubbles have
higher energy gamma rays than most

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.560
of the rest of the
emission in our galaxy.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.190
So they stand out when we
make a map of higher energies.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.680
They also have sharp edges.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.160
So the sharp edges are important,
because the sharp edges suggest

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.810
that they were produced
by some transient event.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.820
That something happened that
produced a shock wave that went

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:32.010
out into the intergalactic
medium, blowing up the bubbles.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.670
So now the question is, well,
what could that possibly be?

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:43.980 position:56%
To think about this, you need to try
and imagine where is a good place

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.060
to produce a lot of energy?

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.030
Well, we know that the center

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.770
of our galaxy contains a
supermassive black hole.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.070
It's not active at the moment.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.370
It's quiet.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.670
It's quiescent.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.610
We know it's there, because we
can see the pattern of the stars

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:03.060
as they orbit the center
of our galaxy,

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.110
but what the Fermi bubbles are
telling us is that somewhere

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.960
between 1 to 3 million years ago,

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.150
the center of our galaxy
was not quiet,

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.480
and there are two possibilities.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.200
One is that the black
hole itself became active.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.470
That perhaps some star
has dropped in,

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.790
and you had a large accretion
event that produced the same jets,

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.580
the relativistic jets, the
particles moving close to the speed

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.720
of light beamed into a
narrow jet was produced

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.970
when this creation event happened.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.190
Or, perhaps, you have
a large burst of stars

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.070
that all form at the same time.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:43.220
The large stars will live a very
short life and will go supernova

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.850
at the same time, and
that's another way

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.360
of producing enormous
burst of energy.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.900
Or perhaps we have both.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:54.240
That initially you have a large
burst of star formation followed

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.650
by creation onto the black hole,
produce a jet that then continues

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:02.410
to power and energize this
shock as it extends out.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.710
It's relatively recent.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.870
So once, 3 million years
ago, humans were on Earth.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.030
So in astronomical terms,
I mean, this happened like,

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.750
you know, just the other week.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.250
So I think it's very exciting to
have concrete evidence that are

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.830
at the center of our galaxy.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.120
The black hole at the center
of our galaxy did not behave

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.830
in the recent past way
that we see it now.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:30.740
Okay, so let me tell you a little
bit about how we make observations.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.040
This is supposed be an animation.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.340
There we go.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.260
So we got a huge field of view.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.980
The field of view of our
instrument, we see about 20%

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.430
of the sky at any instance.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.760
That's about what your
eye is [inaudible].

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:46.030
So what we do is if you
imagine, you just look,

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.330
you're going around the earth,

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.580
and you just always point
yourself away from the Earth.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:54.110
You'd sweep out a swath of
the sky that cover about 80%.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.310
We're not interested in
seeing only 80% of the sky.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.240
We want to see the whole sky.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.290
So what we do is we
tilt North for one orbit

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.790
and cover the northern
hemisphere, and we tilt South

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.750
for the second orbit to cover
the southern hemisphere,

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:13.100
and what you see in this bottom
right-hand chart is the coverage

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.300
of the sky over those two orbits.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.990
We see the entire sky
every three hours.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.680
And that's particularly important,

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.060
because the gamma ray
sky is highly variable.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:30.130
Gamma ray bursts are popping off,
are active galaxies, are flaring,

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.740
sometimes by changing their
flux by a factor of 100

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.940
on time scales of hours or days.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.470
So here what I've done
is taken the Fermi sky

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.150
and taken the northern hemisphere
and put it on the left-hand side

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.350
and the southern hemisphere and
put it on the right-hand side,

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:51.290
and the very bright galactic plane
is now a little bit suppressed.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.840
So you can see the other
things that are varying.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.750
Most of the things that you're
seeing are active galaxies.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:04.180
Super-massive black holes at very
large distances from us, with jets,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.310
relativistic jets, jets with
particles moving close to the speed

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.840
of light pointing directly at us.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.320
You'll also notice that there seems
to be a source running around.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.050
This image is -- this movie is made

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.890
of the sequence of
one-day snapshots.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.230
So this is what our sky
looks like every day.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.340
The object that's running
around is the sun.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.800
So, I mean, we can see it.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.950
It's not, you know, it's
not that it's not there,

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.470
but it's certainly not as
bright as the optical sun.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:40.230 position:56%
I mean, imagine trying to take an
image of the sky when the sun is up.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.200
You certainly wouldn't
see any stars.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.690
I did mention earlier that the
moon is brighter than the sun,

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.860
but of course, of these
timescales, the moon is moving

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.140
through this image
much more quickly.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.540
So you're not seeing the
moon, because it's smearing

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.340
across a larger number of pixels
on an integration time of a day.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:06.320
So I'm going to switch
gears a little and talk

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.690
about one type of object.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.190
So if you start -- the
Earth is kind of small

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.490
in the grand scheme of things.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:18.380
It's very important to us,
but we're really kind of tiny.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:23.470
And I'm showing this just to give
you a sense of the scale of size

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.160
between the sun, the
moon, and the Earth.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.520
And I'm telling you this
because I want to give you a feel

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.800
for how much -- how
large the sun is.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.430
Now imagine taking the sun and
compressing it to something

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.460
that would fit inside DC.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.850
You'd have enormously
high densities.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:49.700
When you compress things, you
also compress the magnetic fields.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.610
So you end up with a
magnetic field that's more

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.050
than a million times more intense

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.100
than anything we can
produce on Earth.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.400
So now you have something
that's incredibly dense,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.520
with an incredibly high magnetic
field, and we spent rapidly.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.630
And by rapidly, think of
something like a ceiling fan.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.800
I mean, can you imagine something
that is the mass of the sun,

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.030
the size of DC, and spinning
as rapidly as a ceiling fan?

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.280
These are really extraordinary
objects.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.880
So it shouldn't surprise us
that this is the kind of place

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.750
that gamma rays can be produced,

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.050
because when we're
reducing gamma rays,

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.620
we're looking for extremes
in the cosmos.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.390
We're looking for extremes
in magnetic fields,

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.800
extreme energy, extreme
acceleration.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.930
We don't, in general, see stars in
gamma rays unless they're exploding

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.580
or have exploded and they're in a
more energetic phase of their life.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.630
So what you're seeing
here is an animation

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.870
of a rotating neutron star,
just to give you the sense

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.850
of how you're going to
see a sequence of pulses

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:52.690
from the emission be produced
at the two magnetic poles.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:57.270
Neutron stars are produced
in solar explosions.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.260
So you produce a neutron star
by starting with a normal star

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.140
at the end of the star's life.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.010
It stops the nuclear burning.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.860
The material collapses on the
center into a huge explosion,

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:15.290
and the remnant of this is either
a black hole or a neutron star.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:24.160
So this brings me to the very first
result that we had with Fermi.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.710
So October 16th is
our publication date,

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:30.770
which means since we
started operations in August

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:35.510
that this first result was based on
our first couple of weeks of data.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:42.890
What you see on the left-hand side
is the grayscale, is a radio image

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:45.300
of the supernova remnants CTA1A.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.760
A supernova remnant
is the outer bits

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:55.010
of the shock that's produced
when the star explodes.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:59.740
The blue circle is the
size of the uncertainty.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.120
So we knew that there is a gamma
ray source here, but we didn't know

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.160
where it was better than the size
of this blue circle from six years

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.000
of observation with the
previous instrument.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.630
The red circle shows how well
we could pinpoint the location

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.090
of this source with Fermi
after just two weeks of data.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.660
The red source lies right
on top of an x-ray source.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.190
So it's clear, at this point,
that the gamma ray source

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.440
and the x-ray source really
must be the same thing.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.800
So the gamma ray is being, in
this case, were not being produced

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.470
by the supernova remnant.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:39.780
They were being produced by
whatever that x-ray source was.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.040
Well, what makes this really
interesting is that when we looked

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:46.060
at the data, we realized that
the pattern, the arrival time,

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.690
of the gamma rays was not uniform.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:57.660
That every 316 milliseconds, we
were seeing the same patterns.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:03.140
So what you're seeing on here
is zero to 316 milliseconds

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.810
and then were just repeating
the same thing again.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:11.520 position:56%
And this is telling us that for each
rotation of this star, this source,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:19.600 position:56%
is rotating at 316 milliseconds,
and that the gamma rays are arriving

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.690
at the same point in
this rotation each time.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.740
So it's telling us
that this is a pulsar.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.150
But it's not a pulsar in radio.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.820
It's not a pulsar on x-rays.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:37.990
This was a pulsar shining only in
gamma rays, and that was telling us

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:43.090
that we were never seeing the full
sample of pulsars in our galaxy,

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.840
because before Fermi, we didn't
have an instrument that was able

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.560
to find most of the pulsars.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:53.630
And they're important, because a
pulsar is the end stage of a star.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.710
So if we want to understand
the full lifecycle of a star,

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.370
you have to understand them
from the birth right the way

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:04.560
through to the death,
and this is the death.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.890
So this is an early degree
of PowerPointmenship.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:16.730 position:56%
So this is -- we've taken a bunch of
the early pulsars, manually put them

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.780
onto the plot, and then
manually added an animation

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:24.100
that is flashing 10 times
slower than the actual pulsar.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:28.280
But it illustrates what
we have in the sky.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.620
So CTA1 was just the
first of many pulsars

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.530
that are found only in gamma ray's.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.430
We have over 60 that are
shining only in gamma rays.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:41.570 position:56%
About a third of the pulsars that
we know of shine only in gamma rays.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.450
We've also found 60 normal pulsars,

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.640
the ones that are also
shining in radio.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.130
But you also notice on this image
that there's pulsars in pink

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.470
that look like they're
just doing -- they're not.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.340
They're going very, very fast.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:59.330
Those are millisecond pulsars, and
those are a special kind of pulsar.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.050
They're pulsars that reach the
end of their lives, slow down,

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.050
then they accreted material from a
companion that sped them up again

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.510
until they were, again,
turned on his pulsars.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:13.960
They're known as millisecond
pulsars.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.300
They're very special objects,
and they're very special objects

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.590
because they're excellent clocks.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.800
So one of the things that Fermi's
been able to do that over half

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:29.270 position:56%
of the known millisecond pulsars
have been found from Fermi searches.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.060
And what we use millisecond
pulsars for is

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.190 position:56%
that you've got something that's
spinning very, very, very regularly.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:39.090
So it's an excellent clock so if
you imagine you've got a very large

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.390
gravitational wave coming

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.660
through the galaxy that's
distorting space/time,

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.860
it's going to slightly move the
arrival time of the radiation

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:53.650 position:56%
from these millisecond pulsars, and
we can use that to chart the passage

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.670
of very large gravitational waves.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.260 position:56%
So with this, we can create a galaxy
-sized gravitational wave detector.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.920
So this is just one
example of what you can do

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.710
with the millisecond pulsars.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.320
We have another mystery.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.160
So this is not gamma rays.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.900
This is an optical image of our
galaxy, and the animation that I'm

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.630
about to show is going to zoom in
towards the center of our galaxy.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:18.980
So this is close to the center.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.790
So not like the Fermi bubbles.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:28.700
Hang on. We need to
actually play it.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:34.270
As we get closer, this animation
will superimpose what we see

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.730
at the galactic center.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:39.830
And as the animation
continues, all of the known ways

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.890
to produce gamma ray's
will be subtracted.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.480
Subtract the background.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:49.480 position:56%
We'll subtract the point sources,
and what you get left with is a blob

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:54.390
about 10 degrees in size
that is also unexpected.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.060
It has an unusual spectrum,
and by spectrum,

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.490
I just mean the distribution
of energies off the gamma rays.

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.190
It just peaks between 1 and 5 GeV.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.310
A supernova remnant
doesn't behave like that.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:10.180
A pulsar can, but a pulsar
isn't 10 degrees in size.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:14.080
So this is one of the second
mysteries that we have

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.680
at the center of our galaxy.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.380
That the center of our galaxy
is special, because that's

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.340
where the largest gravitational
sync is.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:29.440
You might have heard of
the mystery of dark matter.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.410
That there is a material in
our galaxy, there is material

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:39.260
and galaxy clusters beyond what
we can actually see radiating.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.370
And our colleagues from
particle physics tell us

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:46.730
that the leading candidate for
dark matter, because it solves one

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.130
of their particle physics
problems, is a new particle

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:54.410
that when it encounters
itself, will produce gamma rays.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.630
Where would you expect to find the
most dark matter in our galaxy?

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.330
Right at the center.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:32:59.750
How would you expect
it to be distributed?

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.390
You'd expect it to be
distributed in a blob.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.900
What would you expect
the spectrum to be?

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.340
You'd expect it to be peaked
and have a sharp cut off related

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.490
to the size of the
dark matter particle.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:17.770
So one exciting possibility is that
what we're seeing here is a signal

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.810
of dark matter in gamma rays.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:23.220
If we look at our neighboring
galaxy, Andromeda.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.780
So this is a very recent result
published earlier this year,

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.180
we found the same thing
in Andromeda.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.220
So what you're saying
on the left-hand side,

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:39.930
the contour lines chart where
the gas in that galaxy is.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.730
If the gamma rays in
Andromeda are produced

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.720
by very high energy
particles smashing into gas,

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.710
then the gamma rays should
be following the pattern

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.850
of those lines.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.150
And it is not.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:57.630
The gamma rays are concentrated
at the center of that galaxy.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.980
So like our galaxy, Andromeda has

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:05.700
in an anomalously bright
emission of gamma rays.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:10.060
Like our galaxy, Andromeda sees
the same distribution of energies.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.550
So whatever we see in the center
of our galaxy is not unique

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.760
to our galaxy, but is a
phenomenon that's likely present

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.080
in all normal galaxies.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:24.360
So this is potentially very
exciting, and it, you know,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.210
we're still excited at the
prospect of this being dark matter,

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:32.110
but you have to always
consider other possibilities.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.200
And now that we know that
there's a large number of pulsars

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.410
in our galaxy, it's possible
that we've a large population

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:41.290
of millisecond pulsars around
the center of our galaxy,

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:43.090
and from my perspective,
it doesn't really matter

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.690
which of these perspectives
are correct.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:49.610
I think it's incredibly
exciting that the center

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:53.110
of our galaxy had activity
several million years ago

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.790
that we didn't know about,
and that now the center

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:59.240
of our galaxy contains components
that we didn't know about.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.790
I'm going to switch
gears completely.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.840
Everything I've spoken
about so far our data

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.250
from the large area telescope.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.690
That's this box up at the top.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.630
But there's other instrumentation
on Fermi.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.110 position:56%
We have the gamma ray burst monitor.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:19.350
It's an array of instruments.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.590
There's three here, one
here, another three,

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.550
and the same on the other
side of the spacecraft.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:28.080
And his instrument is designed
to detect flashes of gamma rays

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.750 position:56%
at lower energies then the Fermi
telescope, but large-area telescope.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:35.390
So what kind of things do we see?

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:39.030
Well, a gamma ray burst,
I've already mentioned,

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:44.670 position:56%
is the birth of a black hole, either
because two neutron stars merge

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.940
or a neutron star and
a black hole merge,

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:52.230
or a large star has an
extremely energetic supernova.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.400
There's an object known
as a magnetar,

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.230
and a magnetar is an extremely
high magnetic field neutron star,

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:04.260
and when you crack the crossed
and have a sudden large release

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.660
of magnetic energy, you get
a large burst of gamma rays

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.900
that the whole star is shaking.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.800
So the gamma rays are coming
out in a periodic motion,

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.750
but this periodic motion
isn't telling us

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.100
about the rotation of the magnetar.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.230 position:56%
This periodic motion is telling us
about the structure and the interior

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:23.480
of the star, just as the sound
you get from a bell is determined

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.610
by the material of the
bell and its shape.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:30.980
We can use the time, the pattern
of the signal from the gamma rays

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.810
from magnetars to explore
the interior structure

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.130
of a neutron star.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:39.090
We see gamma ray flashes
from the sun,

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.470
less now that the sun isn't
active, and the topic that I want

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.370
to focus on, because I
thought I'd do something other

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.580 position:56%
than astrophysics, or thunderstorms.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:53.370
Because the Fermi gamma ray burst
monitor sees the entire sky,

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.570
most of it is the sky, but
the earth is underneath us.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:58.080
So we don't see the
sky through the earth.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.560
We see the Earth.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.980
And when the spacecraft is
over regions of the earth

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:08.970
that have thunderstorm systems,
we quite often see a very short,

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:13.340
brief flash of gamma rays,
lasting just milliseconds,

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.930 position:56%
with a very characteristic spectrum,

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:18.460
very characteristic
distribution of energies.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.270
And if you plot these
unusual transients in the sky,

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.300
you'll find that they
lie on top of regions

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.600
where there were thunderstorms.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.370
This was the moment where I learned

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.930
that thunderstorms
happen largely overland.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:37.280
I think it's kind of
obvious from this.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.660
But what's interesting is a handful

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.370
of them show very unusual
properties.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:45.910
So we had a situation where
the spacecraft was above Egypt,

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:50.060
and we saw one of these
terrestrial gamma ray flashes,

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.680
flashes of gamma rays
produced in thunderstorms.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.710
But there wasn't any thunderstorms
in Egypt, but there were

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.920
in Tanzania, and if
we look at the --

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.580
there's two things I
want you to look at.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.870
The first is the --
on the left-hand side,

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:11.050
what you're seeing here is
time on the x axis and counts,

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:15.710
number of gamma rays on the right
excess, and what we saw was a peak,

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.780
and then it came down, and then
we saw another little peak.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.220
And that's unusual, but what
I really want you to look

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.630
at is on the right-hand side.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:28.380
On the right-hand side what you
see is energy along the x axis

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.380
and the number of gamma rays
on the right on the y axis,

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.580
and this sharp spectral feature.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:39.910
The energy of that
bump is at 511 KeV.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:48.780
That's exactly half the
energy of an electron.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:53.030
What's happening here isn't that
we're seeing gamma ray's directly.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:57.160 position:56%
What's happening is the positrons
are directly hitting the instrument,

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.460
are converting.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:02.180
It's a positron is the
antimatter particles, the electron.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.550
They're hitting electrons
in our detector,

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.230
and they're doing the
opposite of the pair conversion

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:08.530
that I spoke about before.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.260
So E still equals MC
squared, but in his case,

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.980
we're turning the matter
back into gamma rays,

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:18.510
and then we're detecting those
gamma rays in the instrument.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.850
This also was a surprise.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.170
So you go back to the drawing
board and you think, well,

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.570
what was -- what's going on here?

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:30.880
So this image shows a
thunderstorm on Earth.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.570
The moon is there just for context,

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:43.520
and in the thunderstorm,
the pink are gamma rays.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.490
So what you have is
an enormous amount

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.070 position:56%
of acceleration in the thunderstorm.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.400
The thunderstorm is
accelerating particles.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.260
The particles are producing
gamma rays in the atmosphere.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.000
But the accelerated
particles, when they move --

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.600
when particles move
in a magnetic field,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.040
they have to follow the
magnetic field line.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.870
So the charged particles are

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:06.600
in yellow can't spray
out in all directions.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.060
They are following the
magnetic field line.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.930
So we move onto the next
animation, now you can start

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.950
to get a sense of what happened.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.330
The thunderstorm happened
in Tanzania.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:20.050
You've got a pulse
of charged particles.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.660
This is a pulse of
electrons and positrons

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:25.730
that are traveling along the
magnetic field line thousands

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.990
of miles, hitting our spacecraft.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.310
And they're continuing along
the magnetic field line

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.020
until they reach the conjugate
point, at which they bounce

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.870
and come back and hit
the spacecraft again.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.200
So this is the same
kind of phenomenon

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.190
that keeps charged particles
in the Van Allen belt.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:47.100
I find it quite amazing to realize
that even if you're thousands

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.580
of miles away from something, that
a thunderstorm is affecting us

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.440
by sending antimatter directly to
us from thousands of miles away.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.220
So I'm almost finished.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.460
I'm not going to talk about all
the other things that we do,

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:03.160
but we have done and continue
to do extraordinary things.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:09.040
So what I'm showing here, starting
on the bottom left, close to us,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.610
and going up to the top
right to most distant

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:16.530
from us are all the
astrophysical topics

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:21.010
that Fermi has produced
a press release on.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.750
Everything in yellow are
things that were not known

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.060
as gamma ray emitters
before the launch of Fermi.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.910
So we have it just seemed
more gamma ray sources.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:32.280
We haven't just measured known
gamma ray sources more precisely.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.790
We have understood the
energetic universe in a way

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:37.580
that we had no idea
before launching Fermi.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.950
This has opened our
eyes and hold new ways.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:44.870
And I am pleased that we are
able to address the questions

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:49.140
that we said we would address
when we launched the instrument,

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.650 position:56%
but I think, as a scientist, what
makes me most excited about Fermi is

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:56.150
that we've raised new questions.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.010
We know the Fermi bubbles
exist, but we don't know

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.160
yet precisely what causes them.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.620
We know that we've got an excess of
gamma rays in our galactic center,

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.090
but we don't know what
that excess is.

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:13.500 position:56%
I could have given this talk and
covered a completely different range

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.800
of topics, and I sometimes do,
and I think they would've been,

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:23.890
at least to me, just as compelling
as what I've described to you here.

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:26.000
So I think my summary is
to say that, you know,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.550
really there's much
more to the universe

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.260
and we can see with our eyes.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:34.830
This is true on earth just as
much is it's true in the cosmos.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.400
My day job is extremely exciting,

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.130
because our observatory is
constantly scanning the entire sky,

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.790
and the sky is constantly changing.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.100
So there's always something
new to fine.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.940
I talked about two unexpected and
different features in our galaxy.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.850
We have huge lobes of tens of
thousands of light-years in size,

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.770
and then we have this unexpected
blob right at the center

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:57.700
of our galaxy, both of which
have potentially extremely

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.230
exciting explanations.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:03.330
The first is that the galactic
center was not as calm and quiet

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:09.140
in the near past as it is now,
and the other might be a signal

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.040
of dark matter or might be
telling us about a whole population

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.860
of objects close to the center
of our galaxy that we know about.

didn't discuss, but what can you do?

Thank you, so much.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.880 position:56%
We have time for some questions, and
I will ask Dr. McEnry to repeat them

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.710
so everyone can hear them.

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:53.150
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:58.370
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: Yes, so when
a gamma ray is just traveling

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:02.360
through a vacuum, it's
going to stay gamma ray,

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:07.560
but when a gamma ray passes close
to the electric field of a nucleus

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.920
or to another photon,
in that scenario,

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.670
then you can have a
physical interaction

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:18.900
that converts the gamma ray into
a matter and antimatter pair.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:23.200
The matter that's produced
is related

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.900
to the energy of the gamma ray.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.470
Electrons are like.

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:29.680
So that's about mostly
what's produced,

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.900
because we don't have gamma
rays that are large enough

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.760
to produce any other particles.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.630
So now we have two
charged particles.

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:39.980 position:56%
We have an electron, which you've
probably heard of, and the positron,

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.500
which is the anti-particle
to the electron.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.940
The electron has a negative charge.

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.150
The positron has a positive charge.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:51.230
The silicon in our
detector produces a signal

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.420
when a charged particle
goes through it.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:58.270 position:56%
So with each layer of silicon in the
detector, we're pinpointing the path

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:00.200
of that electron and positron.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.880
So if you imagine, you see
the electron going this way,

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.530
the positron going this way,
you draw a line between them,

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.190
and the gamma ray then
just has to come from where

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.510
that line kind of averages out.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:27.040
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.860
Yes, so the place, the other place
where we see this quite commonly is

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:35.930
in the detector that I just
described to you here is very,

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:38.190
very similar to kind of
detectors that they build

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.680
in the particle accelerators,
and in fact,

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.830
that's why this mission is a
partnership between the Department

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:49.510
of Energy and NASA, because we
work with the particle physicists.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.850
So the other place where you
have these kinds of detectors

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.810
and you're measuring the
same phenomenon is places

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:58.610
like the Large Hadron Collider
in CERN, and in that case,

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:02.440
they're smashing protons
together, and in that collision,

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.260
they're also producing
high-energy gamma rays

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.630 position:56%
that are having exactly the same
phenomenon in the detectors at CERN.

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.500
That they're producing
electron-positron pairs,

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:15.040
and the physicists there can
do the same thing that we do,

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.340
reconstruct to figure

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.500
out how energetic those
individual gamma rays are.

Please repeat the question.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:24.890
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: Ah, sorry.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.190
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I have one.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:30.130
Is this mission going to continue
and continue for many, many years?

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:34.170
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: So the question
is will this mission continue?

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:39.340
And we do not have anything
that is consumed on board.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:45.060
We have a propulsion system, and
there's a requirement that you have

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:49.160
to have a propulsion system -- if
you don't have a propulsion system,

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.290
you have to design your mission
so that you have to de-orbit,

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.380
I think, within 15 years.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.040
Because we have a propulsion
system, we're and an orbit

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:01.080
that will remain valid for
science taking until at least 2050.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.270
Our performance now, almost
10 years after launch,

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.570
is actually a little bit
better than it was at launch,

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:14.080
because we find how
we process the data

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:20.610
so this point we will continue
making observations for as long

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:26.610
as it is scientifically, and every
three years, we are reviewed,

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:31.520
and that determines whether we
continue on it in the future.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:39.650
&gt;&gt; So what about high-energy solar
flares that you did not discuss?

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:44.270
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: Okay, high-energy
solar flares are interesting for us

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:48.850
because one of the results that
I didn't have an opportunity

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:51.050
to discuss -- so here's a picture

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:55.860
of the sun during three solar
flares that we saw with Fermi.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:01.560
And what's amazing is that these
images were taken by stereo.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.240
Stereo, you can see
the back of the sun.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.390
So this is not the part of the
sun that's facing the earth.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:10.450
This is the part of the sun that's
facing away from us, and yet,

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:15.990
we saw a bright flash of gamma rays
lasting about two hours associated

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:22.440
in time with the outburst
that you see in this movie.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:28.640
So what must be happening is that
the sun, when it has a flare,

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:35.400
it's throwing material way
out into the solar system.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.500
Those particles, like I
discussed with the TGF,

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:43.420
follow the magnetic field lines
long enough that the particles,

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.540
the energetic particles, are
now far enough away from the sun

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.770
that we can actually see
them directly from Earth.

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.460
So this was -- I mean, one of the
real things that we've learned is

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:59.260
that when the sun flares, it's
kicking material very far away,

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.970 position:56%
and that the particles in the kicked
out material are being accelerated

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.580
to extremely high energies.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:08.030
And we wouldn't have known that
if everything was coming straight

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.980
for us, because we can't tell the
difference between gamma ray's

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.710
that are produced right at the sun
and produced kind of halfway to us,

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.010
if it's all in the line of sight.

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:20.260
In this particular case, it was
telling us that the geometry

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:25.140
of how the gamma rays are being
produced is not what was expected.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.360
&gt;&gt; How energetic are they?

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: These, the gamma
ray's in each of these three flares,

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.150
these were very, very high energy.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:35.430
So these ones were actually
seen by our main instrument,

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:47.510
the large area telescope, and
they extended up to a few GeV.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:53.080
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.350
The gamma rays are absorbed in
our atmosphere in the same way

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:56.980
that they're absorbed
in our detector.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:03.380
So the gamma rays come in, and they
will interact with or pass close

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:07.140
to an atomic nucleus
in the atmosphere

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.920
and produce the electron-positron
pair.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.030
And in fact, if you look at gamma
rays that are much higher in energy

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:18.040
than the ones that we do, that
process produces electrons

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.010
and positrons that are
themselves very energetic.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:22.680
Those electrons and
positrons interact

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.020
and produce more gamma rays,
and the gamma rays interact

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.480
to produce more electrons
and positrons.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.260
You've got a cascade of particles
moving through the atmosphere.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.190
So before I moved to NASA
and started working on Fermi,

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:41.970
I worked on instruments on the
ground that detected the particles

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:43.610
that are produced in the shower,

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:48.130 position:56%
and if the initial camera has a high
enough energy, then some remnant

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:49.430
of the gamma rays' passage

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:52.370
through the atmosphere is
still there at ground level.

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:55.000
And what we do is measure the
particles that reach the ground,

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:01.690
and from that, figure out
where the gamma ray came from.

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:05.570
&gt;&gt; You mentioned gamma rays
being created by lightning.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.220
Have you detected gamma
rays coming, therefore,

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:11.460
from group storms on Jupiter?

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.760
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: We have not.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:19.740
We have looked, but if you were to
scale the intensity and then move

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:24.700
out to the distance that
Jupiter is at, we wouldn't expect

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:30.980 position:56%
to see gamma rays from thunderstorms
on Jupiter, unless they were much,

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.550
much more intense than
the models predict.

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:35.850
Yeah?

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:41.950
&gt;&gt; Have you seen these
bubbles coming off the center

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:43.630
of other galaxies?

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:45.160
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: So the question
is have we seen the bubbles

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.370
from other galaxies?

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.290
And the answer is maybe.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:53.440
It's hard to see them from --

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.530
I mean, we're not able
to see very far away.

00:51:55.530 --> 00:52:01.100
We do see large gamma
bubbles from Centaurus A,

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.540
which a large radio galaxy.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.130
Actually, if I go back to
an image, I can show it.

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:17.710
Of course, if I go back to it,
I won't be able to find it.

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:21.700
So Centaurus A is a
source that's just here.

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:25.000
But it's not quite the same,

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.940
because the Centaurus A contains
a currently active black hole

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.240
with a relativistic jet.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.920
So it's possible that
what we're seeing

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:36.310
in Centaurus A is something that's

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.330
in the process of making
the bubbles.

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:42.650
But we have not seen
the gamma ray bubbles

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:46.020
from any other galaxy
that's calm and quiet.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:51.890
But for the same reason that we
don't expect to see thunderstorms

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:55.290
on Jupiter, if you were to
take the intensity of emission

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:58.970 position:56%
from that we see from our galaxy
and move it to how dim it would look

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:03.350
if you put it in another galaxy, in
most cases, it would be invisible.

[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:22.540 position:56%
So the question is how fast do gamma
ray convert from energy into matter.

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.440
How fast to the resulting
particles move?

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:31.270
And the answer is it depends
on the energy of the gamma ray.

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:37.020
If the gamma ray has just enough
energy to produce the electron

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:43.690
and positron, then the electron and
positron will actually be at rest.

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.800
If the gamma ray has more energy,
then the resulting electron

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.140
and positron will have more energy,
and energy is directly related

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.110
to how fast the particles
are moving.

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:57.210
So the speed of the electron and
positron that are produced depends

00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:00.190
on the energy of the
camera a that produced it.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:03.720
And in most cases, the electron
and positron are, themselves,

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.510
are moving at close
to the speed of light.

&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: Yes, so it
is certainly the case that,

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.040
and we joke about this, that the --

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.530
a gamma ray telescope is
almost like an anti-study.

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.280
That anywhere that could
produce gamma raises going

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.360
to be extremely inhospitable
to life.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:00.840
Some of the phenomenon I described,
if the radiation was produced by --

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.490
if that same phenomenon
happened close to us,

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.190
it could be quite severe.

00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:09.970
So there's a couple of examples.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:16.570
The magnetar, which I
described with the GBM,

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:22.990
some of those magnetars have --
when the magnetic crust cracks

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:25.950
and you have this huge release
in energy, these objects are

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:28.740
in our galaxy, and the
radiation that we see

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:33.600
on earth can be sufficiently
high that it would knock

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.220
out electromagnetic communication.

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:40.480
We haven't had one of these
out bursts in about 15 years,

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.020
and in the past 15 years,

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:47.960
our electromagnetic infrastructure
has greatly increased.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.470
So could we tell you that
something bad was happening,

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:51.770
you need to protect yourself?

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:54.420
Probably not, because the by
the time we see something,

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.610
the bad has already happened.

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:59.600
However, we could tell you
what the problem had been,

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.840
and I think that actually would
be in extremely important.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.120
So if our communication systems
were suddenly knocked out,

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.420
it would be very helpful to know

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:12.470
that it was an actual astrophysical
source that caused that.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:18.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Have you seen anything that could
suggest burning all life right off

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:20.570
the planet?

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:23.160
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: So the
second example would do that.

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:28.420
On the left-hand side
is a gamma ray burst.

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.660
And we see gamma ray bursts
from the edge of the universe.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.420
If they gamma ray burst
happened in our galaxy,

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.880
and the radiation was
beamed towards us,

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.990
it would damage life very severely.

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:44.890
Not necessarily directly, but
it would change the properties

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:49.350
of our atmosphere sufficiently
severely that if you didn't die

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.580 position:56%
in the immediate radiation exposure,

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:55.450
life on earth would be very
difficult for some time afterwards.

00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:59.050
Now there are some hypotheses
that the age of the dinosaurs,

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:08.390 position:56%
that it is one of the candidate ways
that dinosaurs stopped being around.

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:11.420
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I hope no one
has nightmares after this lecture.

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.770
&gt;&gt; Julie McEnery: Well,
it has been a long time.

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:15.180
They're not that common.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.140
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Okay, I guess that's it.

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.650
Thank you so much for coming.

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:20.450
Thank you.
