00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.490
Now let's compare the MESI,
MOSI, and MOESI protocols.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.950
We have three cores and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.840
we start off with block A being in
the invalid state in all three caches.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.930
Suppose that we have sequence of axises.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.520
Core one reads A.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.500
Core one, then writes A.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.660
Core two reads A then writes A.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.330
Core three then reads A.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.770
Core one, then reads A.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.080
And core two also reads A.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.323
Assuming that A's the only
thing we access so

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:33.507
we don't have to worry
about replacing A for

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:37.750
these caches unless it needs to
be replaced because of coherence.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.030
How many memory reads and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.290
Bus requests do we have in
this sequence of events for

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.090
MESI, MOSI, MOESI protocols?
