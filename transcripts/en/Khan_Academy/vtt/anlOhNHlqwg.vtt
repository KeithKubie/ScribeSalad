00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.150
Blair scored 144 points
this football season.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.084
He scored all his points
with 50-yard field goal--

00:00:09.084 --> 00:00:10.500
that's actually
pretty impressive.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.000
50.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.210
That's close to record breaking.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.140
Even in the National
Football League,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.440
I think the record is like
60 yards or something.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.410
So Blair seems like a fairly
impressive individual.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.800
He scored all his points with
50-yard field goal kicks.

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:28.130
I'm just underlining
that, because I'm

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.400
impressed by how far
those field goals are,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.850
which are each worth 3 points.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.486
So a field goal in
American football,

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:36.860
I should clarify
for those of you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.276
from other countries who think
we're talking about soccer,

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:41.720
a field goal is
worth 3 points each.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.240
He played in 16
games this season.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.080
How many field goals did
Blair make in each game?

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.940
Assume he made the same
number in each game.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.070
So this guy is an incredibly
consistent field goal kicker.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.430
He makes 50-yard field goals.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.490
He makes the same in every game.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.480
So let's think about
how many field goals did

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.087
he make in each game.

00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:07.920
So there's a couple of
ways you can do this.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.730
We could first figure
out, well, how many

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.800
field goals did he
make in the season?

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.300
So he scored 144 points total.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.620
And if we divide that by 3,
we divide that by the fact

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.110
that a field goal gets you
3 points per field goal.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.300
So the total number
of points divided

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.170
by the points per
field goal, this

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.030
should give us the total
number of field goals he had.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.590
So this right over here is
going to be equal to-- so 3

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.500
goes into 144.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.350
Let me do this on the
side right over here.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.620
3 goes into 144.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.920
3 doesn't go into 1.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.120
It goes into 14 four times.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.080
4 times 3 is 12.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.720
Subtract 14 minus 12
is 2, bring down a 4.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.125
3 goes into 24 perfectly.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:56.030
It goes exactly 8 times.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.650
8 times 3 is 24.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.760
We have no remainder.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.980
So 144 divided by
3 is equal to 48.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.564
So all season, he has
kicked 48 field goals.

00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:15.560
Now, we still haven't
answered the other question.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.032
How many did he
make in each game?

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.240
And we're assuming it's the
same number in each game.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.330
So this is the total
number across 16 games.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.350
To find out the average
he makes in each game,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.640
we divide this by 16.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.840
So let's take 48 total field
goals divided by 16 games

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.290
is going to be-- well,
48 divided by 16 is 3.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:51.816
This is equal to 3
field goals per game.

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:52.440
And we're done.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.280
How many field goals did
he make in each game?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.060
He scored 3.
