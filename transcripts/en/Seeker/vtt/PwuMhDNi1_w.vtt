00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.629
Dyslexia is a challenging, and poorly understood
disorder - but one Dutch Designer may have

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.310
just cracked the code!

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.980
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews, and something
we haven’t really discussed on this show

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.140
before is dyslexia - despite the fact that
it affects such a large portion of the population.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.110
It’s by far the most common learning disability
- but it can be difficult to understand for

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.390
people who don’t actually suffer from it.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.269
A common misconception is that people who
have dyslexia are stupid, or below average

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.349
intelligence.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.680
Which is not the case.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.960
In fact, in order to qualify as dyslexic - a
person must be of average, or above average,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.960
intelligence.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.180
It’s simply a neurological disorder that
prevents someone from reading, and occasionally,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.390
speaking properly.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.720
The biggest misconception is that people who
are dyslexic can only read or write words

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.219
backwards - which can sometimes happen - but
only in a small percentage of dyslexics.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.309
Most people who suffer from it, have more
trouble with identifying words, and grasping

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.579
the phonetics and pronunciations of them.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.570
They might have trouble spelling, or reading
aloud, or comprehending what they’re reading

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.680
- and all of these symptoms can vary depending
on age.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.091
By adulthood, most people with dyslexia learn
to comprehend words pretty well, but they

00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:17.100
might still have trouble spelling, or reading
as quickly as other people their own age.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.880
In some cases, brain trauma or serious ear
infections can lead to dyslexia, but for the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.740
most part - it’s a genetic disorder, thought
to be caused by a phonological processing

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.090
impairment.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.340
Phonological processing is what allow us to
bridge the gap between reading and writing.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.810
We learn what letters make up certain words,
how those letters are pronounced in combination

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.760
with each other - and then we piece those
sounds, or phonemes, together to make words.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.610
Once we learn them, that’s it - we know
‘em forever.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.729
But people with dyslexia face a lifelong battle
- that’s helped only through very targeted

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:50.729
training.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.060
Fortunately, a new approach, invented by Dutch
designer Christian Boer, aims to alleviate

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.640
some of the pain associated with reading and
recognizing typeface.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.190
Boer, who is dyslexic himself, says that people
like him will often unconsciously switch,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.030
rotate, or mirror letters in their minds.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.651
And traditional typeface, which has very consistent
strokes, can make it hard to distinguish from

00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:12.840
one letter to the next.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.319
A “b,” for example, is really just a backwards
“d.”

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.150
And an “n,” likewise, is just an upside
down “u.”

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.040
So for his thesis project back in 2008, he
sought to create a typeface where each letter

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.620
appears unique.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.620
By making all of the letters heavier on the
bottom, it prevents the reader from turning

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.510
them upside down in their head.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.180
Letters that look highly similar - like lower
case “p,” “b,” and “d,” have been

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.180
subtly italicized to make them more distinct.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.190
And by lengthening the ascenders and descenders
- which is the part of the letter that stretches

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.470
beyond the normal length, like the bottom
part of a “p” - it makes them easier to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.550
tell apart.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.629
He also added more space in between letters,
and words, as well as bolded punctuation marks

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.140
and capital letters - so people can clearly
tell when a sentence is supposed to end.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.430
Obviously, these changes won’t be a cure-all
for absolutely everyone, since dyslexia can

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.870
come in many different forms.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.659
But it does represent a breakthrough in the
fight against dyslexia, and especially for

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.659
the modern age.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.519
Plus, it’s just kinda awesome.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.519
Who would’ve ever thought, right?

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.519
What do you guys think?

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.720
Do you any of you out there suffer from dyslexia?

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.300
And if so, how do you deal with it?

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.110
