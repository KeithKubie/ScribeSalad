00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.020
Now you might be wondering why I've set this romantic, candlelit scene up for myself,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.280
and it's because I want to talk to you today about firedamp. Now firedamp is something that, in the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.700
early days of coal mining, caused lots of horrific accidents and killed hundreds of miners - and here's why:

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.480
[roaring flame]

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.920
Now that was methane, which is extremely flammable, and one of the main components of firedamp,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.820
which is a gas that used to leak from the coal-bearing rocks in the mines. Now the miners in those days only had

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.720
naked flames like these candles to light their way, so the result was inevitable:

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.780
[roaring flame]

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.960
Now the reason I'm interested in all of this is because the solution to this problem was devised by a scientist

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.940
working right here, at the Royal Institution.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.260
That man was Humphry Davy, a chemist whose simple invention revolutionised the mining industry,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.380
and helped to fuel Britain's industrial revolution.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.280
So I've come down to the RI's archives to look at some of Davy's early attempts to tackle this problem.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.080
Over here, we've got some of the prototypes that didn't work quite so well -

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.480
but then here, this is what Davy ultimately came up with, so this is the miners' safety lamp, or the Davy lamp.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.620
And you can see that it's a really simple solution to the problem, it's just an oil lamp,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.700
the wick enclosed in this piece of gauze here, this cylinder of gauze. And it's the gauze that's doing the work,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.000
the gauze is what prevents the flame from igniting the gases in the mines and creating an explosion.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.140
And all of these actually, Davy made all of these within about two months in 1815, he was

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.820
really working hard at this problem, because he knew that other people were trying to solve it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.060
at the same time, and he wanted to get in there first. And this was so successful, this design,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.740
that this commercial version on the right here was actually made around fifty years after Davy

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.060
posed this idea, which shows that it was used almost unchanged for decades down in the mines, and keeping people safe.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.660
So, how does a Davy lamp work?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.640
Well, to give you an idea, I've filled this tube with natural gas which is mainly methane

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.700
and similar in composition to firedamp. Now if I ignite it at one end, you can see that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.100
the flame front propagates along the tube in quite a spectacular way:

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.100
But if this time we insert a bit of gauze in the centre of the tube, and repeat the same thing,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.240
we can see that the flame stops at the gauze.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.420
The gas itself is able to pass through the gauze no problem, but the flame isn't.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.640
You can see that if I light the tube again from the other end,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.260
the second part of the tube still has gas in it and so it's still able to burn.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.860
Well Davy discovered that flames don't propagate through small holes, and you can see that

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.740
even more clearly if I hold this gauze over this candle flame. He spent ages experimenting with

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.280
tiny metal tubes and different gauzes, trying to find exactly the right size hole for this job.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.720
Now all fires and all flames need to sustain a high temperature in order to burn. And normally that's quite

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.840
easy because the chemical reaction itself releases lots of heat, so the high temperature becomes self-sustaining.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.500
But if you can cool the reacting gases down fast enough, then you can stop the flame in its tracks - and that's what the gauze does.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.280
The metal wires that form the gauze absorb all the heat from the flame,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.460
cooling it to the point where it can't sustain itself.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.940
So I have a replica of one of Davy's early lamps here and, down in the mines,

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.240
these lamps allowed naked flames to be used relatively safely. If there was any firedamp in the air

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.840
it would pass through the gauze, into the lamp, and burn relatively innocuously there,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.180
rather than igniting the gas on the outside. [The flame is much quieter than before]

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.040
And that's quite a difference from what we saw earlier.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.820
[roaring flame]

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.600
Once Davy had perfected his design, it not only allowed miners to mine more safely,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.420
but also to mine deeper and more productively, so coal output soared.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.140
But the reason I like this story is that it's a great example of applied science: just by careful experimentation

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.440
and observation, Davy was able to find a simple solution to a big problem.
