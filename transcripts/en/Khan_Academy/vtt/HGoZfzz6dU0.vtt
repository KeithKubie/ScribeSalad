00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:03.074
- If you've been paying
particularly close attention to

00:00:03.443 --> 00:00:06.404
our use of the factorial
operator in the videos

00:00:06.404 --> 00:00:09.121
on permutations and
combinations, you may or may not

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.745
have noticed something
that might be interesting.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.621
So let's just review
factorial a little bit.

00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.727
So if I were to say n
factorial, that of course

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:22.727
is going to be n times n
minus one times n minus two,

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.625
and I would just keep going
down until I go to times one.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:36.292
So I would keep decrementing
n until I get to one,

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:39.260
and then I would multiply
all those things together.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.010
So, for example, and
all of this is review.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.131
If I were to say three factorial,

00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.786
that's going to be three
times two times one.

00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:48.919
If I were to say two factorial,

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:51.924
that's going to be two times one.

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:55.340
One factorial, by that logic, I just keep

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.775
decrementing until I get
to one, but I don't even

00:00:56.775 --> 00:00:58.961
have to decrement here,
I'm already at one.

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:01.093
So I just multiply one.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:04.684
Now what about zero factorial,
this is interesting.

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:07.642
Zero factorial.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:11.428
So one logical thing is to say,

00:01:11.428 --> 00:01:14.656
maybe zero factorial is zero.

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:17.975
I'm just starting with itself,
it's already below one.

00:01:18.388 --> 00:01:21.661
Maybe it is zero.

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.999
Now what we will see is
that this is not the case

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:28.792
that mathematics,
mathematicians have decided.

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:30.970
This is what's interesting,
the factorial operation,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.314
this is something that
humans have invented,

00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:36.053
that they think is just
an interesting thing,

00:01:36.053 --> 00:01:37.596
it's a useful notation.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.999
So they can define what it does.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.713
And mathematicians have
found it far more useful

00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:47.604
to define zero factorial
as something else.

00:01:47.604 --> 00:01:50.574
To define zero factorial as...

00:01:50.574 --> 00:01:52.618
And there's a little
bit of a drumroll here.

00:01:52.618 --> 00:01:55.880
They believe zero factorial should be one.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.537
And I know, based on the reasoning,

00:01:58.537 --> 00:02:00.361
the conceptual reasoning of this,

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.055
this doesn't make any sense.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.099
But since we've already
been exposed a little bit

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:09.099
to permutations, I'll show you
why this is a useful concept,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.447
especially in the world of
permutations and combinations.

00:02:12.447 --> 00:02:16.276
Which is, frankly, where
factorial shows up the most.

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:18.878
Most of the cases that
I've ever seen factorial

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:20.704
in anything has been in the situations

00:02:20.704 --> 00:02:22.278
of permutations and combinations.

00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:23.334
And in a few other things,

00:02:23.334 --> 00:02:25.654
but mainly permutations and combinations.

00:02:25.654 --> 00:02:27.802
So let's review a little bit.

00:02:27.802 --> 00:02:31.359
We've said that if we
have n things and we want

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.134
to figure out the number
of ways to permute them

00:02:33.134 --> 00:02:38.134
into k spaces, it's
going to be n factorial

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.680
over n minus k factorial.

00:02:45.973 --> 00:02:50.466
Now we've also said
that if we had n things

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:53.438
that we want to permute into n places,

00:02:53.438 --> 00:02:56.217
well this really should
just be n factorial.

00:02:57.257 --> 00:02:58.516
Let's just do this.

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:02.609
This is the first place,
this is the second place,

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.358
this is the third place.

00:03:04.358 --> 00:03:08.421
All the way, you get to the nth place.

00:03:09.113 --> 00:03:11.950
There would be n possibilities for

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.327
who's in the first position,

00:03:13.327 --> 00:03:15.610
or which object is in the first position.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.014
And then for each of those possibilities,

00:03:17.014 --> 00:03:18.873
there would be n minus one possibilities

00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:21.751
for which object you choose
to put in the second position,

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:23.932
because you've already put
one into that position.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:26.993
Now for each of these n times
n minus one possibilities,

00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:29.066
where you've placed two
things, there would be

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:31.500
n minus two possibilities of what goes

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.396
in the third position,
and then you would just

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:35.316
go all the way down to one.

00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:36.148
And this thing right over here

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:38.167
is exactly what we wrote over here.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:43.167
This is equal to n factorial.

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:46.549
But if we directly applied this formula,

00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:50.564
this would need to be n factorial

00:03:50.934 --> 00:03:54.859
over n minus n factorial.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.824
Then you might see why
this is interesting.

00:03:56.824 --> 00:04:01.824
Because this is going to be n
factorial over zero factorial.

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:07.636
So in order for this formula to apply,

00:04:07.636 --> 00:04:10.440
even in the case where k is equal to n,

00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:15.363
which is this one right over here,

00:04:15.363 --> 00:04:18.926
and for that to be consistent
with just plain old logic,

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:22.398
zero factorial needs to be equal to one.

00:04:22.398 --> 00:04:24.824
And so the mathematics
community has decided,

00:04:24.824 --> 00:04:27.467
this thing we've constructed
called factorial,

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.058
we said you put an exclamation
mark behind something,

00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:31.569
in all of our heads, we say you kind of

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.427
count down that number all the way to one

00:04:33.427 --> 00:04:36.105
and you keep multiplying them for zero,

00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:37.456
we're just going to define this.

00:04:37.456 --> 00:04:38.709
We're just going to define,

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:40.450
make a mathematical definition.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.450
We're just going to say zero
factorial is equal to one.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.727
And it's actually quite useful.
