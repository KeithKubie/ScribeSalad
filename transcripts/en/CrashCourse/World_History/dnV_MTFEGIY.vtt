00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi, my name is John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we're gonna talk about slavery.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Slavery is not funny. In fact, it is very
near the top of the list of things that aren't

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.469
funny, so today's episode is gonna be a little
light on the jokes but, I'm gonna help you

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.149
understand what pre-Civil War Americans often
euphemistically refer to as "the peculiar institution."

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:29.109
[Intro Music]

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.339
Slavery is as old as civilization itself,
although it is not as old as humanity thanks

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.759
to our hunting and gathering foremothers,
but the numbers involved in the Atlantic slave

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.760
trade are truly staggering.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.640
From 1500 to 1880CE somewhere between 10 and
12 million African slaves were forcibly moved

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.760
from Africa to the Americas and about 15%
of those people died during the journey.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.610
I know you're saying that looks like a very
nice ship, I mean my God, its almost as big

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.909
as South America, yeah, not to scale, and
those who didn't die became property; bought

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.549
and sold like any commodity.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:04.290
Where Africans came from and went to changed
over time, but in all 48% of slaves went to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.350
the Caribbean, and 41% to Brazil, although
few Americans recognize this, relatively few

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.030
slaves were imported to the U.S, only about
5% of the total.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.190
It's also worth noting that by the time Europeans
started importing Africans into the Americas,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.190
Europe had a long history of trading slaves.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.020
The first real European slave trade began
after the 4th Crusade in 1204; the crusade

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.170
that you will remember as "The Crazy One".
Italian merchants imported thousands of Armenians,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.780
Circassian and Georgian slaves to Italy. Most
of them were women who worked as household

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.050
servants but many worked processing sugar,
and sugar is of course a crop that African

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.890
slaves later cultivated in the Caribbean.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.560
Camera 2 side note; none of the primary crops
grown by slaves--sugar, tobacco, coffee--is

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.330
necessary to sustain human life. So in a way,
slavery is a very early by-product of a consumer

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.750
culture that revolves around the purchase
of goods that bring us pleasure, but not sustenance.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.880
You are welcome to draw your own metaphorically
resonant conclusions from this fact.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.820
One of the big misconceptions about slavery,
or at least when I was growing up, is that

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.700
Europeans somehow captured Africans, put them
in chains, stuffed them on boats and then

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.020
took them to the Americas.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.479
The chains and ships bit is true as is the
America part if you define America as America

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.780
and not as 'Merica, but Africans were living
in all kinds of conglomerations. From small

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.170
villages to city-states to empires and they
were much too powerful for the Europeans to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.420
just conquer. And in fact, Europeans obtained
African slaves by trading for them.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.700
Because trade is a two-way proposition, this
meant that Africans were captured by other

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.170
Africans and then traded to Europeans in exchange
for goods; usually like metal tools or fine

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.880
textiles or guns; and for those Africans, slaves
were a form of property, and a very valuable one.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.400
In many places, slaves were one of the only
sources of private wealth because land was

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.940
usually owned by the state.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.380
And this gets to a really important point;
if we're gonna understand the tragedy of slavery,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.709
we need to understand the economics of it;
we need to get inside what Mark Twain famously

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.010
called "a deformed conscience." We have to
see slaves both as they were, as human beings,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.459
and as they were viewed, as an economic commodity.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.910
Right, so you probably know about the horrendous
conditions aboard slave ships, which at their

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.640
largest could hold 400 people. but it's worth
underscoring that each slave had an average

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.739
of four square feet of space. That is 4 square
feet. As one eye-witness testified before

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.630
Parliament in 1791, "They had not so much
room as a man in his coffin."

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.680
Once in the Americas, the surviving slaves
were sold in a market very similar to the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.520
way cattle would be sold. After purchase,
slave owners would often brand their new possession

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.750
on the cheeks, again, just as they would do
with cattle. The lives of slaves were dominated

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.650
by work and terror, but mostly work.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.610
Slaves did all types of work, from housework
to skilled crafts work, and some even worked

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.520
as sailors, but the majority of them worked
as agricultural laborers. In the Caribbean

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.770
and Brazil, most of them planted, harvested
and processed sugar, working ten months out

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.360
of the year, dawn until dusk.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.750
The worst part of this job, which is saying
something, because there were many bad parts,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.940
was fertilizing the sugar cane. This required
slaves to carry 80 pound baskets of manure

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.989
on their heads up and down hilly terrain.

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.910
MFTP:"Mr. Green, Mr. Green! ...Isn't there
a poop joke in there somewhere?"

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.370
John Green: No, me-from-the-past, because
this whole thing is too depressing!

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.379
When it came time to harvest and process the
cane, speed was incredibly important because

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.069
once cut, sugar sap can go sour within a day.
This meant that slaves would often work 48

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.180
hours straight during harvest time, working
without sleep in the sweltering sugar press

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.379
houses where the cane would be crushed in
hand rollers and then boiled. Slaves often

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.029
caught their hands in the rollers, and their
overseers kept a hatchet on hand for amputations.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.680
Ugh.....I told you this wasn't going to be
funny.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.639
Given these appalling conditions, it's little
wonder that the average life expectancy for

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.879
a Brazilian slave on a sugar plantation in
the late 18th century was 23 years.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.759
Things were slightly better in British sugar
colonies like Barbados, and in the U.S., living

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.069
and working conditions were better still.
So relatively good that, in fact, slave populations

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.150
began increasing naturally, meaning that more
slaves were born than died.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.259
This may sound like a good thing, but it is
of course it's own kind of evil because it

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.520
meant that slave owners were calculating that
if they kept their slaves healthy enough,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.779
they would reproduce and then the slave owners
could steal and sell their children. Or use

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:53.960
them to work their land, either way, blech!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.089
Anyway, this explains why even though the
percentage of slaves imported from Africa

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:00.710
to the United States was relatively small,
slaves and other people of African descent

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.159
came to make up a significant portion of the
U.S. population. The brutality of working

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.959
conditions in Brazil, on the other hand, meant that
slaves were never able to increase their population

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.460
naturally, hence the continued need to import 
slaves into Brazil until slavery ended in the 1880s.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.659
So I noted earlier that slavery isn't new,
it's also a hard word to define. Like Stalin

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.990
forced millions to work in the gulags, but
we don't usually consider those people slaves.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.900
On the other hand, many slaves in history
had lives of great power, wealth, and influence.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.139
Like remember Zheng He, the world's greatest
admiral?He was technically a slave, so were

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.199
many of the most important advisors to Suleiman
the Magnificent. So was Darth Vader!

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.150
But Atlantic slavery was different and more
horrifying, because it was chattel slavery,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.300
a term historians use to indicate that the
slaves were move-able property.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.000
Oh, it's time for the open letter?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.680
An open letter to the word slave.

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:55.069
But first lets see what's in the secret compartment
today. Oh. It's Boba Fett. Noted owner of

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:00.119
a ship called Slave One. And apparently a
ballet dancer. (Singing) Do do doloo do do doo...

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:02.949
Stan: That's a fine approximation of ballet
music.

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.169
(Laughter)
John: Thank you Stan.

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.789
Alright, dear slave, as a word. You are over
used.

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:15.159
Like Britney Spears, I'm a Slave 4 U, no you're not!
Boba Fett's ship, Slave One, a ship can't be a slave!

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:20.080
But more importantly slave, you are constantly
used in political rhetoric, and never correctly!

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.080
There's nothing new about this,witness for
instance, all the early Americans claiming

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.539
that paying the stamp tax would make them
slaves. And that was in a time when they knew

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.669
exactly what slavery looked like!

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.839
Taxes, as I have mentioned before, can be
very useful. I, for instance like paved roads.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:37.399
But even if you don't like a tax, it's not
slavery. Here, I have written for you a list

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:43.719
of all the times it is okay to use the word
slave, oh, it is a one item long list!

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:45.199
Best Wishes, John Green.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.979
So what exactly makes slavery so horrendous?
Well, definitions are slippery, but I'm going

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.759
to start with the definition of slavery proposed
by sociologist Orlando Patterson.

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:57.990
It is "the permanent, violent and personal
domination of natally alienated and generally

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.279
dishonoured persons." According to this definition
a slave is removed from the culture, land

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:06.490
and society of his or her birth suffers from
what Patterson called "social death".

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.770
Ultimately then, what makes slavery slavery
is that slaves are de-humanized. The Latin

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.659
word that gave us 'chattel', also gave us
'cattle'.

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:18.399
In many ways Atlantic slavery drew from previous
models of slavery, and took every that sucked

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:22.520
about each of them and combined them into
a big ball so that it would be the biggest

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.050
possible ball of suck.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.469
Stan am I allowed to say suck on this show?
(pause) Nice.

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:29.989
Now to understand what I'm talking about we
need to look at some previous models of slavery.

00:07:29.989 --> 00:07:30.960
Lets go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.869
The Greeks were among the first to consider
otherness a characteristic of slaves. Most

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:39.550
Greek slaves were Barbarians and their inability
to speak Greek kept them from talking back

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.710
to their masters, and also indicated their
slave status.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.020
Aristotle, who despite being spectacularly
wrong about almost everything was incredibly

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.050
influential, believed that some people were
just naturally slaves, saying "It is clear

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.939
that there are certain people who are free,
and certain people who are slaves by nature,

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:01.309
and it is both to their advantage, and just,
for them to be slaves"

00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:05.669
This idea, despite being totally insane, remained
popular for millennia. The Greeks popularized

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:09.540
the idea that slaves should be traded from
far away, but the Romans took it to another level.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.219
Slaves probably made up 30% of the total Roman
population, similar to the population of America

00:08:15.219 --> 00:08:20.240
at slavery's height. The Romans also invented
the plantation, using mass numbers of slaves

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.039
to work the land on giant farms called latifundia,
so called because they were not fun.

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:29.559
The Judeo-Christian world also contributed
as well, and though we are not going to venture

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:33.690
into the incredibly complicated role that
slavery plays in the Bible because I vividly

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:39.080
remember the comments section of the Christianity
episode, the Bible was widely used to justify

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.880
slavery. And in particular the enslavement
of Africans, because of the moment in Genesis

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.410
when Noah curses Ham, saying "cursed be Canaan,
the lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers".

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:54.580
This encapsulates the two ideas vital to Atlantic
slavery: 1. that slavery can be a hereditary

00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:01.140
status passed down through generations, and
2. that slavery is the result of human sin.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.220
Both ideas serve as powerful justifications for holding
an entire race in bondage. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.140
But there were even more contributors to the
ideas that led to Atlantic slavery. For instance,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.340
Muslim Arabs were the first to import large
number of Bantu speaking Africans to their

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.350
territory as slaves. The Muslims called these
Africans Zanj and they were a distinct and

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.470
despised group, distinguished from other North
Africans by the colour of their skin.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.770
The Zanj and territory held by the Abbasid
staged one of the first big slave revolts

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.100
in 869CE, and it may be that this revolt was
so devastating that it convinced the Abbasid

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.640
that large scale, plantation-style agriculture
on the Roman model just wasn't worth it.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.430
But by then they'd connected the Aristotelian
idea that some people are just naturally slaves

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.420
with the appearance of Sub-Saharan Africans.
The Spanish and the Portuguese, you no doubt

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.950
remember, were the Europeans with the closest
ties to the Muslim world because there were

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.540
Muslims living on the Iberian Peninsula until
1492. So it makes sense that the Iberians

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.460
were the first to these racist attitudes towards
blacks.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.970
And as the first colonizers of the Americas
and the dominant importers of slaves, the

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.190
Portuguese and the Spanish helped define the
attitudes that characterized Atlantic slavery,

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.650
beliefs they'd inherited from a complicated
nexus of all the slave holders who came before them.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.520
In short Atlantic slavery was a monstrous
tragedy, but it was a tragedy in which the

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.040
whole world participated, and it was the culmination
of millennia of imagining the other as inherently

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.080
lesser. It's tempting to pin all the blame
for Atlantic slavery on one particular group,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.740
but to blame one group is to exonerate all
the others, and by extension ourselves.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.610
The truth that we must grapple with is that
a vast array of our ancestors, including those

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.140
we think of as ours, whoever they may be,
believed it was possible for their fellow

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.020
human being to be mere property.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.220
