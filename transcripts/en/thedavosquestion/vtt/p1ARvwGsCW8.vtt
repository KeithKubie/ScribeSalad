00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:06.640
Hello the You Tube community. Very, very cool
community. And I'm not just saying that cuz

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.719
I'm here in the cold Davos Switzerland. We're
here at the world economic forum, I'm a young

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.841
global leader. My name is, I'm sorry, a member
of the young global leaders, we will not want

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:25.050
to suggest that I am a leader. Here at the
WEF. My name is John Hope Bryant and I'm founder

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.769
of operation HOP, which is America's first
non profit central investment bank. I'm also

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.330
vice chairman of the President's council on
financial literacy in the United States. As

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.850
executed by the President on this past Tuesday.
Which speaks to the question, what's the one

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.469
thing that companies and governments, that
organizations, that individuals like you,

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.969
can do to make the world a better place? I
believe in one person can change the world.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.260
And when you think about people who changed
the world, with all due respect to all the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.590
great people who are here, man y of those
people had no titles. Jesus Christ was a carpenter,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.270
Mother Theresa was a nurse, Nelson Mandela
for 27 years was a prisoner, Martin Luther

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.740
King Jr was a southern preacher, my friend
Andrew Young, my mentor, civil rights leader

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.380
and reverend. But one person changed the world.
So what's the one thing that we should do?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.900
What's the one thing we could do? I think
we need to move from civil rights to ciliary

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.979
rights. I think that we need to empower people.
It's not to give them a hand out, but a hand

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.479
up. To not to not focus, as a lot of bad colabority
is on, a lot of government services are focused

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.560
on giving a man a fish but teaching him how
to fish. I remember Martin Luther King Jr

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.399
told Andrew Young a story that really wasn't
made public back then, it wasn't politically

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.860
correct. He was on the Jericho road in Israel
and the media kept saying Martin you remind

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.439
me of the goos samaritan on the Jericho road.
Dr. King said to Andrew Young, he said Andy

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.229
we need good samaritans. I respect good samaritans.
I want a good samaritan to be in my community,

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:11.790
but I don't want to be a good samaritan. [pause]
The Jericho road is dangerous. [pause] I don't

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.840
want to pick up my people, sitting like a
victim, sitting on the edge of the Jericho

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.459
road anymore. We need to fix the Jericho road.
We need to pave the Jericho road. We need

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.430
to put street lights up along the Jericho
road. We need to build community development

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.489
and home ownership and small business and
entrepreneurship along the Jericho road. We

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.000
need to create entrepreneurs and educated
people along the Jericho road. Andy, we need

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.610
to fix the Jericho road. And when he was killed,
Dr King was killed, in 68, April of 68, he

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.250
was focused on the poor people's campaign.
And that was about poor whites, there's more

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.989
poor white people in America than anybody
else. Poor blacks, poor Latinos, poor Asians,

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.569
poor Indians, poor African Americans, poor
Latinos, moving all up the economic ladder.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.180
He said this, you can not educate goodness
and you can not pass a law to force someone

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.030
to respect you. The only way of social justice
in a capitalist country is economic parity,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.379
ownership. There's nothing more appropriate
than this Davos conversation, then looking

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.500
at the least of these God's children, looking
at the fact that we integrated the lunch counter

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.909
in 68, 62, 1960 in the U.S., but we never
integrated the dollar, or the euro or the

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.910
zen dollar. Whatever it is, the currency you're
dealing with. In Swiss it's frank. I think

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.019
that the thing that we can do is to teach
people about civil rights. To teach them about

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.549
financial literature. Teach them about free
enterprise and capitalism and ownership. If

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.709
you're living in a little shanty town in south
Africa, you're living in Alexandria, South

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.659
Africa, you don't have running water, you
don't have lights, you don't even have solid

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:52.379
walls. But on every street corner is a black
woman doing hair. That's an entrepreneur.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:04:01.349
On every corner, in every block, there's a
little kiosk selling cell phone and cell phone

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.410
minutes by little cards that have cell phone
minutes on it. Those are entrepreneurs. We

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.959
are natural entrepreneurs. Poor people are
natural entrepreneurs. People don't realize

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:19.800
that Sam Walton, Wal-Mart, was an uneducated,
poor, white male from the south who realized

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.090
that poor people wanted good products at a
good price. And well on now you have the largest

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.650
retailer in the world. Poor people have made
most the fortunes in the world. We've got

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.870
to stop making fortunes on the back of poor
people and start making fortune developers

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.419
out of poor people. That's something that
all of us can do. Teach financial literacy,

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.620
tech dignity. Go in your community and understand
you can not be a leader unless you are there

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.050
to serve. All around this world we've got
to continue the work of Dr King, big An, and

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.720
launch a global civil rights movement. If
we do that you won't have to worry about more

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.340
aid for South Africa because you're giving
people a hand up. Africa or the African continent,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.590
or Latin America, or poor places in Asia,
or poor places in Latin America, the 6 billion

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.940
people in this planet. Half of which are living
on a dollar day. That's not sustainable, that's

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.130
not dignity, that's not what we deserve. What
people want is an opportunity to succeed or

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.790
fail on their own merit. And if you want to
feel good about yourself, help somebody help

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.340
themself. And if we do that, if we create
a generation of entrepreneurs in Africa, they'll

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.229
become tax payers, they'll become job producers.
Africa will not be the dark continent. It

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.871
will be a place of opportunity and prosperity
because it's an amazing beautiful place. That

00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:36.570
will take it's place as one of the leaders
in the 21st century. And you can help make

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.340
that a reality. Everybody can help make a
difference. You be that one person.
