00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.720
You are listening to radio lab radio from w n y.

2
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:09.900
S t e n n p. R.

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.610
One when you die, we can all agree on this.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.830
Something changes.

5
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.770
You get the feeling that's something that was there, isn't there or leaves.

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.240
But what leave one, two, three. Can you hear me? We talked to a biologist,

7
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.250
a at Princeton University, Lee silver,

8
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:33.020
who told us a story about a guy back in 1907 who did a very interesting

9
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:35.780
experiment. His name was Dunkin McDougal. I Dunno,

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.260
I don't remember exactly who he was, was he was, he was a doctor, a doctor,

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.870
a physician. And what's his story?

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.500
He wanted to prove that the soul exited the body after.

13
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.173
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.930
<v 0>He thought the sole had a certain amount of weight, that it was a substance.</v>

15
00:00:55.931 --> 00:01:00.910
And so what he did was he had these people who were dying from tuberculosis and

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.270
he studied, they were lying on beds on this gigantic scale.

17
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.200
He literally put people almost dying onto a way unto a scale. Yes.

18
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.260
So imagine how a patient on one side of the scale and on the other side are

19
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.170
weights and they're there in perfect balance.

20
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.430
And then at the moment of death, right at the last breath,

21
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.420
he tried to determine whether or not the scale changed.

22
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.900
So did they lose weight when they died? That was the question. Right?

23
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.140
And he claimed that on average they lost 21 grams the instant they died.

24
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.620
Oh,

25
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.620
did it as he described the moment that suddenly the scales shift one way or the

26
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:48.020
other. Yeah, the moment,

27
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:51.050
I mean death was easy in those days because you stopped breathing.

28
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.120
You were dead. I mean there were, there weren't,

29
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.380
they weren't hooked into brain scans. Right. So it's the, the last breath.

30
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.150
Last Fan. Yes. Um, and the New York Times headline was so has wait,

31
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.510
physician thinks, right. Great headline. Right?

32
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.420
And this is the beginning of the 20th century.

33
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:10.750
We're not talking about medieval times to remember that.

34
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:14.690
What did he conclude from this soul has weight. Okay.

35
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.010
I seen a soul.

36
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.840
It was there when he was alive and it flew off and it weighs 21 grams. Yes. Now,

37
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.190
there was one person whose weight didn't change immediately.

38
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.080
It changed a minute later.

39
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.430
And so his hypothesis was that this was a very kind of dumb guy and the soul

40
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:38.540
was, they didn't realize it was free. And so it took a minute after the death,

41
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.480
before the salt realized it was freeing. It flew out of but the bottom,

42
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.850
so a true idiot, we'd be hanging out like your for five

43
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.060
now. This was very serious. Of course. Yeah.

44
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.750
How would you explain what he saw or thought?

45
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:57.470
He saw the 21 grams? I'm still stuck on that. I mean, 21 grams.

46
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.850
It's statistically insignificant.

47
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.841
I mean,

48
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:09.841
three quarters of an ounce compared to the weight of a body is a minuscule

49
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.310
amount. Particularly he says, Lee,

50
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.070
when you consider how crude the scales were at the time,

51
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.880
almost anything could have swayed them. I'll breeze the pressure.

52
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.310
Anything really, uh, today, hey, we'd be laughed out of the academy.

53
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.230
You ever seen someone die or ever seen a dead person? I've seen dead people.

54
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.860
I mean, I've seen dead bodies. [inaudible] I've [inaudible] do you, I mean I,

55
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.490
I just want my mom just before she died, just after she died. Yes.

56
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.110
And I thought to myself, um,

57
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.400
there's a real difference here. It's,

58
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.740
it's beyond power or it's a,

59
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.070
it's a very noticeable deep absence of something.

60
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.690
And it does make you think that something,

61
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.550
I'll use the word carefully. Vital has gone away suddenly.

62
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.940
[inaudible] we have to be very careful about the words.

63
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:06.520
I mean something has gone away,

64
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:11.521
the brain has ceased to function and therefore I would say there is no person.

65
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.520
<v 3>It's still the unanswered question is what really happens in that moment when a</v>

66
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:27.220
person is suddenly

67
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.033
<v 1>gone</v>

68
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.920
<v 3>to the other side, the other side,</v>

69
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.140
those of us with the benefit of being alive cannot help but ask this question.

70
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:39.310
It's like a curse. We want to know.

71
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.380
But obviously it's not something you can though.

72
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.780
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.660
<v 3>Cause this will just always be one of those domains where the tools of science</v>

74
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:50.190
just can't be used. Alas. But then there are those folks like neuroscientist,

75
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:52.380
David Eagleman who say screw it. We're going to ask.

76
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:54.480
We're going to wonder cause that's just what we do.

77
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.960
When you walk to the end of the pier of science,

78
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.840
you look out and you've got everything beyond that.

79
00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:04.320
You've got the whole ocean of what we don't know. Cast the end of the pier.

80
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.610
What a scientist does is sort of leap out onto different islands and just try

81
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:13.410
things out. I'm Jad Abumrad and I am Robert [inaudible]. Today on radio lab,

82
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:16.920
we're going to do what David Eagleman suggest. We're just going to hop around.

83
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.240
This is unusual for us,

84
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:21.990
but with that we're going to look at different aspects of yeah,

85
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.610
<v 4>and the other side in no particular order, but here's what we can tell you.</v>

86
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:29.550
We're going to make 11 stops, 11 meditations,

87
00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:33.720
shall we call them on various questions relating to death and die and what

88
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:34.554
happens after

89
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.680
<v 0>won't be depressing. No, you just heard the first one. Soul has weight,</v>

90
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:45.240
physician thinks. Here's our second [inaudible] comes to us from a,

91
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.690
the guy you just heard David Eagleman who is a neuroscientist but wrote a book

92
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:53.550
called some. Yeah. Which is very not neurosciencey at all. Truth is,

93
00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:57.620
I haven't talked about this book with any of my science colleagues. Why not?

94
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.890
<v 5>I have reasons why, but I'm not sure I want to say them on the radio.</v>

95
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.233
In any case,

96
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.080
the book consists of 40 different versions of the afterlife and here's one,

97
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.380
it's called metamorphosis written by David Eagleman and read by Jeffrey Tambor,

98
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.560
the Ecuador, right? There are three depths.

99
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.640
Now the first is when the body ceases to function of course,

100
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.490
and the second is when the body is consigned or you know,

101
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.033
put in the grave.

102
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.200
The third is that moment sometime in the future when your name is spoken or the

103
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:33.074
last time

104
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.720
<v 2>[inaudible]. So</v>

105
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.590
you wait in this lobby until the third death.

106
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.860
<v 6>There are long tables with coffee and tea cookies.</v>

107
00:06:52.861 --> 00:06:53.880
You can help yourself in there.

108
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.000
There are people here from all around the world and with a little effort you can

109
00:06:57.001 --> 00:07:00.330
strike up some awesome convivial small talk.

110
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.380
Just be aware that your conversation could be interrupted at any moment by a

111
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.943
while. We call them

112
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.790
<v 2>the colors,</v>

113
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.300
and what they do is they broadcast your new friend's name

114
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.620
<v 6>to indicate that there will never again be another remembrance of him by anyone</v>

115
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:24.544
on the earth.

116
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.000
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

117
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.770
<v 6>your friend's slumps saddened. Even though the callers, they tell them kindly,</v>

118
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.630
look, you're, you're, you're off to a better place. The thing is,

119
00:07:36.631 --> 00:07:39.930
no one knows where that better place is or what it offers because no one exiting

120
00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:41.430
through that door has returned to tell us

121
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:44.820
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

122
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.080
<v 6>and tragically, many people leave just as their loved ones arrive.</v>

123
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:49.980
Since the loved ones,

124
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.240
we're the only ones doing the remembering and we all have our heads at that

125
00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:57.970
typical timing. Now,

126
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.010
not everyone is sad with her callers.

127
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.780
Shout out their next list of names on the contrary. Some people beg,

128
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.580
they plead. These are generally the guys who've been here a long time.

129
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.090
<v 2>[inaudible] too long. [inaudible]</v>

130
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.790
<v 6>I take that farmer over there who drowned in a small river 200 years ago.</v>

131
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.201
I get this,

132
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:24.520
his farm is the side of a small college now and the tour guides each week tell

133
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:27.040
his story. So he, he's, he's stuck.

134
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.830
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

135
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.880
<v 6>he's miserable. The more his story is told,</v>

136
00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:36.520
the more the details drift.

137
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.770
He's utterly alienated from his name and it's no longer identical with him,

138
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:46.771
but it continues to bind and that cheerless woman across the way is praised as a

139
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:49.360
saint

140
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.100
<v 2>even though the roots in her heart, believe me, we're complicated</v>

141
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.060
and

142
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.890
<v 5>I guess that is the curse of this room</v>

143
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.260
because since we live in the heads of those who remember us,

144
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.140
we lose control of our lives and become who they are.

145
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.633
<v 1>Why not us</v>

146
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.393
to be?

147
00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.490
<v 5>What gave you the idea for that story? This is actually, um, I should say, um,</v>

148
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:07.420
came out of my work as a neuroscientist because what happens in the brain is you

149
00:10:07.421 --> 00:10:10.300
make models of other people when you think, well,

150
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:12.940
what would my friends such and such say, or what would my wife say?

151
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.570
You're actually running a little simulation of that person in your head.

152
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:18.541
Well,

153
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:23.541
what happens when somebody dies is then they exist only in the scattered heads

154
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:25.920
around the globe of people who knew them.

155
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.670
They exist in some way as these algorithms that continue to run.

156
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.190
But through time you, your model of somebody might drift.

157
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.110
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible] are we ready?</v>

158
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.090
<v 5>Uh, number three, I'm going to change up the question a bit. William, am I dead?</v>

159
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.620
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

160
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.140
<v 7>how do you decide if somebody is alive or dead?</v>

161
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.240
If you take as your starting point, King Lear Shakespeare,

162
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.080
when Cordelia, his daughter died

163
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.283
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

164
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.200
<v 7>near takes out a mirror.</v>

165
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.330
Let me looking guys puts it right under her nose to see if there is some breadth

166
00:11:25.331 --> 00:11:27.130
there. Is that to have breast

167
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.880
fed just the same thing.

168
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.020
And that is how he decides if she's on.

169
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.310
Yes. And it's really one of the most beautiful scenes in Shakespeare.

170
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.490
That's Gary Greenberg. He wrote a book called the noble lie.

171
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.320
When it's done right, it's impossible not to weep.

172
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.790
She has gone farther at that scene

173
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.573
and the intimacy

174
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.113
<v 3>of that moment.</v>

175
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.540
But if you fast forward a few hundred years, things change.

176
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.040
<v 8>Alright, is 1816,</v>

177
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:09.350
there's a fat lady in a hospital where in France and in walks a guy by the,

178
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.580
what was his name? [inaudible]

179
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.950
Mack lantack. Yeah, he's a doctor. He's a dust fellow. Okay. Yes.

180
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.590
And he is called in to consult with, uh,

181
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.220
a patient who is obese, obese, and ill. He says to this lady, please,

182
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.350
may I see your wrist so that I can feel your pulse.

183
00:12:30.351 --> 00:12:34.850
But this woman had so much flesh on her that the only way he could imagine to do

184
00:12:34.851 --> 00:12:38.690
it was to put his ear on her chest, which would have been in decent

185
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.453
<v 9>mm.</v>

186
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.790
So came up with an idea he fabricated quite quickly.

187
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.130
A device rolled up paper really and fashion did into a tube,

188
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.440
put one end of the tube on the woman's chest and his year on the other end. Oh,

189
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.260
how very decent of him. So he doesn't have to touch her flesh.

190
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.140
He doesn't have to even really look at her chest.

191
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:07.420
His head is actually turned away from the patient. And so

192
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.370
<v 3>what we've got here in 1816 is the world's first stethoscope and a very,</v>

193
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.620
an intimate, budding,

194
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.920
increasingly precise and technological approach to defining death,

195
00:13:19.921 --> 00:13:23.250
which now is all about the heart. Up until then,

196
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.360
a death was heart death. People are dead when their heart stops speeding.

197
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.110
But if you fast forward again, things take another term,

198
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.940
like just imagine thought experiment.

199
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:38.100
If King Lear had been written not in 1604 but 1968

200
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.000
LBJ administration, gay, Cordelia, [inaudible]

201
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.343
<v 2>die,</v>

202
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.370
<v 3>there would be distraught. But instead of doing the mirror thing again,</v>

203
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:51.880
he would call a doctor who would rush her to the hospital, shock her heart,

204
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:55.000
resuscitate her, hooked her up to a ventilator and a feeding tube.

205
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.850
And there she would be alive again.

206
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.460
Sort of. I mean technically, yes, she'd be alive cause her heart would be,

207
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.780
but the core Delia that he knew his daughter would be gone.

208
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.103
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

209
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.603
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

210
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.343
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

211
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.050
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

212
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.140
<v 3>and this was the problem in 1968 with all this new technology,</v>

213
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:33.141
ICU units were filling up with these purgatorial Cordelia's who floated

214
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:37.410
somewhere in a comatose state between life and death.

215
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.660
You could minister to these people, you could feed them,

216
00:14:39.661 --> 00:14:43.620
you could clear their infections, but you could not restore the consciousness.

217
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.740
What are you going to do with these people? In walks a physician,

218
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.790
a very prominent American physician named Henry Beecher,

219
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.150
and he decided that the time had come to acknowledge the obvious,

220
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:59.660
which to him was these people weren't just dying, they were dead.

221
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:05.020
He convened a committee at Harvard and he simply moved the line that divides

222
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:10.340
life from death back a little bit toward what most people would consider life.

223
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.150
And so you get in that moment, the concept of brain death person is really dead.

224
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:19.230
We really did not, when they stop breathing, not when their heart stops beating,

225
00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:21.630
but when their brain winks out,

226
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.140
that now is when a person really dies. Exactly.

227
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.070
Totally invented concept, but it stuck.

228
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:33.130
One way to argue it was that the brain was considered to be sort of the Maestro,

229
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.560
the coordinating Oregon that made all of the rest of the body work and without

230
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:41.960
it, the center no longer holds and things fall apart.

231
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.270
And nowadays most people go with this brain dead definition of death.

232
00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:48.650
But where it gets weird is it?

233
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.280
<v 8>There are some holdouts, just a few. For instance,</v>

234
00:15:53.281 --> 00:15:57.180
some sex of Orthodox Judaism will say that if the heart is beating,

235
00:15:57.181 --> 00:16:00.050
the lungs are still filling with Aaron. If the lungs are still filling with air,

236
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:00.893
still a soul,

237
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.880
the spirit of God is in you and you certainly can't be said to be dead. Well,

238
00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:07.830
I'll give you another example. That's John Troyer,

239
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.340
associate of death and dying practices at the University of bath. For example,

240
00:16:11.341 --> 00:16:16.230
Italy, they use the brain death criteria. The Vatican, however it's own city,

241
00:16:16.231 --> 00:16:18.960
state within the country of Italy does not.

242
00:16:18.961 --> 00:16:23.100
The Vatican goes only by heart death. So technically according to John,

243
00:16:23.101 --> 00:16:26.730
it's possible that if I were brain-dead and Italy and doctor wanted to pull my

244
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.960
plug, but my family didn't,

245
00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:32.310
they could just wheel me down the street into the Vatican and I'd be alive

246
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:33.180
again.

247
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.391
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

248
00:16:33.391 --> 00:16:36.870
I mean you'd need a really long extension cord probably cause of course these

249
00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:37.350
are all,

250
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.710
I mean you'd be on machines and devices that require power so you can meet.

251
00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:44.370
It would be a laborious process to say the least. Nonetheless,

252
00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:48.420
the real question here, the deeper one is in when do you die?

253
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.290
Is it brain versus heart? It's when are you gone?

254
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.790
Like when is a father, a son, a daughter

255
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.650
<v 7>really gone to us and who gets to decide that? And that's there in lies.</v>

256
00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:07.651
The rub dead to family can be very different than dead to an institution that

257
00:17:09.551 --> 00:17:10.570
might be caring for that body.

258
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.550
You know that that scene of lear with the mirror is in the feathers.

259
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.460
It's not a medical diagnosis.

260
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.920
It's a diagnosis about love and loss. Ooh,

261
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.240
stay little

262
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.190
<v 3>and number four tennis. Anyone,</v>

263
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.080
<v 10>let me tell you about a woman. She, we see a victim of a,</v>

264
00:17:48.081 --> 00:17:51.000
a road traffic accident. So that's Dr Adrian Owen.

265
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:53.610
He's a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge.

266
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:56.090
And he told me about this patient. He had

267
00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:01.110
<v 11>a patient who's in her thirties and she came to us after five months in a</v>

268
00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:05.320
vegetative state following a blow to her head.

269
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.560
<v 10>So for five months she'd been lying in the hospital,</v>

270
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.080
couldn't talk or couldn't move. He could breathe,

271
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.860
but no evidence of any awareness would shine light in her eyes.

272
00:18:14.861 --> 00:18:18.580
She wouldn't have the normal response in the fact that woman was gone.

273
00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:19.443
That's right.

274
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.630
But in spite of the fact that she was giving the world nothing back,

275
00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.630
Dr. Owen wondered, would it just be possible that there was somebody in there?

276
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.520
<v 11>So we tried a new kind of approach with her. Yeah.</v>

277
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.820
<v 10>Because they had a new and sophisticated tool that previous site is,</v>

278
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.340
I never had any rain scanner. Yeah. This is a stethoscope for the brain.

279
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.520
Dr. Owen stood by her bedside and said, tell you what,

280
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.720
in a few minutes we're going to take you to a machine. You chat with her.

281
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:55.554
You say, hey,

282
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.010
<v 11>that's exactly how it's done. Yes, it sounds, um,</v>

283
00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:01.430
a little bit bizarre because of course you don't get any responses back from

284
00:19:01.431 --> 00:19:04.970
these patients. You don't even know whether they can hear you, but we, you know,

285
00:19:04.971 --> 00:19:06.560
we might instructions very clear. Yeah.

286
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.940
<v 10>And he says, now when we put you in the machine,</v>

287
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.220
there's going to be a click and I'm going to say into your ear, please begin

288
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.530
<v 11>to imagine playing a vigorous game of tennis.</v>

289
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:18.763
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

290
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.160
<v 11>we said, imagine that you're standing there at the base line,</v>

291
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.560
Wimbledon carrying out the movements.

292
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.540
<v 10>Dennis. See, because here's the thing.</v>

293
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.250
We now know enough about brains to know that if you are imagining tennis, yeah.

294
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.550
<v 11>Well, produce activity in your motor cortex.</v>

295
00:19:33.551 --> 00:19:36.760
Probably similar to the activity that you would see if you could scan somebody

296
00:19:36.761 --> 00:19:38.380
when they were actually playing a game of tennis

297
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.840
<v 10>and this is true of all healthy people. That's right. Oh, it's the same pattern.</v>

298
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.270
Yeah. It lights up very reliably. Okay,

299
00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:48.350
so he puts this patient into a brain scan and then he rolls her into the machine

300
00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:53.180
<v 11>and we say, right, play tennis now relax,</v>

301
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.270
play tennis. Not really.

302
00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.050
<v 10>You said this woman's been vacant for five months? Yeah,</v>

303
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:05.270
I get to see this seems quite literally a shot or a forehand in the dark.

304
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.950
This was his first patient. Really? He does this. He says, play,

305
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.970
stop, play, stop.

306
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.630
She hadn't spoken or showing any sense of awareness or any interior life at all

307
00:20:17.631 --> 00:20:19.970
for months and months and months and months and

308
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.730
on the screen. Here's a tennis game.

309
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.433
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

310
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.030
<v 11>what we saw is exactly what we see in healthy volunteers.</v>

311
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:42.280
No premotor cortex is turning on and turning off. When we asked her to relax,

312
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:44.953
turning on,

313
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:49.970
<v 10>we also have to do the task,</v>

314
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.560
then it would stop when we asked her to relax. So she's in there,

315
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.633
she's in there. Oh,

316
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:02.380
were you amazed or were you expect it, what were you,

317
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.640
what happened to you?

318
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.190
<v 11>Um, well, yeah, I mean it, it was,</v>

319
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.690
it was pretty exciting.

320
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.830
I'm going to have to say the fact that it was the first person we tried it in

321
00:21:13.831 --> 00:21:14.041
with.

322
00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:18.450
It was perhaps the biggest surprise and we've scanned about 20 patients since

323
00:21:18.451 --> 00:21:23.320
then doing the same thing. And we've, we've seen three so far who, uh,

324
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.130
showed clear signs of, uh, of being aware.

325
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.230
<v 10>See, that's the thing that sort of frightens me about what you've done.</v>

326
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.760
It seems to me you've discovered that there may have been,

327
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:39.570
and there may be lots of people in this world who are somehow aware but who are

328
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.880
invisible to the rest of us whom we could in effect murder a by mistake.

329
00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.320
<v 11>Yeah. Well that's obviously very, um, loaded question.</v>

330
00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.140
Uh, I mean I think we, you know,

331
00:22:00.141 --> 00:22:05.141
we have to face the side that historically we haven't always had the tools that

332
00:22:07.371 --> 00:22:11.660
we have today that can help us to make complex decisions.

333
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.520
But we're very early stages of this and they're awesome.

334
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.770
Some also very technical reasons why one needs to be extremely cautious about

335
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.340
drawing conclusions from this. For example, you know,

336
00:22:25.341 --> 00:22:30.260
we could tell with this patient that she was aware and what we can't do is to

337
00:22:30.261 --> 00:22:33.590
conclude that the rest of them were definitely unaware.

338
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.420
Imagine if you were stone deaf and you appeared to be in a vegetative state.

339
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.280
Now in that situation,

340
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:48.300
we wouldn't necessarily know that you were stone deaf because you've,

341
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.730
you've had a major brain injury and we can't talk to you and find out.

342
00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:53.630
So we don't know that you're stone deaf.

343
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.530
We put you in the scan and we asked you to imagine playing tennis.

344
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.440
But you can't even hear the instructions. Actually,

345
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:02.260
that patient wouldn't imagine playing tennis.

346
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:04.390
They wouldn't activate their premotor cortex.

347
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.560
But it wouldn't be because they weren't aware it would be because they were

348
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:09.190
deaf.

349
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.060
<v 10>Oh dear.</v>

350
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.490
<v 11>So even though we can tell when a patient is aware,</v>

351
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:19.440
we can't tell when a patient is unaware, and that's very,

352
00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:20.760
very important distinction.

353
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.410
<v 10>But if you can't really know that someone is unaware</v>

354
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.160
and then you can't actually ever really know if they're gone.

355
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.170
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

356
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:36.170
<v 10>we've entered into this very difficult space where we have learned enough to</v>

357
00:23:37.921 --> 00:23:40.680
know that we know much less than we thought.

358
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.583
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

359
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.013
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

360
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.830
<v 12>message one. Hi, this is Gary Greenberg.</v>

361
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.560
Radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

362
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.250
the corporation for public broadcasting and the National Science Foundation.

363
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.450
Message to Ken Baldwin.

364
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.970
Radiolab is produced by W W N Y C and distributed by the National Public Radio

365
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.040
and this message.

366
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.850
<v 3>Hello, I'm Jad. I boomerang. I remember Krulwich Radiolab.</v>

367
00:24:57.851 --> 00:25:00.250
We're back from our break. Yes we do. During our breaks,

368
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.290
which would you say we do during our breaks, we don't do anything.

369
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.670
We don't exist really. And we're going to continue with our show here today.

370
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.540
How many meditations?

371
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.400
1111 meditations on things relating to death and what happens after,

372
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.480
but we're not up to 11 this is a five. Five.

373
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.290
It's called four seconds down from producers who were in wheeler. Wake up.

374
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.890
Everything's pretty black.

375
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.140
Same as it has been last couple of weeks. This is Ken Baldwin.

376
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.280
The day he's talking about is August 20th, 1985.

377
00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:37.900
Say Goodbye to my wife and I just say, you know, I'll be home late.

378
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:42.100
Do some overtime at the time he was living couple hours east of San Francisco.

379
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.210
<v 13>Why? Say I love her and uh,</v>

380
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.200
I know right now that I won't survive the day.

381
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:55.690
She has no idea how I feel. Everything is,

382
00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:00.520
is dark, everything is, is black.

383
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.380
So I get in my car,

384
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:06.520
I'm just not a very good person drive to work cause I think maybe, uh,

385
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.050
maybe I can do it one more day closer.

386
00:26:11.051 --> 00:26:13.720
I get to work the more I realize I've, I've,

387
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.290
I've got to disappear to,

388
00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:21.010
to start over and get rid of whatever it is I've got.

389
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:25.720
It's got to end. I drive right past work and then I'm on the uh,

390
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:29.800
freeway. Kind of relaxed. Yeah.

391
00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.460
<v 3>Finally a see the bridge and it's, it's huge. It's gigantic.</v>

392
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.820
He parks his car at the bridge, puts money in the meter

393
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.940
<v 13>and uh,</v>

394
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.890
I start walking and I'm walking on the bridge just like any other tourists.

395
00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.940
It's a beautiful day. It's a gorgeous Wednesday.

396
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.150
I see everything around me and it's just gorgeous.

397
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.470
And I find a place, it's, it's an outcropping.

398
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:58.960
You can see straight down into the water. And I say,

399
00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.190
ah, this is time to do it. You really got to do this.

400
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.000
I really believed that everybody would be better off without me,

401
00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:13.960
that everybody would just get on with their lives feeling better about me being

402
00:27:13.961 --> 00:27:17.010
gone than me being here. I put my hands on the,

403
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.990
on the railing count to 10.

404
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.400
<v 3>Yup. And I vaulted over.</v>

405
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.420
<v 13>And the last things I, uh,</v>

406
00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.480
saw leave the bridge where my hands and that moment

407
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.270
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

408
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:47.150
<v 13>that very moment I said, oh my God, this is a mistake</v>

409
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.070
and nothing I can do about it. It's a fall,

410
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.680
the fall from the bridge to the water, it takes about four seconds.

411
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:59.710
And it was almost like a quick flickers of what I was trying to think of my

412
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.130
family, my daughter, three years old,

413
00:28:04.131 --> 00:28:07.940
I'll never see her grow up the things she's going to see that I don't get to see

414
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.540
man, the misery that I caused. This is bad.

415
00:28:11.541 --> 00:28:14.420
I'm sorry guys that I did this to you.

416
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.030
I do want to listen to how it's going to end.

417
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.100
<v 3>I just blacked out</v>

418
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.030
<v 13>and I woke up and I was swimming for my life and I was saying, oh my God,</v>

419
00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:35.250
somebody please save me somebody. Somebody saved me.

420
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.200
<v 14>He hit the water and a ball. He bruised his feet, his backside,</v>

421
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.880
but no serious injuries.

422
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.540
Some workers saw him jump and called the coast guard

423
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.880
<v 13>and then the next thing I remember I was on the coast guard cutter.</v>

424
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.910
<v 3>Only 26 people have made it onto that boat out of a thousand or so that have</v>

425
00:28:54.911 --> 00:28:59.911
jumped and nearly all of them say that in the middle of the fall when they're

426
00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:04.030
facing their death, something inside them changed.

427
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:06.450
<v 2>Mm.</v>

428
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.470
<v 3>They didn't want to die.</v>

429
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:09.180
<v 2>Mm.</v>

430
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:09.960
<v 3>For Ken.</v>

431
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.340
That change happened the very moment he saw his hands leave the bridge.

432
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.990
I can see that perfectly.

433
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:17.650
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

434
00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:22.180
<v 8>I can, I can, I can see my hands leave the bridge. I don't know if it was a,</v>

435
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.350
if it was a mechanical switch or a, you know, um,

436
00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.760
some kind of switch in the brain function, but it,

437
00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:35.910
for some reason it became a switch to another life.

438
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.753
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

439
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.930
<v 3>number six. Am I dead?</v>

440
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.650
Ooh, I hear some seagulls. You hear the seagulls? Yeah.

441
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.620
Where are they coming from? We just told the, I shut the, um,

442
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.940
the English Channel and the Atlantic.

443
00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.790
So they've got you in a little box floating in the ocean.

444
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.940
We're not actually not that far away from, from the sea.

445
00:30:13.941 --> 00:30:16.550
So we get lots of seagulls here. This is Barb rocks.

446
00:30:16.551 --> 00:30:18.650
He's not really floating in a box in the ocean.

447
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.630
He's just in a box near the ocean.

448
00:30:20.631 --> 00:30:25.190
And the reason we've connected our box in New York to his in England is because

449
00:30:25.191 --> 00:30:26.780
of a question he was once asked.

450
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.650
If you work in the sort of line that I've worked in over the years,

451
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.650
you get the most bizarre statements and questions,

452
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.960
which is because Palsy neuropsychologist,

453
00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.980
which means he diagnosis patients with various mental disorders.

454
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:45.070
And he describes this one case about eight years ago involving a woman named

455
00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:50.660
Jeanie, just an ordinary pleasant middle aged woman from the north of England,

456
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.750
early fifties well loved by her family. She comes into his office,

457
00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:55.520
he runs it through some basic tests.

458
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.800
<v 15>I just did a basic assessment of as I would in that sort of case of general</v>

459
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:00.634
intellectual level.

460
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.490
<v 3>And at first she seemed pretty with it. She answered all his questions,</v>

461
00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:06.220
he seemed pretty alert. But then while she was,

462
00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:08.970
she wasn't gonna have a conversation about whether [inaudible]

463
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.340
<v 15>things seemed real. What does that mean? Well,</v>

464
00:31:12.341 --> 00:31:14.200
it's difficult to pin that one down.

465
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.950
She just felt that things weren't real.

466
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.760
She would point to objects in the room and say, well, that cup that doesn't,

467
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.930
it doesn't seem real, does it? Or the chair doesn't seem real.

468
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:29.980
It just doesn't feel real. So I can see it and I can describe it to you.

469
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:32.740
But it just doesn't feel real.

470
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.400
And the thing that really made me sit up was when she said,

471
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.143
um,

472
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.330
<v 16>I forget the exact phrase, but it's in the book. Um, eventually Jeannie said,</v>

473
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.370
am I dad and my dad? Yes. Do you think I'm dead? Do you think I,

474
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.030
I didn't respond immediately and I let the silence flow.

475
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.390
Jeanie smile, her face was lit with a benign perplexity.

476
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.780
There was a smear of toothpaste around the corner of her mouth.

477
00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:07.700
She didn't seem to notice the droplets of tea spinning onto her dressing gun,

478
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:11.480
but there was a glint in her eye in the middle of the night. I was convinced,

479
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.960
she said, I thought they would come to take me away.

480
00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.220
I can't say for sure that I'm dead. She continued.

481
00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:24.140
The things are not the same. I don't feel real.

482
00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:29.760
It seems to me I might be dead. How would I know if I was dead

483
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.780
<v 2>and</v>

484
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.630
<v 16>immediately made me think? This may be an example of coats</v>

485
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.080
<v 8>syndrome. No one really knows what causes co-taught syndrome. It's very rare.</v>

486
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:47.900
I mean I've, I've come across three cases,

487
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:53.040
but one of the symptoms he says is often this sense of deep sense that you're

488
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.450
somehow not completely here.

489
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.810
<v 15>One idea about, um,</v>

490
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.940
this syndrome is that somehow that that's a decoupling of thoughts and feelings,

491
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.850
<v 8>which means what exactly he was, how to explain it to me.</v>

492
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.480
The brain has two jobs. It's doing it all times.

493
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:16.200
The first is to keep track of what's happening outside your body.

494
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.040
Like the sites that are coming out.

495
00:33:18.041 --> 00:33:21.250
You smell touch with your central experience of the world.

496
00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:25.260
That most immediate consciousness of the body and the world and the body being

497
00:33:25.261 --> 00:33:25.861
in the world.

498
00:33:25.861 --> 00:33:30.330
All the while the brain also is maintaining this inner life where you think

499
00:33:30.331 --> 00:33:33.450
thoughts and you have memories, personality,

500
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.630
what you normally think of when you think about yourself. You write,

501
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.690
what do you think happens in these, in this condition? Is it that outer?

502
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.010
Are you essential? Self somehow gets cut,

503
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.700
<v 5>cut off from that inner mental you and it just drifts off to see leaving you</v>

504
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.740
with just thoughts.

505
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.120
<v 15>But it's the feelings that give us our in the moment sense of self.</v>

506
00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.890
So if you don't have feelings attached to faults and perception,

507
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.000
<v 5>then you're like vapor. You're there,</v>

508
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.000
but you have no weight isn't what you're describing.

509
00:34:07.001 --> 00:34:10.720
Basically one version of the afterlife. Like my body's gone.

510
00:34:10.721 --> 00:34:12.580
But some thing remains.

511
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:13.980
<v 15>Yeah, I haven't thought of that. That's very,</v>

512
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.990
very interesting way to think about it.

513
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:21.680
But is that any different than the story persisting in someone else's head?

514
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.013
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

515
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.820
<v 5>you guys know this group, that edge edge.org it's John Brock [inaudible] group.</v>

516
00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.610
Yeah, we do. That's David Eagleman again. And for number seven,

517
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:52.210
a brief excerpt from a conversation we had with him if I only had a brain. So,

518
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.480
so I just wrote an essay on there yesterday.

519
00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.800
It came out to this big ideas that will change the world. That exactly. Yeah.

520
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.140
What's the thing that will change everything? And my answer was,

521
00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.870
and I think this is something I'll actually see in my lifetime.

522
00:35:03.871 --> 00:35:07.170
So the idea is silicone and mortality. In other words,

523
00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:12.171
downloading your consciousness into a computer and will really have reached a

524
00:35:12.361 --> 00:35:14.400
new point where there'll be a mortality.

525
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:16.450
<v 8>Ah,</v>

526
00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:17.650
<v 5>how would you figure this would work?</v>

527
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:22.150
So imagine you make an exact copy of the three dimensional structure of the

528
00:35:22.151 --> 00:35:24.790
brain, all the neurons, all the connections between the neurons,

529
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.150
the proteins inside the phosphorylation state to the proteins.

530
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.860
You make a copy of this whole thing.

531
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:34.780
What matters is the algorithms that are running on top of the brain,

532
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:36.880
it's not the wet gushy stuff that matters.

533
00:35:36.881 --> 00:35:40.650
It's what that wet cushy stuff is implementing and the idea is that if you could

534
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:44.970
recreate the brain out of let's say beer cans and tennis balls and you get all

535
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:48.870
the structure the same and it runs the same algorithms, then that would be,

536
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:52.410
you would have your consciousness, your memories, your thoughts and so on. Yeah.

537
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:55.470
Right now it's science fiction because it's so much data.

538
00:35:55.471 --> 00:35:58.940
Our current computers can handle it. Is that the only limitation? Just the, the,

539
00:35:58.941 --> 00:36:00.840
the hard drive size where there are no,

540
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:02.990
there's other limitations with there too. There,

541
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.470
there are two limitations right now.

542
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:09.060
One is our imaging technology and the other is the amount of storage capacity

543
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.270
and error. I mean you get one Adam or two wrong,

544
00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:14.310
and all of a sudden instead of your cat named Coco,

545
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:18.180
it's now named Boco and then you're not the same person. No, that's not true,

546
00:36:18.181 --> 00:36:20.850
in fact, because every time you hit your head on a cabinet,

547
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.510
you're actually killing lots of neurons. But that doesn't change who you are.

548
00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:27.030
You don't miss. Remember your cat's name. I mean,

549
00:36:27.031 --> 00:36:30.300
imagine that you changed one word in, in the novel Moby Dick.

550
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.900
It would still be Moby Dick. Be Almost Moby Dick.

551
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.290
It would be almost Moby Dick. But,

552
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.990
but you are almost the same person day to day,

553
00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:43.220
and you're never exactly the same person that you were yesterday because of the

554
00:36:43.221 --> 00:36:45.870
small changes in your brain. But let's say, imagine that you're right,

555
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.630
despite Roberts objections, even imagining,

556
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.850
let's just say you think you're the Hubris.

557
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:56.040
What would you actually do with the Xerox brains to be immortal?

558
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:58.210
Don't you have new cotton than [inaudible]?

559
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.160
How would you interface with a xerox brain?

560
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:07.430
So the idea is if we can recreate a brain in zeros and ones on a computer,

561
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.590
then you could actually live inside of a virtual world

562
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.700
and you could enjoy living in this world indefinitely.

563
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.060
Or like the scarecrow

564
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.080
brain. He, he didn't have a real brain.

565
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:34.680
He had straw and a certificate. Well,

566
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:37.740
you don't actually know that you have a real brain either, right? One,

567
00:37:37.741 --> 00:37:40.500
there are, there are modern philosophers who deal with this in a very,

568
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:45.510
in a real way, they ask how would we know if we are a simulation?

569
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.330
Why would we die if we were a simulation? He's not going to die. That's like,

570
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.740
ah, well so this, this is the point of my book.

571
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:57.300
Some is to illustrate that there are lots of possibilities out there, right?

572
00:37:57.301 --> 00:38:02.070
Here it comes. Yeah. When you interrupt,

573
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.950
you are about to become immortal. So there,

574
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.490
there are many different stories written here and some of them,

575
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:13.950
God is actually a married couple that got separated and then reunited or that

576
00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:16.230
God is the size of a micro

577
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.900
eight. Did we say eight or is it nine? I think it was nine. Yeah,

578
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:26.160
I think we're eight. Ineffable. Another story by David Eagleman and his book,

579
00:38:26.161 --> 00:38:29.070
some red for us again by actor Jeffrey tambor.

580
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.530
When soldiers part ways at war's end,

581
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.270
the breakup of the platoon triggers the same emotion as the w. Well,

582
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:41.830
the death of a person, it's the final bloodless death of the war.

583
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.390
The same mood Hans actors on the drop of the final curtain after months of

584
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:47.081
working together,

585
00:38:47.081 --> 00:38:52.081
something something greater than themselves is just died after a store closes

586
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.550
its doors on its final evening or a congress wraps its final session.

587
00:38:57.551 --> 00:39:01.990
The participants amble away feeling that they were just part of something larger

588
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:06.080
than themselves, something they intuit had a life, even though they,

589
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.600
they can't quite put a finger on it in this way,

590
00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:13.930
death is not only for humans, but for everything that exists.

591
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.760
And it turns out that anything that enjoys life enjoys an afterlife,

592
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:22.780
platoons in plays and stores in congresses, they don't end.

593
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.050
They just move on to a different dimension.

594
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.550
Although it's difficult for us to imagine how these beings interact.

595
00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:36.100
They enjoy, uh, this delicious afterlife together.

596
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:38.900
They exchange stories of their adventures. They,

597
00:39:38.901 --> 00:39:42.850
they laugh about good times and often. Well, just like us, just like humans,

598
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:47.890
they lament how short this thing is, how brief

599
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.223
it is.

600
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.660
It may seem mysterious to you that these organizations can live on without the

601
00:39:55.661 --> 00:39:58.900
people who compose them, but the underlying principle, well, it's simple.

602
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:03.840
The afterlife is made of spirit. I mean, after all you,

603
00:40:03.841 --> 00:40:06.910
you don't bring your kidney or your liver or your heart to the afterlife with

604
00:40:06.911 --> 00:40:10.810
you. Instead, you gain independence from the pieces that make you up.

605
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.413
Now,

606
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.620
a consequence of this cosmic scheme is going to surprise you.

607
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.660
When you die.

608
00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:24.250
You're aggrieved by all the atoms of which you were composed.

609
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.640
Yeah, I mean, they hung together for years,

610
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:31.660
whether in sheets of skin or communities as spleen, but with your death,

611
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.690
they don't die. Instead, they,

612
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.780
they part ways moving off in their separate directions.

613
00:40:37.781 --> 00:40:39.640
Mourning the loss of a special time.

614
00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:44.410
They shared together actually haunted by the feeling that everyone's playing

615
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.580
parts in something larger than themselves.

616
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:52.490
Something that had it's own life, something, um,

617
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:58.300
well, they can hardly put a finger on

618
00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:09.790

<v 3>Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich and today on the show, 14 meditations,</v>

626
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:42.480
1211 1111 meditations on the moment of death.

627
00:41:43.831 --> 00:41:48.430
And what happens after eight nine nine eight title,

628
00:41:48.431 --> 00:41:53.040
which simply escapes me. Boo-Yah Mozart from producer Lulu Miller.

629
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:54.270
Hi there. Can you hear me?

630
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:55.360
<v 11>Yes I can.</v>

631
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.120
<v 3>Okay, great. So I called it this guy at the University of Leicester.</v>

632
00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.270
<v 11>Yeah. [inaudible] ceviche. I'm a,</v>

633
00:42:00.271 --> 00:42:03.270
I'm a ecologist who basically went from the history,

634
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.730
<v 3>but in his spare time he's been studying what he calls</v>

635
00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.850
<v 11>future fossils.</v>

636
00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.350
<v 3>Like let's go ahead a hundred million years,</v>

637
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.130
<v 11>which is roughly at the time that separates us from the dinosaurs.</v>

638
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:16.430
We will be dead. All the species that are around us will be dead.

639
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.620
<v 3>So I asked him, well, any of our stuff, the books we write,</v>

640
00:42:19.621 --> 00:42:23.580
the buildings we make, well any of that still be here. And here's what he found.

641
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:31.040
<v 11>Concrete is probably going to preserve pretty well. Glass will preserve,</v>

642
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:35.480
but it will probably turn opaque bits of brickwork, carotid piping,

643
00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:40.460
some types of plastic and our rubbish dumps all under Pritik of champs being

644
00:42:40.461 --> 00:42:45.440
preserved. What about paper? Paper is again,

645
00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:47.780
we can treat that paper is plant material.

646
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:52.290
It will carbonize just because when we see fossil plants,

647
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:56.190
they can be preserved for tens or even hundreds of millions of years.

648
00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.450
So the shape of paper will be preserved almost forever.

649
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.450
Uh, but the print, the print on paper will almost certainly be lost.

650
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:12.180
If you have a, a book preserved, it will be like a little piece of,

651
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.410
of oblong coal.

652
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:20.060
So the idea is that we produce that I cannot see surviving us,

653
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.740
you know, so Shakespeare and Gerta and all the people we call the mortals,

654
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.120
you know, Mozart Music, um,

655
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:31.620
that information I think will be lost forever.

656
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.713
[inaudible]

657
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:38.980
<v 3>oh one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,</v>

658
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:43.030
10 psi. Bertrand city, Sydney, it's a word of our own coinage,

659
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.530
cyber trinity and it comes to us from producer Emily Voight.

660
00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:51.620
This story is about dealing with death in a world where no one really dies.

661
00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:57.670
At the center of the story is a guy named Wyatt Amman.

662
00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:01.590
<v 18>I knew I at and uh, I consider him my best friend.</v>

663
00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:02.880
That's Donald Dover.

664
00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:07.710
Wyatt and I both had office jobs at the same time and together we decided that

665
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.670
this wasn't enough because both of us are spending so much time in front of

666
00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:12.504
computers.

667
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.450
So the goal was going to be to join the Peace Corps and we had talked about

668
00:44:15.451 --> 00:44:16.620
doing the Peace Corps together,

669
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.240
<v 3>but why it got things going. First he quits his job,</v>

670
00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.810
he signs up for the Peace Corps and within a few months was headed off to

671
00:44:22.811 --> 00:44:23.430
Zambia.

672
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.200
<v 18>He called me to see him off. And um,</v>

673
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:29.440
we sat there and sat there and sat there sort of avoiding the fact that he was

674
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.670
going to actually have to leave. Um, finally he's like, all right,

675
00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.970
you need to go home. I need to get on a plane. So, um,

676
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.560
he walked me to my car and, uh,

677
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.270
gave me a big hug and I said, yeah.

678
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:50.270
He said, uh, you've been a great friend to me.

679
00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:54.840
[inaudible] I said, yeah, you too. And uh, he said,

680
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.760
don't worry, I'll be back in two years. Nobody's going to die.

681
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.590
<v 3>But 10 weeks into the trip, why?</v>

682
00:45:03.591 --> 00:45:08.030
It was hanging out with some friends on the fourth floor of a hotel and he

683
00:45:08.031 --> 00:45:09.470
leaned back against a window,

684
00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.430
almost floor to ceiling and the play glass gave out.

685
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:18.290
He fell four stories and he bled to death. His lungs filled with blood.

686
00:45:18.291 --> 00:45:19.700
He never regained consciousness

687
00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.930
<v 19>when the peace corps called it. I just said, I don't believe it. Who is this?</v>

688
00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:26.390
What are you, what kind of sick thing are you doing?

689
00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:31.220
This is Jeannie m and why it's mom. He said, fatal injuries. I said,

690
00:45:31.221 --> 00:45:32.990
what do you mean fatal? What does fatal mean?

691
00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:35.450
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

692
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:38.270
<v 19>I couldn't, my mind would not comprehend what that word meant.</v>

693
00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:44.060
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

694
00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:48.070
<v 19>I th I felt so betrayed by God. Um,</v>

695
00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.360
I had prayed for Wyatt and had felt that God would keep him safe. And you know,

696
00:45:53.361 --> 00:45:55.640
it isn't, it's, it's such a crock

697
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.740
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

698
00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.090
<v 19>so two years go by</v>

699
00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:07.580
and right at the time that why it would have been returning from the peace

700
00:46:07.581 --> 00:46:09.710
corps, something happened.

701
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.480
<v 3>Jeanie, can you tell me about getting the letter?</v>

702
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.200
<v 19>Yeah, I remember.</v>

703
00:46:14.201 --> 00:46:18.610
So clearly Greg and I were both home and we went to the mailbox and walk to the

704
00:46:18.611 --> 00:46:19.900
kitchen and um,

705
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:25.100
we ripped open the envelope and inside was a letter from Wyatt.

706
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:33.050
We were really unsure what was going on. It's hard to describe. It was,

707
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.160
um, it was really incredible.

708
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.420
So what happened is this before why it died,

709
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:44.050
he had been playing around on the Internet and he went to this site called

710
00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:47.530
future me a website where you can send a letter to your future self.

711
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.200
Why he wrote his right before he joined the Peace Corps.

712
00:46:50.201 --> 00:46:53.590
And the idea was that the site would hold onto it and email it back to him in

713
00:46:53.591 --> 00:46:58.090
two years. But of course, why it wasn't there to get the letter.

714
00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.560
But Donald, his friend found it and sent it.

715
00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:05.860
And so Greg and I both stood there at the counter and we read the letter. Okay,

716
00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.790
so what does it, what does it say dear future me, I'm leaving DC.

717
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.810
So far I've managed to do pretty much everything other than what I needed to do.

718
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.900
No, it's about the fact that he's leaving for Zambia. First of all,

719
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:18.490
I have no idea what to expect.

720
00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.180
He talks about his ex-girlfriend sometimes love is like crack.

721
00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.740
How he hates his office job.

722
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:27.880
I truly believe that I was meant to be a semi-transparent being, you know, he's,

723
00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.630
he's sort of being a little, I want the Sistine Chapel,

724
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.050
not a ranch style home in the suburbs outlet or really captured who,

725
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:38.200
why it was my life is my canvas, you know,

726
00:47:38.201 --> 00:47:42.250
with all his ramblings and these grandiose things already. Schizophrenia, Cli,

727
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.860
colorful, intricate in dizzyingly morphis.

728
00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.630
He knows that he's seeing too much in that. He kind of has to humble himself.

729
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.480
How pretentious is that? And that's what he was like.

730
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:55.600
He was always keeping a check on himself. One thing's for sure.

731
00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:00.760
I'm capable of rambling on and on and on and on and on and on and on.

732
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:06.160
I have the same problem. I just remember feeling,

733
00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:11.550
<v 3>I felt like, why had I just sent us a letter? Greg shook his head and he said,</v>

734
00:48:11.551 --> 00:48:13.710
that kid, you know, and um,

735
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:19.050
it was like a part of him was still alive.

736
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.690
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

737
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:27.940
<v 3>Emily [inaudible] let me just interrupt for just a second. Okay.</v>

738
00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.790
Because it will be easy to hear. The story is just like a fluke,

739
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.740
like a letter shows up from a kid who died and liquid.

740
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:35.470
It means to the mom and his friend. But no,

741
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.790
this might be where we're all headed, cause he internet, you know,

742
00:48:39.791 --> 00:48:40.624
it's always on.

743
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:43.270
And one of the things that's happening is that there are sites that are popping

744
00:48:43.271 --> 00:48:48.271
up that allow people to speak from beyond the grave and to keep on speaking.

745
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.270
In fact, David Eagleman, who we heard from earlier,

746
00:48:52.271 --> 00:48:55.570
the guy who read those stories and a neuroscientist, he started one.

747
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:59.200
So I started the company, deathswitch.com this is a real thing.

748
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:02.320
There are hundreds of subscribers. Yeah, no kidding. Oh yeah.

749
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:05.590
The way it works is you sign up for the site and then you keep checking in with

750
00:49:05.591 --> 00:49:08.230
the site to prove you're alive. And if you disappear for too long,

751
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.450
the computer deduces you are dead.

752
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:14.350
Then it sends out all those emails that you told it to see your company,

753
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.810
telling him what the passwords are to your family,

754
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:20.290
telling them where the gold is buried or even just to remind them that you love

755
00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.910
them. And he says that these switches,

756
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:24.310
these desk switches are going off all the time.

757
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:28.390
But lots of people test the deaths, which is to make sure that it works.

758
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.240
So they might not be real yet, but they will be pretty soon.

759
00:49:31.241 --> 00:49:33.010
So it's easy for him to imagine.

760
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:36.460
I'll let her to like this happy 87th birthday.

761
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.810
It's been 22 years since my death. I hope your life is proceeding delightfully,

762
00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.990
which may sound funny, but imagine that that's you in the kitchen,

763
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:49.620
getting a letter from your mom or from someone that you lost too early.

764
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.950
How would you feel? Um,

765
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.930
it was like a part of him was still alive.

766
00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.720
So after Jeannie gets the letter, what happens? Well,

767
00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:06.070
Jeannie starts writing Wyatt as if he hadn't died.

768
00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.060
What do you mean writing him where? Well, why?

769
00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.770
It had been a huge blogger and Jeanie discovered that a lot of his blogs were

770
00:50:11.771 --> 00:50:14.410
still active. One of them was even updating his age.

771
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.840
It shows his age is what he'd be now, you know,

772
00:50:16.841 --> 00:50:18.280
it doesn't know that he's not here anymore.

773
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:20.500
So she goes on and leaves him comments.

774
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:24.740
My latest one was on November 5th of this year. Do you want me to read that one?

775
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.980
That'd be great. Why? It feels like you are still here living in

776
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.660
<v 19>Zambia and it is 2005 I feel frantic to do something to stop the 17th from</v>

777
00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:35.980
happening in your mind when you comment on a blog. Oh Wyatt,

778
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:40.500
another holiday without you. Where do you picture that it's going well, I think,

779
00:50:40.501 --> 00:50:43.980
I wish you could just let me know what it is like and how you feel now. Um,

780
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.380
I think I just figure it's like on a screen and somehow he's getting it.

781
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:49.913
Why it's dead

782
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.133
<v 18>for Donald.</v>

783
00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:57.700
Getting the letter was just a reminder of that why had died and Zambia and in

784
00:50:57.701 --> 00:51:01.360
fact the idea that technology could keep him around. I guess I'm sort of,

785
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:02.710
it just didn't work for Donald.

786
00:51:02.711 --> 00:51:07.420
I sort of feel that the way I imagine why it felt in his letter he talks about,

787
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:08.260
um,

788
00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.980
not being static and what to learn and grow and see how other wants to continue

789
00:51:11.981 --> 00:51:15.160
moving and seeking and building and growing. And I will at rest,

790
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.710
it can be kind of frustrating. Like he's,

791
00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:21.520
he's stuck in a 24 year old y. Um,

792
00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:26.650
before I died we had, um, we decided we were Luddites.

793
00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:28.990
They, we were anti-technology. And, um,

794
00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.360
the hilarious part is that then wild then googled luddite to find out things

795
00:51:34.361 --> 00:51:36.010
about Luddites. Um,

796
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:41.190
but initially the plan was to leave to meet why in Africa and when white died,

797
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:46.120
I knew that I still needed to make that break. So we did,

798
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.770
I left my office job to go live on a small island in the middle of Chesapeake

799
00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:57.430
Bay to 240 Acre island. And I lived there with three other people.

800
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:02.190
There's no cell phone service. You won't be logging onto the Internet.

801
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:07.980
He sure why it would've left it there

802
00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.550
and 11 goodbye.

803
00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:45.930
<v 16>Here's Peter Ward,</v>

804
00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:50.100
a paleontologist and professor of biology and earth and space sciences at the

805
00:52:50.101 --> 00:52:53.010
University of Washington in 7 billion years.

806
00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.970
<v 14>Her son will suddenly go red giant</v>

807
00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:05.380
and the earth is just burned to a crisp. Is that happened

808
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:10.600
<v 16>and like one morning or does that happen over several hundred years or actually</v>

809
00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:15.080
you take a few thousand years, but the oceans will have been actually long gone.

810
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:19.730
The oceans are going away in 2 billion years. Oh dear. Because the sun,

811
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:21.260
that nasty old sun just [inaudible] just keeps

812
00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:25.560
<v 14>getting brighter and brighter and brighter and about 50 to 60 centigrade,</v>

813
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.220
we start

814
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.140
<v 1>rapidly losing the ocean space.</v>

815
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:32.090
<v 16>This is the opposite of Noah's flood. Instead of [inaudible]</v>

816
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.210
<v 0>the gas descending into the giant oceans,</v>

817
00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:38.390
now the oceans pick up and go back into the sky. Exactly,

818
00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.550
and then things get worse from there because 5 billion years after the oceans

819
00:53:43.551 --> 00:53:46.520
are gone, the sun starts to expand

820
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:48.310
<v 16>and it happens in</v>

821
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:49.943
<v 1>Hans.</v>

822
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:54.650
<v 16>There are actually four to five pulses that are going to take place.</v>

823
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:58.880
The first four pulses will not eat up the earth,

824
00:53:58.881 --> 00:53:59.830
but it will certainly stay around

825
00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:02.500
<v 1>six.</v>

826
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.690
<v 16>The whole surface will melt. It would be glowing.</v>

827
00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:06.680
<v 1>Um,</v>

828
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.290
<v 16>the last one, the sun just keeps expanding.</v>

829
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.890
Our Sun will expand be almost to the orbit of Mars.

830
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:16.970
So the earth is totally gone. I mean, it just gets snuffed out.

831
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:23.280
But the nice thing is that your Ropa will become the new Maui.

832
00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:27.250
Yes, Jovian satellites.

833
00:54:27.251 --> 00:54:31.840
If you buy real estate there now and now here is jerk sheet that will be the

834
00:54:31.841 --> 00:54:36.840
tropics, Jovian Moon, Jovian Moon. How many are candidates for Maui's?

835
00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:41.410
There's Europa and Ganymede and io, not so much,

836
00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.040
but he's in Europa. When the ice melts on Europe as it was just an,

837
00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:48.610
isn't it an all watery is just gonna be a nice warm ocean would just be a ball

838
00:54:48.611 --> 00:54:52.120
of water ball of water. A hundred mile deep water too with that,

839
00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:55.870
that's regular liquid water. H Two. Oh yes. Oh, it's beautiful stuff.

840
00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.720
Taking the view. Think of the views of Jupiter under these. So spectacular.

841
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.450
The downside with these Jovian moons is that you couldn't breathe

842
00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:16.390
when you left that out. Minor detail can breathe it fucking that.

843
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:21.360
You can certainly go water skiing. It's just have a little respirator on, oh,

844
00:55:21.361 --> 00:55:24.210
that was a small little asterisk you've just gone to now.

845
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:27.340
It's just compared to the end of the world. That's minor detail. I see.

846
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.970
All right, so now let's go further out.

847
00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:35.060
At what point does any possibility of solar system existence and ah,

848
00:55:36.721 --> 00:55:37.554
that was tougher.

849
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.980
That was very tough because after the red giant we'd become a m mclass or a

850
00:55:43.711 --> 00:55:44.490
dwarf,

851
00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:49.490
which means the Sun after being this big now expanding Redstar made giant sinks

852
00:55:50.551 --> 00:55:54.750
back into itself and becomes much, much, much smaller and much, much cooler.

853
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:59.940
So Europa, I live a little paradise now. Pleases exactly.

854
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.980
And then the only thing left is things like voyager, things that you, um,

855
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.610
you sent off that are still going off somewhere.

856
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.870
Bits of us, they're going and going and going and gone.

857
00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:16.950
And the chance that they'll ever intersect a star is very small.

858
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:20.590
The end, the end.

859
00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:26.490
Now, the final end, of course,

860
00:56:26.491 --> 00:56:31.491
is way off into the future because the universe keeps expanding.

861
00:56:32.461 --> 00:56:35.750
That means eventually Adams themselves is pulled apart.

862
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.690
Little Protons and neutrons.

863
00:56:38.691 --> 00:56:43.010
They get ripped away from one another and we're somewhere else.

864
00:56:43.011 --> 00:56:44.900
Something else somehow else.

865
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.420
<v 20>Yeah, and then everything that is isn't</v>

866
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:56.920
[inaudible]. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.

867
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.600
Goodbye neutron.

868
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.770
<v 2>You're playing Robert Krulwich by jet blue. Brad,</v>

869
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:05.780
goodbye everyone.
