00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.140
SPEAKER: Mobile users
expect their apps

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.660
to have beautiful designs,
smooth animations,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.250
and great performance.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.020
To deliver on this,
developers need

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.140
to create new features faster
than ever without compromising

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.520
on quality or performance.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.280
That's why we built Flutter.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.440
Flutter is Google's
mobile UI framework

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.990
that provides a fast and
expressive way for developers

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.560
to build native apps on
both iOS and Android.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.140
This is because apps and
interfaces made with Flutter

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.780
are built from a single
codebase, compiled directly

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.160
to native arm code, use the GPU,
and can access platform APIs

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.750
and services.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.380
Here are three ways that Flutter
will help you on day one.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.170
Flutter is engineered for
high developer velocity.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.540
Stateful hot reload allows
you to change your code

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.130
and see it come to
life in less than a

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.820
second, without losing
the state of the app.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.750
Flutter also ships
with a rich set

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.840
of customizable widgets, all
built from our modern reactive

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.860
framework.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.830
Plus, Flutter integrates with
popular development tools,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.860
which means you can get started
quickly with the editor or IDE

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.930
you already know and love.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.300
Flutter moves the widgets,
rendering, animation,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.210
and gestures into the framework,
to give you complete control

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.280
over every pixel on the screen.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.700
This means you have flexibility
to build custom designs.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.280
Flutter apps follow platform
conventions and interface

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.400
details, such as scrolling,
navigation, icons, fonts,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.360
and more.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.950
This is why apps
built with Flutter

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.200
are featured on both the App
Store and Google Play Store.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.890
Flutter is great for developers,
both new and experienced

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.870
in mobile.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.620
If you're new to mobile,
Flutter gives you

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.650
a fast, fun, and modern
way to deliver native apps.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.427
If you're an experienced
mobile developer,

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.760
you can add Flutter to your
existing workflows and tools

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.860
to build new expressive UIs.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.950
Flutter is free and
open source, and used

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.460
by developers and
organizations around the world,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.510
including enterprise,
agencies, and startups.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.240
