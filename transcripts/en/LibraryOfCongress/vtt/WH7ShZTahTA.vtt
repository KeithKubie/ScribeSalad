&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.400
&gt;&gt; Eli Campbell: We're so glad
you could join us this evening

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.200
and we hope that you
will do so again.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.150
We have a great venue going
here with events all the time.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.470
We do this Life of a Poet series
four times a year in conjunction

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.770
with the Library of Congress

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.380
but we do a lot of
other great stuff.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.680
Coming up this weekend

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.310
of special interest we have our
Annual Emancipation Day Forum

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.220
named after the hospital's
first patient,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.120
an African American sailor
named Benjamin Drummond.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.940
And so we'll have lectures
going on starting tomorrow night

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.380
and throughout the
rest of the weekend

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.200
about African American
history and struggles.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.620
So it's going to be
a lot of good sort

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.080
of in-depth educational
stuff this weekend

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.280
if you're free to join us here.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.350
But now I will turn
it over to Rob Casper

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.650
to introduce our guests.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.340
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Thank you, Eli.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.450
Ooh! Hey! There's
a new sound system.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.230
Doesn't it sound great?

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.290
[Laughter] I'm so excited.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.750
I'm also turn off my
phone and you should too.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.750
Let me move out of the way.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.050
Hello, everyone.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.350
Thanks for coming out.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.650
We're so excited to see
you here at the Hill Center

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.820
where we've been doing
this quite a few times.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.040
This is, yeah, our 17th?

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.370
Seventeenth.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.110
["Whoa" from audience]
Very exciting.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.740
Thanks to Eli, who's manning
the sound in the back,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.130
and to Charlotte and to the
rest of the Hill Center staff

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.460
for continuing to have us here
hosting this terrific series.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.040
Of course I want to thank
the Washington Post,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.870
too, and Ron Charles.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.120
Every event I try to say
something new and wonderful

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.710
about Ron but I decided
I was just going

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.010
to say I really cannot say
enough good things about Ron.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.440

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.010

&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.870
So yeah, that's what
you're in for tonight.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.510
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: The Poetry and
Literature Center at the Library

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.710
of Congress, we are home
to the US Poet Laureate.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.200
Our current Poet Laureate
is Tracy K. Smith.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.840
She just got renewed
for a second term.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.140
It's worth checking her out.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.470
If you want to know more
about the events that we do --

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.290
most of which take place at
the library down the street

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.590
but a few which take place
here and around the country --

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.810
you can go check out our
website www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.760
Now I get to introduce
one of my dearest

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.430
and oldest friends,
Matthew Zapruder.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.720
Matthew was born here and in
fact he went to school just

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.530
around the corner
from my apartment.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.880
And Don, he went to the same
high school that you teach at.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.710
So he wants to talk about some
teachers you may have heard

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.170
of back in those
days [laughing].

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.480
Our paths first crossed, though,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.560
[inaudible] when we were
both graduate students

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.220
at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.300
Matthew was literally the first
student I met at the program.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.210
The appointed greeter for
incoming MFA students,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.830
he shook hands with
anyone who --

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.050
as still slightly
lost as I was --

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.670
wandered into the
grad student lounge.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.820
I can argue that in the years

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.410
that followed Matthew would find
new and ever more powerful ways

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.380
to welcome writers and
readers to the art.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.520
There is his work as an editor
of Verse Press Wave Books

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.670
and as last year's editor
of the poetry column

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.910
for The New York Times
Magazine as well as his work

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.900
as co-director of the
Bagley Wright Lecture Series

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.180
which we've hosted
at the library.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.440
All this work has
done much to get poems

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.310
and poetry criticism
out into the world.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.430
Matthew has also written his own
collection of poetry criticism,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.670
Why Poetry, published
last year by Echo Press.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.980
It has received all
sorts of praise

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.040
but let me just say I've never
seen someone who's given more

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.430
of his time and effort or has
spent as much of that time

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.020
and effort worrying over ever
detail in arguing for the value

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.320
of poems in our lives.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.950
And I'm impressed by how Matthew
weaved his own story of coming

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.730
to poems as part of
the book's argument.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.010
Finally and most importantly for
tonight, Matthew is the author

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.450
of four terrific poetry
collections: Sun Bear,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.490
Come On All You Ghosts, The
Pajamaist, and American Linden.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.790
He also collaborated

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.570
with painter Chris Uphues
-- is that how I say it?

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.440
-- Chris Uphues for
You In Full Bloom

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.130
and co-translated Romanian
poet Eugen Jebeleanu's last

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.440
collection, Secret Weapon:
Selected Late Poems.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.090
Matthew's honors include the
William Carlos Williams Award

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.690
from the Poetry Society of
America, the May Sarton Prize

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.440
from the Academy of
American Arts and Letters,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.820
the Tupelo Press Editors
Prize, and fellowships

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.020
from the Guggenheim Foundation
and the Lannan Foundation.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.490
He currently lives all the way
across the country in Oakland,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.290
California and is an associate
professor at St. Mary's College.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.290
I have so many stories I
could tell about Matthew

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.050
but for now let me say something

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.390
about his last book
of poems, Sun Bear.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.770
I read the whole book
in one fell swoop

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.530
on a subway train back home
to Brooklyn after a long week

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.410
in D.C. I'd been traveling for
hours and was pretty sapped

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.640
yet I'll never forget how I
floated page by page and stop

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.510
by stop as if in a
vehicle of another kind.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.650
It was a perfect way
to experience his book,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.660
among a car full of traveling
strangers, each easy to ignore,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.410
but Matthew's poems
made me think

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.310
of how connected we all can
be, how much we desire a way

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.920
to speak and see
and know each other.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.070
It's this great empathic charge

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.670
that I think makes
Matthew's poems so necessary

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.530
and I can't imagine a better
person for him to engage

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.760
with on poems and connection
and, frankly, on how to live,

&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And it's
wonderful to meet you in person.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.220
I read your book of
criticism, Why Poetry,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.480
last year when Elizabeth Lund
reviewed it for The Post.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.780
She loved it.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.200
And then I had the pleasure
of reading all your poems

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.940
and they're brilliant and
humane and very provocative.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.830
But you've said as a young
person you could never have

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.980
imagined yourself being
a professional poet.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.450
Why was that?

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.560
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Oh, I just
don't think I knew any poets

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.300
or just, it just wasn't even
in my realm of possibilities.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.740
I mean, I think I
was more interested

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.200
in being a wide receiver
for the Washington Redskins

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.500
at that time.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.200
[Laughter] That probably --
so yeah, I just didn't think

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.080
of that in any kind
of way as being --

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.070
I didn't think of writers as
being really living beings.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.140
I just -- they were people
who had written books

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.490
and they were either dead or
functionally dead [laughter]

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.420
because they were away from me.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.230
And then when I got into
music that was different

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.790
because I really got into music
and playing music and then got

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.840
into the music scene
here in D.C.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.140
And then then I met
all kinds of people

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.440
who made music and
played in bands.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Were
you writing lyrics?

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.040
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: I
didn't really write lyrics.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.340
I'm not a very good songwriter.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: OK.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.940
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
I play guitar.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.830
And so musicians were real
people to me but who were living

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.130
and making the art now.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.380
But poets I don't -- I just
don't think it just entered

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.310
into my head that that was
like a thing that people did.

write, "I grew up a wonderful,

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.750
sullen boy close enough to
the capitol building to dream

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.010
of hitting it with a
stick but did not."

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.310
[ Laughter ]

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.610
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.910
That sums it up.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:34.210
[ Laughter ]

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I wonder
if you'd read a poem.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.810
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Sure.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: A poem called
Tonight You'll Be Able.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.090
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.360
Sure. Tonight You'll Be Able.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.660
Can everybody hear me OK?

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.960
Or is it -- yeah.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.550
Tonight You'll Be Able.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.340
It may feel good to go wherever.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.800
Desires lead you into old,
destructive awareness.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.100
Going a thousand miles away
seems to be keeping up.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.990
Unsettled and anxious signals
-- they're so microscope.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.510
Be a sleuth.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.340
Tiny sparkling under those

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.310
around you sees you
feeling and waiting.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.600
Life today is slow-moving
coworkers.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.420
Respond by giving your
profile a new sense of clarity

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.640
and feel ready to
share your outlook,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.070
even if they may
not be as excited.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.660
It makes you good
to spread your joy.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.450
People, it's harder
to be yourself.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.950
A series of role-playing
opportunities appeases.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.990
Showing the authentic,
you won't hurt anything.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.320
Focus on your lovely find, that
there are many more things.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.600
Tonight you'll be able to
talk to anyone about anything.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.300
Make all the loved
ones muster up.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.600
Chat with character.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.970
Keep alive the conversations.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.720
You feel you're getting
something someone gives you.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.130
The key to a series

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.500
of coincidences you
play matchmaker to.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.490
An odd couple -- the present you
and the future and a big suit,

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.850
a new haircut, or better
than anticipated funds.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.360
A few minor changes to June.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.080
Love partners -- your
lucky numbers are 4,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.570
7, 18, 21, and 32.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:16.720
Ask yourself what would I do
if I knew I could not fail?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's a
lovely, hopeful poem.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.040
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Thanks.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.340
Do you want to know a
secret about that poem, Ron?

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, I do.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.940
I won't tell anyone.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.240
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: All the
language is from the horoscope.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.910
[Laughter] It's from
two horoscopes

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.210
in The Chicago Tribune.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.510
I was traveling --

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.810
[ Laughter ]

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.280
And I was sitting with my friend
Joshua Beckman and we were

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.710
in a Polish kielbasa
place [laughing]

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.530
and we decided we were
going to write a poem

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.830
and I had this newspaper.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.220
I had The Chicago
Tribune or Sun-Times,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.690
one of the two Chicago
papers in front of me.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.440
And they had two horoscopes
which struck me as very funny

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.740
that you would have
two horoscopes.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.420
It seems like that
creates immediate chaos.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.720
[Laughter] Like, why not one?

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.420
You know? It's hard enough
as it is to know what to do.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.830
So I just started cutting out
all the language of those things

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.400
and rearranging it and
made the poem out of those.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.800
So it's all, all -- that's
all language from horoscopes.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: A found poem.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But that --
not really a found.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.370
I mean, I moved them
around a lot.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.970
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: But
yeah, but it's all --

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.670
I think that's probably the
only poem I've ever written

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.690
like that that's all
found language like that.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.290
That's amazing.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.590
[ Laughter ]

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:21.890
Well now you're a poet

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.550
but you're also a
critic and an editor.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:28.790
How did that transition
come to be from music?

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.540
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Well,
I tell the story about this

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.870
in the Why Poetry book,
but what happened is

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.400
that I played music
for a long time.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.550
I was in different
bands and sort

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.280
of always secretly
wanted to be a writer.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes?

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.880
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.180
But I hadn't really
ever written anything.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.480
[ Laughter ]

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.090
And I figured out -- I
went to graduate school

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.870
for Slavic languages
and literatures.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.480
I had been a Russian major
in college and then I went

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.000
to UC-Berkeley to get a PhD.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.360
And I knew pretty
much right away

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.060
that was not going
to be my career path.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.920
I wasn't going to be a
big success as a scholar.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.600
But I thought, well, if I want

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.320
to be a writer I
should start writing.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.920
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
I better write.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Poems?

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.520
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
I didn't know.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.820
I just knew I needed to write
so I just sat down at a desk

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.930
and basically just
started writing everyday.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.230
You know, I'd try to write.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.530
And I wrote poems.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.830
It was very strange.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.820
I was studying Russian
poetry at the time

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.400
and getting -- but
it was very odd.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.120
I didn't, you know,
I didn't think

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.680
that was necessarily
what was going to happen.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.940
And then I started writing
poems and then once that started

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.550
to happen then I tried to figure
out what was going on, you know,

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.570
what was happening with
poetry and what it all meant

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.100
and everything to
educate myself.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You've got a
poem called This Handwriting.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.130
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I wonder
if you'd read that.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.730
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It seems
to have a lot to do --

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.330
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: This is
all very exciting, by the way,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.270
because I have no idea what
he's going to ask me to read.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.570
So it's [laughter]
really like --

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Well,
they're all yours.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.170
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Well, yeah, that's true.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.470
So I have --

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Come on, now.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.070
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Yeah, I have some idea.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.370
But yeah [laughter].

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.590
So This Handwriting.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.210
This afternoon I heard the
small voice speaking again,

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.280
though no one was there.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.380
I could not hear the words,
though from the helpless,

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.280
complicated tone I
knew it was something

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.110
like someday you will realize
you already know you must go

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.170
elsewhere to be free.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.090
Maybe the white island with just
a few necessary buildings you

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.210
saw once from above
as if you were flying.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.990
All your friends in gentle,

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.060
laughing disputation
are already waiting.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.130
For now I settle for trying
to picture each of their faces

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.650
but when I close my eyes I just
keep seeing this horrible actual

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.640
sunny floor I've scattered
pages of my handwriting on,

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.530
searching for a pattern.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.600
And also this table.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.860
Upon it lies a yellow book
containing a translation

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.960
of the half-burned gospel

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.730
that says often Jesus
kissed Mary on the mouth.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.360
Reading it makes me feel as if
the true future, like the son

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.450
of a dethroned king long
ago hid in a cave trying

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.830
to silence his breathing.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.650
The great, black indeterminate
stallion pounded implacably by.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.000
Now there's only silence,
like an auditorium

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.570
after a modern composition
has just finished perfectly

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.570
destroying our foolish,
cherished ideas of music.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.020
When I think very hard about
my thoughts, they seem to me

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.570
to be very small horses attached

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.670
to invisible reins
attached to facts.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.510
And what of my memories?

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.690
Like sleeping in daylight.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.130
A decade ago I lived in
Massachusetts, a shallow,

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.610
terrible installation leaking
smoky versions of myself,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.260
each in turn emitting
weak, soluble ideas

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.110
like people care only because
they do not even know they feel

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.410
they must.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.650
And now I'm here in California
happy to be, though always part

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.550
of me is thinking of my friends

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.840
and their shadows
patiently waiting

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.290
for my shadow to join them.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That seems
like a poem about your writing.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.280
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: About
searching for an identity.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.910
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Pretty critical.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.510
Self-critical.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.810
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] Yeah.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: "The small
horses of your ideas."

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.410
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: "Searching
for patterns"

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.010
and your "weak, soluble ideas."

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.310
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] Yeah.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Is that --

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.370
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah,
well [sighing], I think.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:29.290
You know, one thing about
writing that's a terrible truth

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.200
that I'm sure you must
-- I suspect you also --

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.270
know and a lot of people in this
room know is that, you know,

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.330
often you're not very
interesting to yourself.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.620
Or you have to go through
a lot of kind of self-doubt

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.300
and self-criticism and
just feeling kind of not

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.340
like you're particularly on your
mark before something starts

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.640
to happen.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.940
That's just part of that.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.240
I mean, maybe there are
writers out there in the world

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.540
who don't have to
go through that.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.840
I've never met any.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.520
So that bringing that experience

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.330
into the poem seemed
more honest to me.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mmhmm.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.930
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And
also a good opportunity to,

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.230
like, make some jokes.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.830
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: You
know but [laughing] --

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: At your
own expense, right?

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.430
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
You know, I feel --

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.730
and I think the thing
about writing is

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.030
that it can feel very lonely.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.630
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And so I
was feeling lonely in that poem

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.930
and then I was imagining my
friends where they keep kind

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.230
of going away from me.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.530
You know, like, they're
not really there actually.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.310
All that's there
is my crummy poem

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.610
that I'm working on [laughing].

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.210
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: You know,

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.510
but I just have to
work through that.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.810
That's the thing you learn.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.110
I think that's the
thing you learn

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.410
about writing is you've
just got to grind it out.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.710
A lot of it is just
grinding it out.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.010
I mean, that's been said
many different ways before

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.310
but it's true.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It taxes your
confidence so dramatically and

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.600
yet it takes so much
confidence to publish.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.900
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: To put these
things out into the world

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.260
and then have them be critiqued,
sometimes cruelly, tritely.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.560
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.860
[ Laughter ]

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.830
Yeah, I mean once they're
done and they're gone,

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.810
I mean it stings
to get criticized.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.110
But the first part --

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.860
the feeling of going
through that self-doubt

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.530
and self-criticism.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.220
That's a million
times worse to me.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.520
That's in my experience.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.900
I mean, I don't -- you
know, a bad review?

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.030
I mean, you can shake
it off, you know?

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.330
But --

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.930
Because you've already done
so much worse in your mind.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.230
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Right.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In a poem
called Schwinn you write,

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.150
"I will never know a
single thing anyone feels,

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.040
just how they say it, which is
why I'm standing here exactly

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.560
covered in shame and lightning,
doing what I'm supposed to do."

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.860
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.160
[ Laughter ]

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.810
That's like a dramatic
end to the poem.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.310
That's kind of like
the poem starts

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.110
out with my bike getting stolen,
and then sort of wanders around

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.040
and then laments, like, the
Redskins losing the Superbowl

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.340
and [laughter] --
to the Dolphins.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.640
[ Laughter ]

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.490
And then -- but by
the end of the poem,

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.270
I mean that poem
surprised me because the end

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.140
of it is this almost
statement of being.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.340
It's a statement of my
purpose as an artist.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.940
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And it
shocked me when I wrote it.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.420
You know? I didn't think that's
where the poem was going.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.060
I wasn't -- I didn't say,
"oh, I must write a poem

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.580
in which I assert my right
as a poet to do whatever."

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.330
But I think I just -- I
think that's just true.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.980
I don't actually
know how people feel.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.480
I only know what they say.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.540
Like on some kind of literal
level, I mean, you know,

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.200
for the most part except if
it's your intimate partner

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.820
or something and you have
physical contact with them.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.810
But I mean, otherwise
I don't know anything

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.440
about you expect
what you tell me.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.520
And that distance is
both tragic and exciting.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.910
And so the recognition of that
fact led me to this belief that,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.480
huh, that's why I do this
because I think that distance

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.140
and that possibility
of transmission is

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.170
so exciting to me as a poet.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And for us
as readers, to read it --

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.580
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Well, hopefully.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: When it
speaks to you and to realize,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.340
oh my gosh, this person
feels the same, strange,

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.470
inexpressible thing that I feel.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.770
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Yeah, that's the hope.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.070
That's the idea.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.370
I mean, you don't know.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:39.970
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: You don't
know but you throw it out.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.910
You know, at some point
you have to stand.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.450
You know, at some point you
have to be really honest

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.750
with yourself as a poet.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.760
You know, you can't bullshit.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.110
And then you're just yourself

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.290
and your naked, ludicrous
humanity.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:59.050
And like, and saying the things
that you've seen true to you.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.590
And then if anything person
makes contact with that,

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.810
it's this amazing experience.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It
is for readers, too.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.410
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Yeah, well, I hope so.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.140
I mean, I've felt that so many
times on the other end of poems.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right, right.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.740
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: For sure.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.040
So.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You've
written this book recently,

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.640
your latest book
called Why Poetry --

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.940
which I highly recommend,
by the way.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.330
It's very smart but very
humble, very well-informed.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.630
It includes lots of poems.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.450
And he talks about how to read
poetry in a way that anybody

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.560
who is beginning or
experienced would profit from.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.170
I'm sure it's for
sale out in the lobby.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.130
I really recommend
that in addition

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.580
to the poems themselves.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.780
One of the the poems in
your collection begins,

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.120
"People say they don't
understand poetry."

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.460
[Matthew Zapruder
chuckles] And it seems

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.180
to me this essay collection
you published is in response

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.100
to that oft-repeated
statement, right?

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.400
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.700
Yeah.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.300
"People carry so many
incorrect ideas about poetry

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.600
into their reading of it,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.900
ones that ruin the
experience before they even get

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.200
to have it."

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.500
[ Laughter ]

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.580
What are those incorrect
ideas we have about poetry?

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.690
Just off the top of your head
from your experience teaching?

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:06.990
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
That the words

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.960
in the poems don't mean
what they seem to mean.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.560
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
That's a problem.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.160
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: That
the language is coded.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: [Laughing] Yeah.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.760
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
It's like --

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.060
which is problematic
because some

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.650
of the words really do mean
what they usually mean.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.610
But then if some don't,
which ones are which?

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:22.910
And what do they mean?

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.210
And who knows the
answer to that?

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.510
That's bad.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.920
That's not helpful.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.820
That seems like a pervasive
idea that people have

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.290
about poems, I've noticed.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.500
It's totally wrong.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:38.050
Also that -- yeah, the
poems are always sort

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.590
of about some big idea at the
end and there's some payoff

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.280
of like deep wisdom
that the poet has.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.290
That's also usually
not the case.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.660
They're an experience of
something that happens to you

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.220
and I think that
people know who read --

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.570
if you think about the
poems you really love

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.850
or maybe even an experience
you had with a poem you loved,

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.870
it's more like a process.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.480
It's an experience of
being changed by it.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.530
It's not just valuable because
of what comes at the end.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.530
You know? So I think
those are two,

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.090
like right off the
top of my head.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's good.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.900
Let's think about that last
one and what you just said,

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.520
that the poem is not
something that you wring

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.570
until something valuable
comes out of it.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.870
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right?

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.470
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.770
That does sound unpleasant.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.070
[ Laughter ]

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.370
It's like, yeah,
torture the poem

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.670
until it confesses [laughing].

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right
[laughing].

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.270
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Isn't --
I think somebody has a poem.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.570
Is it Billy Collins has a poem?

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:30.870
Yeah.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.470
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.770
Good old Billy.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
talked about the poem

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.370
as being an experience
with language.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.670
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Yeah, or like a process.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:39.970
I mean, I compare it in the book

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.270
to like a friendship
or a conversation.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.570
Especially maybe with a new
friend sometimes a poem can feel

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:43.870
that way.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mmhmm.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.470
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Like
you meet someone interesting

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.770
and you go out for coffee or
beer or with them or whatever,

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.070
a walk, and you're not,
like, oh I can't wait

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.120
until he says the one
thing that's really going

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.420
to be -- [laughter].

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.720
You're sort of, I don't know.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.020
I don't think.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.320
I mean, maybe some people do.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.620
[ Laughter &amp; Inaudible
Comments ]

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.930
Yeah! Or like, just
like, I hope.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.830
You know, I guess you could hope

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.540
that the person says one
interesting thing, I guess.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.970
But I mean, it's more like, oh
I'm joining with this person.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.550
I'm feeling changed.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.030
I'm interested in
what they're saying.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.730
They're revealing themselves
and I'm not going to sit here

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.820
and say that I understand
everything about them

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.290
and I'm completely done
with this experience just

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.530
after this one cup of
coffee or beer or something.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.190
It's like the opposite
should feel true, right?

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.490
You should feel like,
oh, that was great.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:24.890
Let's do that again.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.230
You know? And so I think poems
should make you feel that way.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.100
They shouldn't be like, OK,
now I know death is scary.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.270
[Laughter] Or like, you know,
being alone is a bummer.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.910
You know? Thanks
for the information.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.210
I mean, that's what I
think about poems is

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.990
like the information in
them is just so banal.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.700
You know? Like, when
even, like, my favorite,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.780
you know, Ode to a Nightingale.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.630
Death is scary.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:45.930
Like, thanks, Keets.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.230
I mean, that's not like --

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.530
[laughter] that's one
of my favorite books.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:49.830
That's not why I like that poem,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.520
because of the big
reveal at the end.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.930
You know, like, it's not that.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.910
I mean, and so that's why the
teaching of poems is so annoying

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.800
if you look at the
standardized tests.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.060
You know, where they ask you
for the theme of the poem

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.360
and it's the list

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.510
of possibilities is usually
just such a stupid list.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.930
I mean, like, that's the
big message, you know?

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.720
I mean, like, nature is worth
preserving or something?

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.320
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: You
know, I don't think I need

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.620
to read a poem to know that.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.920
You know? But like,
but the feeling

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.510
that nature is worth preserving,
OK, that's different.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.520
Like, that's a feeling
that that's kind of cool

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.910
if I read the poem and it
makes me feel that way.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.490
OK, that's a whole different
-- or if it could make,

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.360
if I could feel like death
is, you know, brought closer

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.580
to that fear of death
in some interesting way.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.540
I mean, that's useful.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.840
You know, for me.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What goes wrong?

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.270
Because all of us begin life --
I think this is largely true --

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.940
reading and loving poems, right?

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.730
As children people read to us
and they're mostly poems --

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: For
a couple years.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.630
And we like them.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:47.930
And then it drifts
away pretty fast.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.230
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: By high school

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.140
and college we're not reading
collections of poems anymore.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.060
Most of us never go back.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.350
Why?

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.830
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Well,
I wrote about this a lot

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.130
in the book and then cut it

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.160
out because I'm actually
not a historian of education

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.860
and I don't really
know the answer.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But
you think you know.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.460
[Laughter]

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.760
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Well,
I have some ideas about it

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.150
but I don't -- and I actually
read a lot of textbooks.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:19.210
I don't know how many of you all
-- this book by Cleanth Brooks

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.110
and Robert Penn Warren
called Understanding Poetry.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.520
Are you familiar with this book?

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.220
It sold like five
million copies.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.940
It's the most popular
poetry textbook.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.240
I'm sure there are
people in this room

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.540
who had it in high school.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.140
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: There's
absolutely no way there isn't.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.110
But anyway I read this book
and then I wrote 15,000 words

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.540
about the problems with
it and then realized

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.370
that this was the most
boring thing [laughing]

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:38.670
for the world to read.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:39.970
[Laughter] So I cut
the whole thing out.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.410
In the book I did say these
textbooks are problematic,

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:42.710
trust me.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.010
[ Laughter ]

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.730
And like, and so -- but yeah,
I think they replicate a lot

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.340
of the problems that
I'm talking about there.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.100
And plus no one likes to be --

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.270
I mean, who wants to
be made to feel stupid?

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.390
You know, I mean,
that's another problem

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.760
with the way poems are taught.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.360
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: It's
like people don't get asked.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.820
You know, there's a way to talk
about them that pushes people

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.120
to read more deeply

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.700
and carefully that's
more respectful.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Of their -- ?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.300
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah!

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.600
Or just like, what
do we think about it?

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.900
I mean, there's nothing more
exciting in a classroom for me

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.140
than dealing with this little
square area of the text.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.740
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And
kind of digging into it

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.670
and figuring out, OK, what's
the poet actually saying,

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:19.970
and what's the next thing?

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.750
And why do you think they
went from here to there?

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.880
That's so exciting and
it's this collective kind

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.520
of exploration of the poem.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.570
It's such an amazing experience.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.130
But I've also seen poems taught
in this way where it's like,

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.610
well, what does it mean?

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.340
And if you don't figure
out the big secret

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.020
and repeat it then you're
wrong and you're made

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.320
to feel stupid or whatever.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.160
And that's not a good feeling.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.590
And I think that
people don't like that.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.780
So -- and they transfer
that resentment to poetry.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, I agree.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.380
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: So
that's one thing that happen

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.850
but probably other things
happen too, you know.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You said

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.450
when you were young you
had the vague impression

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.750
that poets used poetic
language and techniques

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.530
to express important thoughts
or ideas in a more beautiful

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.550
or complex or compressed
way than prose.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.850
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.150
I think I thought
that's what poems were.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.450
I mean, if you would have
asked me I would have said,

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.360
yeah, it's just wisdom.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.480
It's wisdom in pretty
language, I guess, you know?

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.530
So what does poetry do
better and specifically

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.830
than other forms of literature?

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.710
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] That's what a lot

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.490
of the book tries to,
you know, account for.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.360
I think one thing it does is
that it takes the material

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.290
of language that we're
all so familiar with

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:31.160
and it doesn't submit
to any need

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.540
that we usually have
for language.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.090
We usually have the
need for language

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.220
to communicate information
like I'm doing right now.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mmhmm.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.820
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Or
to give us information

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.070
that we really need or to
convince us of something.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.670
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Or to whatever.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.080
Poems are -- I think
they liberate themselves

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.650
from all those obligations
and explore what the material

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.340
of language itself
can do when it's freed

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.830
from those obligations.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.800
If I were going to define a
poem, that's what I would say.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.120
So but that doesn't mean

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.370
that poems don't
communicate information.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:05.970
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Or
convince or tell stories.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.270
They do, of course.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.640
I mean, you can see that
in the poems that I read.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.940
They sometimes do it.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.540
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: But it just
means they only do it as long

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.230
as they feel like it and
then they do something else.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.840
There's this famous -- I'm
sure you know this principle

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.470
of Chekhov's Gun.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.530
You know, this idea in
playwriting or fiction writing.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.690
Like if the gun is on the wall
in the first act then it has

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.590
to go off by the
end of the play.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.700
Well, poets don't
care about that stuff.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.920
[Laughter] The gun doesn't
have to go off in a poem.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.640
Like, we don't live
by those rules.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.900
We only do what's beautiful.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.800
And if it's beautiful to mention
the gun and never say anything

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.390
about a gun that's
what we're going to do.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.750
And if you want your plot
you can go somewhere else.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.050
You know?

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: [Laughing] In
one of your poems you write,

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:50.200
"I'm thinking about the hidden
reasons I love something small."

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.170
[Matthew Zapruder laughing]
This seems like a great line

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.750
about what a poem can do,
to think deeply and clearly

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.160
and cleverly about
something small we might not

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.490
consider otherwise.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.750
In another poem you refer to
your father playing the guitar

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.730
and communicating many
contradictory things.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Which also
seems like you were talking

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.630
about what a poem can do.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.930
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:12.230
And I mean, that poem, you know,
it's like I'm thinking back

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.950
to my dad and that mystery of
another person that you're close

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.230
to but like suddenly
you see them as if

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.530
from a great distance.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:21.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mmhmm.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.130
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Like
all the things you don't know

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.430
about them, especially a parent.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: You
know, you have those moments

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.330
where you're like, god, I
don't know my parents at all.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.630
Like, I have no idea
who they are.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.000
They're these people who
have these whole lives

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.820
that -- so that thing.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.640
And I guess maybe the
contradictory nature of that,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.050
of their feelings that might be.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.240
I want you to read a
poem called Pocket.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.540
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.560
Sure. These are all
really good questions.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.010
I want to ask you questions.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.310
[ Laughter ]

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.260
It might happen.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.110
Pocket.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because I wonder
if a poem is like a pocket.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.350
That's what I'm going to
ask you when we're done.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.680
[ Audience Giggling ]

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.980
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.650
[Laughing] Well, I think that
is maybe sort of the kind of --

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:05.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Point
of the poem?

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.250
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Not
the point of the poem

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.550
but the sort of like the --

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:09.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The secret!

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.150
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
It's a secret meeting!

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.450
[Laughing] If you can pass

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.210
on the test you can get an
A. [Laughter] OK, Pocket.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.030
I like the word pocket.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.790
It sounds a little
safely dangerous,

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.670
like knowing you once
bought a headlamp

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.310
in case the lights go
out in a catastrophe.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.860
You will put it on your head and
your hands will still be free.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.570
Or standing in a forest
and staring at a picture

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:33.840
in a plant book while eating
scary-looking wildflowers.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.100
Saying "pocket" makes me feel
potentially but not yet busy.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.790
I'm getting ready to
have important thoughts.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.000
I'm thinking about my pocket

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.770
which has its own
particular geology.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.550
Maybe you know what I mean.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.050
I mean, I basically
know what's in there

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.160
and can basically
list the items,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.120
but also there are little
bits and pieces made of stuff

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.260
that might not even have a name.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.490
[Ron Charles chuckling] Only a
scientist could figure it out.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.850
And why would a scientist
do that?

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.820
[Laughter] He or she should
be curing brain diseases

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.510
or making sure that
asteroid doesn't hit us.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.640
Look out, scientists!

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.120
Today the unemployment
rate is 9.4%.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.360
I have no idea what that means.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.300
I tried to think about it harder
for a while, then tried standing

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.420
in an actual stance of mystery

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.270
and not knowing toward the
world, which is my job,

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.480
as is staring at the backyard

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.350
and for one second believing
I am actually rising away

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.850
from myself which
is maybe what I have

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.010
in common right now with you.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:40.140
And now I'm placing my hand
on this very dusty table

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.730
and brushing away the dust.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:45.760
And now I'm looking away and
thinking for the last time

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.430
about my pocket but this time
I'm thinking about its darkness,

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.490
like the bottom of the
sea but without the blind,

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:58.420
fluorescent creatures floating
in a circle around the black box

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.210
which along with tremendous
thunder and huge shards of metal

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.530
from the airplane sank
down and settled here

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.950
where it rests, cheerfully
beeping.

[ Laughter ]

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:19.010

immoral to end, like, just --

[ Laughter ]

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.660

&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] I don't know!

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.690
Just like -- it just, like,
imagining that huge plane crash.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.920
It doesn't even mention all the
people that died and, you know,

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.040
it's like just interested in
the beep of the black box.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.350
It's really -- yeah,
it's terrible.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's terrible?

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:35.950
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah,
Richard Hugo is the poet who,

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:41.440
he has this great line where he
says the imagination is a cynic,

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.740
which I think is a great --

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.670
you know, I think there's
a way that, you know,

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.210
artists is like a magpie.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:48.980
Isn't magpie the
bird that just --

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Picks things up?

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.580
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah!

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.880
Like just, like, oh,
that's interesting

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.180
and that's interesting.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.780
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And like,
doesn't really care, you know,

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.080
that much, like, about the
bigger picture somehow --

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.500
that there's some way you have
to be like that a little bit

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.800
when you're making art.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.100
You just have to be interested

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.830
in what's beautiful
on some level.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.110
Like and that just
cracked me up when I read

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.240
that because I was like,
oh god, it's so like --

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.200
I mean, no actual planes
were harmed in the making

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.500
of this poem [laughter].

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.800
But like I mean, still.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.100
It's like a little bit, you
know, like [laughing] --

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: [Laughing]
That's such a humble image

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.530
when you talk about, basically
I know what's in there.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.830
I can even list the items.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.250
But it's also other bits
and pieces made of stuff

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.550
that might not even have a name.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.890
I mean, it strikes me as a
metaphor of the poem itself.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.190
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That you know
basically what's in the poem

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:32.790
but you don't know
everything that's in the poem.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.090
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] Yeah.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The poet
doesn't entirely understand his

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.690
own creation.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:37.990
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.290
Well, that's true.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.590
That's for sure true.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.890
I mean, I don't think -- I think
that's when it gets exciting

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.190
when it starts to get a little
bit out of your control.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.800
Rob and I were talking about
this downstairs a little bit.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.650
But when you feel the poem
start to escape your control.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.210
You know? And then if you've
done it for a while you can sort

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.560
of let it go farther and farther

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.260
and let it still
maintain some kind of --

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.350
you know, there's
probably some analogy

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.180
with other different
human behaviors here.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.680
But like, you know, like you can
kind of let it go more and more

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.530
and still keep it together.

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:06.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.130
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And
how far you can let it go.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.430
And so keeping it
together is exciting.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:10.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But you
know there are parts

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.480
of the poem whose implications
you are not controlling.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.780
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: I think

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.580
that that's the point
of the poems for me.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.220
That's why I write them
because I want the poem

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.740
to provide a space for
those moments to exist --

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.260
when I don't understand
what's going on.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.660
You know, I need that.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.020
I don't mean to understand
like in a semantic way.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.620
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: I mean, I
understand what the words mean.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.220
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: But why
they feel significant to me.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.820
Toward the end of
your book, Why Poetry,

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.120
you talk about the danger
of trying to use poetry

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.380
for overtly political purposes.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:45.920
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Yeah, I mean, well -- and?

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.220
[Laughter]

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And --

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.820
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Stalling.

[ Laughter ]

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We have seen
since the election a lot

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.270
of very overtly political
poetry.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:34:00.870
Some of it is obvious and bad.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.520
Some of it is very
emotionally powerful.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.820
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
is the dividing line

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.770
between when it works
and when it's just kind

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.230
of everybody preaching
to the choir

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:11.950
about how horrible
such-and-such is?

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:13.250
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Rob

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.550
and I have a very ongoing
conversation about this.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.220
I mean, first of all,
I think when I said

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.040
that it was horrible,
I think my point was is

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.940
that political material is
difficult to manage in a poem.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.960
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Because
it can swamp other things.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.450
I think that was sort
of what my point was.

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:33.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
it becomes obvious.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.090
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Right.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.560
I mean, for me obviousness
isn't such a problem.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.160
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Like, I don't mind

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.460
if things are obvious,
actually, and really direct.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.400
It's more that that
becomes ugly.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.640
And again, I mean, it's
not that I want everything

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.160
to be fancy language
or beautiful

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.400
but it's somehow lifeless.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.420
And so it has no movement
and it doesn't move.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.230
It isn't alive for me.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.830
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And I think

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.490
that when the poem just
becomes just this inert thing

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.080
on the page of mutual
agreement --

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.680
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
I think part of -- OK.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.240
Do you want to really know
what I think the problem is?

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.830
I think the problem is that in
a lot of these political poems

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:14.360
that I've read that aren't
good, they start from a place

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.760
of certainty and they don't --

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.340
that in and of itself
isn't a problem.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.060
That could be fine.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.600
But they don't change.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.960
They're just reiterations of the
same idea over and over again

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.310
until you get to the end and
they are just, there's no --

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:31.610
they're static, basically.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:32.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.210
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Like,
that's more the issue

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.510
that I have with them,
like that they --

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:38.110
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: So
it's not the certainty.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.410
It's not the subject matter.

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:40.710
It's not the passion
or commitment.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.010
In fact, those things can
be really great in art.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:43.850
It's that they don't move.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.670
You know, they're lifeless.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.100
I don't know.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.400
That's what I think.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I want you
to read the poem, Canada.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.850
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah,
speaking of political poems.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.800
It's a good political
poem [laughing].

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.610
Yeah.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.190
I think this poem --

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:00.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
one of my favorites.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:01.650
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Oh.

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:02.950
[Laughter] Thanks.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Are you about
to say how you don't like it?

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.550
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: No, no, no.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.850
I was going to say that I think
I wrote this during the --

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:08.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Or you got it
off the back of cereal boxes?

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:09.450
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] Yeah, yeah.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.750
No, no, no.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:12.050
This is all me.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:16.270
It's written during the
George W.'s presidency

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:17.610
and I think there
was a lot of talk

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:18.910
at the time about, you know --

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Going to Canada?

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.510
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: We
should all go to Canada

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.810
or Canada is so great.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.110
Canada has a health care system.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.010
You know, so I was feeling a
little resentful of Canada.

Canada. By Canada I have
always been fascinated.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.670
All that snow and acquiescing.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.320
All that emptiness.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.080
All those butterflies
marshaled into an army of peace.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.750
Moving north away from
me, Canada has no border.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.420
Away like the state,

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.250
its northern border
withers into the Skydome.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.290
In a world full of mistrust
and self-medication,

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.430
I've always hated Canada.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.330
It makes me feel like
I'm shouting at child

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.990
for letting a handful of pine
needles run through his fist.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:05.050
Canada gets along with everyone
while I hang a dark cloud

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.830
above the schoolyard.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:10.710
I know we need war, all the
skirmishes to keep our borders

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:15.370
where we've placed them, all the
migration, all the difference.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:19.260
Just like Canada, the
Dalai Lama is now in Canada

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.370
and everyone is fascinated.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:25.130
When they come to visit me,
no one ever leaves me saying,

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.050
"The most touching thing
about him is he's so human."

so many positive
ideas regardless

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.650
of the consequences expressed."

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.840

drink a case of you."

every inch of thousands of roads

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.880
through me to raise awareness
for my struggle for autonomy.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.570
I have pity but no respect for
others, which is not compassion,

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:55.720
just ordinary love based on
attitudes towards myself.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.350
I wonder how long I can endure.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.870

are falling.

"maybe" to the white-tailed
deer of sadness.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.440
And it's clear that whole
country does not exist

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.430

like a candelabra hanging

was a very witty poem

and it does what you were
just talking about --

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:42.110
the way it challenges certainty,
disrupts our certainty,

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:45.400
disrupts path, political
attitudes and ideas

tell you're the first poetry

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.630
editor -- or at least, we've had
other poets who edited things

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:57.930

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.870
who actually does
this professionally.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:04.070
And I'd say the idea of editing
a poem just sounds completely

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.410
mysterious to me.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:07.300
I mean, I edit all day
long and, you know,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.020
I take people's reviews
of books and I, you know,

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.810
just make them smoother
or clearer or try

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.110
to bring out their voice.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.690
But it seems to me that
any editing you would do

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.700
to a poem would be
real violence to it.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.210
So how do you do that?

appropriate to make

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.580

Be good to -- you know.

Because the particular
choice of the words is

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:39.130
so intimately related to
the effect of the poem

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.380
that you can't just say, "well,
you can't say candelabra there.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.490

candleholder or something?"

it's like because those.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.330
But there are -- when
somebody writes a book

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.080
of poems, you know.

looking at a group of work.

&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:58.870
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: So there's
conversations you can have

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.580
about, well in this poem you --

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:06.690
you can compare this poem to
the other poem and say, "see,

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.880
in this one you do such a good
job of this, this, and this,

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.820
but here you lose
focus in this line."

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:15.310
Or you just, this is a
little confusing or you seem

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:18.520
to miss what you're
getting at here.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.350
Can you go back and clarify?

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:21.650
Can you make it better
or whatever?

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:22.950
Like that.

when you write poems is

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.450
that you get lost.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.750
You know, you don't know what
you're doing anymore and they go

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.050
through so many different
revisions and there's

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.350
so many different things.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.670
And so you can forget that in
earlier drafts it was totally

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.900
obvious that you were
sitting in a restaurant

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.010
but it's not obvious anymore.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.310
You forgot.

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:45.130
So just you know it because
you're writing the poem

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.850
but you forgot to mention
it so you're in the poem

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.860
and you're like, where is this
happening and they're like,

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.160
oh, it's in a restaurant.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.460
And you're like, well,
you don't say that.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.760
Well, nobody's going
to know that.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.060
They're like, right.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.360
Maybe I should call
this, In the Restaurant.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.660
That would help.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:57.960
[Laughter] Stuff like that.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.260
Yeah. You know.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.560
So it's things like that.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.700
Or also just sometimes, a
lot of times poets will go

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.790
on a bit long in their poems.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.460
Or take a bit of
time to get started.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.260
And so you can say, you know
-- I mean, it's very annoying.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.760
Anybody who's been in a poetry
workshop knows this is the most

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.060
annoying thing anybody can --

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.840
one of the top 80 annoying
things people can say about it:

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.450
"I think the poem
really starts here."

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.750
Or "It should end up here."

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.110
But that is actually
true sometimes.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:24.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's certainly
common of the stuff I edit.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.730
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Right.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We often see
the lede really is several

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:28.330
paragraphs down.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:29.630
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Right.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.930
So the same thing with poems!

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's
a lot of coat-carrying.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:33.530
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: I always
say it's like the Flintstones.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.830
You remember the
Flintstones and like

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.130
where he does the
thing with his feet?

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:37.430
He's in the car and
then the car goes?

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: It's like
that with poems sometimes.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.330
Like there's a little bit
of this and then, schwoom!

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:43.650
So yeah. And you know, you
can just say to the person,

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:44.960
like, "Hey, it's up to you.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.840
I'm not going to
tell you what to do.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.050
But, like, just put your
finger over the first, like,

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:50.600
three lines of this
poem and just see that,

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.900
what that looks like."

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.790
You know? And sometimes,
especially they'll trust me

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.500
because I will have
read a lot of their work

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.440
and I know what I'm
talking about.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.540
So if I suggest it then
they might actually --

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.840
I might just go home
and sit with it.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.630
You know, see what
I see with this.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:06.680
And also with books of poems
poets often don't realize

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.040
that there's a couple
that just aren't as good.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.640
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: So
you're like, you know,

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.940
you should take these out.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.240
They're just not as good.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Or one is really
a revision of another poem.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.840
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
That happens a lot too.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.440
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And the
interesting thing about that is

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.740
that sometimes individually
they can be great

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.400
but when you put them in the
book you realize they're kind

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.700
of the same poem twice.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.300
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And
they might have been fine

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.600
when they were separate.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.200
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.500
But together they
can't both be there

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.800
because they're basically
the same thing.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.100
So it's like you've
got to make a choice.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.700
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Sophie's Choice.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In one
of your poems you write,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.300
"I'm at my desk pushing against
one word feeling its hinge creak

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.770
like wind would a gate if it
could feel anything at all."

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:45.550
That is a great description of
writing or editing, I think.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:46.850
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Hmm.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That
just pushing on one word.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.540
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Right.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Seeing
what it can take.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.140
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
it opens up.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.740
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.040
I mean, I don't know if prose
writers do the same thing.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.340
Is that that they do the
same thing like that?

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
good ones, yeah.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.570
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Like even
with a single word like that?

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:01.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.170
Yeah.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.470
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:05.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You frequently
write about sleep in your poems.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.070
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] Yeah.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And I've
read all your poems in a row.

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.670
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Did it make you sleepy?

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.970
[Laughing]

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, not at all.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.570
[ Laughter ]

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:14.870
But it -- [Laughter]
I'm sure you've never.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.950
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Read them all in a row?

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:18.250
No.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: All in a row.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:20.850
Have you?

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:22.150
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: No.

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:24.750
So it gave me a perspective
that I think is somewhat unusual

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.110
and sleep is a recurring
theme in your work.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:28.500
Why is that?

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.800
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Hmm.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.890
Well, more recently it was
a recurring theme in my work

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:33.210
because I have a young
child [laughter].

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:38.280
But I think I've always loved
the surrealists and I think

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.970
that their whole idea
that the dream space

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.210
and the liminal space
between waking and sleeping --

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:46.810
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And
the movement from waking

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.150
into sleeping and
that transition,

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:50.790
what starts to happen
to your mind.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:53.640
Like that's intimately
connected with the experience

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.160
of both writing and reading
poetry so I think I'm interested

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.410
in -- but you know, I also
joked about Keats earlier

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:03.600
but Keats is my favorite poet
and you know for him sleep

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.970
and death were so
closely aligned too.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:10.380
You know, so I think that's
probably part of it also.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.420
Yeah. No, I would say that's
true for my experience as well.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.720
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
But the honest answer

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.160
to your question is I
don't really know why.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There
are several poems

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.760
that begin waking up.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.060
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Or
falling asleep

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.660
in that transitional,
liminal moment there.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.960
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Right.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Where you
seem to be saying something

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.560
about getting away from their
conscious mind, getting away

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.110
from your own anxieties
to something freer?

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.210
Or more mysterious to yourself?

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:33.510
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.810
Or an associative space.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:37.420
Like a space where you can
connect ideas that, you know,

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.760
you wouldn't connect
necessarily if you were busy

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.620
in your conscious, like
trying to function.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.220
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
And do things.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.520
You know, you have to be logical
and keep your act together.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.960
But like once that starts to
slip a little bit there's a lot

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.960
of truth that can be found
in that type of thinking.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.870
And that's the thinking
of poetry for me.

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:57.470
Without opium.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:58.770
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Without opium.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.120
It's totally opium-free,
these books of poems.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.720
Because that's a
dead end, by the way.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.180
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
That is what I've heard.

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.330
[ Laughter ]

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.190
But I'm just going to
trust you on that one.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I want you to
read the Poem Without Intimacy.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.840
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Uh-huh.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.650
Yeah. This is going
to prove your thesis.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:19.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.190
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Poem Without Intimacy.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:27.480
The other day I was shopping
in one of those giant,

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.120
incredibly brightly-lit
stores you can apparently see

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.890
from space, wheeling a
massive, empty cart thinking,

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:39.320
"This is a lot like
thinking, 'why do I go

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.290
to sleep not having
brushed my teeth?'

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:47.170
and dream of the giant failure
known as high school again?"

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:49.760
On the loudspeaker
was a familiar song

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.710
by Quicksilver Messenger
Service.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:56.090
There were no lyrics
but I remember it says,

00:46:56.090 --> 00:47:00.420
"We are all skyscrapers
under one blue rectangle

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:05.900
that never chose us to be these
sentinels who imperceptibly sway

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:11.390
and watch people far below like
tiny devices no one controls,

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:16.010
enter our various sunlit
glass conversations."

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:21.240
The world is old and full as
it always will be of commerce

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.490
and its hopeful nonprofit
mitigations.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:28.670
Future products from the Amazon
will cure ailments we have

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:31.610
and also ones not yet invented.

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:36.060
Looking down I saw my cart
was full of a few boxes

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.620
of some cereal I do not
recognize, four flashlights,

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:45.140
and a pink plastic water bottle
made of some kind of vegetable

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.880
that will eventually like me

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.390
into the earth harmlessly
decompose.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:54.820
And then I passed an entire row
of plastic flowers and wanted

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.690
to be the sort of person
who bought them all

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:01.030
but really I am a
runway covered in grass

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.120
and all I truly love is sleep.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:08.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:10.650
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
I wrote that poem

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:16.230
for Juan Felipe Herrera,
the former Poet Laureate.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:17.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mmhmm.

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.510
The most striking
strategy in your poems

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:24.690
that I observed is this sudden
shift from very ordinary details

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:28.940
to something very profound
without any warning at all.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.170
You see it in this poem all
the time moving from the things

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:35.150
in this, you know, the shopping
cart to some much larger idea.

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:37.940
How conscious is that?

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:46.430
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: I think
not very but I just think that I

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:49.760
like -- I think that's how
people think in general.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mmhmm.

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:53.150
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: I think if
you were to just somehow be able

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:56.630
to see into someone's mind I
think you would see them rapidly

00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:01.310
moving between, you know,
mundane thoughts or observations

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:05.370
or visual impressions
and big thoughts.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:06.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:07.970
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: You know?

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:10.260
Or just scary thoughts or
some kind of, you know,

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.140
emotional impressions
or something.

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.200
I think that's kind of how
people -- and for me the poem,

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:19.800
like, replicates and attempts
to, like, implicate the reader

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.170
in that process so that
we can experience it

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.370
in a more conscious way.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:28.140
And like, yeah.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:32.560
I compare it in the Why
Poetry book to lucid dreaming

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.400
which I've never been
able to actually achieve.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.590
Apparently there are some people
who can wake up in their dream.

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.130
There are probably people
in this room who can do it.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:39.430
Can you do it?

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:40.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, but
I've read about it too.

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:42.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:43.330
You can wake up in your
dream and move around and fly

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:44.630
and everything on purpose.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:45.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.230
Yeah.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:48.530
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: But like
poems are kind of like that.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:49.830
They're, you know -- I
mean, or they can be.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:51.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.430
You have a poem called
White Castle

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:53.730
where you describe thinking
major feelings such as longing

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.600
for purpose while eating
little square hamburgers

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.770
with dots in them [laughing].

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:59.070
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Yeah [laughing].

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:00.370
Yeah.

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:01.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Watching
dragonflies mate.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.610
Yeah. It's often charming
and funny the way you move

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:04.910
between those two things.

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.480
Read a poem called
Erstwhile Harbinger Auspices.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.780
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.180
That's the first poem
about the -- yeah.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:12.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
a tough title, too.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.780
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: yeah.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.470
Well, do you want to hear
a story about this one?

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:16.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:18.070
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Do you guys

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:19.370
like hearing the
stories or is it like --

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:20.670
[ "Yes" From Audience ]

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:21.970
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: OK.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:23.270
Well [chuckling], if you insist.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.570
[Laughter] This poem --

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:27.390
I had gone to a party
with a bunch of writers.

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:30.950
I'd just moved to San
Francisco and I didn't know them

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.660
but it was like the first,
like, fancy writer part

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:33.960
that I'd been invited to.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.670
So I felt it was high stakes.

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:40.240
And somebody used
the word erstwhile,

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.210
or I think I used
the word erstwhile

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.720
and someone corrected
me and my usage of it.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mmm.

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.320
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: I know.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.230
And I was this -- I took umbrage
and defended my usage of it

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.130
but because everybody has
phones now they can look

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:52.430
up what it meant.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.180
It turned out I was not
correct in my use of erstwhile.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.340
[ Laughter ]

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.790
Which I thought --
well, whatever.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:01.110
It means it was a long
time ago that it happened

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:02.700
but I did not use it that way.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.350
I thought it meant it
was continuing to happen.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:06.520
It just -- I was
wrong, basically.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.440
Must we go into it again?

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.480
[Laughter] But anyway, and
so then I started thinking

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.620
about other words
whose name that I use

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.220
that I don't actually
know what they mean

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.650
or I am incorrect [laughter]
and then I just kind

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.060
of constructed the
title of the poem

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.360
out of three of those words.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:24.010
So the title is called
Erstwhile Harbinger Auspices.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:25.640
[ Laughter ]

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.750
Erstwhile means long time gone.

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:32.890
A harbinger is sent before to
help and also a sign of things

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:37.200
to come, like this blue
stapler I bought at Staples.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.740
[Laughter] Did you --
[laughing] it's hard

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.190
when someone's laughing
next to you.

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:43.940
It's great, actually.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.160
[Laughing] Like this blue
stapler I bought at Staples.

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.260
Did you know in ancient Rome
priests called augers studied

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.760
the future by carefully watching
whether birds were flying

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:57.680
together or alone,
making what honking

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.540
or beeping noises
in what directions?

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.730
It was called the auspices.

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:05.780
The air was thus a
huge announcement.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.220
Today it's completely
transparent of [inaudible].

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.160
Inside it, a flower is flower.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.690
Thus, a little death sent.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.530
I have no master but always
wonder what is making my

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.190
master sad?

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:22.310
Maybe I do not know him.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:25.440
This morning I made extra
coffee for the beloved

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.020
and covered the cup
with a saucer.

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:31.820
Skeleton, I thought,
and stay very still.

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.970
Whatever it was will
soon pass by and be gone.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You know, the
juxtaposition of the ordinary

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.790
and the profound is
funny in that poem.

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:46.090
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:47.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And creates
a kind of tension and mystery

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:49.300
that keeps drawing us through.

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.710
So many of your poems,
the words are quite clear

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:59.630
and we all know the words, but
the sense of them escapes us.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:01.200
In a poem like that,
for instance.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.030
By the end you've taken us
somewhere very, very different.

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:05.650
It's become very
intimate suddenly.

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:06.950
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Take
us through that poem.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.270
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah,
well as I mentioned before,

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:17.360
the structure of it is just
kind of examining those works.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.360
I mean, it's almost
crude, the structure of it,

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.910
because just sort
of define the words.

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:23.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mmhmm.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:24.510
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: You know,
I just say what they mean,

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:25.810
like in the dictionary.

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:28.230
And then I say it and then I
think, oh what does that suggest

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:31.850
to me or can I -- the blue
stapler I bought at Staples.

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:33.640
I just wrote that and
thought that was funny.

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.080
I mean, that was,
you know, kind of --

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.030
and the idea that that
would be a harbinger.

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:38.890
You know, like that that's
-- because it kind of is.

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:40.700
You're in Staples
and you're like,

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.000
you will buy a stapler
[laughing].

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.070
It seems ordained because
of the name of the store.

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:46.490
[Laughter] But anyway,
but you know.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:48.490
And then I just would
sort of, yeah.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:51.810
Kind of going through what these
words mean but then looking

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:56.060
for things that that suggests --
you know, doorways or pathways

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.360
or whatever like
you were saying.

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.770
So that's really
just how I write.

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.070
I'm just looking.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.200
I'm looking for that other
other place I can go.

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.930
I mean, when I taught
composition, I remember saying

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:08.350
to my students, you know,
the thing is is your papers,

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:09.650
they're just a hallway.

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.390
And you're just sort of
charging down the hallway

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:12.690
as fast as you can go.

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:13.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.290
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
But you're moving,

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:16.590
you're rushing past
all these doors.

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.050
And why don't you stop and,
like, open the door and go in

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:21.240
and see what's in the room
and then go down a little bit

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.540
and see what's in the room?

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.840
Stop. Think.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.140
Think, think, think, think.

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.490
You know? Don't just
go charging through.

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:29.630
And I think that for the
poem's exciting because I

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:32.830
out of the corner of my eye see
a door and I'm going to stop

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:34.130
and open it and go in.

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:35.870
And a lot of the time I go in
and there's something in there.

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:39.020
And then I go back out
and those lines go away.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.320
You know? It's not like that --

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.620
I mean, most of the
time that's true.

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.570
But in the poem it's got this --

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:47.220
the times when there's something
interesting in that room,

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:51.410
you know, then that's so I think
it has this quality of moving

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:53.340
and then stopping
and then digressing

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:56.520
but not losing the forward
momentum totally, you know?

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.120
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And
always the ends surprise me.

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.420
I mean, the ends
always surprise me.

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.720
I don't know where
they're going.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.020
I have no idea where
they're going.

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.880
And then that -- yeah.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.180
And I don't know.

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.810
I just -- the word "skeleton"
just appeared in that poem

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.620
and then I thought, oh
well that's a strange thing

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:12.920
to have happen.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.220
It's a little scary.

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.600
And then maybe if I just wait
a little while I won't feel

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.060
scared anymore.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.360
[Laughing] You know?

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.660
I mean, that's all.

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:20.960
I mean, I don't know
if that's --

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.800
that might either be a very
small thought or a big one.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.400
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Or
somewhere in between.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.700
I don't know.

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Could you
read the poem Prelude?

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.300
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yes.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's a pretty
weighty title to give a poem.

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:32.110
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] Yeah.

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:34.770
Well, I'm an English
professor as Rob mentioned.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:39.030
And you know, but I don't have
a traditional training in --

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:42.320
which just means I've
barely read anything.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:47.780
And so I decided at some point
that should read Wordsworth.

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.560
Because I'm an English professor
it seemed [laughing] like --

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah,
you should.

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.160
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] Yeah.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.730
And so I start reading The
Prelude, which is really good

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.210
by the way -- [Laughter]
and but it's hard.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.610
It's really hard to read it.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:55:59.910
I don't know.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:01.210
Has anybody read
The Prelude in here?

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:02.510
It's hard.

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:03.960
You know? It's -- really, the
language is very complicated.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.360
So you've got to,
like, really grind

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.750
through it or at least I did.

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:10.330
And so over a few days of
trying to read the beginning

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:14.430
of The Prelude, his language
really started to, like,

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:16.230
seep into my own brain.

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:17.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes [laughing].

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:19.040
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: And then
I just decided to write this.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:22.340
I decided, oh I should just
write a poem with the same title

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.230
which kind of takes on
his diction a little bit.

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:27.380
But it was almost involuntary
because after reading it

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.320
for a few days I was just
-- I couldn't stop thinking,

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.480
in these words, were
they in, like,

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:36.720
sentences which sound absurd if
you don't pull them off exactly?

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.150
So and the first line of
this poem is an imitation

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:41.790
of the first line
of The Prelude.

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:44.370
The first line of
Wordsworth's Prelude is, "Oh,

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:46.560
there is blessing in
this gentle breeze."

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.200
That's how his poem begins.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:50.580
So this is The Prelude.

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.010
Oh, this Diet Coke
is really good.

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:54.830
[ Laughter ]

00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:56.530
Though, come to think of it,

00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:00.310
it tastes like nothing
plus the idea of chocolate

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:03.170
or an acquaintance of
chocolate speaking fondly

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:07.000
of certain times it and
chocolate had spoken of nothing.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.520
[Laughter] Or nothing
remembering a field

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.470
in which it once ate the
most wondrous sandwich of ham

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:16.990
and rustic camembert cheese
yet still wished for a piece

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:19.670
of chocolate before
the lone walk back

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.560
through the corn then
the darkening forest

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.320
to the disappointing village

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.790
and its super creepy
bed and breakfast.

00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:30.940
[Laughter] With secret
despair I returned to the city.

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.230
Something seemed to
be waiting for me,

00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:36.150
maybe the chosen guide
Wordsworth wrote.

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:40.040
He would, even were it nothing
better than a wandering cloud,

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.110
have followed, which
of course to me

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.360
and everyone sounds amazing.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.640
All I follow is my own
desire, sometimes to feel,

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.170
sometimes to be at least a
little more than intermitently

00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:54.440
at ease with being loved.

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:58.730
I'm never at ease, not with
hours I can read or walk

00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:02.420
and look at the brightly colored
houses filled with lives,

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:06.030
not with night when I lie
on my back and listen,

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:09.990
not with the hallway,
definitely not with baseball,

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:12.360
definitely not with time.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:16.170
Poor Coleridge, son
of a vicar and a lake.

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:18.340
He could not feel the energy.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:23.180
No present joy, no cheerful
confidence, just love of friends

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:26.240
and the wind taking
his arrow away.

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.850
Come to the edge, the
edge beckons softly.

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:34.180
Take this cup full of darkness
and stay as long as you want

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.480
and maybe a little longer.

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:41.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's such a
clever and provocative response

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:45.620
to Wordsworth and to
that romantic tradition.

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:47.990
It starts off pretty caustic
and sarcastic and funny.

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:50.380
And then it ends in a much more
tender and much more accepting

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.820
and much more personal way.

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:59.000
But there is a lot of your
poems are about nature

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.300
in that romantic tradition.

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.850
You write about nature
all the time.

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:03.150
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:04.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In a way
that is clearly, you know,

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.510
you could draw a
line from Wordsworth

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:07.810
to some of your poems.

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.160
You've got a poem
called Tiburon.

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.460
I want you to read that.

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.380
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: This
is from my first book.

00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:26.500
Tiburon, which is
the name of a town

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:29.960
across the Golden Gate
Bridge from San Francisco.

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:34.230
How sweet to lie just once like
a painter, propped at the top

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:36.170
of that hill on my elbow,

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:39.140
considering the conundrum
of breath.

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:44.500
Grasses blow among my limbs as
if wisdom had been withdrawn

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.960
for safekeeping into the
library of fragments.

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.720
I have no purpose
except to return back

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.160
down towards a eucalyptus
I love.

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.920
Its petals are filled
with the terrible weight

00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.800
of careless reversal,
grief without consequence.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.150
It burns with such ease.

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:07.570
Just to stand there below it
dreaming of union, all trembling

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:10.140
in scent and colors
of the moment,

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:15.210
is like living inside a flower
while making a study of winter.

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:18.070
Blue span that leads
to a gleaming city,

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:20.790
you cannot be crossed
by longing.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And another
one from that collection.

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.220
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Oh.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Called
American Linden.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.820
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mmhmm.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This is the
title poem of the collection.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.220
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: American
Linden, which is a kind

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:44.780
of tree as you probably know.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.500
American Linden.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.920
When you'd like to remember
the notion of days turn

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.620
to the barn asleep on its hill,

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:55.740
a red shoulder holding
the weight of clouds.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.430
You could stand still
for so many moments.

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:01.400
So little is over
and over-required,

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.280
letting the wind
brush your crown,

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.240
the laze of tobacco
swing into autumn.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.200
Swallows already
discuss the winter.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.010
I know you are tired
of imagination.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:16.100
All that clumsily
grasping the sunlight.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.660
Aren't you tired of bodies too?

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:23.290
Whenever it rains they fall from
the sky and darken your window.

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:26.780
Clutching each other they
call out names while you sit

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:31.350
in the circle thrown by a lamp
and pretend they are leaves.

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:34.250
The potatoes cringe
and bury their heads.

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:35.850
Do you see them?

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:38.850
They know where to return
when hoofbeats come.

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:41.730
Like you they were
not born with pride.

01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:44.320
They where born with
skins made of earth.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.610
Their eyes are black and
they sing out of tune,

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:50.100
quietly under the snow.

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:55.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What do
you think of that poem now?

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.250
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Sighs loudly].

01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:59.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Years
after writing it.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.140
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
That's a great --

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.470
that's exactly what I was
thinking when I was reading it.

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:09.480
Like, I mean, I was, you
know, a different person.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.080
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
When I wrote that poem.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It is not
a poem you would write now?

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.780
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
No, but I like it.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.490
It's because it's
I think it's brave.

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.890
I think it's like it like has
a bravery of a young poet,

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:21.190
you know, where I
just say stuff.

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:23.880
And I say these big
pronouncements and then I move

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.100
on to the next thing and
it feels very sincere.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.700
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Actually,

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.000
like super sincere,
which I really like.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.050
And I think it's -- I'm
not a person who goes

01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:33.640
around liking my own poems,
you know, or whatever.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:34.940
But like --

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, we --

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.540
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: But we
just like -- I mean, I kind of,

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.840
I'm surprised that
I like reading

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.590
that in front of
other people now.

01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:43.310
But yeah. I don't know.

01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:47.620
I think it's -- another thing
about it is it is remind me

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:50.620
of eastern and central European
poets who were very influential

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.330
and important to me and
the sort of animation.

01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:55.670
You know, the way that
I animate these --

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:56.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Potatoes?

01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:59.080
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Pototoes and leaves and trees.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.160
You know, whatever that sort
of pantheistic like animating

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:08.500
of the landscape is something
that came to me from this,

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.260
you know, this European
tradition.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.460
It's more than an American one.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:17.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's
no sarcasm in that poem.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.900
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: No.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Really.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.500
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: No.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.800
Yeah.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Again and again
we see trees in your poems.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.400
We see bees.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.700
We see lots of birds.

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.060
How does nature function
in your work, do you think?

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.360
Or how did it?

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.130
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Well,
I mean, that poem I wrote

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:33.770
when I was in graduate school
at Amherst in Massachusetts.

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:35.360
I also was an undergrad
at Amherst too.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.660
So that --

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
a beautiful setting.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.260
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Yeah, and it's old.

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.560
America is very young.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.010
Our civilization of America is
obviously very young compared

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:44.310
to other places.

01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:45.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:46.910
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: I mean,

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.210
the American south is not
young either but the landscape

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:50.140
of that -- that feels like
an old part of America to me.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.740
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Compared to some other places.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.540
And so I felt the history
in that place a lot.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.900
Of the landscape.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:01.250
And so I think that for me
I also am scared of nature.

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:04.500
Like, I'm not a big -- I get
scared when I go out into that.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.770
And you know, like I don't
understand what's going

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:09.070
on a lot of the time.

01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:12.830
And I feel like I didn't
grow up camping or going

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:14.130
for hikes and stuff like that.

01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:15.430
So for me it's a very, like,

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:17.280
weird experience
to do that stuff.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.470
So I'm very aware of, like,

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:23.460
all the way that the
landscape feels alive to me.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:24.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Interesting.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.060
You once told an interviewer,

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.740
"a lot of poets are
terrible readers."

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.040
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] Yeah.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Often
they go on too long

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.640
and they choose the
wrong poems to read.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.940
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Yeah [laughing].

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But
you're a great reader

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.540
of your own poetry [laughing].

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:37.840
I have to say.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.300
Could you quickly close with
a poem that I just love.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.500
I mean, I'm not fitting
it in thematically here.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.840
I just think it's a
great poem to end on.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.200
Called Letter to a Lover.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.500
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Where is that?

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.100
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
That's in here.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There?

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.590
There it is.

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:57.890
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.190
This is a love poem that I wrote

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:00.760
to my wife early in
our relationship.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.570
So and there's actually a --

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:05.920
I have a friend whose
name is Gabe Kahane.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.360
He's a young composer,
a brilliant composer,

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.300
and he did some musical
settings to my poem.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.680
And actually he and this band,

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.440
this chamber orchestra called
Brooklyn Rider did this amazing

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.740
recording of this.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:20.070
And the best recording of
it is on YouTube and they're

01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:21.520
in a hotel room just doing it.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.620
And they're playing and
he sings it and plays it.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh wow.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.220
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: So
if you like the poem,

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.520
you can go see the [inaudible].

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.310
Letter to a Lover.

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:33.050
Today I'm going to pick you
up at the beige airport.

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:36.840
My heart feels like a
field of calves in the sun.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.650
My heart is wired directly

01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:41.960
to the power source
of mediocre songs.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.600
I'm trying to catch a ray
of sunlight in my mouth.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.460
I look forward to showing
you my new furniture.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.430
I look forward to the
telephone ringing.

01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:51.880
It is not you.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:55.250
You are in the kitchen trying
to figure out the coffee maker.

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:58.630
You are pouring out the
contents of your backpack.

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.830
I wonder if you now
have golden fur.

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:05.550
I wonder if your arsenal
of kind remarks is empty.

01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:09.150
I remember when I met you
you were wearing a grey dress

01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:14.160
that was also blue, not
unlike the water plus the sky.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.650
They say it's difficult to
put a leash on a hummingbird.

01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:21.520
So let us be no longer
the actuary of each other.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.140
Let us bow no longer our heads
to the tyranny of numbers.

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:30.460
Hurry off the plane with your
rhinestone covered bag full

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:34.880
of magazines to check up on
the downfall of the stars.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:39.870
I will be waiting for you at
the bottom of the moving stairs.

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
just so lovely.

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:42.470
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
[Laughing] Yeah.

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:43.770
Thanks. And then I
ended up married.

01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:45.220
[ Laughter ]

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I would
marry you [laughing].

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.820
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: So
be careful [laughing].

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.120
I do.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's been such
a pleasure talking to you.

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:51.720
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Thanks, Ron.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank
you so much for coming.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.820
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Thank you so much.

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:58.730
[ Applause ]

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:02.390
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
