MALE SPEAKER: Good
morning everyone.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.862
Welcome to another exciting
Talk at Google event.

00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:13.820
Today, we're extremely
thrilled to have with us

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.096
Patrick Rothfuss, a writer of
things, welcome him to Google.

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:22.856
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.350
MALE SPEAKER: Now, Pat
has written several books

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.540
you may have heard of,
there's this whole Kingkiller

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.390
Chronicles bit, there's "The
Tale of the Princess and Mr.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.997
Whiffle", and we're going
to talk about that today.

00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:37.580
For those of you that are here
in the audience and on YouTube,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.700
I do have one quick forewarning.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.360
We will be covering
spoilers from books one

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.000
and two, mild spoilers.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.840
But if you haven't read
the books, pause right now,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.580
go to the Google Play
store, buy the books,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.550
restart and then join
us in another day or two

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.300
and you'll be all set.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.820
Now, we also will have some
spoilers from the third book,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.090
but that's only if you
take the YouTube video,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.300
reverse it, run it through
the Google Translate mode

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.480
into [INAUDIBLE], and then
watch the hand-gestures,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.990
so that's about it.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.560
And we also have
go/askrothfuss for those of you

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.400
in the audience and want
to ask some questions.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.240
So Pat, I thought we'd start
by talking a little bit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.370
about your writing
process and how

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.630
you come up with
these great ideas.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.420
So, going all the way
back, when you hang out

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.160
with your children, do you
have ongoing narratives

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.320
that you tell them,
stories that you weave?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.230
Do you find seeds
in that that could

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.480
be appropriate for
a broader audience?

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.960
PAT ROTHFUSS: Well, let
me do the first one first.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.240
I do, actually, with my
little boy, my oldest,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.830
I started telling him
stories years ago.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.990
We would sit down, and I would
tell him a little adventure

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.990
story.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.350
And at first, it was just
sort of a story about a boy,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.190
and then it suddenly
it was kind of him,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.490
but sometimes it was not him.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.780
And it would be
centered around whatever

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.040
he was fixated on in the moment.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.000
For a while, skunks were the
coolest possible thing ever,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.590
and so it wasn't just the
story about this little boy,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.010
he was a skunk boy,
so the story had

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.980
better center around his
ability to spray animals

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.770
with this stank, or it would
not be a satisfactory story.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.950
Then he was into lizards,
and of course, the story

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.610
better center around
him changing color

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.190
so that he could defend
himself or scare people away.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.680
Now, do these directly
translate into stuff

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.320
that's good for a fantasy novel?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.170
No, no, not really.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.720
But it actually
goes the other way.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.820
It's because storytelling
is pretty old hat for me,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.260
and that goes all the
way back to any table top

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.970
D&amp;D or any role-playing games.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.490
It's really just
improvisational storytelling.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.365
I have LARPed, which is
real improv storytelling.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.045
It's all similar aspects
of the storytelling craft.

00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:28.420
I've been thinking
about it a lot

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.770
lately, because it's
a ton of fun with him,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.750
and they used to be
little standalone stories,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.640
and then they started getting
connected where he would say,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.130
well he would use
the magic rope.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.470
And I'm like, what
magic rope is that?

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.070
He's like, the magic rope he
found before, and I'm like,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.440
right, OK, yeah, that's
right, there was a magic rope.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.730
And so now, he's having a little
D&amp;D adventure with a continuing

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.730
character that is him kind of.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.890
And I have a lot of
fun with it, and I've

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.220
been thinking of trying
to come up with some way

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.850
that I could bring that
to other people who aren't

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.860
storytellers by their nature,
that's not their craft.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.410
Like a series of cards that
you could use as storytelling

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.790
framework where it's like a
setting card, it's a forest,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.610
it's a castle, it's a
cave, what's in there?

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.210
Well, there's webs, it's
night time, it's raining.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.200
And these things that
could give somebody

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.640
who doesn't do this
for a living a way

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.382
to have a storytelling
experience with their kid.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:43.920
But you know, I
need another project

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.030
right now like I need
a whole in the head,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.331
so I've been pushing off that.

00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:50.080
MALE SPEAKER: I like
what you said, there.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.496
I think there's really a lot
to be said about improvising,

00:04:52.496 --> 00:04:54.080
and them whole
idea of, yes, and,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.780
and continuing with the story.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.820
Now, with that the
origin for Mr. Whiffle

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.450
as well from stories
told to your children

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.540
PAT ROTHFUSS: No, that was
a story that I originally

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.860
told to my girlfriend
back in grad school.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.010
Grad school was a
dark time for me,

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.920
and so we were both living
out in Washington state,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.410
and she was going
to bed earlier,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.230
and I was going to bed later.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.680
And one night she
said, tell me a story.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.290
We had separate bedrooms, and
so I went into her bedroom,

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.630
and she's like, tell me a
story before I go to sleep.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.280
So I said, once
upon a time, there

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.490
was a princess who lived
in a marzipan castle,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.270
starting with the grossest,
most saccharin sort

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.560
of children's story I
could possibly imagine.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.810
And it infuriated me so
much when it came out

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.810
of my own mouth that
twisted it into something

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.379
dark and terrible.

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.920
And then I finished it, and I
thought, that was a good story,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.960
I feel good about that.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.043
And she was laying there
in bed, and she was like,

00:05:56.043 --> 00:05:59.080
now I can't sleep.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.010
And so I'm like, OK, and then
I put a different ending on it

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.830
that was even more
saccharine and awful

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.700
than the first one that
had started to piss me off.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.770
And so then I put
a third one on it

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.390
that was much worse
than the other.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.710
And it was a fun story,
and I told it to somebody

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.390
the next day, and one of
them was an illustrator.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.020
We did a cartoon in the
campus paper, and he said,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.020
I'd love to draw that.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.940
So I took a couple hours
and I scripted it out,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.530
and nothing came of it for five
years until "Name of the Wind"

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.370
was already published, and
then somebody approached me,

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.720
the lovely folks at Subterranean
Press, "Name of the Wind"

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.990
had been out like a week and
a half, and Bill emails me,

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.250
and he's like, so,
what do you want

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.690
to do that you've never
had a chance to do?

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.660
Come do it with us.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.710
And I'm like, I got
a weird kids story,

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.230
and he's like, let's do that.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.810
And if it wasn't
for him it never

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.020
would have seen
the light of day.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.940
MALE SPEAKER: So
marzipan castle,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.100
are there any other fancy
tropes that you particularly

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.740
hate apart from stew and--

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.750
PAT ROTHFUSS: I love stew.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.560
That's Scalzi that has a problem
with stew and fantasy novels.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.730
I hate the feeling of
picking up any book

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.920
and reading it, being excited
about reading a new book,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.760
and feeling like I've
read the book before.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.410
And if you read
a lot of fantasy,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.050
you know what I'm talking about.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.150
And I'm not saying-- I've
done a couple of interviews,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.380
and I end up quoted
kind of out of context.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.950
I think there's one
up on-- it might

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:44.020
have been io9 or something--
where the big pull quote is,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.040
Rothfuss says fantasy has to
move past dragons and goblins.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.600
And I'm like, whoa, whoa,
whoa, that's a little extreme,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.070
it's that we need more than.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.570
It's like if you're
going to do that,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.490
you should do it in a way
that hasn't been done before.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.530
Oh yeah, I think I
took a crack at dwarfs

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.770
an elves with long
bows and stuff,

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.530
so it really looked
like I was either

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.720
taking a pot shot at Martin, or
Tolkien, and that's not true.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.780
Because Martin and Tolkien have
written some really amazing

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.540
stories, but there's a lot
of people who have maybe

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.870
recycled some of those troops
past their sell by date.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.650
MALE SPEAKER: Well even having
a story told in the first-person

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.822
was a pretty good--

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:33.030
PAT ROTHFUSS: Yeah, although
I wasn't the first there

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.850
by any means.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.309
Joan Vinge was writing
brilliant first-person,

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:42.500
Robin Hobb wrote brilliant
first-person fantasy, too.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.630
And honestly, first-person is
the most natural storytelling

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.870
form.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.000
If you are talking to
anybody during lunch today,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.680
you don't say, yesterday, she
was, you say, yesterday, I was,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.660
that's the most natural
storytelling form there is.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.450
But you're right, it doesn't
show up in novels as much.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.150
MALE SPEAKER: Now,
Terry Pratchett,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.430
one of your favorite
authors, well-loved

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.320
among this crowd as
well, he ceremoniously

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.335
deletes every draft copy of
his books and manuscripts

00:09:14.335 --> 00:09:16.050
before they come out.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.170
Do you do the same?

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.820
Is there a university vying
for the Rothfuss papers,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.920
the early drafts?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.730
PAT ROTHFUSS: It
kind of horrified me,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.240
and it broke my heart
a little hearing that.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.240
But I read the same article
where he said, yeah,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.060
he goes, I delete every other
thing after it's published.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.120
He goes, let the
literary analysis

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.130
get real jobs or
something like that.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.330
And that's his right,
it's the equivalent

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.330
of burning your papers.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.580
No, I keep a lot
of my old drafts,

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.700
the computer file with "Name
of the Wind" in it has, like,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.370
600 embedded
comments where I make

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.340
note of what
particular words mean,

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.920
or sometimes it's just,
leave this sentence alone

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.770
because the meter is good
so that if I'm revising it,

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.140
I don't screw up that nice
little piece in there.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.460
Sometimes it's, this is actually
a reference to something that's

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.610
happening in book
three, so if you

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.846
forgot this, Rothfuss,
don't change this either.

00:10:21.846 --> 00:10:24.360
Sometimes one of my beta
readers has given me

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.830
a really funny comment
that I don't want to lose,

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.206
and I'll tuck it in there.

00:10:30.206 --> 00:10:32.610
I get a lot of great
peanut gallery comments

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.900
from my beta readers.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.970
MALE SPEAKER: So, is
there any hope of those

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.370
comments seeing the light of
day or an extended edition,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.320
things that may have
gotten in editing?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.810
PAT ROTHFUSS: There will
never be a director's cut.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.962
This is the director's cut.

00:10:46.962 --> 00:10:50.080
What you have is the
best possible book.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.930
If we cut something,
it's because it really

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.300
shouldn't be in there.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.810
But that said, an
annotated version

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:03.300
for the people who perhaps
enjoy the book beyond all reason

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:03.800
or sense?

00:11:07.609 --> 00:11:09.400
I have a delightful
number of those people,

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.700
I am one of those
people, and you really

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.030
want to know what
this phrase actually

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.910
means, what the
etymology of the words

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.290
is, and a few of
the little jokes.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.020
And it's not giving
anything away,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.420
in the very first pages
of "Name of the Wind"

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.300
when you meet the
troop and they're

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.750
talking about them
setting up, and there's

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:37.060
Marion and his wife who are
doing a string-puppet show.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:43.270
And what would Marion wife,
what would his wife's name be?

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:43.785
What is it?

00:11:43.785 --> 00:11:44.660
AUDIENCE: Marionette.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.390
PAT ROTHFUSS: Marionette, right?

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:46.890
See?

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:52.190
And that's just there for me
and maybe you, if you catch it,

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.910
but the books are full of that.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.220
I wanted to put like
100 things on every page

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.480
so that if you caught
two, you'd be like,

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.450
oh, there's some
cool stuff in here.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.230
And then when you
read it again, there's

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.021
some stuff that you
really can't appreciate

00:12:06.021 --> 00:12:07.880
until you're reading
it the second time

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.970
or until you've read
the second book,

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.580
or until you've
read the third book.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.430
So those things are
waiting for people.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.805
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah
even allusions

00:12:14.805 --> 00:12:17.560
to Dune I found on a repeated
reading, which was cool

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.380
PAT ROTHFUSS: Something
about Dun, really?

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.963
MALE SPEAKER: Sand
worms I don't know.

00:12:20.963 --> 00:12:24.520
PAT ROTHFUSS: Oh,
yeah, there is, yeah.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.860
MALE SPEAKER: So,
another well-known author

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.590
was recently in the
press a few months ago

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.439
about things that she would
have changed in her books.

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:33.980
So now that you have
two of the books

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.810
out, anything that you would
have changed in book one or two

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.869
or maybe done a
little differently?

00:12:39.869 --> 00:12:41.160
PAT ROTHFUSS: Who's the author?

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.210
Oh, right, I know that,
let's not go there.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.880
I made a trigonometry
mistake in the first book,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.580
and it's really embarrassing,
because like anybody

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.990
who knows some basic
trigonometry looks at that

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.410
and they're like, no.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.400
It's in Kvothe's first
admission interview,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.770
and he answers with such
authority that a lot of people

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.400
are like, I guess you're
right, and they move on.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.980
And I did the math
once, but then I

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.380
think I changed the formatting
and I moved the question,

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:20.220
and so he's supposed to
calculate the length of a side

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.200
based on the angles in the other
two sides, and it's just wrong

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.270
and nobody calls him on it.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.860
And that's my mistake,
some people are like, oh,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.992
maybe in the book,
I'm like, no, don't.

00:13:33.992 --> 00:13:35.700
You can cut me a break
with other things,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:41.300
but this was me not
doing the math right.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.720
MALE SPEAKER: And I guess your
works have been translated

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.027
quite extensively as
well, so what sort of hand

00:13:46.027 --> 00:13:46.860
do you have in that?

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.300
Any hidden secrets found from
reading a foreign language

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.630
edition or a favorite cover?

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.880
PAT ROTHFUSS: I'm a
freak, and because there's

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.630
like 1,000 hidden
things in the book,

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.600
it would be really irrational
for me to expect a translator

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.570
to catch those things because
I specifically put them

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.050
in such a way so
that they're hidden.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.087
And so you have
a piece of poetry

00:14:13.087 --> 00:14:14.920
and it seems like it's
about something else,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.050
but there's actually
other things seeded in,

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.510
like little secrets there for
the people who want to delve.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:25.414
I don't want to turn this
into a fricking Sudoku, right?

00:14:25.414 --> 00:14:26.830
That's not the
point of this book.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.538
I want you to be able
to read it and have

00:14:28.538 --> 00:14:30.790
fun, and if that's
all you get, great.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.030
But if you're the person
who likes to delve,

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.720
I want there to be
stuff there for you.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.160
And so that means it's sort of
resting underneath the surface.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.160
And my poor translators,
because I play word games,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.800
and I have puns.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.880
Who's multilingual?

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.110
Have you ever tried
to translate a pun?

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.160
It's a nightmare.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.820
And the books are full of it.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:59.370
Everyone's name means something,
the name mean something,

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.620
and it's a reference
to something in one

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.970
of my created languages.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.120
But in their language,
coat means kitten,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.240
and they're like, how
do I deal with this?

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.280
So I quickly realized
that this was

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.470
going to be a problem
because one of my very

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.920
first translators,
my Dutch translator,

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.900
actually contacted
me and started

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.470
asking me these questions.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.750
And I just started to
sweat cold realizing

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.660
that there was no way
for the translators

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.060
to do their job without a
ton of information from me.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.600
And so I actually
created a forum,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.790
there's a
password-protected forum

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.630
out there that only the
translators-- even editors

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.470
don't get to go in there.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.610
Because I love my editors,
but that's not for you,

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.020
it's for the translators and the
people who just need that info.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.979
There's a lot of things there.

00:15:54.979 --> 00:15:56.770
MALE SPEAKER: So shifting
a little bit more

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.070
towards the books
themselves, I see

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:03.000
that there's a heavy use of
three's throughout your two

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.450
books, and so this is a question
from Josh in the audience,

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.520
so I must ask you
three times, why

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.720
do you use groupings of
threes in your writing?

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.830
PAT ROTHFUSS: OK, how--
isn't there a Schoolhouse

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:23.780
Rock, (SINGING) three,
it's a magic number.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.647
(SPEAKING) The truth is, three
is just mythically significant,

00:16:27.647 --> 00:16:28.980
it's mathematically significant.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.080
If I go on a big
screed about it I'm

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.990
going to look either flaky
or tin foil hat, but it is.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.650
Here's what it is,
three of something

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.680
establishes a pattern.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.260
One, you can't graph from
one point, you all know that.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.920
You can graph from
two points, but you

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.374
shouldn't, that makes a line.

00:17:00.374 --> 00:17:01.790
MALE SPEAKER: Three
makes a plane.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.050
PAT ROTHFUSS: Three makes
plane, more specifically,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.390
three makes a
circle, and a circle

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:12.349
allows you to begin to
center in on a concept.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.130
Is that the reason we find
it mythically significant?

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.869
No, maybe, I don't know.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.160
That's my answer, I don't know.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.980
MALE SPEAKER: And
of course there's

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.188
seven as well so that's nice.

00:17:22.188 --> 00:17:24.150
PAT ROTHFUSS: Sevens
easier, I think, actually,

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.520
that goes back to the
phases of the moon.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.796
If you-- these days,
who sees the moon?

00:17:32.796 --> 00:17:35.210
But-- there's somebody
back there, good,

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.680
you and me, the people who
actually look at the moon--

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:43.394
but if you think of it,
think of the people living

00:17:43.394 --> 00:17:48.000
pre-electric light,
the moon is a big deal.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.650
And it's got a cycle of 28 days,
you have waxing, waning, full,

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.640
each quarter is seven days.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.060
You can take out
all the way back

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.990
like the Earth-mother
of Lascaux and whatever,

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.277
I'm not going to do an
anthropology lecture, here.

00:18:03.277 --> 00:18:04.860
MALE SPEAKER: So,
and also, how do you

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.214
approach the balance of
technology in your world?

00:18:07.214 --> 00:18:09.130
Do you introduce something
like The Bloodless?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.290
How do you keep that from
becoming a deus ex machina that

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.470
just starts an arms race.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.120
PAT ROTHFUSS: You have
to be really careful.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:23.320
And this is a criticism I will
level against some fantasy,

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:31.250
sometimes-- OK, Rowling's
books are well-loved.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.300
But some of the things that
were put in those books

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.700
to serve a very useful
purpose in the book

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.460
were not well considered
in terms of their-- like,

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.860
if this exists, then.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.050
And the biggest, classic version
is the time turner, right?

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:04.600
If something like this exists,
well then, and any rational

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:10.160
person says, but if this, then.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.640
And there's a bunch of
then from the time turner.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.059
It's so big that everyone
butts up against that.

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:19.850
But there's a bunch of
other little things,

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.030
too, that once it's
introduced, this

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.700
should have huge, far-reaching
implications in the world,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.810
and if it doesn't,
what this does

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.930
is it screws up the elaborate
modeling system that we have

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.610
that makes us human.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.340
We've got an incredible
modeling processor, here,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.390
that allows us to set
and solve problems

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.850
without even being aware of it.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.810
It's the thing that
creates the uncanny valley.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.420
If you see a face, and
it's not a right face,

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.710
it freaks out our brains.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.370
But if it's a totally
off face, that's fine,

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.540
but if it's a
slightly wrong face,

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.710
it gives us a severe wiggins.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.720
It's the same thing is
true with our fiction.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.330
If everything is just like
William Burroughs "Naked

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.440
Lunch", crazy, nothing,
nobody ever points

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.610
at something in William
Burroughs and says,

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.060
this is a plot hole,
that's ridiculous.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:24.620
But with a story that's supposed
to cohere, and be rational,

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:30.120
and follow rules, and then
it doesn't, it bugs us.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.620
It really bugs us, and
sometimes in the rush

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.330
to tell a good story,
technology is introduced,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.780
or a piece of magic
is introduced,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.360
and its ramifications
are carefully

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.810
permeated through the society.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.160
And then sometimes authors
go back in later books

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:53.020
and really have to start
to backfill, which is fair,

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.290
and I respect the ones that go,
whoa, I did not anticipate that

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.590
and then they fix it.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.792
But sometimes it's just
like, and I'm moving on,

00:21:01.792 --> 00:21:03.000
I've got a new book to write.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:11.144
I think the difference is
hard fantasy in soft fantasy,

00:21:11.144 --> 00:21:13.060
people talk about hard
sci-fi and soft sci-fi,

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.630
I think there's hard and
soft fantasy as well.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:21.780
Hard fantasy tries its best
to be coherent, and realistic,

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.850
and it all fits together,
and it all makes sense.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.075
Soft fantasy is like,
eh, there's dragons,

00:21:26.075 --> 00:21:28.450
there's a million dragons in
the world, what do they eat?

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.400
A million dragons,
magic, there's

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.120
a lot of hand-waving involved.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.750
I don't write soft fantasy.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.770
MALE SPEAKER: Well, and I
think that you did a good job

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.750
with that, as well, in terms
of the economy of the Four

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.480
Corners, like
Kvothe's tuition bill,

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.350
and just the monetary exchange.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:45.270
PAT ROTHFUSS: I'm a bit
of an economy geek, yeah.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.120
MALE SPEAKER: So,
let's see here,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.570
so, George R.R. Martin
wrote the scenes following

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.020
the red wedding before he
wrote the wedding itself.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.740
When you were writing
the books one, books two,

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.160
what was the last
thing that you wrote?

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.190
Did you skip around?

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.500
Or did you move forward
through the narrative?

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.030
PAT ROTHFUSS: The last thing
that I wrote, I do skip around.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:08.240
I do skip around, when I
was writing the whole thing,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.880
I skipped ahead and wrote
a huge chunk of book three

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:18.150
before I went back and filled
in the gaps, so to speak.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.940
And then when I'm
revising, of course, I'm

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.120
hopping all over the
place and sometimes I

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.510
need to yank out a chapter
for pacing reasons,

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.840
and I need to put something
in here for clarity,

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.017
so no, I'm all over the place.

00:22:29.017 --> 00:22:30.600
MALE SPEAKER: I guess
the latest rumor

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.410
from the internets concerns
a series of short stories,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.380
some origin stories,
some novellas, something

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.800
like [INAUDIBLE] or something
like that, why them?

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.630
Why now?

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.985
Does it help you write
what's yet to come?

00:22:43.985 --> 00:22:46.110
Or is it something that's
always been in your mind?

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:55.260
PAT ROTHFUSS: Well, George
Martin and Gardner Dozois, I

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.570
think-- I don't know how
to pronounce his last name,

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.390
I just see it in print-- were
editing an anthology called,

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.570
Rogues, and they invited me in.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.559
And they invited
me in previously,

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:06.600
and I wasn't able to take
them up on their offer.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.260
They do these
beautiful anthologies,

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.730
they did dangerous women
and star-crossed lovers,

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.820
with big names, and it's really
flattering to be invited.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.730
And I had to pass on
two of them because I

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:22.070
was working on book two and
trying to really get that done.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.650
Then I realized that focusing
exclusively on book two

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.700
really makes me
crazy, and unhappy,

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.910
and does not make
me write faster,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.030
it makes me right slower.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.700
And so when they invited
me into Rogues, I accepted.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.200
And when I was struggling to
write a good story for it,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.710
after failing remarkably
about three times,

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.970
I wrote a Bast story.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.330
I wouldn't say it's
an origin story,

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.210
but it centers around Bast.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:56.290
And so that'll be coming
out in that anthology.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:00.700
And I just found out
that's happening in June.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.150
And I'm a little tingly, there,
because Gaiman's in it as well,

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.970
and he's got, I think,
in this anthology,

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.730
is how the Marquis de
Carabas got his coat back,

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.160
which is, if you've
read Neverwhere,

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.501
I've been waiting to hear
that story for five years.

00:24:17.501 --> 00:24:18.000
Yeah.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.541
MALE SPEAKER: And
that's yet to come.

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:22.010
Do you think that there's
room for a Silmarillion

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.790
or an atlas, things like
that in the Four Corners?

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.890
PAT ROTHFUSS: I
could do an atlas.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.584
And people, a lot of
people who ask me,

00:24:31.584 --> 00:24:33.500
when are you going to
do role-playing game set

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.630
in your world?

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:38.481
What they kind of
mostly want is an atlas.

00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:40.230
And I know a lot of
people who would never

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.720
role-play in the
world would still

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.620
probably buy it and
use it as an atlas.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.550
And I'd love to do that if
I did not have anything else

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.524
going on right now,
which I kind of do.

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:54.690
It would take a lot of work
for me to assemble that,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.670
and I can't outsource that, I'm
the only one that knows so many

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.460
of these things.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.190
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
so Kvothe shortens

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.110
momentous events into a couple
sentences, things like his boat

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.800
ride to the sea, his
trial, how much of that

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.340
is the way he tells stories?

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.880
And how much of that corresponds
to things that you actually

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.930
wrote then but then
decided not to use?

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.990
PAT ROTHFUSS: You know,
this comes up a lot,

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:24.830
and there's a few places in
the book where people are like,

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:29.740
oh, Rothfuss cut this because
the book was too long.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:34.550
Or Rothfuss cut this
because he wanted to cut it.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:39.422
But if I wrote a story and it
left a visible scar like that,

00:25:39.422 --> 00:25:41.830
that would not be
good storytelling.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.180
In the same way, it
would not be good surgery

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.900
if you have a big Frankenstein
scar running down,

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.570
and the two pieces of my head
don't fit together right.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.576
That would be clumsy.

00:25:54.576 --> 00:25:57.180
So, you can assume,
and honestly, people

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.979
assume that I wrote that
and then took it out,

00:25:59.979 --> 00:26:01.020
and it's simply not true.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.630
I didn't write it.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.550
So then, why did I put
something like that

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.290
in implying that
there was a story,

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.650
and then not giving you the
story, therefore, making you

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:17.000
want something that
you're not going to get.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.180
Why would I do that?

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.300
And that's a good question.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.530
MALE SPEAKER: It leaves room
for imagination, I like that.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.260
So here's a question from
Michael here at Google.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.450
He says, at Google,
we sort of implicitly

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.200
stand for the proposition that
making knowledge available

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.480
is good.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.432
In that way, the [? K'thah ?]
scares the crap out of me.

00:26:37.432 --> 00:26:38.890
PAT ROTHFUSS: Oh,
the [? K'theh ?].

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.210
MALE SPEAKER: [? K'theh ?],
that was the follow-up question.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.320
PAT ROTHFUSS: Yeah, it's
a weirdly spelled name.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.340
[? K'theh ?].

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.640
MALE SPEAKER: [? K'theh ?].

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.380
We'll pause on that,
can you offer any solace

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.230
to that dichotomy?

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.950
Is too much knowledge
a bad thing.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.580
PAT ROTHFUSS: Is?

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.210
I won't say is, I won't say too
much knowledge is a bad thing.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.420
I will say that too much
knowledge can be a bad thing.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.920
Yeah, I will absolutely--
and of course,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.126
that's of extraordinarily
simplified stance,

00:27:12.126 --> 00:27:13.750
I'm painting with a
broad brush, there,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.490
but yeah, I would make an
argument for some instances

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.226
where too much knowledge
is a bad thing.

00:27:18.226 --> 00:27:19.476
MALE SPEAKER: All right, cool.

00:27:19.476 --> 00:27:21.350
He also wants to know
if the Lackless box is

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.767
keeping something or
keeping something out.

00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:25.600
PAT ROTHFUSS: That is
also a great question.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.120
MALE SPEAKER: I'm sure it is.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.740
So, why didn't Kvothe ever
make a concerted effort

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.910
to show that Ambrose sent him
into the stacks with a candle?

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.704
Question from Andrew
in the audience.

00:27:37.704 --> 00:27:39.245
PAT ROTHFUSS: That's
a fair question.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.210
You can almost view that from
a simple legal standpoint,

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.570
it's like, he says, she says.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.770
You have two people
who are saying

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.000
different things,
who do you trust?

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.520
MALE SPEAKER: One's a Scriv.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.880
PAT ROTHFUSS: One is
an established student,

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.338
he's been around for a long
time who works at the archives,

00:28:00.338 --> 00:28:02.300
and the other is
some punk kid who's

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.315
already started making
trouble in his first days

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:05.065
at the university.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.480
It sucks, yeah,
but you should not

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.200
mistake your over-arching
narrative perspective

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.160
as something that everyone
possesses both in the book

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.970
and in the real
world, by the way.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:27.010
MALE SPEAKER: So, can you
shed some light on what things

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.756
some other folks may have taken
from the Latantha, the Sword

00:28:29.756 --> 00:28:31.130
Tree, what would
you, personally,

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:32.855
have taken during your trials?

00:28:32.855 --> 00:28:34.730
PAT ROTHFUSS: That's an
interesting question.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.124
Pass.

00:28:40.124 --> 00:28:41.540
I don't have a
good answer for it.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.030
That's the mark of
a good question,

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.100
that I hesitate to
be glib with it.

00:28:50.902 --> 00:28:53.200
But no, I can't get my
head around that quick.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.449
MALE SPEAKER: Well, here's
a follow-up along the lines

00:28:55.449 --> 00:28:59.230
that hopefully you can
answer, do you know Kung Fu?

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.070
You're describing the martial
arts scenes in great detail,

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.980
is there any interest there?

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.980
PAT ROTHFUSS: Actually,
if you go back and look,

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.170
you'll realize that I did not
describe them in great detail.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:13.870
And this is a thing that I
delight in fooling people with.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.210
I met somebody once
at a con ages ago,

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.160
and that was back when things
were a little more relaxed,

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.220
book had only been
out 18 months.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.735
So I got together with some
high school students who

00:29:27.735 --> 00:29:29.590
had contacted me,
and they were like,

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.910
you're coming to Dragon Con,
we should have burritos.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.520
And I'm like, we
should have burritos.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.430
And so we went out,
and we had burritos,

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.680
and we're hanging
out, and he was like,

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.620
my favorite part
is when Kvothe goes

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.180
and he kicks ass on this Scrael.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.620
And he's just all over the
place, and he's just awesome,

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.620
and he's so badass.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:53.590
And I'm like, I'm really
glad you like that scene,

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:57.590
but I didn't write it.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.420
You kind of wrote
that, because you

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.990
see everything that
leads up to it,

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.280
and then there's a
scene break, and then

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.000
you come in at the end of it.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.680
And I'm like, you did that.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.620
Which is great, because
that's how I like to write.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:19.170
I'd like to imply, more than
I exply, that doesn't work.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.680
I like to be implicit
more than explicit.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.840
It takes a lot more work and
it's dangerous in your writing,

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:32.710
because what I want you to infer
is not always what you infer,

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.850
which is why I have this
elaborate beta reader

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.060
process, to check
if my implication is

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.710
having the desired effect.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.720
For the Kung Fu--
you want a secret?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.630
Do you want secret?

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.470
MALE SPEAKER: I think
so, we're here at Google.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.770
PAT ROTHFUSS: If you've ever
read the Princess Bride,

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.860
who's read-- not the
movie-- who's read it?

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.540
Right?

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:59.410
You know when they're
fighting, Inigo Montoya

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.060
is fighting his sword
master, whatever.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.450
And they're going
back and forth,

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.199
and they're saying,
oh, you're using this,

00:31:06.199 --> 00:31:07.820
oh, you're using that.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.590
The sword play is
never described.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.110
And I remember reading
that and thinking,

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.240
this is so exciting,
and so cool.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.440
And I'm not reading eight
brick thick passages of like,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.710
then I parried in Quarte
and the forte of my sword

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.870
touched his whatever dongle.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.680
Because for the people
who get fencing and know

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.970
all the terminology,
that can be really sexy,

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.940
but the slice of
the pie chart is

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.450
very narrow for
those fencing geeks.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:43.570
And in the Princess Bride
what he did is he's like,

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.140
can you imagine what
Benetti's defense might be?

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:47.870
You do that.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:48.460
Is it awesome?

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.140
Yeah, that's so awesome.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.660
Now we're going to
move on, and I'm

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.627
going to give you another
cool-sounding name,

00:31:53.627 --> 00:31:55.210
can you imagine what
that sounds like?

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.710
Yeah, that's awesome,
too, isn't it?

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.370
Let's keep going.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.830
And so you don't need to know
anything about sword play

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:04.250
or anything, and you cannot
be disappointed in the action

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.550
because it's all here.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:10.350
And this is something the books
can do that movies can't, and

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.880
so if you're writing and you
don't take advantage of that,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.130
you're really missing out on one
of the huge potential benefits

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.610
of text over visual imagery.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.520
And so what I do a lot of
times, now, I do occasionally,

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.040
I talk about some elements
of the body or whatever.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.830
But usually I try
to give something

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.910
a very evocative
name, and then I'll

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.850
describe a little bit of the
physicality, but just enough

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.200
to ground it in reality.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.570
And then I give you a
little bit of scaffolding

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:44.612
and you create the rest, so
it's a total team effort.

00:32:44.612 --> 00:32:46.070
MALE SPEAKER: So
Fela's explanation

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.860
of the rival factions of
Master Archivists and Scrivs

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.950
throughout the years, each
organizing their own library

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.930
is great, but Alison,
who wrote this in,

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.420
said that it reminds her of
the bad side of Wikipedia

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.370
or refactoring other
open source products.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:03.840
Did you have a real life analog
in mind when that came through?

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.890
PAT ROTHFUSS: A lot of times I
write something and then people

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.780
email me and they
go, it's so nice

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.580
that somebody who
really understands

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.080
post traumatic stress disorder
has finally written about it.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.370
And I'm like, ah yeah, I suppose
that is post traumatic stress

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.260
disorder, isn't it?

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.530
I'm glad I nailed that.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.400
But really what I
was doing is like,

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.290
if this person was
in this situation,

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.610
what would the realistic
human response be?

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.970
And then I postulate,
and extrapolate,

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.350
and attempt to convey that.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.060
There's some things in
writing that I'm not good

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.550
and I have to struggle with, but
I think that piece is something

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:52.830
that I am very good
at, that extrapolating

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:56.900
from known factors
into the unknown.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:02.220
And so that's how
I did the music.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.580
I love it when people
say, oh finally,

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.100
a musician writing about music.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.940
I've been waiting
for so long, and I'm

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.659
like, ha, ha, ha, I got you.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:16.130
Nothing makes me prouder
than fooling a musician

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.089
into thinking that
I am a musician.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.409
I think I might have had a
third point, but it's gone now.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:29.409
I only got two hours of
sleep last night, sorry.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:31.710
MALE SPEAKER: It's always
important, the sleep.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.585
I wanted to talk a little
bit about the fans,

00:34:33.585 --> 00:34:36.230
and the fan community
that's arisen around you.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.949
You're always really
generous, like you

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.780
said, from going for
burritos, to signing books

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.361
that people will mail you.

00:34:42.361 --> 00:34:44.360
Was that something that
came immediately to you,

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.290
or where you always
this extroverted?

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.580
Did you grow into it?

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.080
PAT ROTHFUSS: I don't know
if I'm actually extroverted.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.630
You can be-- this
is something I've

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.199
been trying to get
a bead on for years,

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.360
now, because I love this.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.041
I love getting
together with people

00:34:59.041 --> 00:35:00.540
that are interested
in books, I love

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:05.720
talking about things, whether it
be writing, or the earth-mother

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:10.690
of Lascaux or anthropology,
or whatever your a geek about.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:14.160
And so I always assumed that
I was kind of an extrovert,

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.700
but it turns out
you can actually

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.910
really enjoy talking
about things like that,

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.310
or being in front
of an audience,

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:24.140
or signing 1,000 books, and
be an introvert as well.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:30.021
So first off I'll say,
introverts I am one of you.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:34.575
Then give me the question again.

00:35:34.575 --> 00:35:36.450
MALE SPEAKER: Was it
something you grew into,

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.627
like managing the fan community.

00:35:38.627 --> 00:35:40.710
PAT ROTHFUSS: Actually,
here I can trace this back

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.810
to its origin.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.910
For one, I am from
the Midwest, and so we

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:53.730
tend to be considerate people,
polite, considerate, people who

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:58.045
will make you a casserole
at the drop of a hat.

00:35:58.045 --> 00:36:00.630
We try to take care of people.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.240
Also, when you start
out as a writer,

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.790
it's not like your book
gets published and then

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.780
here's an 800 person signing,
how do you deal with this?

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.880
No, I got pictures of me
sitting at a table in front

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.080
of a Waldenbooks and
people walking past,

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.020
desperately trying to
avoid eye contact with me.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.700
That's where you start.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.247
And then you get
to the point where

00:36:25.247 --> 00:36:26.830
you're like, 10
people showed up, woo!

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.490
I'm famous!

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:32.900
And then there's this level,
which is just, frankly, weird,

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.250
and I only cope by not
thinking about it too much.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.510
I'm getting to the
point now where

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:47.670
I'm having to reevaluate the
level at which I interact

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:50.990
with people just from the
cruel mathematics of it.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:57.560
When I went to Barcelona, and I
did a signing-- I was in Spain,

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.040
and I did something at Madrid,
and 800 people showed up.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.970
And so they couldn't let
them in, they were lined up

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:08.860
in the street, and then they
couldn't-- there was no dealing

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.490
with them all.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.150
And I would happily
stay all night,

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.770
but I did have stuff to
do in the next morning,

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:18.900
and so when we went to
Barcelona, there like,

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.730
we're worried.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.437
Barcelona's a bigger city,
we're going to get a lot more,

00:37:22.437 --> 00:37:23.770
we're going to get 1,000 people.

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:26.030
I'm like, we won't
get 1,000 people.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:30.184
They're like, we should only
let people bring one book,

00:37:30.184 --> 00:37:32.100
and I'm like, no, no, I
don't want to do that.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.516
If these people are going to
stand in line for five hours,

00:37:34.516 --> 00:37:35.920
I'm going to--

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.740
I let her win that argument,
and 2,000 people showed up.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.020
And then I have to
do this math where

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.170
it's like, now I can't take
pictures with everyone.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.970
We left the burrito
days behind long ago.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:53.710
I can't hang out and have
burritos with everyone, now.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:57.740
But now it's weird, because you
start looking at 2,000 people,

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.367
and you're like, if I can save
three seconds in each of these,

00:38:02.367 --> 00:38:03.950
then the people at
the end of the line

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:07.740
get to go home and
hour and a half early.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.940
And it leads to some
really weird stuff.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:16.810
Like if I don't say, to Maria,
if I just say, Maria, comma,

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:20.330
this actually has an
impact on how long

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.350
the signing is going to take.

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:24.530
And that kind of sucks.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.370
Because I would
love to hang out,

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:30.311
I want to hear your story
about how you found the book,

00:38:30.311 --> 00:38:32.060
or it helped you through
a difficult time,

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.880
or we'll talk about whatever.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.990
And it's getting
to the point where

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.170
I can't do that with
every one, and so I

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.000
don't know how to
do with some people

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.430
without having it
be really unfair.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.170
And I'm still
struggling with that.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:52.950
But I can say I got started,
partly with my own personality,

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.100
being Midwestern, but
just a couple months in, I

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.400
saw Neil Gaiman in action.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.410
He did a reading in assigning
it a little time near where

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:07.890
I was so I watched him
read and answer questions.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.450
And who's seen Neil
Gaiman do his thing?

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.140
He's marvelous.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.730
He's so graceful, and
gentle, and articulate,

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:20.650
and considerate, and I
saw him-- so he was there,

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.800
he gave this little
con a piece of his time

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.180
as a favor to his friend,
took the red eye back

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.610
from the Beowulf
premiere in London

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:32.350
to get there on Saturday,
to do this little con.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.800
And then after doing
his thing, stuck around

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.180
to talk with the new authors
for like an hour and a half,

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:41.580
just goodness of his
heart, man is exhausted.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:45.570
And then after that, he starts
to go home so he can sleep,

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.370
and he gets hijacked, somebody
ambushes him, and says,

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:52.120
oh, Mr. Gaiman, my
brother is a huge fan,

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.840
and he's really trying
to get published,

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.548
and it would really
mean the world to him

00:39:55.548 --> 00:39:58.040
if you could read
his manuscript.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.840
And he says, I wish I could.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.380
If you could email me eight
hours in which to read it,

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.070
I would love to
read it, but they're

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:09.360
just aren't enough hours in
the day, I don't have the time.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.380
And he goes, how about maybe
just a couple of chapter,

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:16.110
he's such huge fan, he's having
such trouble getting started.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:20.580
And Neil says, well, he'd
probably get better response

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.470
from somebody he could
sit down with and have

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.060
a good conversation
with, somebody

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.020
he could sit down
over coffee with.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.700
And the kid wasn't mean,
there was no malice,

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.205
he just didn't get it.

00:40:33.205 --> 00:40:35.410
And he was coming
from a place of love,

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:37.470
trying to help his brother.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.310
And he ran up against
Neil like five times,

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:44.980
and I was watching it, trying
to figure out how I could, no!

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.190
Like, take the bullet
for him or say,

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.470
I'd read your brother's
manuscript, I'm not that busy,

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:53.142
so Neil could run away.

00:40:53.142 --> 00:40:56.880
But I watched Neil do it again
and again, always polite,

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.210
always considerate,
never got tetchy, never

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:05.010
got a little snarky, never
did [SIGH], none of that.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.530
And I thought, if Neil
Gaiman can do this,

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:11.480
and he gets this five times
a day, and he's exhausted,

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.290
there's no reason for
me to ever be anything

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.440
other than gracious
to one of my readers.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.384
And so I made that
decision right there.

00:41:20.384 --> 00:41:22.300
MALE SPEAKER: So going
off the Midwest threads

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.890
that you started weave, is
your writing Midwestern?

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:29.940
Is this a Midwest tale?

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:34.080
PAT ROTHFUSS: I'm not
sure, I don't know.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.870
It could be that some of
it is influenced-- probably

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:37.470
my landscapes.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:45.440
There's a lot of small town,
and the landscape itself

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.240
is usually forested.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.690
Somebody said once, they wrote
in my margins, they said,

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:56.490
I know you try to make your
world not look like our world.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:59.097
Then they said, but I
recognize your trees,

00:41:59.097 --> 00:42:00.430
and I'm like, yeah, that's true.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.257
This is a Wisconsin forest
that he's walking through.

00:42:03.257 --> 00:42:04.590
MALE SPEAKER: And roads as well.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:08.590
So, I wanted to shift the
focus over to Worldbuilders.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:13.164
So, Alison wrote again,
congratulations on the $670,000

00:42:13.164 --> 00:42:15.580
raised for Worldbuilders this
year so that's really great.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:19.220
That's actually the
charity that Pat founded.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.970
She wants to know what the
second best part of running it

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:22.470
is.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.260
PAT ROTHFUSS: The second
best, that's a great question.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.718
MALE SPEAKER:
There's warm fuzzies,

00:42:25.718 --> 00:42:28.020
but what's the second best?

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.460
PAT ROTHFUSS: Honestly,
the second best part of it

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:38.030
is the confirmation of
my longstanding theory

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.740
that people are inherently good.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.500
I mean, there's
a lot of evidence

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.770
to the contrary out there,
and it's really easy

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.820
to get down on humanity.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.730
And then you say,
hey, everybody,

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:53.430
would you like to give money to
make the world a better place?

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:57.160
And they do, and they
do they do in scads.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.250
And it's not just
rich folk, this

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:02.940
is like broke college kids,
broke high school kids,

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:07.310
somebody kicking in $10 because
that's all they can afford.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:11.170
And you're like,
people are really good.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.930
MALE SPEAKER: So does that
map onto personal philosophy

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:15.310
that you have?

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.010
Is there a [? lithani ?]
of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:21.090
PAT ROTHFUSS: I do
genuinely believe

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:25.160
that people are inherently good.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.450
Sometimes we can
have low blood sugar,

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:32.850
sometimes we can
be a horribly hurt

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:35.530
by our environment
or our upbringing

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:40.370
and damaged, perhaps, beyond
our ability to cope with it

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:44.050
or realize that goodness.

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:51.960
But truthfully, those are
situations that have nothing

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.460
to do with what the
person actually is.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.060
I almost launched into the
weirdest analogy ever, there,

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.840
and I've spared you.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.820
There was another weird one,
I'm having a weird analogy day.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.790
You can shave a dog, but
that doesn't mean-- see,

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.958
that's a bad analogy.

00:44:14.958 --> 00:44:17.120
It's still a dog even if
you shave it, no, that

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.750
makes sense Rothfuss,
what are you--

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:23.030
this is why I have an
extensive revision process.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:28.840
No, the fact is, and I believe
this more now has a parent,

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.120
my little boy is so good.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.790
And I view it as
one of my main jobs,

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:36.240
not to teach him
to be good, it's

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.900
just to not fuck
up his being good.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.780
He already is good,
and I just got

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.710
to try to not get
in the way of that

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:51.160
and accidentally
set a bad example

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.562
or hurt him in such a
way that he will be hurt

00:44:54.562 --> 00:44:56.145
and then takes it
out on other people.

00:44:58.219 --> 00:45:00.010
MALE SPEAKER: Playing
games and everything.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:03.220
PAT ROTHFUSS: Playing games, and
trying to set a good example,

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.330
but yeah.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.030
Are there any questions from
the audience that were here?

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.180
Say it and I'll repeat it.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:12.476
AUDIENCE: Sure, I was going to
ask without too many spoilers,

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.412
what you were planning
for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:14.412 --> 00:45:16.348
Given what you said
so far, I'll ask more.

00:45:16.348 --> 00:45:17.889
Why did you decide
you could actually

00:45:17.889 --> 00:45:20.640
afford the time for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.754
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:21.754 --> 00:45:23.920
PAT ROTHFUSS: Do you want
to repeat it, so that on--

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.080
MALE SPEAKER: Or if you
want to rephrase it.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.740
PAT ROTHFUSS: The
question was, first off,

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.250
what's going with Torment?

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.050
Or can you tell us
something about Torment?

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:35.750
Or why did I pick it up?

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:38.170
And the follow up,
given what I've

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.210
said that I had to not do
projects because I'm too busy,

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:43.490
what made that one
a project that I

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.409
felt like I could pursue?

00:45:46.409 --> 00:45:47.200
Did I get it right?

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.450
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:54.480
PAT ROTHFUSS: The first-- I'll
answer the second one first-- I

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.830
love video games, right?

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:01.800
And the video games that I
grew up playing, some of you

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.560
might have played, who played
Infocom games back in the day?

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.650
Hey!

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.290
This is proof for my
theory that people

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.410
that played Infocom
games turned out

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:15.000
to be the smartest goddamn
people in the world,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.250
and it is just true.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:19.790
You know who played video games?

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:22.230
Neil Gaiman, it was one of
the first things that came up

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.580
in that first
conversation at that con,

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.250
he talked about how he
played the Douglas Adams one.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:30.520
And he complained
about the babel fish,

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:35.270
and I'm like, this--
OK, no, I'm not

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:39.830
going to go off onto a
screed about video games.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:43.200
Bring it back Rothfuss,
what's your point?

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.950
I love playing
video games, and I

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.000
love some of the
narrative opportunities

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.910
that are present in video games
that are not present in text.

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:55.490
Specifically, there's a
level of interactivity

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:58.800
and the ability to branch
a narrative that does not

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.230
exist in text to
the same extent.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:04.919
Yes, you can do a Choose
Your Own Adventure,

00:47:04.919 --> 00:47:06.710
but it's not the same
because you're always

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:10.162
keeping one finger in
there, you always want to,

00:47:10.162 --> 00:47:12.120
oh, maybe I'll flip back,
oh, it doesn't count,

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.280
it doesn't count.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.390
There's also the ability for
problem solving in a video game

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.870
that you don't have in
the same way in a book.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.780
And the team was amazing.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:32.570
Also I do hope to eventually
have a video game in my world,

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:36.780
and so I need to build up some
skills now so that when it's

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:41.400
time to launch into doing
mine, I know a little bit,

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.580
so I can be a better
member of that team.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.949
In terms of what
am I doing, I'll

00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:51.240
share just a brief story there.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.110
We had a team meeting
where we went in

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:56.680
and I talked to all
the other writers,

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.090
and it's like an
all-star cast of people

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.870
who have been
doing games forever

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:03.700
from all these different
studios, people who've

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:07.530
won awards, just marvelous
folk who've come together

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.165
for this Torment game.

00:48:09.165 --> 00:48:13.390
There's Chris Avellone,
several of the people

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:17.230
that worked on the original
Planescape Torment game.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.710
Who played Planescape Torment?

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:23.010
See, 15, 20 years
after the fact,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:25.260
people still remember
that game fondly

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.690
because it was an amazing
storytelling experience.

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.820
So it's this great
team, and then there's

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:34.720
Rothfuss who like
has never done--

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.240
I have not programmed
since basic.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:43.370
Or actually, that's not
true, I did Pascal, too.

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:47.197
And so, they're all
talking about this stuff,

00:48:47.197 --> 00:48:49.280
and they're like, well,
what about your character?

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.196
What are you thinking?

00:48:50.196 --> 00:48:53.460
And I'm like, I'm thinking
of something weird,

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.550
can I pitch it to you?

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.770
So I sit there, and for 15
minutes, I pitch my concept.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.530
I go, this is not anything
that I've ever seen in any game

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:05.250
that I played for this companion
character, and I pitch it,

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.770
and I pitch it, and I'm kind
of watching them, trying

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:09.050
to read the audience.

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:12.760
And eventually I see--
and it's a weird concept,

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.620
I can't tell you what it is
right now, because it's still

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:19.175
coming-- and I'm going,
do you have them Rothfuss?

00:49:19.175 --> 00:49:20.300
Are they just being polite?

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.280
Are they listening?

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.136
And then eventually, I
see Chris Avellone go,

00:49:24.136 --> 00:49:26.740
and I'm like, oh, good,
if I've got Chris,

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.720
then I can't be
totally off target.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.630
And they're like,
OK, let's do that.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:34.010
And I'm like,
awesome, awesome, this

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:36.041
is going to be
something that it's

00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:37.290
going to be double or nothing.

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:40.520
If I can pull it off, people
are going to talk about it,

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.380
and it will be
very new and cool.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.306
And if I fail, then I
will fail spectacularly.

00:49:47.571 --> 00:49:50.070
MALE SPEAKER: And also with the
card games out of your world

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:50.694
that have come.

00:49:50.694 --> 00:49:52.550
Two Kickstarter projects so far.

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:56.340
We had a person ask on the
blog by the name of true eyes,

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.085
is Corners just a
variant of Spades?

00:49:59.085 --> 00:50:02.064
Is there going to be a
Kickstarter for that as well?

00:50:02.064 --> 00:50:03.480
PAT ROTHFUSS: It's
not fair to say

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.510
it's a variation of
any game, and if I

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:09.470
was going to say if it
was close to something,

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:11.780
I'd probably pick
something like euchre,

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.330
which I'm guessing like--

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.290
MALE SPEAKER: Midwest.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:15.660
PAT ROTHFUSS: Yeah, if
you're from the Midwest,

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.680
you play euchre.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.360
See, I go to a gaming
convention and I

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.510
look for somebody
who can play euchre,

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.070
because I was trying to
play test some of my rules

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:25.780
for corners.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:29.020
And I could not find
the game designer

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.520
who knew what euchre was.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:34.860
Because they're not
from the Midwest.

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:39.280
It is a trick taking
game, there is bidding,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.850
but it's not really
a variant of anything

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:44.220
so much as it is a different
sort of trick taking game.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.080
MALE SPEAKER: Well
hopefully we'll

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.290
see that in the
marketplace someday.

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:46.860
PAT ROTHFUSS: Hopefully.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:47.940
MALE SPEAKER: Hopefully.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.000
Other questions, yes.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.460
AUDIENCE: I've read your blog
piece about wealth accumulation

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.500
and having a chocolate
cake and one slice,

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.000
and two slices, and
the whole thing,

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.350
and I wonder how you think
about having a family,

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:06.320
having a child, having a
future where your writing

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.612
career suddenly
goes south, and now

00:51:08.612 --> 00:51:10.070
what's your income
earning ability?

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:11.560
How does all of
that fit together

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.240
in your attitude towards wealth?

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.323
MALE SPEAKER: What is your
attitude towards wealth

00:51:15.323 --> 00:51:18.510
as it has highs and lows and
with the wheel of fortune?

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:22.790
PAT ROTHFUSS: Yeah, I did write
a blog post where somebody

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:27.100
asked me the question, it
was effectively, why charity?

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:30.185
Why do you do this?

00:51:30.185 --> 00:51:34.980
And I responded with my now
famous chocolate cake analogy.

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:39.270
You have a slice of cake and you
eat the cake, then that's OK.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:42.010
And if you have two slices
of cake and you eat the cake,

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:44.990
well, that's kind of OK, too.

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:48.210
But if you have a whole cake,
and you eat the whole cake,

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:52.580
then you're kind of an asshole,
because some people have

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:58.780
no cake, and some people don't
have dinner before the not-cake

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:00.961
that they don't have.

00:52:00.961 --> 00:52:05.960
And so I'm glad that
you liked that, I'm

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.390
sorry if that gave you
a stroke right there.

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:11.430
The absence of not-cake
would actually be cake.

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:17.055
Can you take the no tea?

00:52:17.055 --> 00:52:21.520
I dropped the no
tea, now I have tea.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.400
That's for just a
few of you out there.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.620
And some people, a
lot of people have

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:36.720
said that Rothfuss, you're
doing you're riding high now,

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:41.220
you're making money off these
books, but what happens if?

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.730
What if things
stop going so well?

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:46.550
Aren't you going to
really feel stupid

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.560
if you've got to go back
to doing some other job

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.351
or you don't have the
money to do whatever?

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.280
What they're
effectively-- I've had

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.730
a lot of people espouse the
Carnegie solution, which

00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:03.450
is you are like a
huge, rapacious bastard

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:07.910
for your whole life, and you
get all the cake you can,

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:11.602
and then, before
you die, you set up

00:53:11.602 --> 00:53:13.060
a foundation to
give it away again.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.900
And Carnegie's foundation has
done some really awesome stuff,

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:27.340
that's undeniable, but the
underlying philosophy there

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:30.060
is that people
aren't smart enough

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.110
to take care of themselves.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:37.106
That's fear that if I give you
a piece of cake, you'll eat it

00:53:37.106 --> 00:53:39.230
and you'll get a tummy ache
because you're an idiot

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:43.030
and only I am smart enough
to actually allocate cake.

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.080
And I don't really
think that's the truth.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.190
I think that people can
deal with their own cake,

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:51.790
and because you are good, if
I give you two pieces of cake

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:53.880
or you accidentally end
up with some extra cake,

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.270
you will share it
with your neighbors.

00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:02.280
And that is-- I see
somebody going, no.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.830
And I'll fight
you on that point.

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:07.110
That is the hill
that I will die on,

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:10.630
and the only reason that
sometimes it doesn't work

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:15.590
is because people have
grown up in situations

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:19.980
that have hurt them terribly
or taught them skills that

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.930
have forced them to hoard as
the only survival mechanism

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.000
that they have.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.890
Or they don't
understand that you

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:32.420
need to shop at the
local comic book store

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:35.325
if you want the local comic
book store to stay in business.

00:54:35.325 --> 00:54:37.200
And this is something
that you're like, well,

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.726
duh, of course.

00:54:38.726 --> 00:54:40.100
But there was a
time in your life

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:43.100
when you did not
understand that.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.280
And so you can either just
rage and gnash your teeth

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.130
at the world, or
you can hopefully

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:50.862
be one of the people
that says, boy, you know,

00:54:50.862 --> 00:54:53.770
it's really nice, you guys
got Pandemonium Bookstore here

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:58.030
in Cambridge, it's a great local
bookstore, great local game

00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.999
store.

00:54:58.999 --> 00:55:01.290
And that means that if you
go online and buy your games

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:05.960
there, you are saying, the $2.50
I save is more important than

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.900
having this resource
in the community.

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.800
What was the question again?

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.280
MALE SPEAKER: The cake is
a lie, I think you got it.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.571
AUDIENCE: How does being a
father change your attitude?

00:55:18.571 --> 00:55:20.707
PAT ROTHFUSS: Ah,
now here's the key,

00:55:20.707 --> 00:55:22.790
and for those of you that
might be Pratchett fans,

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:25.600
this is not an
unfamiliar philosophy.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.620
It's the fact that personal
isn't the same as important.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.460
My kids are really important
to me because they're my kids,

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:38.470
but the point at which I
say, it's better for my kid

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:47.000
to have food and to have
these two kids go hungry,

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.860
that is the thin end
of the wedge that

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:54.720
leads to the only thing
that I would label as evil.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:56:04.390
Because as soon as you
do that, it selfishness.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:12.320
And it's a natural impulse,
it is a reasonable impulse,

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:15.040
it's a biological impulse.

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.590
It's an impulse
which has made us

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:23.096
able to survive
through the years, its

00:56:23.096 --> 00:56:26.520
a mechanism which made
us extraordinarily

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.360
successful monkeys.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:35.250
And now, at this stage, because
we are no longer monkeys,

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:38.580
at this stage, that
behavior, that impulse,

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:43.030
if we give into it, that makes
us extraordinarily ineffective

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:45.470
human beings.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:52.460
We need to recognize our
monkey impulses, and then say,

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:57.460
is my kid really more
important than four other kids?

00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.290
And it's hard, and
you have to say, no.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.490
MALE SPEAKER: Well-spoken.

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:04.800
I think we have time for
one more audience question,

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.485
then I'll wrap it up with
some zingers of my own.

00:57:07.485 --> 00:57:08.900
All right, [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:16.424
AUDIENCE: Jumping
well back in the talk,

00:57:16.424 --> 00:57:17.840
I was struck when
you were talking

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:21.030
about hard fantasy
versus soft fantasy.

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.870
My impression both as a
child reader of fantasy

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:28.360
and a parent of child
readers of fantasy

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:34.960
is that somehow
children's fantasy

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.782
tends, as far as
I can tell, to be

00:57:36.782 --> 00:57:38.923
soft fantasy more
often than not.

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:43.050
What's your sense,
more important,

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:46.190
less important for kids'
fantasy to be hard or soft?

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:50.465
Easier or harder to make
hard fantasy for children?

00:57:50.465 --> 00:57:53.090
MALE SPEAKER: How hard is it to
make hard fantasy for children,

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:55.930
or keep it soft?

00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:58.780
PAT ROTHFUSS: There's
an unfortunate tendency

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.610
among people, in
general, to say,

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:04.470
oh, I'll write a fantasy
novel because you can all just

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:05.980
make stuff up.

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.195
And that's wrong, because
that's not-- you can just

00:58:09.195 --> 00:58:11.445
do a bunch of stuff and magic
will make it make sense.

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.650
You can, but that's
not good writing,

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:19.920
it's not good storytelling,
it's not good craft.

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:25.050
In my opinion, similarly,
people, sometimes, in the genre

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:26.980
are like, well, boy, I
wish I could write YA,

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.690
because then kids don't
know what a plot hole is,

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:32.010
they don't care about
consistent characterization,

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:35.600
they're not going to call me
on the million dragons ecology

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.280
problem that I've
created, this is not

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.140
a sustainable ecostructure.

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:47.840
But that, in my opinion, is
a really egregious cop out.

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.100
Because in the same
way that the food

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.510
we feed our children
should be actually held

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:56.220
to a higher standard than the
food that you give to an adult,

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:59.910
because an adult can say,
blech, this is awful,

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:01.640
or they can read
the label and go,

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.370
oh, this has
terrible things in it

00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:05.720
and it's going to make me
sick and give me cancer.

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.600
A kid can't.

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.490
And so you owe it to kids
to actually put more work

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:15.960
into this, because it's
actually harder to write short.

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.580
It's harder to write simple.

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.290
It's harder to do a
lot of these things,

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:26.280
and it's harder to write
cohesive, coherent, internally

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.200
consistent fantasy.

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:31.890
And you shouldn't go to
YA thinking, oh, my, this

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:35.600
will be way easier, I can
just bang out 30,000 words

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.420
and then go play
World of Warcraft.

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:42.220
No.

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:44.300
I do not approve.

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:48.870
But then again, I have not
really taken a legitimate crack

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:51.544
at YA, I know that
it's hard, but that

00:59:51.544 --> 00:59:52.960
doesn't mean that
we shouldn't try

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:56.670
for it, that's my philosophy.

00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:59.960
MALE SPEAKER: Quick question
here, any update on Kingkiller

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.620
on TV or Mr. Whiffle
the cartoon version.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.150
PAT ROTHFUSS: I would love to
see a Princess and Mr. Whiffle

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:07.690
cartoon, that would be awesome.

01:00:10.455 --> 01:00:15.010
I'm trying to imagine
that right now.

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:18.040
There is a TV deal
in development.

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:23.100
I have no more news than that.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.320
MALE SPEAKER: It exists.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.930
So the final question I wanted
to wrap up with, first of all,

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:33.100
thank you very much for joining
us today, it was really great.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.720
Talk to me about the care,
growth, and maintenance

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.980
of such a magnificent beard.

01:00:39.576 --> 01:00:41.200
PAT ROTHFUSS: A beard
is the only thing

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.740
in the world you
get by being lazy.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.780
And people are like,
wow, how do you grow?

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.180
See, I've got a couple
beard people, here,

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:53.200
and do people ask, how do
you grow a beard like that?

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.048
Do people ask you?

01:00:55.048 --> 01:00:56.552
AUDIENCE: Sometimes.

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:59.392
PAT ROTHFUSS: And the
thing, I started saying,

01:00:59.392 --> 01:01:04.940
for two hours a day I sit in a
dark room and I just grow it.

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:09.910
Because it's the
only way I can not

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:13.760
be snarky about that
conversation anymore.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.600
This is what a person looks
like when they do not care.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.750
Don't ask me for
grooming suggestions,

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.830
what the hell's wrong with you?

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:28.350
This is man in
his natural state.

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:31.470
I literally, I was going
to get a haircut for this,

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:34.720
we scheduled a haircut, and
then the one person I trust

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.310
to cut my hair, her kid got sick
the day before I was flying,

01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:40.270
I couldn't find
another haircut person,

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:42.490
so you get to see
me in my full glory.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:48.020
I think it's been a year since
I've been trimmed in any way.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:55.330
This is not a maintenance
issue, I do not, beard.

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:57.700
MALE SPEAKER: No favorite
comb or anything like that.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:58.408
PAT ROTHFUSS: No.

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:03.170
And actually, it's
going to probably

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:05.710
be getting severely
cropped back,

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:09.340
because my littlest is
starting to develop fine motor

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:14.230
coordination, and little
sweaty kid fingers,

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:17.970
ladies you have no-- whoa--
you have no idea how much it

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:20.710
hurts to have your beard pulled.

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:25.070
It's right on one of the most
sensitive parts of your body,

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:28.130
you get a little kid with
his sweaty fingers in there,

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:33.370
and then he just pulls on it,
and you cannot cuss him out.

01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:36.380
You have to say,
ah, daddy loves you,

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:41.000
he's crying so much
that he loves you.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.184
This is not a fashion statement.

01:02:44.184 --> 01:02:45.600
MALE SPEAKER: And
no beard shaving

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.870
challenges for
Worldbuilders 2015?

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:51.010
PAT ROTHFUSS: People said,
how much money would it

01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:52.180
take for your to
shave your beard?

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.304
I'm like, make me an offer.

01:02:56.110 --> 01:03:00.550
I did not cultivate this
to be a marketing ploy.

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:03.190
Again, I have a
beard because I don't

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:07.622
want to waste my time
scraping my face every day.

01:03:07.622 --> 01:03:09.436
MALE SPEAKER:
Cool, on that note,

01:03:09.436 --> 01:03:12.060
thank you very much for joining
us at Google, you can check out

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.987
his books online, and in stores,
and at your local book seller,

01:03:14.987 --> 01:03:15.820
thank you very much.

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.028
PAT ROTHFUSS: Thanks so much.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:37.740
This is very inside the Actor's
Studio, a very tall chair.

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.570
How do I sit in the
tall chair without kind

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:42.580
of exposing my
crotch to you guys.

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.120
I'm don't know how to be
dignified in this position,

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:45.630
here.

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:47.379
Oh, see, that's something
that I shouldn't

01:03:47.379 --> 01:03:52.197
say in front of an audience, I'm
bad at this, I'm bad at this.

01:03:52.197 --> 01:03:52.780
How's my hair?

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.630
Oh, you can see my bald spot.

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:58.960
Do you have some sort
of special technology

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.561
that can get rid of that for me?

01:04:00.561 --> 01:04:01.394
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:04:05.299 --> 01:04:06.590
MALE SPEAKER: Should we switch?

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:08.090
PAT ROTHFUSS: I
thought he was going

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:10.780
to come just put his
coat over my head.
