00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.339
With this one simple trick, you'll be able
to take any bottle of soda, and pour out an

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.620
instant slushy on command. Now if you don't
believe what you're seeing, that's ok, but

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.179
it is real, and in this project you'll discover
the insanely easy secret to making an instant

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.179
soda slushy.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.340
For this project, grab a bottle of room temperature
soda, and start shaking it violently. We want

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.750
as much pressure to build up inside as we
can get. Now I've done this with these 500mL

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.420
bottles, and set them in the freezer for 3
hours and 15 minutes. This is the point when

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.200
they're colder than freezing, but not actually
frozen. Now you can show your friends that

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.750
it's just a normal soda, but watch what happens
if we simply release the pressure, tighten

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.880
the cap, and turn it upside down. In just
3 seconds, the entire bottle has turned to

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.250
an icy soda slush. Pour it in a glass, and
you'll get a good idea of how thick the slush

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.799
really is, and when it starts pushing up at
the top you can see it's a light and fluffy,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.810
delicious carbonated ice. Now let's try removing
the pressure very slowly. This is going to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.600
take a bit of patience, but when you get the
cap off, you might notice, your soda didn't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.030
freeze. If you pour it into a frosty bowl
that just came out of the freezer, it'll ice

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.159
up right before your eyes. There's one chilled
soda ready to be served. You could try keeping

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.799
your soda liquified by pouring it in a clean
bowl, then freezing it by dropping in one

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.439
flake of ice. These crystals will grow rapidly,
until your entire bowl is filled, and now

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.759
we have another chilled soda, ready for your
enjoyment. On a bigger scale, like in a glass,

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.240
you'll notice that the crystals collect at
the top. To get them to spread out, just take

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.819
a spoon, or a straw, and give it a little swirl.
You should see the whole drink quickly ices

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.259
over. Now, if you're wondering why this works,
it's because the liquid is supercooled and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.420
actually wants to freeze. It just needs some
help getting started. Now this works with

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.610
every soda, and sports drink that I've tried
because it's the water in the drink that's

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.910
actually freezing. As the ice forms, the syrup
gets trapped between the ice crystals, so

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.830
the slush keeps its flavor. If you try this
yourself, keep in mind that every freezer

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.200
is a little different, so just play around
with the time it takes to get your best results.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.050
I tried supercooling canned soda and found
that they work as well, but you have to release

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.250
the pressure very very slowly or they'll ice
up in the can. When you do get them open,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.270
you'll see the trick works exactly the same
as the others. Well now you know how to super-chill,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.810
your favorite soft drink, and master the art
of the 3 second slushy. If you like this project,
