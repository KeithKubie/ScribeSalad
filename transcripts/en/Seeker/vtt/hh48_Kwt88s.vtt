00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.000
Foods marketed as healthy are actually making
America fat.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.899
If you don’t want to know more, I suggest
you run away now, for about 30 minutes a day

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:07.319
with an elevated heart rate.

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.390
Actually, you should just do that anyway.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.070
Hey gang, Matt Lieberman here for DNews.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.369
Obesity is, dare I say, a huge issue in the
United States.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.100
Nearly two thirds of US women and three quarters
of US men are overweight or obese, and a new

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.670
report published in the journal JAMA Internal
Medicine revealed that Obese Americans actually

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.490
outnumber overweight Americans.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.340
It’s big news, but a new study published
in the Journal of Marketing Research is weighing

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.130
even more heavily on my mind.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.480
The study, authored by the American Marketing
Association, shows that foods marketed as

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.010
fitness, diet, or healthy options can lead
to overconsumption and actually reduce consumers’

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.450
motivation to exercise.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.110
The study examined the eating and exercise
patterns of so-called “restrained” eaters,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.760
who are chronically concerned about their
body weight and image.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.430
Participants were allowed to choose between
two bags of trail mix, one labelled simply

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.060
Trail Mix, while the other was labelled Fitness
Trail Mix, with an image of running shoes

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.510
visible on the package.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.030
They were given eight minutes to eat and give
their opinions on the trail mix of their choice,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.060
and then encouraged to exercise as much as
they wanted on a stationary bike.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.810
Overwhelmingly, participants who chose the
Fitness trail mix consumed more of it and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.970
also opted to work out far less vigorously
than those who chose the “normal” trail

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.970
mix.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.649
Through simple marketing, people internalized
the message that this trail mix was a light,

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.499
fit snack, and that exercise was therefore
less necessary or not necessary at all.

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:31.950
However, diet foods are in many ways just
as unhealthy or more unhealthy than foods

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.280
considered unhealthy.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.859
You see, when food producers try to make a
food seem leaner by cutting fat, they often

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.859
add sugar and sodium to make it taste as great
as the real thing.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.039
Take breakfast cereals for example.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.700
Cereals like General Mills’ Total Raisin
Bran, Kellogg’s Smart Start, or Kellogg’s

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.689
Low-Fat Granola all contain more grams of
sugar per serving than a powdered sugar donut

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.069
at Dunkin Donuts.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.670
All of their boxes encourage a health-conscious
lifestyle.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.039
But if a consumer decides to eat more in one
sitting AND exercise less often, their sugar

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.310
intake could skyrocket.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.069
What’s worse, it’s not just an American
problem.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.280
In the UK, the University of Hertfordshire
discovered that foods from 7 major supermarkets

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.860
marketed as healthy options for children in
fact contained more sugar, fat, and salt than

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.320
the same healthy foods marketed towards adults.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.140
Either way, we’ve got a mega-sized marketing
mix-up here.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.060
In closing, don’t be fooled by a pair of
running shoes, a happy sun, or pictures of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.430
happy, rugged hikers.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.720
Always read nutrition facts and the ingredient
list of foods before you buy, and hey, it’s

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.940
better to eat less of the real thing than
to eat more of a processed clone.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.410

Crust Pizza?
