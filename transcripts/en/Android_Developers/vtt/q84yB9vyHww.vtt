code for this evening's attire.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.500
And you're forgiven, however.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.050
But I wanted to look my best in
honor of some of the greatest

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.455
developers in the world.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.330
One of the favorite
parts of my job

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.660
is watching developers
take a new design

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.650
or a nascent technology and
create experiences that are

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.880
truly changing people's lives.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.680
The apps and the
games that they create

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.180
offer a service, piece
of functionality,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.870
or an entirely new
experience that

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.090
is truly inspiring and amazing.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.910
Being an early adopter
is really hard.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.410
It means challenging
the status quo.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.580
It means pushing your team
in different directions.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.750
These are all things
that we at Google truly

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.420
admire in this year's nominees.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.867
Let's take a look.

00:20:36.867 --> 00:20:38.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: Early
Adopter nominees

00:20:38.450 --> 00:21:04.218

00:21:22.392 --> 00:21:24.850
SAMEER SAMAT: And the winner
this year in the Early Adopter

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.165
category is World Around Me.

FEMALE SPEAKER: Go Global.

00:22:09.585 --> 00:22:11.710
SAMEER SAMAT: Given how
popular Android devices are

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.100
around the world, we often
get asked by developers,

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.780
how do I make a successful
entrance into a new market?

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.920
And many people think
that localizing an app

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.950
just means taking the app
from one language to another.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.780
But it's so much more than that.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.460
For an app to feel
truly successful

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.430
in a different
country, users there

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.530
need to believe that
it was built for them.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.160
This is all about
colors and character

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.020
choices and contextual
relevance as well as language.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.040
It's really hard to do.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.550
And so this year we wanted
to honor a set of developers

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.100
that exemplify what great
localization looks like.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.120
And the nominees are.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.160
It's incredibly humbling--
just looking out at this room,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.770
it's incredibly
humbling, as a reminder,

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.240
to see how far our
Android developer

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.660
community has come
since we first launched

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.140
the platform back in 2008.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.040
We're now at the final two award
categories of the night, Best

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.080

They serve their users
in different ways,

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.890
but what they all have in common
is great design, intuitive user

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.320
