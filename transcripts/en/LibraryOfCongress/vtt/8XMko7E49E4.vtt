00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.690
&gt;&gt; Kate Murray: Hi, everyone.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.450
I'm Kate Murray, and I'm
from The Library of Congress.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.840
And please allow
me to welcome you

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.670
to "Designing the Future
Landscape: Digital Architecture,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.760
Design, and Engineering Assets."

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.470
And before I introduce
our opening speakers,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.170
I'd like to say a
few words about what

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.040
to expect for the day.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.900
We -- and by that, I mean our
stellar organizing committee,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.880
which is comprised of staff
from The Library of Congress,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.500
the Architect of the Capitol,
and The National Gallery of Art,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.800
have been on -- planning
this event for over a year.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.830
We all sort of bumped
into each other

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.600
when we were exploring
these complex

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.390
and dynamic digital
collections about 18 months ago,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.400
and we thought there must be
other folks out there like us

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.790
who are looking for
opportunities

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.920
to share information
-- it's a hum, right?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.900
But to share information to
build communities of practice.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.030
So we decided to work together
in what really has been a model

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.430
of inter-agency cooperation
and collaboration.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.720
And in this, we include our
colleagues from GSA as well.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.970
And we are bringing
together thought leaders,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.290
content creators, technologists,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.840
members of the archival
communities --

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.450
that is to say, all of you,
to talk about the development

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.570
and implementation of open,
standardized file formats,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.600
case studies, and current
projects and practices,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.140
and future-looking approaches.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.270
And we have our engaged and
supportive program committee

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.590
to thank us for bringing
this to fruition.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.360
You know how sometimes
program committees are more

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.800
about moral support?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.840
This was not one of
those program committees.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.500
They were true partners in
bringing this event about,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.190
and we owe a sincere
and heartfelt thank-you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.700
for allowing us to
pick their brains

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.470
and raid their contact lists.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.250
We'd be remiss not to also
thank the special events,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.900
music division, and multimedia
staff at The Library of Congress

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.220
for their important and
valued contributions.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.040
And of course, we're grateful to
all of you in the audience today

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.930
for sharing our passion and
curiosity about all things ADE.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.730
A few logistics for the day.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.810
The restrooms are out the
door near the yellow corridor,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.570
although I think the
ladies' room one is broken,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.950
so you might have to go
down the hall a little bit.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.370
Breaks and lunch are on your
own in our cafÃ©, which is just

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.430
across the hall, and it's
actually pretty good.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.700
I usually get the Korean
rice bowl or the sushi,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.860
but you can find
something that you like.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.700
We expect to have a dedicated
pay lane, so look for some kind

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.340
of a sign that says
"Architecture,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.740
Design and Engineering," or
"Special Event," and you can get

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.020
in that lane, although
you can pay anywhere.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.950
There's also a Subway and a
Dunkin Donuts on the G level.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.140
We won't spend time in our
sessions on speaker bios,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.850
but you can read all about
them on the conference website.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.660
Our hashtag is #DigADE2017,
and it's case-sensitive,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.370
as you see there
on the monitors,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.440
and we hope you flood Twitter
with posts throughout the day.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.000
The wireless network is
lock guest, and you need

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.360
to accept the prompt in
your web browser to connect.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.240
This event is being recorded
for later release on YouTube

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.250
and other social
media platforms,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.790
so we ask that during Q&amp;A,
you wait for the mic to come

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.720
to you before posing
your question.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.200
And please note that
participating --

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.110
by participating in this event,
you acknowledge that your image

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.010
and voice might be captured
on these recordings.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.320
Speaker slides will be available

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.420
on the conference website
in the near future.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.230
We'll also have a report
coming out in 2018,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.580
which will be authored
by Aliza Leventhal,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.830
covering the main themes
and topics of the day,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.820
and we'll widely distribute the
links to all of these resources.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.760
If you have any concerns

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.950
or questions during
the conference today,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.370
please seek out a member of
the organizing committee,

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.930
and we have stars
on our nametags.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.900
And finally, we invite
everyone to join us

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.230
for a no-host happy hour down
the block at Bullfeathers

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.530
at the end of the day.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.860
This is the start
of a conversation,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.530
and we're thrilled you can all
join us, so let's keep it going.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.760
Without further ado, I'd like
to introduce Mark Sweeney,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.040
Acting Deputy Librarian
of Congress,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.270
followed by Stephen Ayers,
Architect of the Capitol,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.920
to get us started with
welcoming remarks.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.640
Mark Sweeney is currently
serving as the librarian of --

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.410
The Library of Congress's
Acting Deputy Librarian.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.110
Prior to his current
appointment, Mr. Sweeney served

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.490
as the Associate Librarian
for Library Services.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.530
He was responsible for carrying
out library service's mission,

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.080
which is acquire, organize,
provide access to, maintain,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.030
secure, and preserve The Library

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.880
of Congress's universal
collection.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.020
This vast collection
contributes to the advancement

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.500
of civilization and knowledge
throughout the world --

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.430
throughout the world, documents
the history and culture

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.970
of the United States,
and records

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.230
and supports the creativity
of the American people.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.090
On May 13th, 2010, President
Barack Obama officially

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.200
appointed Stephen
Ayers to a 10-year term

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.900
as Architect of the Capitol.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.540
Mr. Ayers is responsible
for facilities maintenance

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.690
and operation of the historic
U.S. Capitol Building, the care

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.780
and improvement of more
than 570 acres of grounds,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.220
and the operation
and maintenance

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.430
of 17.4 million square
feet of buildings.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.870
Including the House and Senate
Congressional office buildings,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.230
the Capitol Visitors' Center,

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.860
the Library of Congress
buildings,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.770
the U.S. Supreme Court building,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.550
the Thurgood Marshall
Federal Judiciary building,

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.850
and other facilities.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.690
He's responsible for the care of
all works of art in the capitol

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.840
under the direction of the
Joint Committee and the Library,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.040
and is responsible for the
maintenance and restoration

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.800
of murals, outdoor sculpture,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.850
and other architectural elements
throughout the Capitol Complex.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.510
Please join me in
welcoming them to the podium.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:32.900
[ Applause ]

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.350
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Good
morning, everyone.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.650
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.950
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney:
Again, I'm Mark Sweeney,

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.500
the Acting Deputy Librarian
of Congress, and on behalf

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.610
of the Librarian of
Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.410
it's my pleasure to welcome
you to today's program.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.400
We are pleased to host this
symposium in collaboration

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.850
with the Architect
of the Capitol

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.450
and the National Gallery of Art.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.800
Let me take a moment to provide
a little context for the Library

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.680
of Congress's commitment

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.170
to architectural
and design heritage.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.180
The Library is both the oldest
federal cultural institution

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.740
in the United States and
the world's largest library.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.020
Since its founding in 1800, its
collections, which are universal

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.620
in subject matter, have grown
to over 164 million items,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.880
stored on more than
838 miles of shelving.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.390
The collections include
more than 38 million books

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.820
and other print materials, 36
-- or, 3.6 million recordings,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.780
14 million manuscripts,
photographs, 5.5 million maps,

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.380
8.1 million pieces
of sheet music,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.860
and 70 million manuscript
sheets.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.800
What's germane to our
discussions today is the fact

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.340
that the subjects of
architecture, design,

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.410
and engineering are
woven into all

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.800
of these different collections.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.610
However, the largest
concentration

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.810
of design sketches,
presentation renderings,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.370
and technical construction
drawings are in our prints

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.710
and photographs division, which
is also home to the Center

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.030
for Architecture
Design and Engineering.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.730
The division's extensive
holdings include original

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.180
designs by many of the most
distinguished designers

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.010
who worked in the United States,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.810
including Benjamin Henry
Latrobe, Robert Fulton,

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.940
Richard Morris Hunt, Cass
Gilbert, Frank Lloyd Wright,

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.980
Charles and Ray Eames, Raymond
Loewy, Paul Rudolph, and,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.800
of course, I.M. Pei, just
to name a few of the giants

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.610
that live here at the
Library of Congress.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.730
We are also fortunate
in having the archives

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.240
of two prominent
professional organizations,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.430
The American Institute
of Architects,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.910
and The Engineering
Society's Library.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.210
I don't have time to tell you

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.090
about all the great
research that's being done

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.450
with our architecture, design,

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.140
and engineering collections
right now.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.230
However, to give you just a tiny
bit that will give you a glimpse

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.280
of what's going on, I'll
mention a few examples

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.080
of the work that's being done
with the Paul Rudolph archive.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.020
The Urban Land Institute
is using the archive

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.310
to further its study of
urban planning and renewal.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.280
An architect is studying
Rudolph's Florida houses

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.940
in order to understand
changes in building codes

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.960
and their financial impact.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.840
Architectural scholars are
studying Rudolph's building

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.380
techniques and materials,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.170
particularly his
use of concrete.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.210
And finally, preservationists

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.550
and architectural historians
are looking closely at examples

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.690
of some of Rudolph's most
notable public buildings,

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.170
such as The Jewett Arts
Center in Wellesley,

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.010
and the controversial Boston
Government Services Center.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.700
In closing, I'm sure
today's panel presentations

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.860
and discussions will help us
achieve a better understanding

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.190
of the challenges inherent
in acquiring, preserving,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.750
and sharing important born
digital assets relative

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.720
to architecture,
design, and engineering.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.420
And I hope the remarks of the
Library of Congress curators

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.860
and others will stimulate you

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.650
to explore our magnificent
collections.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.510
Thank you.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:17.190
[ Applause ]

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Ayers: Thank you,
Mark, and thank you, Katy.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.980
Good morning, everyone.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.330
It's great to be here today.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.760
Let me start with a brief story

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.940
about the first major
restoration

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.580
of the United States Capitol
Dome that we recently completed,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.490
the first in a generation.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.280
You may have seen the
scaffolding going up

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.720
or coming down, and we completed
that terrific job in January

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.760
of this year, just before --
or, December of this year --

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.770
last year, just before the
Presidential Inauguration.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.510
The Dome, as you may know,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.720
is made of nearly nine million
pounds of cast iron girders,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.950
plates, columns, and
cast iron ornaments.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.130
Even the pedestal
upon which the Statue

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.610
of Freedom sits is
made of cast iron.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.060
And as we were gearing up
for this restoration effort,

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.040
we used CAD drawings, of
course, of the Capitol Dome

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.240
that we had prepared
many years before

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.240
to help us develop
the scope of work,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.310
to help us document the
more than 1300 cracks,

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.390
and deficiencies, and
repairs in the cast iron

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.970
that we were about to undertake.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.120
And these digital assets,
or these CAD drawings,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.220
were incredibly helpful
to the work we were doing.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.280
But they didn't contain
the important stuff,

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.340
the important details
of the fasteners,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.830
the connection points, and
all of the cast iron parts.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:57.670
It wasn't exactly like working
with a virtual erector set

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:02.690
that showed how all of these
hundreds of thousands of pieces

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.520
that fit together to
make up this dome.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.320
You can't necessarily see them
all, either, the fasteners

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.920
and the connection points,
because they're hidden.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.500
They're inside spaces
that haven't been --

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.570
haven't seen the light of
day in more than 160 years,

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.930
in the gutter systems,
and balustrades,

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.030
and those connection points
are what are important to us,

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.200
and what were important
to our contractor.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.090
And so, despite the amazing
technology that was available

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.650
to us, the most important tool

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:44.710
in this restoration project
was the roughly 200 original

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:50.500
watercolor drawings from Thomas
Ustick Walter in the 1850s,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.770
two of which you can see
right there on the screen.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.640
Thomas Ustick Walter was the
fourth Architect of the Capitol,

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.180
and his drawings were tremendous

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.800
in documenting exactly how
everything would fit together

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.390
back in 1865.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.610
By sharing these drawings with
our contractors, they were able

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:16.210
to develop their means and
methods by which they would go

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.800
about disassembling all of
the pieces of this dome,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.010
restoring them, and then
putting them all back together.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.070
And that reduced our risk
immensely on the job.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.880
They were particularly
helpful on the balustrades,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.900
some of which you can see
here, essentially serving

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.420
as a paint-by-numbers kit.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.120
And it's amazing,
the level of detail

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.570
of these drawings
back 160 years ago.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.100
I could spend the next 30
minutes talking about the state

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.450
of our design drawings today
produced by our engineers

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:58.230
and architects, and how
we can draw an outline

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.900
of this particular dome, make
a bubble around it, and say,

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.830
"The contractor needs to prepare
shop drawings for all of this."

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:10.760
Well, back in the 1860s, the
Architect of the Capitol did all

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.280
of that, and Walter made all
of those connection points.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.970
And they -- in fact, we
don't have shop drawings,

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:23.870
because his design documents
were essentially the shop

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.170
drawings for that.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.070
But that is for a
different gathering.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.950
Today, fortunately,
we are blessed

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.200
to have some incredibly
archivists at the Architect

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.110
of the Capitol that were able
to pull these drawings together,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.310
the ones from Thomas Ustick
Walter, more than 200 of them.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.630
They were stored on a
network drive, just a couple

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.320
of hundred gigabytes of
data that had been stored

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.110
on that drive for a
number of decades.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.670
While we were working
on the dome restoration,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.620
we also took the time
to pay it forward

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.700
to our future colleagues,
as well.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:09.050
We used BIM 360 to document
all of the work that we did,

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.780
whether it was including
the photographs

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.550
of existing conditions once
we took nearly 1/4 inch

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.700
of paint off the dome --
lead-based paint, that is,

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.260
documenting the conditions
that we found,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.620
documenting the original
repairs,

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.750
or repairs that were done in
the 1959 and 1960, that is.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.720
And paid it forward
for our colleagues

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.290
that might be undertaking
similar work some 50 or 75 years

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.820
from now, as they go

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.380
about restoring the
Capitol Dome once again.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.510
In the short term,
we're confident

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.910
that we can mine this
data to diagnose problems

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.180
that we may have with the dome
and our maintenance activities,

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.670
and in the longer term, of
course, it will be useful.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.860
This BIM 360 model will
certainly be useful only if it's

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.790
in a format that can be
assessed by future Architects

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.870
of the Capitol, again,
50 or 75 years from now.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.610
And as much as we want
to cling to paper,

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:21.780
it's just not realistic, as you
know, as it won't last forever.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:27.130
So we need to capture documents
in their born digital formats,

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.940
and certainly, we're
all here today wrestling

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.600
with the same questions.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.010
What's important to keep?

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.160
What are the challenges of
keeping it in perpetuity?

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.970
How do we protect the digital
record for the long-term.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.690
And perhaps most importantly for
me, anyway, how do we make sure

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.240
that our colleagues
in the future,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.930
those that might undertake
the repair and restoration

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.810
of this great Capitol Dome
50 or 75 years from now --

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.870
how do we make sure
they can use it?

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.650
Well, I hope by the end of
the day, you can figure all

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.030
of that out [laughter].

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:10.270
That's your challenge, and
I'm delighted to be here.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.820
I hope you have a great day.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.970
I look forward to hearing
the results of your work,

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.180
and I'm quite certain you'll
be able to figure that out

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.480
by the end of the day.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.510
So good luck, have a
great day, and thank you.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:33.000
[ Applause ]

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.300
&gt;&gt; Kate Murray: So
thank you, Mr. Ayers.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.600
That's a bit of a challenge.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.820
I think we'll do our best
by the end of the day,

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.490
and thanks to Mark
Sweeney, also,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.880
for those wonderful
welcoming remarks.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.170
So we're going to start with our
first session, which is going

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.400
to be Aliza Leventhal, Katie
Pierce Meyer, and Tim Walsh,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.930
and they're going to
give us an ADE primer.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.230
Thank you.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.030
&gt;&gt; Katie Pierce Meyer:
Good morning, everyone,

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.690
and thank you all for coming.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.150
I am Katie Pierce Meyer.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.590
My colleagues, Tim Walsh
and Aliza Leventhal,

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.190
and I are going -- are
very pleased to be asked

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.950
to provide an ADE
formats primer.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.290
Essentially, what we're
going to do is give a --

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.070
you about a one-hour
introduction

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.460
that covers the history and
preservation issues associated

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.980
with architecture design and
engineering and digital content.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.640
We'll each take on a particular
period, identify key trends

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.710
and preservation concerns.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.200
I should note that the
three of us come with a bit

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.100
of an architecture bias,
but we're very interested

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.640
in exploring the connections to
and overlaps with other fields.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.520
So, I will introduce the early
years, provide a little bit

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.820
of a background on
early CAD development

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.310
from the 1960s through
the 1980s.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.630
My colleague Tim Walsh will
take on the 1990s and 2000s,

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.380
a very active period in
technology development,

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.190
and increasingly complex
preservation challenges.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.080
And finally, Aliza Leventhal
will discuss software --

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.360
current software and
preservation landscape,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.140
setting us up for the
remaining sessions today.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.570
But first, let's start
with a look back.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.440
So the use of computer-aided
design applications

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.050
in architecture trailed
similar implementations

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.410
within engineering
and manufacturing.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.560
Stimulated by mandates from the
U.S. Air Force in the 19650s,

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.860
airplane engineers

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.060
and manufacturers were
early adopters and testers

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.520
of computer technology
for design.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.280
Computer-aided design and
drafting, manufacturing tools,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.910
and techniques were developed
to use machines as a means

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.750
of increasing speed
and precision,

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.660
while decreasing
production costs.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.580
In the aerospace industry,

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.590
automated drafting tools were
widely used in the 1950s,

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.470
and the needs of
manufacturers resulted

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.520
in innovative software
programs for project management,

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.220
data collection,
and engineering.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.370
Research and development
intensified

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.180
in the academic community,
however, in the 1960s.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.120
Ivan Sutherland, his 1963
electrical engineering doctoral

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.010
dissertation, and
his development

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.950
of the sketchpad system
are widely credited

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.850
with being a significant
contribution

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.400
to computer graphics
programming.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.770
Sutherland was working at
MIT, along with Steven Coons,

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.050
to rethink the interaction
between humans and computers.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.170
He and Coons envisioned a
computer-aided design system

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.820
that would allow multiple
designers to interact

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.850
with the system simultaneously
to communicate effectively

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.380
with each other, and to,
quote, "use the creative

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.080
and imaginative powers of
the man, and the analytical

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.510
and computational
powers of the machine."

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.220
While these researchers
were approaching a problem

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.740
from an engineering perspective,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.510
their work demonstrated
possibilities

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.130
for computer graphics
that held promise

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.350
for applications
to architecture.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.650
The idea was to create, move,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:47.790
copy geographical
entities using a light pen.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.710
By the 1960s, several
conferences were organized

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.930
to bring professionals, kind
of like we are here today,

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.780
to discuss the possibility and
implications of using computers

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.490
in architectural practice.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.670
The goals of the conferences
and associated publications were

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.320
to present information
about current efforts

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.390
in using computers in
architecture and related fields,

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.980
and to open up a discussion

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.650
about the potential use
for creative design.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.630
There were also conversations
about the role of the architect,

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.390
and what that looks like if
you start adopting computers

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.690
in your practice.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.730
So there's a little bit of
an apprehension on the part

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.480
of some architects about
embracing computer technology,

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.870
because of the uncertainty of
the value of the technology,

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.360
and concerns about potentially
changing their role and status.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.160
A common theme in
the conferences

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.680
and publications focused
on educating practitioners

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.960
about computers and addressing
their role as architects.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.850
Now, in the 1970s,
we saw the beginning

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.430
of the first commercial programs
available to the market.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.420
These are just a few examples
of those that were available.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.620
They were, however,
very expensive.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:59.040
In his 1977 book,
"Computer-Aided Design,"

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.670
William Mitchell predicted that
developments in architecture

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.500
and computer technology
had finally reached a point

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.560
where the tools would, quote,

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.880
"radically transform the
practice of architecture."

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.180
So what was coming
down the line --

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.050
a lot of things regarding
personal computing,

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:20.740
and just a lot of changes
within computer technology

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.740
that were going to make
these programs a little more

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.490
accessible, and, as
we'll see in a moment,

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.340
change just the nature
of the field.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.760
So the book was written
as an introductory guide

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.740
for architects, students,
and computer technologists,

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.780
to try to bring them together
to think about the developments

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.300
in computer technology, and what
was possible in architecture.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.230
So he encouraged
thinking about design

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:47.040
as an information processing
task, in which one conceives

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.950
of the mechanics
of managing data.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.160
So it was about data
even in the early days.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.020
He was concerned about
the seeming hostility

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.730
from architects, their
ignorance of the potentials

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:03.740
of the computer technology, but
mostly the financial constraints

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.040
of relatively small firms.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.400
It was -- he noted that the
challenges were particularly

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.800
great as compared
to other fields,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.520
where computer-aided design
was implemented more readily --

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.700
specifically, automotive
and aerospace engineering.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.210
One point he made was that the
relatively small size of firms

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.190
and the economic
investment necessary

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.290
to bring computer-aided
design to such firms meant

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.680
that the adoption of
the technology needed

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.410
to be perceived as necessary
or valuable to the industry,

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.800
not just to individual firms
or individual practitioners.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.300
It needed to be sort
of a broadly-applied --

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.390
to have real value, and to be
perceived as having real value.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.340
So what are some

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.540
of the preservation
challenges from this period?

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.410
You know, I've introduced
kind of a lot of big ideas

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.690
around what was going
on in those early days.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.840
There's not as much in the
way of -- as far as I know,

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.410
large quantities of
records available,

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.710
in terms of the technology.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.670
But there are some, and I think
identifying where those are,

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:05.760
where different repositories
might have different things

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.120
that might help us preserve what
was tried, what was debated,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.380
and what was presented
to various audiences,

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.340
what has value, both for the
history of design records,

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.900
but also for the history
of computer technology.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.660
Because some really interesting
things were happening during

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.180
this period, and they're just
sort of blending, and merging,

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:25.650
and borrowing ideas and
technologies from other fields.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.980
So looking at that, I think,

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.200
is one of the things
that's really valuable.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.220
There's also the experimentation
and adaptation to new markets.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.320
Some of the technologies
were created for one market

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.180
and then used within another,
and I think that's the kind

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.490
of thing that we might
want to be preserving

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.790
and providing access to.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.740
So, moving on to the 1980s --

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.240
the 1980s can really
be characterized

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.480
by a proliferation of programs.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.590
As I mentioned earlier,
there's sort of a change

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.430
in computer technology --
several changes that allowed

00:23:54.430 --> 00:24:00.610
for a wider array of people to
have access to the technologies.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.470
They were becoming
less expensive.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.450
Numerous vendors
entered the market.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.400
So this is a very long list,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.380
that is by no means
comprehensive,

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.070
of all the vendors that were
entering this particular space.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.920
Some were specifically focused
on architectural software,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.060
while others expanded
their offerings

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.920
to the architecture
and design market.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.180
So numerous companies competed
to create and sell CAD software

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.040
to firms, including
AutoDesk, Intergraph, Bentley,

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.890
Dassault, just to name a few.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.560
So in the early 1980s,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.970
firms began adopting
computer-aided design

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.390
technologies -- some firms --

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.720
in large part because the
development and affordability

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.590
of computers occurred in
concert with years of research

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.320
and discussion within
the industry.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.950
So another thing I like
to point out is that all

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.660
of this happened, you know,
over a long period of time.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.960
There was a long period of
discussion that was occurring,

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.260
that, you know, architects
were sort

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.810
of debating what
their role would be,

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.250
how they might implement
this, whether it was worth it.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.600
There's a kind of -- there's
a lot of sort of social,

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.750
and political, and economic
considerations that go along

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.870
with all these changes
in technology.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:14.300
So, just to give you a
little bit of a view of some

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.100
of the advertising that was
going on during this period,

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.480
in the 1980s -- this is taken

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.050
from several different
journals in the mid-'80s.

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.030
And one of the things I thought
I'd mention was that the editors

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.840
of "Architectural
Technology," a publication

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.220
of The American Institute
of Architects,

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.320
organized two rounds
of CAD evaluations.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.620
They called them shoot-outs,

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.070
and published the
results in 1984 and 1986.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:40.570
They evaluated numerous programs
-- architects evaluated them,

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:44.350
and by the '84 review, AutoCAD
was already pretty acknowledged

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.150
as the de facto standard
for affordable CAD.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:55.530
And by 1986, it's noted that
most of them were expanding

00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:00.980
into giving 3D possibilities,
or 3D models of buildings,

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.870
as well as 2D plans, elevation,
and construction drawings.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.320
So one of the things
that was revealed is

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.090
that there were many
affordable options

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.400
for CAD software
in the mid-1980s.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.250
So it wasn't as easy as CAD just
-- you know, AutoCAD came in

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.550
and took over the market.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.490
There was a lot of
competition during this period,

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.500
and a lot of different
software out there,

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.570
and a lot of different
companies making this software.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.560
So -- let's see.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.690
From the 1980s through the '90s,

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.960
the substantial competition
existed,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.330
with AutoCAD really
becoming a predominant tool

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.330
within the architectural
community by the 1990s,

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.360
but by no means the only tool.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:45.660
Others have persisted, and
digital assets that produce --

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.750
produced by these programs
have a lot of value.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:52.110
One thing I would like to note
is that, during this period,

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.400
there's several preservation
things to contend with.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.150
So a lot of this
software was sold

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.550
in hardware and software
bundles.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.880
So one thing we might need
to think about is not just,

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.170
you know, providing access
to software, but thinking

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.510
about the hardware used
to access these materials,

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.080
which we would in
most cases anyway.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.750
But there's some
really interesting

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.690
and different hardware that
might've come with some

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.450
of these programs that we
would need to contend with.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.470
There's, as I mentioned before,
development or adaptation

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.750
across multiple different
fields.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.400
There's a lot of proprietary
systems that we're just starting

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.240
to see, and you'll hear
more about from Tim.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.000
I'd also argue that preserving
the context of these assets,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.360
the history of these
vendors, is very --

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.380
I think interesting,
and significant.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:39.340
There was a lot of mergers,
a lot of bankruptcy,

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:44.720
or people choosing to get out
of CAD, but also people choosing

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.940
to merge together
with another company,

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.400
because they were
stronger as one.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.530
So I think that kind of
history might also help us,

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.550
when thinking about the
challenges we're dealing with,

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.680
and just thinking about
telling a broader story

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.490
about computer-aided design
technology for architecture.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.260
So collaborating with
colleagues to identify

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.900
and address the preservation
of legacy assets is part

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.320
of the challenge we're
here to address today.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.580
And I'm very happy to
introduce my colleague, Tim,

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.630
to tell you about the 1990s.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.540
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: Good
morning, everyone.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.330
I thought I'd take a second,

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.860
if we can just together
congratulate Katy,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.510
who just successfully
defended her Ph.D. Whoo!

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.040
[ Applause ]

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.490
And on very similar topics,

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.110
so you have the right person
introducing the early days

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.410
of this to you.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:48.390
So picking up with the 1990s, I
think one thing that's important

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.810
to acknowledge is
that, you know,

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:51.440
there's some arbitrary
distinctions here.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.330
Some of the things that'll
characterize as, like,

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:57.230
from the '90s, or from the 2000s
-- it's not quite so linear.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.530
People weren't always working
on the same timeframes.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:03.350
There's a lot of trends
that stretch over time,

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.660
but that said, we'll
kind of stick

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:09.540
with the narrative for now.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.960
The '90s really saw sort
of two divergent trends.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.600
In aerospace, automotive,
engineering,

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.680
we started to see a lot
more market consolidation

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.920
around a handful of systems.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.760
This is probably largely because
in these fields, the longevity

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.280
of assets is just as, if not
more, important than, you know,

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.440
the creativity of the
design, which is, I think,

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.280
something that we'll hear
a lot more about later

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.800
on with projects like
the LOTAR project.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.990
But really, we saw quite a lot
of consolidation around tools

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:50.520
like NX, and CATIA, and Pro
ENGINEER, largely by these sort

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.030
of gigantic firms like GM,
who not only standardized

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.240
around the software, but
actually, in some cases,

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.730
you know, purchased it,
and guided its development.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:02.650
At the same time,
in architecture,

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.010
we sort of saw an explosion
of the amount of software

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.450
that was being used,
and experimentation --

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.710
you know, even people
taking software,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.220
realizing it didn't
quite meet their needs,

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.840
and sort of scripting around it,
and hacking on it a little bit.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.640
And a lot of this is
related to the development

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.890
of 32-bit operating systems
and personal computers

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.710
that actually had the
processing power to compete

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.290
against these larger, UNIX-based
mainframe applications

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.680
that had previously kind
of dominated the market.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.060
So when we get 32-bit operating
systems, like Windows NT

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.400
with more advanced
graphics capacities,

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.900
more advanced processors,

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:47.800
suddenly a desktop application
could actually be just as viable

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.870
as a mainframe application at
a significantly lower cost.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:56.000
Which opens the door to
smaller firms, to students,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.370
to people working at home, which
really kind of changes the game,

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.540
when it goes from being
basically a technician doing the

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.840
CAD, or, you know,

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.540
a very trained professional
doing the CAD to anybody.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.450
You know, where now, you
know, a student, like,

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.400
one of the first things they're
going to do is open up Rhino

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.640
and start doing 3D modeling,
and it's very, very different

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.850
than what it used to be.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.360
We also have the development
-- sort of the brief rise --

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.600
like, fast rise and brief heyday
of Silicon Graphics, which is,

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:26.580
I think, a history that has been
kind of written, but in relation

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.560
to this field, is really
important to think about.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.200
Because essentially, that meant

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.620
that there were these
commercially-available systems

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.620
that were miles and miles
beyond, in terms of 3D modeling

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.980
and animation, anything
else that was out there,

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.200
that were largely used in
other but related spheres.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.000
And I think this is
something that I'll talk

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.080
about a little bit -- I'll
keep talking about a bit.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.780
Like animation, the film
industry, special effects --

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.050
so basically, you have
software that's being written

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:01.450
for these machines that's being
used to do advanced CGI work,

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:04.790
that's then getting taken by
firms like Asymptote and applied

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.160
to do visualization of the
New York Stock Exchange,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.230
for instance, which becomes
part of a built environment.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.940
And these sort of crosses
between these disciplines,

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.480
I think, complicate the history,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.780
make it a little
more interesting.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:23.070
So some of the software that
we see in this time period --

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.070
a lot of it's not new.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:29.250
Form-Z would be an exception
here, which it came out in 1991.

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.100
But existing systems, like
MicroStation, Solid Edge,

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.290
SolidWorks, AutoCAD really sort

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.470
of developed the 3D capacities
either for the first time,

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.560
like AutoCAD comes
out with release 13.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.480
Or they sort of continue to
develop the 3D capacities

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.290
that were already there to the
point that they're actually,

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:52.380
you know, viable, commercially.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.980
And I'll talk about this more
in a minute, but, I mean,

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.990
these are some of the
systems that basically won

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.900
in this market that
Katie was talking about,

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.270
with a lot of competitors.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.760
There were a lot of
other systems out there,

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.860
but these are the ones -- you
know, they're still around.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.230
They're still in wide use.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:15.920
We also have, like I said,
this sort of parallel trend

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.100
of 3D modeling, and this
largely coming out of film,

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.050
games, special effects.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.090
So PowerAnimator becomes Alias.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.520
Alias becomes Maya.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.120
These things are basically
used to create the dinosaurs

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.290
from Jurassic Park, and
the liquid spider --

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.110
or, the liquid Terminator
from Terminator 2,

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.610
but then get applied to
architecture, and design,

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.130
and engineering, and
sort of change the way

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.290
that not only models
are being created,

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.570
but also how they're presented.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.090
Things like, you know, having --

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.090
being able to do
animated renderings,

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:50.340
and photorealistic
video walk-throughs

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.980
of what a building would be like
kind of changes the interactions

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.280
that people have with clients,

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.610
on top of how they're
actually doing the work.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.500
And a lot of this
software's still around.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.420
I mean, even big budget movies
are mostly still using things

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:06.240
like 3ds Max, Maya, which
were largely developed

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.460
for and/or bought by
AutoDesk, for the most part.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:16.550
This is a couple of the
other software programs

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:17.850
that were around.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.310
This is the desk next to mine at
work, some of the old software

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.640
that we're disk imaging.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.640
But just to show that, you
know, there are lots of names

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.430
out there, too, that you
don't necessarily remember.

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:30.730
I think I agree with Katie.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.030
I think it's a fascinating
history

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.560
that deserves a little
more attention.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.760
There was a lot of
experimentation,

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.920
and what this means is that, if
you are a place like the CCA,

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.750
where I work, or, you know,
a library archive museum,

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.850
and you're getting the
archives of these projects --

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.130
like, these are just a
few of the file extensions

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.730
and softwares [sic] that you're
potentially contending with.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.630
You know, I think
we have a tendency,

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.410
from our historical perspective
now, to think, like, oh,

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:02.010
it's like AutoCAD, and Revit,
and maybe MicroStation,

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:05.380
but there's, you know, dozens
and dozens of software programs

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.800
and file formats that
we potentially have

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.100
to contend with.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.460
Which is, I think, a thing
that we should keep in mind

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.260
when we're talking about things
like best practices for working

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.830
with these legacy collections,
you know, that file formats

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.060
like STEP are fantastic, but
it doesn't necessarily mean

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.360
that we're going
to have a converter

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.520
into these open file
formats from all

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.750
of these previous softwares
[sic] that came before.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:29.730
Some of the preservation
challenges come, again,

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:33.470
from this sort of just variety
of applications out there,

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.660
most of whom were proprietary,

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:40.150
most of whom didn't
sell that many copies.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.250
These applications are
also extremely expensive,

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.550
so it's not like
Word or something,

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.030
where you can buy
a copy off of eBay,

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.600
because it was in
almost every home.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.630
At this point, even tracking
down the software to begin

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.290
with can be a real challenge.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.580
Experimentation and
practice as well --

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.570
I think this is something --
I might be a little biased,

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.390
coming from CCA, which is
usually interested, sort of,

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:04.040
in developments in theory
and practice more than sort

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.570
of the end products
of architecture.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.530
But, you know, in
our collections,

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.260
we see from this period
a lot of scripting,

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.200
a lot of creative
experimentation with software,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.930
which means you have to
get creative in response

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.310
when you're thinking about
how you preserve access

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:21.480
to this material
over the long term.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.970
One of the things which
continues before as --

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.040
or, begins before, and
continues even now,

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.250
is that it's an extremely
protective market, which means,

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.150
like I said, the
licenses are expensive,

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.710
but also that we're dealing
with things like dongles

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.710
and hardware keys, where
the application won't work

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.120
if you just have a copy of
the application and a license.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.250
You also have to have
something physically plugged

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.400
in to a parallel
port or a USB port.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.020
So if we're thinking
about, like, oh,

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.900
maybe one potential
solution to this is,

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.340
we preserve the old software,
and we run it in emulators,

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.550
which is something we're going
to hear more about today.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.520
And there's a sort of
added layer of complexity,

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.820
because how do you -- you know,

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.260
how do you convince this
software that's not actually

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.570
running on a physical machine
that there's this dongle plugged

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.610
into a physical machine,
without actually going in

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:07.910
and cracking the software?

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:13.710
Which is not exactly allowed
by U.S. or Canadian law

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.790
without explicit permission.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.480
So these things start
to complicate some

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.100
of our potential
solutions a little bit.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.750
Proprietary hardware platforms,
like Katie was saying, too,

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.220
you know, SGI was fantastic.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.130
It was also extremely expensive,
so people like Neil Denari

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.530
in architecture only got copies
because they were hanging

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.400
out with people in
the film industry.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:37.100
So it's not like there's
a hobbyist gamer community

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:41.810
emulating these things, that
we can then use to emulate it.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.950
You know, so there's
whole challenges there.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.470
And I would say, you know,
finally, that sort of lack of,

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.410
like, fully interoperable
vendor-neutral file formats --

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.490
you have things like Ijus
[phonetic] that's long

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.790
established by this point.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:59.140
STEP is in development by
the '90s, but it doesn't mean

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.540
that all these software
programs can actually write data

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.360
into these interoperable
file formats.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.480
It doesn't mean that data
isn't lost in that migration.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.770
So just a thing to keep in mind.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:13.930
As we go into the
2000s, essentially,

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.880
we see sort of further
development of these tools,

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.710
especially around 3D
modeling and scripting.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.740
Probably the biggest
thing, though,

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.180
is just a wider adoption,

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.290
that these software
programs get more advanced

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.190
because there's more
time, but also more money,

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.350
because the market's bigger.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.840
We see the development of things
like SketchUp and Rhinoceros

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.900
that really lower the barrier to
entry for things like modeling.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.390
Also, a lot of really
interesting automated

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.850
fabrication, 3D printing --

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.050
so people start to play with
materials a little more,

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.420
think about what can change
on the construction site,

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.840
what can change in the process
of creating the materials

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.330
that ultimately go to the site.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:57.950
One of the biggest things, which
actually starts in the '90s,

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.950
really -- technically maybe
before with AutoLISP --

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:04.660
but is a -- this, like, sort of
experimentation with scripting.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.550
So in the '90s, you know, if you
look at a software like Maya,

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.010
which is largely used
for, like, animation

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.950
and special effects
work, but tends to get --

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:17.040
like, gets used in
architecture and design as well,

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.170
you no longer have to program
outside of it and figure out how

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.350
to interact with the program.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.070
They start to build in
capacity for scripting.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:29.500
So Maya has the Maya
embedded language, or, like,

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.110
MEL language, so you
can actually script

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.110
within the program to do
things like generative design.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:35.410
That eventually gives way

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.710
to more standard programming
languages, like Python,

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.090
and then, you know,
in the 2010s,

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.210
like Aliza will talk about,
that gives way to even sort

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.160
of easier methods of scripting.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.200
So they start -- these
things that people were doing

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.320
as experimental practice in the
'90s start to become normalized

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.040
as part of, like,
typical practice.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.730
And finally, but certainly
not least for the 2000s,

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.780
we see the real development
of BIM.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.780
If you look at the sort
of AIA membership surveys

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.610
at this point, you realize

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.350
that basically Revit gets
developed in the 2000s.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:15.910
ArchiCAD becomes, you know,
fully unarguably BIM software

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:21.240
at this point, but not that
many people are using it yet,

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.000
except for the really
large firms.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.300
So something like, you know,

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.940
16% of architectural firms
are using BIM software

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:31.190
by the mid-2000s, but
IFC is in development.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:32.490
The software's there.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.210
There's a lot of
evangelizing going on,

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.120
a lot of discussion going
on, which sort of leads us

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.860
up to the current moment.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:45.540
So unique preservation
challenges for the 2000s --

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.040
you know, all this use of
scripting, of parametricism,

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.090
of experimentation around
the software means a lot

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:53.630
of dependencies, and a lot of
data that's potentially lost

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.790
if we migrate between formats.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.690
Always complicates things.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.870
We have much more
complex workflows, which,

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:04.820
for someone like me, means
I might get what appears

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.470
to be the same model in
four different file formats

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.390
from four different
software packages,

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.280
and unless you have
documentation from the project,

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.110
you don't necessarily
know what the order

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:15.640
that things happened in was.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.030
Because they might be doing
initial modeling in one thing,

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.350
and then porting it to
something else for rendering,

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:21.840
and porting it to
something else for creation

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.420
of construction drawings,

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.900
and sometimes it's a lot
more complex than that.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.200
So it starts to -- we start

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.050
to need quite a lot
more documentation

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.350
to understand the
work processes.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:35.010
A vast increase in the number
of files and file size --

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.770
so at this point,

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.780
as the software gets
a lot more complex,

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.560
the assets get a lot bigger,

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.680
which has real sort
of economic concerns.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.210
Which, I think, when --
especially when we're talking

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.420
about the cultural sector, has
a big impact when we're talking

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.550
about collecting, because we
have to actually be able to pay

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.310
for all this redundant storage

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.580
to meet our digital
preservation best practices.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.320
And finally, a challenge
that I think is not related

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.440
to just architecture, and
engineering, and design,

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.680
but certainly universal,
is partially

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.200
because these files
were so much bigger,

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.570
there was so much more
data, people didn't want

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:09.780
to keep the stuff on their
computers and servers anymore.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.850
And people were told that it
was best practice in the 2000s

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.400
to use things like Archival
Gold CDs that were guaranteed

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:22.440
for 300 years, that I can't read
10 years later, and LTO tape,

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.740
which degrades over time.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.920
You know, there was a
really common practice --

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.250
a lot of architects were
like, we'll burn our archive

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.870
to CDs now, and these are things

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.490
that we have to contend
with now.

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:35.310
It basically means that
there's a ticking clock,

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.890
where a lot of data's sitting

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.040
on removable media that's
in people's closets.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.270
It's under the stairs.

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.430
It's rapidly degrading, and
things have to get migrated off

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:47.560
if we want to even have the
assets around to begin with,

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.580
in order to preserve and
provide access to them.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.780
And with that, I will
leave it to Aliza

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.040
to very competently
continue the talk.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.840
Thank you.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.460
[ Applause ]

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.610
&gt;&gt; Aliza Leventhal: So as
you see, the zoo continues.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.910
It doesn't get smaller.

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:09.790
It continues to grow, and
these are just a sampling

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.590
of some of the software.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.390
I am the archivist
for Sasaki Associates,

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.880
which is an interdisciplinary
design firm

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.590
that includes planners,
landscape architects,

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.910
graphic designers, including
environmental graphics,

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.210
lots of architects.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:28.660
And so, as a result, this
is a pretty good assessment

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.460
of the software that
we use at my firm.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.460
It's not everything, but
it's a good assessment,

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.330
which also tells you
that there's some --

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.390
while we have a skew
towards architecture,

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.700
a lot of these tools and
resources are being used

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.040
by the other disciplines
as well,

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.460
mostly because you can't design
a building and not have a way

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.410
to put what the landscape is
going to be in that same model.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:50.710
It's impossible.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.010
You can't really do that.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:53.310
It's a bad idea.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:54.960
Well, I guess you can do it,
but I don't recommend it.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.780
And so it's important to
understand that this is not --

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.280
we're not looking at a
microcosm of our system.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.850
It's a larger ecosystem, and
these software are working

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:09.870
in between different
disciplines.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:11.750
But the important thing
also to think about is

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:17.610
that as some software, like
Revit, is becoming more robust

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:21.030
and heavier, clunkier,
bigger, can handle more data.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:23.360
We're also getting really light
things like Tim mentioned,

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.850
of Rhino and SketchUp, that
are really easy plug-and-play,

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:29.010
which I'll talk about
in just a second.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:32.460
That facilitate much
easier access,

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.290
and for you to do different
things at different times.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.350
And so the workflow issues
that Tim's talking about --

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:39.510
talked about just a minute
ago get more complex,

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.000
because you're like, oh,
I see a SketchUp file.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.030
That was only during
schematic design.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.330
Great. Nope.

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.410
Nope. That's not the case,
because sometimes you'll want

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:47.960
to do a piece of that
massing in SketchUp,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.260
and then import it into Revit.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.110
And then it's there, and now
you're building on top of that.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:53.450
So it's a very confusing --

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.800
and I'm sorry for everyone
who is not familiar

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.100
with all of these software.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.400
I'm going to explain
them in just a second.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.700
My apologies.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.810
But the workflow is
really confusing,

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.190
because you might
think that you know

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.860
when something was used based on
what the software is capable of,

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:09.490
but it's kind of a -- you
know, the Wild West continues.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:10.870
We thought it was only
really in the '90s,

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:14.080
when everyone could sort of
hack and break their software,

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.880
but it's continued to evolve.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.810
It wasn't an anomaly
of the '90s.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.850
It's actually the
trend, which is great,

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.240
but two of the main
things that come

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.140
out of the 2010s is
really parametric design,

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.600
and computational design,
and visual scripting.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.670
Visual scripting is
particularly interesting,

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:30.390
and comes a little bit
later, so we'll focus

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:31.890
on parametric design for now.

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:35.290
The software that's
included on this list --

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:37.660
the large blue R is Revit.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.540
It is a building
information modeling system,

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.260
and it definitely has the
lion's share of the market.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.800
It is incredibly robust, because
it can handle engineering.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.180
Mechanical and structural
engineering can be added on,

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.850
or you can take those
layers off.

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:53.180
It's really helpful for that.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.890
The bumblebee, and
ladybug, and all of that --

00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:02.520
there's actually a whole zoo
that exists for energy modeling

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.460
and more environmentally
oriented data elements,

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:07.760
and -- for programming.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.880
And then Rhino and SketchUp,
as I'll explain right here,

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.450
are the much lighter-weight
softwares [sic].

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:15.340
So this should just
give you a basic primer

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:20.110
of what we're looking at, in
terms of gradation of intensity.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.440
So starting at the
top, it's much easier.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.290
You can really -- like, first
day of class in design --

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:27.710
any design program, you should
be able to just, you know,

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:29.210
hop on and start playing around.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:30.650
It'll be super confusing
at first.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:33.400
I have worked with it,
and it's very confusing.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.910
But once you understand
the lay of the ground,

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.650
it makes it much easier to
come into these other software,

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:40.470
and so you start
understanding what massing is,

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:45.810
what different layers can look
like, and different levels

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:49.880
of texture and materiality
that you can apply to it.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.640
Alternatively, we've got
Grasshopper and Dynamo.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.220
So Grasshopper came out
much earlier, and was meant

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.010
to be paired with Rhino.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.630
I'll just go there
and show you that.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:59.930
So that's helpful.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.450
So these -- Grasshopper was
designed to work with Rhino,

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.380
and Dynamo, which is this
fun four-cornered thing

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.910
that has an arrow going to
Revit, comes from AutoDesk.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:11.510
And they basically
-- sorry, yeah.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:13.120
Revit, great.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.740
They basically are intentionally
designed software to pair

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.870
with another software, which is
an entire market that evolves.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:23.620
But, a lot of the time,
the software like Revit --

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.840
Revit has just kind of made
itself this wonderful amoeba

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.910
that can just continue
to accept things in.

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:29.730
So more things can
be imported into it,

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.650
and it can handle
exporting into a different --

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:35.560
a huge range of different
file types.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.150
So it's sort of just
becoming this sponge

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:39.530
that can handle taking
everything in.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:41.280
It becomes a really
heavy software, though,

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.070
and that's really
dangerous when you're working

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:44.710
on a very large project.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.520
There's this chance for not
something to get saved back

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.410
to the file correctly, as many
people are playing with it --

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.010
not playing, working in it.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.250
And -- you know, and
so it can become --

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:58.020
it can become much more complex
and difficult to parse apart,

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.070
and find where the errors
happened, because you're working

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:01.370
on a much larger scale.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:03.400
The wonderful thing that
comes with visual scripting is

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.380
that it allows designers to
very quickly get into that --

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:10.500
the landscape of
programming, and providing some

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.510
of the automation that the
1970s had hoped computers would

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:14.810
offer them.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.190
Because if you've ever worked
in any of these software,

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:19.090
you know you don't want to
really be the one that has

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.610
to number every single
room in a dorm

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.470
as you're working
on the floor plan.

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.560
And so that's one of the things
that Dynamo can do for you,

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.030
is like, we'll automatically
create that --

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:30.140
if you run that script, it
can create numbering systems.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.620
And so it lightens the load
for the designer to not have

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.580
to focus on these
granular details

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.430
that you really don't want
to mess up, and instead,

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:39.300
you can rely on the strength
of the computer to fix

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.480
that for you, if you've
applied that element.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.860
So that's a really hopeful
thing that's come about,

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.260
but it does create a lot of
layers of issues that I'll talk

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.660
about in just a second.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.120
This is the layer of issue.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.110
So this looks really
simple and clean, right?

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:53.700
Oh, obviously, one-to-one.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.890
Yeah, that's super, except
that's not really what happens.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:59.980
This is an actual diagram
from our sustainability lead

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.550
in my firm, and she created it
to explain how certain data goes

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.260
from one area to
another in order for you

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.410
to create certain energy
modeling assessments.

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:14.360
And so, I'm not going to get
into all of the various critters

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.990
on the screen, but the important
thing to understand is that,

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:21.520
it is a really complex problem
that we're dealing with.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.820
Because this is just for
her part of a project.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:29.470
Like, that is a very small
portion of a much larger animal,

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.510
and we're not even at
construction administration yet.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.020
Like, this is during
design phase.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.870
You know, so -- and for everyone
who might not know every --

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:38.380
might not understand
the full phases,

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.910
there's schematic design, which
is where you'd want to just play

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.580
around with massing and come
up with a general concept.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.050
There's design documents.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.540
That's when you're working
more in honing the design,

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.940
and really cleaning --
clearing it up, and then you get

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:52.240
into construction documents.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.830
And that's when things get
really firm and more concrete,

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:57.280
to actually then make
it into concrete.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:02.250
And so this comes much earlier
than the actual concrete moment,

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.220
but -- like, this
is the landscape

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.520
that we're dealing with.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.140
And I can tell you,
it's terrifying to me.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.440
I'm sorry.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.830
That probably doesn't make
anyone here feel very good,

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:15.890
but -- [laughter] but it's
a scary space to be in,

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.490
to recognize that when
you accept these files in,

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.850
even at my firm, there's
a good chance that some

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:24.100
of these won't have these
saved to our billable drive.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.040
It'll be something that she
was working on on the side

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.030
in this case of the
sustainability coordinator,

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.060
just testing something
out, and then maybe

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.360
that doesn't get back.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.970
And so, I mean, that's, like,

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.740
one orphan record
kind of situation.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.990
But for someone at a
collecting institution,

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:41.880
that becomes a much bigger
issue, and it's something

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.020
that needs to be talked
about in terms of appraisal.

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.450
Which is not what I'm
here to talk to you about,

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:47.540
so I promise I'll stop there.

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.540
We'll continue with the primer.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.860
That's just a nice
little doom and gloom

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.160
for everyone to keep in mind.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.070
So then, more doom and
gloom, but also excitement,

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:58.130
is that now we're
moving towards the cloud,

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:01.430
and it's a more collaborative
environment, higher impact

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:02.980
in terms of -- firms can work

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:04.300
across the country
with each other.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.920
They can work across the world
with one another using platforms

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.080
like GreenBIM and A360.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.490
I include Adobe Creative Cloud,

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:15.030
because it's also an incredibly
robust cloud-based suite.

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.960
And basically, what we need
to be worried about here is

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.460
who owns these records,
because they're being hosted

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.760
on their server.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.490
And it's not that
I think that any --

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:27.130
the servers aren't trustworthy,
or have poor security,

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.320
or anything like that,
but it's about figuring

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.620
out the right regulations.

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.340
If we're the prime on a project,
and we have subconsultants

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.850
that need to have
access to certain parts,

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:40.920
how do we protect our
model from any, you know,

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.440
mischievous goings-on?

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.010
And so, you have to keep that
in mind as we think about --

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:47.970
well, the model -- the business
model then also changes.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:50.560
So the expense is going back
up, because not only do you have

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.500
to have your copy of Revit
2018, but then you also have

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.900
to pay separately for A360.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.540
So now a firm that would
normally pay a set price

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.960
for one year for that person

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.790
to have one thing is now
paying basically double

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:05.180
that for every single person
who needs access to it,

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.160
because of the way that the
subscription model has been

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.460
set up.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:10.800
And as software becomes
software as a service,

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.690
and subscription models rather
than, you buy that software

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:16.050
and you have it on your
computer, and it's something

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.350
that -- oh, well, Katie's
gone onto another place,

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:20.220
so we can take her copy
and give it to Charlotte.

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.000
You know, that doesn't
work anymore,

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.220
and it's something that,
as people who are going

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.120
to be collecting this
stuff in 20 years,

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.420
need to think about now.

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:33.120
Because there has to be
a proactive solution,

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.650
because otherwise, we're
all kind of in trouble.

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:38.220
And so that's something
to keep in mind,

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.060
because we're getting
more exciting as well.

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:43.030
So A360 and BIM -- GreenBIM,

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:45.160
BIM360 that was mentioned
earlier --

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.480
they're all really
exciting platforms,

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.520
and they allow the designers to
do incredibly innovative things

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.260
as a result of being
able to work in real time

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:56.060
across the world and with each
other in different spaces.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.110
However, we need
to keep in mind --

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:59.440
what does it mean when
the project is done,

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.530
and how do you get
those records back?

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:04.770
So then, we'll talk about
something fun again,

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:07.280
which is about augmented
reality and virtual reality.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.320
These are the new ways
that firms are beginning

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.900
to communicate with clients.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:15.700
So building models is still
huge, and is really important

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.660
to materiality, and
expressing the idea,

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.150
because visual literacy isn't
something that everyone has

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:22.190
at the same level as a
designer who went through five

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:24.470
or seven years of design school.

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:29.130
And so it's great to be able
to provide a relatable way

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.790
to experience building,
and one of those is --

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:35.240
virtual reality has become
a new way of communicating.

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.630
And so sometimes, we've
been able to use it

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.510
and actually share it with our
clients, and sometimes it's just

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:41.380
for the designers to get in the
space and see what it's like.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.370
And virtual reality is really
interesting, because as you see

00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.020
on the screen, Revit
and Enscape,

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.410
you can just pull
something right in.

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:49.170
You can make a change
in a Revit model,

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:50.470
and it'll be immediately
reflected

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:53.370
in Enscape, which
is really cool.

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.310
But then you can also do that
for a SketchUp model, which --

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:58.860
SketchUp just has a little
button, and you can go

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.160
into virtual reality mode.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.640
And so, again, what
happens to that record?

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.940
Because there's no
way of knowing

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.580
that someone did the
virtual reality mode

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:05.920
of their SketchUp model.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.320
Maybe they wrote
down in context.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.330
Maybe they have it in the
meeting minutes with the client,

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.970
that they showed them
that, but it's --

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:12.390
the context is really important.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:15.560
And it's one thing to know
what the software's capable of.

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.860
It's another thing to know --

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.930
what did someone actually
do with the software?

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:20.780
That is the question,
when it comes

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.370
to understanding
what is available.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:24.120
And then augmented reality --

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.320
I was also told by somebody that
there's, like, mixed reality,

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.930
and I don't know what
that is, so I'm sorry.

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:31.590
But augmented reality is
where you apply, like --

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.060
if anyone's familiar with
the game PokÃ©mon Go,

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.780
where you basically
put a layer on top

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.080
of what you're experiencing.

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.170
So this could be really
incredible for planners who want

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:42.610
to show, like, this is what
this square could look like now,

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:45.360
or this is what the
streetscape could be going --

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.270
like, walking down, you
know, Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:48.570
They could just change things,

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.610
and so you could see what
layers get put on top of,

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:53.360
rather than sitting in
an office and looking

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.070
at a model on your table.

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:57.180
You could walk and
experience that yourself.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.170
And the potential
for that is immense.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:03.110
Like, I'm so encouraged by
what is possible, but then,

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:04.410
like, how do you save this?

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:06.040
Especially if it's
made as an application.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.570
Well, then, now we have
to worry about holding

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.730
onto a cell phone type
that this was made for.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:13.380
And as we all have experienced,
even if you're really nice

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:14.800
to your cell phone, maybe
it's not always going

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.100
to be so nice to you.

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.400
So that's something to think

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.220
about when we work
through these things.

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.440
And so, to end on
the wonderful part

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.890
of new preservation challenges,

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:26.320
you'll note these are
basically the same ones

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.670
that Tim mentioned earlier.

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:29.080
They just get more intense.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.970
So there's more scripting,
and that's great.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:33.650
It's increased the number
of dependencies, though,

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:35.560
because now we have
more data involved,

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.760
and there's more experimentation
as it has become democratized.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:44.370
So it's not only, you know,
the incredible experimental

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:46.050
and early adopters that
Tim has at the CCA --

00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:48.970
has the records of,
but now it's --

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:51.180
literally every student
can try experimenting

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:55.900
and creating these new
concept at a very low barrier.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.780
And so that just means we have a
whole lot more experimentation.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:02.400
Instead of only 10 people
messing around, got thousands.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.170
The workflows are,
like I mentioned,

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.270
as you can see, super fun.

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:08.510
Workflow number one -- and so,

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:09.990
workflows are getting
much more complex,

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.570
and that adds a whole
new spectrum

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.390
of understanding the
provenance of the records,

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:18.760
understanding the intention of
the records, and then worrying

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:22.060
about how to actually get those
records when they are done.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.160
As an Archos Ware firm, it's
a very complicated process

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.130
of getting the records
when a project completes,

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.620
because there are so many
different ways of defining

00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.120
when a project is completed.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.760
Especially if you continue
to work with a client for,

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.060
you know, 30 years -- maybe

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:36.430
that project's never
actually completed,

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.280
but then it's 30
years of records

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.740
that have not been cared for.

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.410
And that becomes much more
dangerous as we move more

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:46.200
into digital, and if
people think that it's safe

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:50.880
to leave things on CDs,
we might be in a bind.

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.280
We are in a bind.

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:57.220
So -- [laughter] and so then
the last two are a vast increase

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.000
in the number of project
files and file size,

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.640
and that means more in terms
of, like, affordability --

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.530
like, the sustainability
of an archive being able

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:08.420
to handle collecting
more material.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.620
If your first three
collections, you didn't realize

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.950
that you needed to change
your appraisal guidelines,

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:16.860
so now you have six terabytes
from, you know, Aliza Leventhal,

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:20.110
congratulations,
but that's not great

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:22.770
if you are now 45 people
in, and they also want

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:24.430
to give you all three
terabytes that they have.

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.500
If you don't have the
bandwidth to literally house it,

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.820
and you don't have the
funding to support that,

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:33.330
that becomes a problem that
we need to become better

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:35.490
at articulating, so
that we're more careful

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:37.400
in how we're curating
our collection.

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.240
Which is a dangerous thing
to say, because we don't want

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.170
to be pre-selecting too far --

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:43.560
too much, but we also need

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.600
to be protecting
ourselves for the long term.

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.710
And then, the last thing is
actually digital deliverables,

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:49.780
and that's something that
I'm really hopeful for,

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.520
and hope that we get to
talk a lot more about today,

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.250
which is that there is
now a need for this.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:56.980
So before, it was,
wouldn't that be nice?

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:58.280
Ah, this is really frustrating.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.580
I don't know what to do.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:02.710
But if these files are
becoming contract deliverables,

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:05.270
that means that, in perpetuity,
they need to be available.

00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:07.370
It's not just being kind
to our future colleagues

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:09.620
and future designers that
need to reference these.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.720
It's a legal obligation

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.990
to provide these records
for long-term access.

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.340
And so it's a call to arms,

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:17.980
not only for the preservation
community, but for designers

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.560
who are agreeing -- who are
signing these contracts, saying,

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.280
"Yep, I will definitely
give this to you

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.980
in various level of
detail BIM mode."

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.280
Yowza. All right.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.390
You need to, like, have a
way to do that, and you need

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.310
to help educate the
person who's claiming

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:36.090
that they want this file to
then be able to receive it

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:37.730
and protect it for
the long term.

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:39.810
Because that's the whole point,
is that they want to move

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:42.970
that one file to, you know,
rule them all, sort of thing.

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:44.270
That's what Revit's promise --

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:46.120
or, not Revit, but
BIM's promise,

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:49.100
was that if I have this
building information model,

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.950
I can have the designer
design it.

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:52.470
They can give it
to the contractor.

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:54.670
The contractor can build it,
add whatever notes they need

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:56.310
to in the process, and
then they can hand it

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:57.610
to the facilities manager.

00:58:57.610 --> 00:58:59.790
And that's a really
beautiful idea.

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:02.270
We're just not there yet,
but the deliverable --

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:03.850
that contract deliverable
is the thing that's going

00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:05.150
to get us there.

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:07.630
Because there's no
other way to ensure

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.600
that something will get done
unless there is a very huge

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.400
amount of liability to
not do it the right way.

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:18.000
So I know that's not a very
exciting way to end that,

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.900
but it is -- I think
it is really hopeful,

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:22.680
and I hope you also think so.

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.700
If you have questions,
feel free to ask us.

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.180
We're all really
excited for today.

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.990
This feels like a
long time coming.

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:33.510
I know we're a little
quick, so that's all.

00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:39.380
[ Applause ]

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:40.680
&gt;&gt; Kate Murray: Hi, everybody.

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.980
We all spoke really fast.

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:43.280
So we're wondering,
would you guys be willing

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.580
to take some Q&amp;A?

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.880
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: Sure.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.180
&gt;&gt; Kate Murray: Great.

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.480
So if you have questions,
we'll have mics.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.780
Questions, anyone?

00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:52.920
No questions.

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:56.000
Oh, one in the back.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.850
Phil -- yeah, you -- we will
get a longer break time,

00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:01.640
so that's okay.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.940
So --

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.650
&gt;&gt; Maybe because this was the
last thought I heard from Aliza,

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:08.390
do you have any examples,
working at Sasaki,

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:10.880
for what are deliverables
currently?

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.060
How are you -- I mean, surely
you're delivering products.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.680
What's your best least
common denominator?

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.980
&gt;&gt; Aliza Leventhal: Yeah.

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.280
So -- is this on?

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.580
Does this work already?

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:21.880
Can you hear me?

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.180
Great. Super.

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.790
Well, that's been recorded now.

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:27.010
So -- yeah.

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:30.400
So Sasaki is working with some
projects that do require it,

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.930
the -- I believe it's the BRA,

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:34.250
the Boston Redevelopment
Authority,

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.280
or whatever it has
now been renamed.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.800
We were doing a project for
them, and they were asking

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.260
for Revit as their -- or, a
BIM model as their deliverable.

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.170
And they provided the standards
that we had to comply to.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.910
So it was a very well-thought
and articulated deliverable

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:50.780
that we were able to uphold to.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:57.290
I read what they were
requiring, and it seems like --

01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:59.160
because they were -- the
client also owns a copy

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.750
of the software already, because
this is how they're planning

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.890
on moving forward, it's
a much easier option.

01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:07.530
Because they're planning on
just holding things in a version

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.000
of the software, and then
maintaining it at that level.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.040
So that changes things
a little bit for us.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.990
I don't think that's going
to be the case almost ever,

01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:17.070
in terms of, like -- if you
think a university is going

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:20.230
to keep a version of every
software that you, you know,

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:22.410
make a -- or that
you work for, like,

01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:24.190
that's kind of a crazy option.

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:26.590
But that's what I think
is going to have to happen

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:29.940
for the beginning, is that these
clients are already having a

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.240
version of the software
for themselves

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.540
to be able to read it.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.290
And then the next thing
is figuring out how --

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:37.470
how do we make this so that
it can be long-term access,

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:41.340
and it's not dependent on if
it was a 2016 or a 2017 file?

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:45.260
Because corruption does
happen at that point.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.770
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:48.070
&gt;&gt; Kate Murray: Thank you.

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:49.370
Mike --

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.200
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: Well, I might
add something real quick,

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.580
which is that if there are any
software vendors in the room,

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.140
that means there's
a business case

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.820
for licensing us
your old software,

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.860
and not just librarians
and archivists.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.770
It does come in handy,
and we would pay,

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.630
if there was an option to.

01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:09.930
&gt;&gt; Aliza Leventhal: Hint.

01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:13.030
&gt;&gt; Really, good luck.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:17.400
&gt;&gt; Kate Murray: The
mic is on the way.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.440
&gt;&gt; Aliza, you talked a little
about problems of assessing

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.000
or determining ownership
in the cloud environment,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.300
and I thought that
was fascinating.

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:33.070
And I wondered if Katie or
Tim had any comments on issues

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:37.490
about the same problem
with respect

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:43.900
to the earlier periods
that you described.

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:46.310
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: Probably not
much cloud in the '70s, yeah?

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:47.610
&gt;&gt; Katie Pierce Meyer: Yeah.

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.690
Yeah. Well, but not the
cloud, but file ownership --

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:50.990
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: Right,
ownership, okay.

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:53.720
&gt;&gt; Question doesn't go so
much to the cloud as it does

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.630
to issues about who owns what,

01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:59.480
and to what extent
they appear even

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.940
in the pre-cloud environment.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.240
&gt;&gt; Katie Pierce Meyer: I
think there's always going

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.610
to be issues of who owns what,
but I think in most cases,

01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:11.930
it'll come down to -- you
know, those were the products

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:13.710
of the firm, and so
that they own them.

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:20.200
And they have then an ability to
hand over rights to those files.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.210
I don't know -- in the case of
where I work, I'm dealing mostly

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:27.570
with printed documents, as
opposed to softwares [sic].

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.830
Tim has more experience with
software from this period.

01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:33.100
I don't know if you've run
into this particular issue.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.390
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: I don't think we
run into an issue of ownership

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.790
with the -- well,
there's an issue --

01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:41.550
there's a question about
ownership of software

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:44.940
and transferability of licenses,
if we get old files as well

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.300
as installation media
for old software.

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.740
And that's a thing that quite a
lot of people are talking about,

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.140
who are quite a lot more
legally qualified than me.

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.030
So I'll just leave that there.

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:58.750
But otherwise, I don't
think much ownership issue

01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:00.050
on that level.

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:01.880
One thing is that, you know,
there's always a question,

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.700
but I think this was true
before, of whether, you know,

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.090
the architects can also give
us the engineering records

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:08.390
and all that.

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:09.690
And that depends
on their contracts,

01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:11.330
and how they've handled that.

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:16.610
So that's sort of a
case-by-case issue.

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:20.460
Yeah. I think, in terms of
accessibility to content,

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:24.220
though, it's very similar in
that right now, I'm spending --

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.630
my team is spending quite a
lot of time basically, like,

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.870
disk imaging old media,
everything from, like,

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:33.660
zip disks, and CDs, and floppy
disks, and SyQuest cartridges,

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.690
and whatever as, like, overhead

01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:39.560
to actually getting
access to the content.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.930
And I think that
overhead is remaining.

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:43.660
It's just changing, where
now it's going to be,

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.960
you have to figure
out how to get

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.860
into these third-party
servers managed

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.860
by other people, and
get the data out.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.050
And, you know, it's not just
us that's dealing with this.

01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:56.850
The digital forensics community
is really seeing a change

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:58.740
in how they work,
from going to, like,

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.580
evidence that's physically
inscribed on a disk

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.010
to transactions being
on third-party,

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:06.070
corporate-owned cloud servers.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.270
And figuring out, like, how --

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:11.590
you know, it requires a whole
change in the way that you work,

01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:14.880
but that's just always true.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.250
You know, formats evolve,
and we evolve with them.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.550
&gt;&gt; Katie Pierce Meyer: And
I've had other concerns,

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:20.850
I guess, lately.

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.420
I've been thinking a lot
about privacy and security,

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:25.990
and providing access
to just any sort

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:27.890
of building documentation
in general.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.240
So this is something
I'd probably

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.980
like to work a little
further on,

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.280
to think about this
kind of issue.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.040
But I think that's one
thing to keep in mind, too,

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.590
is we're always talking
about data about buildings,

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:39.930
or about the built environment,
and ways that we might want

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:44.190
to be sensitive to, or need
to be legally responsible

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.740
for what we provide
access to in terms

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.390
of privately owned structures.

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:53.760
And that may have security
issues for, you know,

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.920
individuals, or society
in general.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:02.330
So that's, I guess, where
I'll leave off on that.

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:05.790
&gt;&gt; I've got one here.

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:07.520
&gt;&gt; Hi, Kate, Tim, and Aliza.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.820
It's Kurt Helfric
[assumed spelling] --

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.120
&gt;&gt; Aliza Leventhal: Hi, Kurt.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.420
&gt;&gt; -- and I just
want to thank you all

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.720
for a fantastic presentation.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.260
I mean, I think you've really
shown us so many things

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.980
that some people remember
maybe way back in the day,

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.490
but you've given us a
really great overview

01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:22.040
and assessment from today.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.000
So congratulations on that.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.780
My quick question, Aliza,
is I think you're spot-on

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.650
about the contractual
obligations as a driving force

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:35.000
for trying to get
some of these things

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.460
in standards that we can accept.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.870
I do want to share
with you something --

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.180
in my current position,
this isn't true, but in --

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:44.760
previously, at Santa
Barbara, we were very careful

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.640
as collecting repositories
never to claim

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.020
to be the legal repository

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:50.490
for the materials
we were collecting.

01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:52.130
And I think -- I
want to remind people

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:57.350
that that's still definitely the
way for research collections.

01:06:57.350 --> 01:07:00.630
The question I had,
really, is --

01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:03.250
I'm just going to
throw this out to you.

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:06.390
Do you think it's going to take
some serious legal lawsuits

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:11.970
to actually be able to then
get these things developed,

01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:16.330
or is it something we can
really reach out and work on?

01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.710
&gt;&gt; Aliza Leventhal: So I really
hope it doesn't take that,

01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:20.010
because it's terrifying.

01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:24.270
But, for instance, the
$6.1 billion revenue loss

01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:27.860
that happened for
Airbus in 2006,

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:29.360
they had a problem with CATIA.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.930
They had two different
versions being used.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:32.760
One was in Germany, one was in
France, and then when they tried

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.270
to build the plane, the
wires weren't long enough.

01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:38.650
Whoops. And so, all of
these flights got delayed,

01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:40.830
and they had to, you know,
change a bunch of things over.

01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:42.130
And these planes were
supposed to be able

01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:44.180
to handle double the capacity,
and would be able to fly

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:45.820
around the world
in one tank of gas.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.730
It was, like, you know,
this crazy awesome new plane

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.470
that they were making, and $6.1
billion is definitely a reason

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:52.170
why LOTAR now exists.

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:53.590
Super. Thank you, LOTAR.

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:55.330
But -- which also
sets a precedent.

01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:58.530
It's an ISO standard for
the aerospace industry.

01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:01.230
Sorry for everyone who isn't
as much of a nerd as I am,

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.140
as excited about LOTAR.

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.160
But that, like -- so that
set a precedent for us.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.620
And so, luckily, we have someone
to talk to us today, here --

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.850
yay -- a little bit about
what that experience is.

01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:14.720
But I think that my
Chicken Little schtick

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.760
for quite a while has been,
well, it already happened

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.030
to somebody else, with
something that's very similar

01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:20.330
to what we're dealing with.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:23.020
Shouldn't we just be able to now
proactively address this issue?

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:26.570
And I'm not quite sure
we're there quite yet,

01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:28.160
but we certainly have
the momentum now.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.930
And I think we're articulating
it in a much more effective way

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:34.530
to capture attention for this,

01:08:34.530 --> 01:08:37.230
and having the contract
deliverable also be pushing

01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:40.210
at the same time -- we're
hitting a critical moment

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:42.480
where it's now about
identifying what does

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.700
that actually look like.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.750
Because, as Tim said,
STEP is a great idea,

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.860
but it's not really realistic.

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.030
Especially -- I work within
a firm that is, you know --

01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:54.440
at any one time, they could
be working on five projects

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.150
as a person -- not as the firm.

01:08:57.150 --> 01:08:59.250
But -- and so, like, that --

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:03.130
that level of chaos and
hecticness, them to be able

01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:05.430
to then apply COBI metadata

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:08.110
on a daily basis seems
very unrealistic.

01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:09.630
And so we have to come
up with some way --

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:12.620
again, hint, vendors
-- that we should --

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:16.010
the software should be able
to account for this for them.

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:18.510
Because just like
Microsoft finally came

01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:19.930
and said, "You know what?

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:22.110
We're going to stop messing
with it every two years,

01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:24.350
so that you can't have
access to it in a forward

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.860
and backward compatibility

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:28.410
with massive data
loss or corruption."

01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:30.720
And I hope that that's where
we move, in that direction,

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.250
so that there's just a
little bit more safety

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:33.550
and security in the files.

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:37.080
The concern really is about all
this stuff that came before,

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.300
because we're at a moment where
we can help, as a groundswell,

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.700
shift it moving forward
so that software's better,

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.000
but we still have to deal

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.010
with all the crazy
that happened before.

01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:48.950
And that's why we
have Tim and Katie.

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:50.960
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: I do think that's
an important distinction,

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.390
though, and it's one we
should keep in mind today,

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:53.940
that there's sort of, like --

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:56.630
what are the best practices we
can lay down moving forward,

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:59.050
and how can we try to
make it more likely

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:02.220
that people will use
IFC and, you know,

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.640
document their workflows?

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.760
And thinking about contract
deliverables is a really --

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.140
you know, it's a really
important factor in there.

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.550
I think looking at Scandinavia,
it's also very interesting that,

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:14.430
you know, there are
countries out there

01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:17.410
that are requiring BIM files,
not just for the deliverables,

01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:18.980
but also for, like,
competition entries.

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.630
And it sort of changes
how things work.

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:26.520
But, you know, in a certain way,

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.660
we have all this older
stuff to deal with, too.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:32.320
I think it's extremely
interesting.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:36.680
Maybe it's because it's what I
deal with the most, but yeah,

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:41.420
we do kind of need two
strategies, at least.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.210
And so we're almost talking

01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:45.070
about two separate
things at that point.

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:46.800
There are a lot of
issues that continue,

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.330
especially around file formats,

01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:51.450
and their interoperability,
and their longevity.

01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:55.850
But, you know, the solution
that we do for creative,

01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:57.880
small design projects that
never got built in, like,

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.310
1992 is going to be a little
different than the solutions

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:03.270
that we have for, like,
massive infrastructural projects

01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:04.870
in 2018.

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:07.040
And that's okay, but it
means we're kind of talking

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.290
about separate things sometimes.

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:10.720
&gt;&gt; Katie Pierce Meyer: That have
some continuity between them,

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.800
hopefully, in the long term,
from a historian's perspective.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.620
&gt;&gt; Is this already on?

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.920
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:22.220
&gt;&gt; Hi, all.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.810
Thank you for a great overview.

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:26.050
So you're all practicing
archivists, as am I.

01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:28.840
I'm wondering, in light of the
many preservation challenges

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.840
that you've outlined,
what kinds of awkward

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.860
or tough conversations about
appraisal has this led to?

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:38.370
And if you feel comfortable
offering examples,

01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:41.920
I'd love to hear about them.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.220
&gt;&gt; Katie Pierce Meyer:

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.520
[Laughter] I'm actually
a practicing librarian.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.280
I'm an archivist in librarian's
clothing at the moment.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.800
But I do have, you know,

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.050
interesting conversations
about appraisal.

01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:57.390
Not probably as much as
these guys, but with one

01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:58.750
of my colleagues, Beth
Dodd [assumed spelling]

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.480
at the Alexander
Architectural Archive,

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.970
and we discuss frequently
some of these challenges.

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:05.940
And I can't think of anything
specifically off the top

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.300
of my head, although
we're currently --

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:11.550
have been doing what a lot of
people are doing, is not taking

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:14.150
in a whole lot of things as
of yet, and kind of hoping

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:16.160
and waiting to see
what will come.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.990
We have gotten a few
collections that have, you know,

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:21.540
a lot of digital
media, and we've had --

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.810
we've been working with
students of the eye school

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:26.760
and bringing their sort of
fresh eyes to these problems.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.490
But we are still kind of hoping
for some ways to move forward.

01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:33.280
The argument I've been
making for quite some time is

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.060
that no one's going
to find a solution --

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:37.320
no one person is going
to find a solution.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.200
No one organization is
going to find a solution,

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.660
and that's one reason
we've been in conversation

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.890
for quite some time, and -- I
have with others in the room,

01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:47.710
too, is I think we have
to do this collaboratively

01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:51.970
and creatively to address
both problems that Aliza

01:12:51.970 --> 01:12:53.420
and Tim just identified.

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.380
And I think that's the only way
we're going to make any headway.

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.790
So that's my schtick, I guess.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:00.730
&gt;&gt; Aliza Leventhal: I was
going to say, hilariously,

01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:03.050
we were literally talking about
this at coffee this morning.

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:04.440
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: Like an hour ago.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.740
&gt;&gt; Aliza Leventhal: Yeah.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.040
Because the appraisal
grid needs to be updated.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.340
Waverly [assumed spelling]

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.640
and Tonnie [assumed spelling]
have a wonderful book.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.940
If you haven't read
it, you really should.

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.560
It's basically the
architecture of records --

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.930
architecture and construction
records management book.

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:18.940
It's great, and they have
an appraisal grid in there

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:21.620
that is wonderful, but is
very focused on analog.

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:24.410
And so the important
thing I've been discussing

01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:28.370
with Waverly lately is how to
update that, because it's not

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:29.670
that they're create --

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:31.520
that designers are
creating new records --

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.100
as in, like, the construction
process hasn't changed

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.400
that dramatically.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.490
It's not now you
offer, like, a, like,

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:40.180
hologram of what
you're producing.

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.160
But even then, like,
we still have plans.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.320
You still have illustrative
plans.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.580
You still have renderings,
and perspectives,

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.050
and elevations, and details.

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:50.810
All those things
are still existing.

01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:52.940
It's just understanding
what are the file types

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.800
that are most likely going to be
the case, and what does it mean

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.670
to say, "Keep forever,"
versus, "You know,

01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:00.310
I don't need your
punch list for --

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:02.070
like, after statute
of limitations."

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:05.010
Like, punch list is not that
necessary for me to hold onto.

01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:07.860
Could be terribly interesting
for research, but, you know,

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:12.930
making the decision of the --

01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:15.500
what records we still
need are consistent,

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:16.800
but it's now changed.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.980
Because instead of saying, "You
need the full set," you now say,

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:22.940
"I want the central file for
Revit and all of its extras."

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.340
And I can't forget that
there's a bunch of things

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:26.640
that are connected to this file,

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.120
because if it's not
packaged correctly,

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.810
having the Revit central file
and none of the families,

01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:34.660
like -- so that would be like
not having windows or walls

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.520
or furniture, which are
what families are in Revit.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.830
So then you just kind
of have, like, a box.

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:42.080
That's the kind of
stuff that I think needs

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.640
to be sussed out more.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.610
And so the appraisal
conversations I've had

01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:48.700
with people in my firm haven't
gotten quite to that level yet,

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.580
because we're still waiting
for our files to be old enough

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.310
to need to be assessed that way.

01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:56.820
But when talking to project
teams, like, it's really --

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:58.800
there's a difference
between your working files

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.190
and your deliverable, and
the deliverable's the thing

01:15:01.190 --> 01:15:03.930
that we're legally required to
provide if something happens.

01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:08.080
And so making sure everyone
in the room understands that,

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:11.470
going back to Kurt's point of,
like, the legal requirements

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:15.120
for the files, is
really important here.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.420
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: Yeah.

01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:17.720
I think there's a couple
things to consider.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.140
One that may not be so
obvious for the people

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:23.420
who don't do sort of,
like, digital preservation

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:27.230
in the cultural sphere is the
significant overhead that goes

01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:29.380
into preserving files
for the long-term.

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:30.680
Like, basically all

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.810
of our digital preservation
best practices require lots,

01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:35.320
and lots, and lots of
replication of files.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.560
So if we're talking to a
donor, and they're like, "Yeah,

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.630
I want to give you everything
that's on my servers,

01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:42.580
and it's 10 terabytes," that
-- in our underlying storage,

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.110
when we account for the
fact that formats are kept

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:47.760
in the original format, and
also migrated to file formats

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.550
that are more likely to be
usable over the long term.

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:52.550
And then all of those
things are replicated

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:55.780
across different media types,
and geographically replicated,

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:57.820
so that we don't have a
single point of failure.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.280
We can do things like audit the
files over time, restore them

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.800
from backups if they change.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.180
All of that has a
significant overhead,

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.480
and it' significantly expensive.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.110
So it means that we have to
be more careful, versus, like,

01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:10.830
a paper drawing that goes into
a climate-controlled vault.

01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:16.170
I think it, again, sort of just
depends on the material, though.

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:19.010
Part of it is also -- like, I
agree with Aliza that, you know,

01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:21.970
thinking about sending --
updating the appraisal grid,

01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:25.330
so that we can think about
what's actually worth keeping,

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:28.470
is really important, that
there are a lot of things

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:30.730
like externally-referenced
files and dependencies

01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:32.030
that you don't want to break.

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:33.330
So that means that you have
to know what you're doing

01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:35.800
when you're interacting with the
material, but at the same time,

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.790
with paper records, we
never kept anything, either.

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:39.470
It's sort of the difference
between an archivist

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:42.180
and being a hoarder, is,
like, you identify the things

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:44.710
that have permanent
value, and you keep those.

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:46.590
But we don't need to keep
every draft of everything.

01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:48.580
We don't need to
-- so this diagram

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.480
that Aliza showed, it's big.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.780
It's complex.

01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.080
It doesn't mean that we have

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.750
to keep everything that's ever
been created in perpetuity,

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:56.560
especially in this world

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.250
where things are,
like, more networked.

01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:59.600
The files are bigger.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.500
So I think we have a lot of
critical reflection to do

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.030
about that, and it's really
good to have a standard

01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:05.330
like the appraisal grid.

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:08.390
I also think it just
depends on your institution.

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:09.910
Like, who are your researchers,

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:12.690
and what are they
going to be doing?

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:14.790
If you want to make sure

01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:17.520
that you have plans
around, PDFs might be fine.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.340
If you want to make sure
that people can go in

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.330
and reuse the data, then
you're going to have

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:24.320
to keep something a lot heavier.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:27.960
So it all really
sort of depends.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.040
I'll say for the old
stuff, our strategy,

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:33.440
largely through a project called
Archaeology of the Digital

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.230
that the CCA did with Greg Lynn
over a period of about five,

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:39.100
was basically to
identify the key projects

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.870
that we thought were
interesting and innovative

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:43.970
from the early days
and go grab everything.

01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:45.360
But that's a lot more feasible

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.580
when everything is a
computer that's been sitting

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:50.570
in someone's closet for
a while, or, like --

01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:54.920
you know, I think the largest
one is probably about 500 gigs.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.940
A lot of them are,
like, 10 gigs.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.960
So there, we can just kind of
go in and vacuum everything up,

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.360
and I think for the old
stuff, we kind of need to do

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.080
that when we have the chance.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.670
Because, collectively,

01:18:05.670 --> 01:18:07.480
collecting institutions
should've been doing this for,

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:11.720
like, 10 or 15 years by
now, and it's kind of close

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.020
to too late for some of it.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:14.370
Like, the media's
already degrading.

01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:16.590
People already retired,
moved on, whatever.

01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:22.110
For the newer stuff, we have
to be a lot more careful.

01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:25.030
Like -- because when we
talk to donors now, yeah,

01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:28.140
usually the assumption at the
beginning on their part is

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:29.440
that we'll want everything,

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.540
because we're collecting
the total archive.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.920
But we can't afford that.

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.220
It's not feasible.

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.520
I don't think it's good
for our researchers

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:40.280
to just present them with,
like, you know, 700,000 files.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.910
No matter how you index
it, that's not going

01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:46.000
to be helpful to anybody.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.850
So, yeah. But it's
a work in progress.

01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:50.630
&gt;&gt; Katie Pierce Meyer: Yeah,
just to add a little bit more,

01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:53.590
I agree with these guys,
but this is where --

01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:55.810
I also have been having a lot
of conversations with a lot

01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:57.830
of different people,
including some people in firms,

01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:59.360
and colleagues elsewhere.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.880
And I just like the idea
of getting it out there

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.650
to some extent that everyone's
always appraising their stuff,

01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:07.400
all the time.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.890
You know, long before it gets
to the point of a curator

01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:12.480
and archivist actually having
that conversation with someone,

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.160
decisions have been made
in a firm about records

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.790
that have implications for
whether we can save it at all.

01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:22.500
And so there's some
sort of education,

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.990
or conversations I want to be
having with architects to think

01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:28.000
about how they're
keeping their own things.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.960
What has value in the way
that they're doing their work?

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.840
And that can inform what we
choose to take on later on,

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.820
and I think it is
very context-specific.

01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:39.250
Like, I think it's going to be
different in different places,

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:42.640
both what firms you're looking
at, or, you know, who --

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.690
what individuals, and also
the collecting repository.

01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:48.120
And so I think there's
also some opportunities

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.140
for thinking across
repositories.

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:52.190
How we might be doing
this kind of work,

01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:53.760
and what we're capturing

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.320
about the built environment
generally doesn't have

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.990
to be the same in all cases,
but it should be able to speak

01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:02.290
to each other in some ways.

01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:06.640
&gt;&gt; So thank you,
Katie, Aliza, and Tim,

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.110
for our wonderful
kickoff for this morning.

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:13.350
The history -- I learned
a tremendous amount

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.160
of material myself.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:20.880
We are right at 10:20, so now
is the time for a morning break.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.530
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
Hello, I'm Kristine Fallon,

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:24.040
a moderator for this session.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.940
I'm a fellow of the American
Institute of Architects.

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.630
I've devoted my 40-year
career to the topic

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:33.740
of computer applications
in designing construction.

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:37.490
I also did a very early
study and proof of concept

01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:41.140
on collecting, archiving, and
exhibiting digital design data

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.680
for the curatorial
department of architecture

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.040
at the Art Institute of Chicago.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.510
We have two presentations today.

01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:53.900
Our first speaker will
be Greg Schleusner, AIA.

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:55.790
He's the principal and director

01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:58.020
of design technology
innovation at HOK.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:02.230
He's also director of
Building Smart Initiatives

01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:06.030
for the BIM Forum, and leader of
the technical room within the --

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:08.910
within Building Smart
International.

01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:12.480
Our second presentation was
put together by Rick Zuray,

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:16.160
who's a technical principal at
Boeing involved in quality, CAD,

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:20.180
CAM, CAI, industry data
standards, and R&amp;D.

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:24.080
He co-chairs LOTAR
International Consortium,

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.370
developing aerospace
data standards,

01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:31.040
and he represents Boeing
on related ISO initiatives.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.640
Unfortunately, Rick isn't here,

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:39.830
so his presentation
is being done by --

01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:41.130
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher [assumed
spelling].

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:44.710
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: Phil Rocher,
who's also involved in LOTAR.

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:47.510
But first, Greg Schleusner.

01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:50.540
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: Thank you.

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:58.670
So I'm going to be -- we
had a prep call for this,

01:21:58.670 --> 01:22:03.760
and I thought the comparisons
and questions that came

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.610
out of it were by far
the most interesting.

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:08.270
So my presentation is really
to set the stage of --

01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:10.670
you know, sort of making sure
it's clear what we're doing

01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:13.370
today at HOK, the things
we're thinking about.

01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:15.770
But I think the meat of
this discussion really comes

01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:18.340
from the interaction
between those two things.

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:20.800
I'm explaining why my
presentation is so short.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.100
I'll put it that way.

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:26.650
So a little bit about HOK --
so not only are we, you know,

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:29.620
sort of a large architecture
engineering firm,

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:33.910
we showed up on that last set
of slides in the '70s and '80s.

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:36.400
I would have to check,
but I'm not certain

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.810
if we ever actually sold
a single seat of HOK Draw

01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:41.390
or Draw Vision, which
were the UNIX-based

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:44.800
and the Windows-based
applications that we had.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:49.500
But in a previous life, and up
until I joined HOK in 2008 --

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.960
2010, we had people using
these systems still internally,

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.260
because they liked them better

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.860
than the other things
we had access to.

01:22:56.860 --> 01:23:01.890
So we do have a very
interesting problem ourselves

01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:06.540
with archival data, but
we were smart enough

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:09.830
to make it interoperable
with EWG a long time ago.

01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:13.030
So HOK is, like I'm showing

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.200
on the slide here,
about 1800 people.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.560
We work on pretty
much everything,

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:20.230
save maybe industrial.

01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:24.200
That's probably the only thing
I'm aware that we don't do,

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:28.980
and we're spread out about
24 offices around the world.

01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:33.980
So thanks for the introduction.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:38.140
I like cats is the only thing
I'll probably add on there.

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.780
I actually don't own a cat,

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:43.280
but that's secondary
-- separate discussion.

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.810
So I've been around
at HOK for 2000 --

01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:50.330
since 2008, which is sort of
a weird time to join a firm,

01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:53.230
given the economy at the time.

01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:58.140
But based on the previous
discussions, it was, you know,

01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.780
sort of made clear to me that
we used to have a librarian.

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.080
We used to have an archivist,

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.440
but now we just have
technologists.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.800
And we've not figured
out how to, you know,

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.110
sort of move past that,

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:11.840
and I actually think it's
a very interesting part

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.140
of the discussion.

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:14.440
Okay, so it was very clear,

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.020
and I think the presentations
helped set the stage for this,

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.330
is we definitely
think in projects.

01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:23.790
We don't think about
a big strategy

01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:28.130
of making sure we have continuum
of information across projects.

01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:30.090
There's a lot of people
that think that, oh,

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:31.820
we did that detail
in that project,

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.160
and that certainly
does take place,

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.060
but that's individual knowledge.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.500
That's personal knowledge.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.880
It's not something
that's institutionalized,

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.180
memorialized anywhere.

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:44.470
And frankly, the technologies
don't exist to enable

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:48.380
that in the first place,
and I think the key thing

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:50.430
that was definitely
made clear on the --

01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:56.030
in the 2010s is this
unique production process.

01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:59.340
We often use the same
tools project to project,

01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:02.010
but there is certainly no
such thing as a standard

01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:05.230
when it comes to what
information is captured,

01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:07.500
how information is developed.

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:13.220
We're very much a right tool
for the project sort of a firm.

01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:15.980
That certainly doesn't
make it easy for us

01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:18.400
on the technology side to
make it easier for the teams

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.010
to interoperate between
platforms.

01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:21.680
And that actually is --

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.980
the linked discussion
we're having here is,

01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:28.300
the business drivers are
starting to make sense for us

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:32.170
to think about making
data more interoperable,

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:35.870
and what are the things that we
need to start to do to do that?

01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:38.440
And that, to me, at least,
is a part of the discussion

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.770
about how an archival
process could become easier,

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:46.980
because I'm -- generally sort
of look to the, you know,

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.220
sort of aerospace
industries and others.

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:52.950
And I think the business drivers
have made it easier to start

01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:58.220
to have these discussions
right now, where we're unable

01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:01.300
to find those -- find the
benefits without starting

01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.150
to think about those long-term.

01:26:03.150 --> 01:26:07.690
So from a -- just a
generally way of working --

01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:10.320
and I think we can go in
many directions with these,

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.030
but 95% of our projects
are model-based.

01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:16.220
We're moving to a
global file system.

01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:23.160
So the reason I'm bringing
that up is, from an archiving

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:26.300
as a result of work strategy,
we're moving to a system

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:29.000
that will give us
backups every 15 minutes.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.810
In everybody else's
minds, that's perfect.

01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:33.420
I don't have to think
about anything anymore.

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.970
I just work, and it's backed up.

01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:39.320
And I have a million copies of
stuff every time it's changed.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.260
And it certainly
will only get worse.

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:46.420
We're not -- from the big
design and engineering firms,

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.580
they're certainly not the first
entity to start to do this,

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:51.190
but the notion of, you
know, every 15 minutes,

01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:52.840
you have a snapshot
of everything you did

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.720
for perpetuity -- and that's
sort of our view of --

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.020
it's a short-term view.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.630
But that's definitely
the way we're going.

01:27:00.630 --> 01:27:05.330
The idea of archiving things
just doesn't make sense

01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:06.630
to people.

01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:08.050
So it's -- well,
we did the work.

01:27:08.050 --> 01:27:09.350
It's saved.

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:11.840
I can go back in a slider,
and see where it was in time.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.480
Whether you have the
information around it

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.750
that describes its state, and
which -- you know, because it's,

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:19.690
you know, 9:45 or 10:00
a.m. three years ago,

01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:21.260
who could possibly know?

01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:24.160
We are starting to do --

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:27.380
the popular term in the
industry is data lake processes,

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:31.040
but some approaches
are to use data lakes

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.660
and just take everything
and put them somewhere,

01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:35.500
which is very much an archive --

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.270
don't do anything before
processing the data

01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:39.720
archive strategy.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.920
Because we're starting to
see a business driver --

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.140
and this is the piece
that I'm most focused on,

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:48.830
is a business driver to
making the data interoperable

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.160
or accessible.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.080
So, simple example.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.270
We get asked by clients
-- we do hospitals.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.690
What does the OR look --
what do these ORs look

01:27:57.690 --> 01:28:00.520
like in the last 20
projects you've worked on?

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.370
This is a three-day
intern question, typically.

01:28:03.370 --> 01:28:07.380
That should be a, you know,
half-hour, sit down in front

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:10.730
of a computer, and
write a query question.

01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:16.570
But that question -- certainly
we can have the non-geometric

01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:19.450
information, but then
you've dissociated

01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:20.750
with it the actual design.

01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:23.250
So from a technology
perspective, we're starting

01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:26.150
to look at tools that will
actually allow us to ask

01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:28.760
that question, and both
get the geometric result

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.060
and the information.

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:34.580
And that's, to us, a very
beneficial way of, you know,

01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:37.120
sort of as a firm our size,

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.970
thinking about that
sort of problem.

01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:44.920
So we can certainly go into
that further in the discussion.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:49.030
And that -- there's a
question that always comes up,

01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:55.150
because buildings -- or, HOK was
one of the original founders,

01:28:55.150 --> 01:28:59.710
along with others, AutoDesk --
I'm blanking on a few others.

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:04.370
Honeywell -- of AIIAI,
which became Building Smart,

01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:07.480
about whether or not our
processes are IFC-driven,

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.370
you know, using these
open tools.

01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:11.170
One of the things that
we're finding is a lot

01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:13.760
of the processes don't
result in the use of them,

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.820
so we're starting to have
that discussion as well,

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:20.250
about whether we need to be
more proactive with the industry

01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:22.450
to make IFC part of that.

01:29:22.450 --> 01:29:26.260
So that's a -- would come up
in a question, so I just want

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:27.970
to make sure I mentioned that.

01:29:27.970 --> 01:29:29.530
So, last one.

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:34.300
I like cats.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:37.080
And this is complete
post-rationalization.

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.700
I just like this one,
but particularly,

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.470
I have a technique I
use in presentations,

01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:45.400
which is actually just
combine the topic of a slide

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.460
with the word cat, and
you search the internet,

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.980
and you can always
find a result.

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:52.210
There's actually -- in
the image-based result.

01:29:52.210 --> 01:29:56.230
And this one in particular was
obviously laser-scanning cats,

01:29:56.230 --> 01:30:02.190
but it's a very meaningful
-- it's actually, you know,

01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:05.570
in the where we are
thinking about going, and --

01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:08.600
within Building Smart, and
starting to get back into it

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.490
at HOK, the concepts
around linked data

01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:12.690
and semantic web
technologies as a means

01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:15.690
to help describe this context.

01:30:15.690 --> 01:30:18.940
One of the most often used
linked data concepts is cat is

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:21.080
an animal -- you know,
sort of the diagram.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.920
So that's a -- like I said, a
very good post-rationalization.

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:28.200
So I'm going to stop
there, and we'll go

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.500
on to the next presenter.

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:31.710
And we'll have a
nice conversation.

01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:33.510
Thank you.

01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:48.090
[ Applause ]

01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:50.840
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: I'm
standing in for Rick Zuray.

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.630
I have worked with Rick for --

01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:55.460
I don't know, probably
20 years or so.

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:58.700
First, I have to mention to you,
though, if you feel a rumbling,

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.000
it's not an earthquake.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.300
It's my stomach.

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:05.490
So -- something that Aliza
had mentioned earlier --

01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:08.100
she had mentioned a
problem that Airbus had had

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:13.580
with their computer-aided design
system, CATIA from Dassault,

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.610
and the billion-dollar --

01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:19.590
many-billion-dollar
problem that it caused.

01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:21.790
And Airbus is one
of my customers,

01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:24.330
as is Boeing as well, obviously.

01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:28.450
There were other surprising
things regarding the

01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:30.210
A380 aircraft.

01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:34.770
A gentleman I used to work with
who worked at Pratt &amp; Whitney,

01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:38.880
who was the engine partner on
the A380, one day, he calls me.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.610
He goes, "They had the first
A380 test flight today."

01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:43.920
And I was going, "Great!

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.220
Everything went all right?"

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.520
He goes, "Yeah."

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:49.210
He says, "And the plane was
only 20 tons overweight."

01:31:49.210 --> 01:31:51.870
Nope, that was -- here
we are in, you know,

01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:55.740
the computer-aided design
and manufacturing generation,

01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:59.080
and the aircraft was
20 tons overweight.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.920
And I was going,
"It even took off?"

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.220
He goes, "Oh, of course it did."

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:05.450
He says, "You know, there's
lots of room for error."

01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:09.050
And that -- 20 tons, you know?

01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:10.350
How many cars is that?

01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:11.710
That's a lot of cars.

01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:16.890
But anyway, despite that
we're in the digital age,

01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:23.530
and the example of the wiring
harness snafu at Airbus,

01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:28.180
using the same CAD system
at two different locations,

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:31.440
and having problems, is
still pretty typical.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:37.780
I think my message today has
to do with interoperability

01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:39.840
through the use of standards.

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:43.750
The primary standard we use
-- not the only standard,

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:46.750
but one of the primary
standards we use in aerospace

01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:49.760
and defense is the
ISO STEP standard.

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:54.120
And I'm going to talk
about two use cases today.

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:58.470
One has to do with
collaboration between partners,

01:32:58.470 --> 01:33:00.580
and Pratt &amp; Whitney and
Airbus are partners.

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:05.620
And then also between
OEMs and their suppliers.

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.190
So I guess -- we're --

01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:17.360
y'all have probably seen
the model-based enterprise

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.950
pyramid before.

01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:21.110
You know, we've changed it

01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:26.470
to fit our particular
mode of operation.

01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:28.760
From an archival standpoint,

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.130
the main three things there are
the information requirements

01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:36.650
and business rules, the
process and systems,

01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:40.690
and the repository -- the
retention period and the format.

01:33:40.690 --> 01:33:49.230
One thing that's very important
in the A&amp;D industry to archive,

01:33:49.230 --> 01:33:51.850
and is -- well, I'll
just go ahead and say it,

01:33:51.850 --> 01:33:53.750
and then I'll talk
about it a little bit,

01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:56.340
but it is design intent.

01:33:56.340 --> 01:34:00.770
And design intent takes
many different forms.

01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:06.340
You know, some of them are
relatively easy to digitize,

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.820
like geometric dimensions
and tolerances,

01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:11.940
what we call product
manufacturing information today.

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:19.370
You know, maybe some of the
systems engineering data,

01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:23.560
maybe some parametrics in the
model, things of that nature.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:29.280
And others aren't quite so easy
to digitize and then archive,

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.200
or pass on to one
of your partners.

01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:40.520
The aerospace industry, just
like the building industry,

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:44.490
has very complex products.

01:34:44.490 --> 01:34:46.500
You know, they have -- you know,

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.270
a simple product only
has thousands of parts.

01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:51.540
A complex products
has tens of thousands

01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:54.240
of parts, maybe a million.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:35:00.000
But as the products get
more complex, it's --

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.100
also becomes more complex on
how do you retain that data

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:06.660
for many years down the road.

01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:14.560
I don't know if I like the
title of this slide or not.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.090
I would've called it "Just
an Interesting Slide,"

01:35:18.090 --> 01:35:22.380
but you have the various
Boeing aircraft programs

01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:27.270
across the top there, the
767, the 747, the 77 --

01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:30.490
the triple 7, and the 787.

01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:33.210
And the top half
of that chart kind

01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:36.360
of represents the
as-designed view,

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:40.140
and the bottom represents
the as-manufactured view.

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:42.270
And if you look at
the numbers --

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:44.790
I mean, look at the data
volume in the as designed

01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:46.350
and the as manufactured.

01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:49.170
Those are significantly
different numbers.

01:35:49.170 --> 01:35:52.750
One other thing I'll point
out is that, you know,

01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:56.080
you're looking at the parts
per airplane there, and you go,

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.970
"Well, why did it go
down from the triple 7

01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:01.720
to the 787, anyway?"

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:05.970
And that's because the
more use of composite parts

01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:07.270
in the later aircraft.

01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:11.970
So that causes it to
be down -- to go down.

01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:21.270
One last thing on this,
and this has to do

01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:23.200
with the complexity
of managing data.

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:29.610
And this is a general
comment, but up until 2005,

01:36:29.610 --> 01:36:33.490
the amount of data
that had been created

01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:36.080
in the world was
something on the order

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.710
of 500 billion gigabytes.

01:36:40.710 --> 01:36:46.090
And very soon, probably
-- maybe we are now --

01:36:46.090 --> 01:36:49.260
we'll be creating that much data
every 10 minutes in the world.

01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:51.560
So --

01:36:55.050 --> 01:37:00.870
-- early example of data
exchange, the Rosetta Stone,

01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:05.680
the same information in
three different languages.

01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:10.030
Evolving technologies --

01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:14.250
and this is kind of
aerospace-centric,

01:37:14.250 --> 01:37:23.900
but something I'm going to
throw in here is the requirement

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:28.070
by the FAA to provide the
type design data to them,

01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:31.970
or to retain it for
long periods of time.

01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:35.580
And the first generation
was the engineering drawing

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:39.100
and the authority,
or the -- to the --

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:42.490
for the FAA was the 2D drawing.

01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:46.760
We're kind of in the end of the
second generation right now.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.950
You know, we are in a 3D world.

01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:55.340
We were talking last night
that the production folks tend

01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:57.620
to still be in the 2D world.

01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:01.570
And I see a lot of
my customers --

01:38:01.570 --> 01:38:04.560
company like a Rockwell
Collins, or a Honeywell,

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:08.160
when they provide data
to one of their suppliers

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.980
to manufacture it, they'll
provide them both a --

01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:15.740
maybe a STEP file, or a CAD
model, and a 2D drawing.

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:20.340
But anyway, we're certainly
moving toward that 3D world,

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:22.960
and we are in discussion
with the FAA

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.050
about a 3D authority
for this data.

01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:31.310
Something else that's
very important to us

01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:36.200
in the A&amp;D industry is
controlling that product data.

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:40.750
And, you know, we used to be
configuration management-based,

01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:43.020
which was, you know,
somewhat paper-based.

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:48.300
You know, it was kind
of haphazard, really.

01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:51.980
The engineering intent
or the design intent was

01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:53.280
in multiple locations.

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:56.670
We moved on to product
data management,

01:38:56.670 --> 01:39:00.580
which was really a
file-based notion.

01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:05.880
You know, the engineering intent
or the design intent was still

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.860
in multiple locations.

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:10.150
And now, we're moving into more

01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:13.400
of a product life cycle
management scenario,

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.240
which is more of a
relation-based system,

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:18.610
and one nice thing about this is

01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:23.120
that we can gather all the
design intent into one location.

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.220
Having to do with
product life cycles --

01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:39.570
and, you know, different
industries have different

01:39:39.570 --> 01:39:41.870
timelines regarding this.

01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:44.650
Typically, point releases

01:39:44.650 --> 01:39:47.070
of software upgrades
are probably every three

01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:48.980
to six months.

01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:53.650
You know, major releases
are one to two years,

01:39:53.650 --> 01:39:55.220
maybe a little longer.

01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:58.300
Computer processes are
changing all the time.

01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:01.430
People are coming and
going at the company.

01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:03.680
I kind of found that
hard to believe,

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:07.000
the one that's marked
careers there at five years.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.230
And I was going, "Why
would somebody want

01:40:09.230 --> 01:40:10.720
to leave a company like Boeing?

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.660
I mean, you know, great
benefits, great pay,

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:13.960
all that kind of stuff."

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:17.400
And I looked it up, and sure
enough, it was 4.6 years,

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.820
was the average turnover
at Boeing,

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:21.650
which I found kind of amazing.

01:40:21.650 --> 01:40:26.590
But the design -- talking
about the need for archival

01:40:26.590 --> 01:40:29.410
in the A&amp;D industry,
look at the B52.

01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:33.450
The design of that
started in the late '40s.

01:40:33.450 --> 01:40:36.090
We're still flying it today.

01:40:36.090 --> 01:40:39.180
I don't really see it
going away anytime soon.

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:45.800
And we have other commercial
and defense products that are

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.780
in that same life
cycle, 707 as example.

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.080
They're still flying.

01:40:57.610 --> 01:41:00.630
From the collaboration
standpoint, Boeing has --

01:41:00.630 --> 01:41:02.880
are a lot of companies --

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.640
and it's not just an
aerospace thing, obviously.

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:07.400
I mean, look at BMW.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.830
They make cars all over the
world, and oddly enough,

01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:14.950
the largest BMW manufacturing
facility is

01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:16.870
in South Carolina, where I live.

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:20.660
And I heard that, and I was
going, "That's just amazing.

01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:24.150
The largest BMW facility in the
world is in South Carolina."

01:41:24.150 --> 01:41:29.210
But Boeing's a 24-hour operation
due to their global nature.

01:41:29.210 --> 01:41:34.380
They have hundreds of partners,
and we use the term partner

01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:38.330
to mean like a Pratt
&amp; Whitney, or a GE,

01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:40.620
or a Rockwell, or a Honeywell.

01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:43.090
And then they also have
thousands upon thousands

01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:44.500
of suppliers, you know,

01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.340
that they may make one
little bracket or something.

01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:53.680
So anyway, there's certainly a
need for kind of a standard way

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.970
of communicating among all
these partners and suppliers,

01:41:56.970 --> 01:41:59.360
due to the global
nature of Boeing.

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:05.910
So in steps the LOTAR project
here, and actually, this is kind

01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:08.490
of the introductory part to it.

01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:12.180
But we work with a number
of different organizations.

01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:18.400
We obviously work with the
ISO to create the standards.

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.160
We work with a company -- or not
-- an organization, excuse me,

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:29.520
SASIG, who has a product data
quality project going on.

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:33.170
One thing that is very
important in the A&amp;D industry,

01:42:33.170 --> 01:42:37.240
when you talk about archival,
is the ability to verify

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.700
and validate it before
you archive it, and also,

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:44.640
the ability to verify
and validate it

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.530
as you're retrieving it.

01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:50.990
And as an example of that, I
had mentioned that, you know,

01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:56.760
kind of a cornerstone for us
are the ISO STEP standards.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.880
They didn't really
have much verification

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:03.070
and validation stuff in them.

01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:08.940
We've extended the data models
that we use considerably,

01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:15.710
and I would imagine that about
25% of the physical files

01:43:15.710 --> 01:43:19.820
that we write out in the
STEP format today are --

01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:22.170
just had to do with
verification and validation

01:43:22.170 --> 01:43:23.980
of the data that's in the file.

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:26.340
So, like I said,
that's very important

01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:28.540
to the aerospace industry.

01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:33.520
I talked about the
model-centric data management,

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:35.710
the model-based enterprise
a little earlier.

01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:38.780
NIST is certainly one of
our partners in all of this,

01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:43.440
and I think they've been very
heavily involved with the IFC

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:45.130
and BIM over the
years, as well --

01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:47.880
probably some of the same
people that we deal with.

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.520
So it's kind of a global
community that's working

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:57.450
on this, not just, you know,
the Boeings, and the Airbuses,

01:43:57.450 --> 01:43:58.750
and the Lockheeds of the world.

01:43:58.750 --> 01:44:06.120
LOTAR Project -- boy,
where to start on this?

01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:10.920
You know what?

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.540
I'm going to skip this slide.

01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:14.840
I don't like it.

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:18.450
This is -- remember, this
isn't my presentation, so --

01:44:18.450 --> 01:44:22.530
these are the --
you know, the --

01:44:22.530 --> 01:44:23.830
I'm not going to spend
any time on this --

01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:28.020
the typical kind of questions
you ask about, you know --

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:30.150
when you're getting ready
to archive data, you know,

01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:34.710
the when, and the what, and the
-- all those kinds of things.

01:44:34.710 --> 01:44:40.200
This is a timeline of the
LOTAR Project or program.

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:44.580
In the late '90s, there
were independent efforts

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.660
in the Americas and
in Europe having to do

01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:53.160
with long-term preservation, you
know, for aerospace and defense.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:59.950
The next key date on that
happened down there in 2009.

01:44:59.950 --> 01:45:01.650
Excuse me.

01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:04.710
We started a funded
project, the LOTAR Project,

01:45:04.710 --> 01:45:08.060
between the AIA and the ASD.

01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:10.650
It's a different
AIA too, by the way.

01:45:10.650 --> 01:45:12.780
Why is there two, anyway?

01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:14.170
&gt;&gt; Confusion.

01:45:14.170 --> 01:45:15.650
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: Which
one came first?

01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:17.250
&gt;&gt; Ours [laughter].

01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:23.270
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: My
understanding was Wilbur Wright.

01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:24.570
&gt;&gt; Predated Wilbur Wright.

01:45:24.570 --> 01:45:25.870
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: Oh.

01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:27.170
Yeah, I guess you do.

01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:32.720
Anyway, 2009, we started
the funded LOTAR program,

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:37.190
talk a little bit more in
a minute about how we work.

01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:42.600
We've been spinning off work
groups to work in specific areas

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.830
that are of importance
in the A&amp;D industry.

01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:52.440
And I'm going to touch
on that a little later.

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:57.580
Another kind of cornerstone for
us is the OAIS reference model

01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:01.160
for the LOTAR processes.

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.070
I'm sure y'all are -- some

01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:06.130
of you are intimately
familiar with that.

01:46:06.130 --> 01:46:10.230
And then, as the basis of
that, as I said earlier,

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:14.450
we use the ISO 10303
STEP standard.

01:46:15.710 --> 01:46:19.560
The work groups that we
currently have in LOTAR --

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:22.960
the newest one, engineering
analysis and simulation.

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:29.470
Wiring harness -- who do you
think drove wiring harness,

01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:31.170
anyway?

01:46:31.170 --> 01:46:33.130
It was Airbus.

01:46:33.130 --> 01:46:38.920
But metadata for archive
packages, 3D digitalization.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.220
Oh, my goodness.

01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:41.900
I don't know if I can do it.

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:45.420
Composites, advanced
manufacturing, mechanical,

01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:47.900
and product data
management, or POM.

01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:49.260
And this is just
kind of a mapping

01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:51.320
between the various work groups.

01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:54.160
In the blue there in the middle
-- that is blue, isn't it?

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.460
I'm colorblind.

01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:56.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.870
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: Are the LOTAR
parts that correspond to it.

01:46:58.870 --> 01:47:01.840
The LOTAR parts kind of talk
about what needs to be archived,

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:03.360
and how to archive it.

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.930
And then the corresponding
ISO standards,

01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:09.450
down there at the bottom.

01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:14.300
You can take a look at the
LOTAR homepage at your leisure.

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:18.160
The impact of interoperability
--

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.990
and then, this is
primarily from the --

01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:24.680
I'd call it the design and
collaboration standpoint,

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:26.690
but delivering models

01:47:26.690 --> 01:47:28.560
to the customer using
different systems,

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.700
that costs an additional
53%, or, you know,

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:35.680
causes a cost increase of that.

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.240
Supplier communication --

01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:40.610
you know, all those
things cause the price

01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:42.420
of a product to increase.

01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:47.600
And, you know, you look at the
price of a 787, or an A380,

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:52.560
and it's just considerable --
these are based on some data

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.900
that NIST had collected
a couple years ago.

01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:58.650
&gt;&gt; We have these tricks, too.

01:47:58.650 --> 01:48:03.110
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: It's
throughout industry.

01:48:03.110 --> 01:48:07.650
Benefits of using
LOTAR standard --

01:48:07.650 --> 01:48:15.250
process security for using
international standards,

01:48:15.250 --> 01:48:21.430
and the aerospace and defense
authorities accept the workflows

01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:25.370
-- the type authority,
based on our process,

01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:29.720
and the way we store data, and
what -- the format of the data.

01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:38.100
The bottom point there
-- the bottom bullet --

01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:41.620
LOTAR is kind of a funny
thing, at least to me.

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:45.430
You solve a lot of the
problems of data exchange

01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:49.170
and data sharing through the use

01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:50.930
of long-term archival
techniques.

01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:52.910
They share a lot of
the same aspects.

01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:58.640
Gee, and I thought I had
one more slide, but I don't.

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.510
But anyway, that's
my last slide.

01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:07.750
[ Applause ]

01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:09.480
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
So we're moving right

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.790
on the second section.

01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:14.020
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: This is a
follow-on to what we were --

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.910
just heard, where
we're going to hear

01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:19.010
from three different
perspectives on some

01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:22.660
of the specific issues
in the data timeline,

01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:25.430
in terms of the work that
is done in different kinds

01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:27.720
of firms and at the GSA.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.900
And we have some questions
to prompt the discussion,

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.600
and I'll start with questions --

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:35.730
I'll start with a question
directed at one of our speakers,

01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:39.530
and then each of them will also
have an opportunity to respond.

01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:43.980
We have with us Noemie
Lafaurie-Debany,

01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:45.790
who is at Balmori Associates.

01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:49.360
I can say a couple
sentences about each person,

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.770
but their bios are on
the website as well.

01:49:52.770 --> 01:49:56.650
Noemie played a role
in activating BLA Labs

01:49:56.650 --> 01:49:59.630
within Balmori Associates to
further push the boundaries

01:49:59.630 --> 01:50:02.030
of architecture, art,
and engineering --

01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:04.920
green roofs, floating
islands, temporary landscapes,

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:07.750
forms of representation,
zero-waste city,

01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:09.580
and other things as well.

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:13.340
Mark Rylander -- in addition
to the bio on the website,

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:16.690
Mark is a solo practitioner
with three active partnerships.

01:50:16.690 --> 01:50:18.680
He formed Rylander
Hoene Architects

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:20.280
to design a friend's school.

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.160
He works with Carrie Moran
[assumed spelling] AIA

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:25.460
on residential projects,
and he serves

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:27.340
as an owner's representative

01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:30.090
on a large development
project in Texas.

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:32.460
He's also currently
freelancing with a landscape

01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:35.140
and land planning firm in
Charlottesville, Virginia.

01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:38.940
And Nick Gicale is a program
manager and product owner

01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:41.400
at the General Services
Administration,

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:43.900
focusing on the implementation
of IT systems

01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:45.370
that support GSA's role

01:50:45.370 --> 01:50:48.770
in design construction
project delivery.

01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:51.130
Nick has been with
GSA since 2003,

01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:54.280
serving as a project manager on
complex construction projects

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.980
for many years before
transitioning

01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:57.910
into his current role.

01:50:57.910 --> 01:51:00.660
And I realized, I
should introduce myself.

01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:01.960
I am Ann Whiteside.

01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.440
I'm the assistant
dean and librarian

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:05.920
for information services

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:08.750
at the Harvard Library
Graduate School of Design.

01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:11.130
I've been working on and
thinking about issues related

01:51:11.130 --> 01:51:16.020
to preservation of digital
design data for a decade now,

01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:19.100
and I'm pleased to be
participating in this symposium.

01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.930
So shall we get started?

01:51:20.930 --> 01:51:22.230
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: Sure.

01:51:22.230 --> 01:51:23.530
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: All right.

01:51:23.530 --> 01:51:24.880
I'm going to start with
a question for Mark.

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:27.270
What are the challenges
of design software

01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:31.270
on your firm's workflow
and design processes?

01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:36.720
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: So
as a sole practitioner,

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:38.060
every project is a
little different.

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:42.950
We figure out what we're going
to do based on the client

01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:46.440
and the partners that we've put
together for a given project,

01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:49.300
and make do with what we have.

01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:52.460
And a moment ago, I was trying
to -- watching Phil's slides,

01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:57.210
and thinking of what we possibly
have in common with Boeing.

01:51:57.210 --> 01:52:01.890
And I looked up at the 767 that
was done with paper drawings,

01:52:01.890 --> 01:52:03.580
and then down at my
pencil, and I thought,

01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:05.740
yeah, we used to do that.

01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:08.310
We can do that, too.

01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:11.120
But by and large, we --

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:15.780
our practices represent almost
the whole history of software

01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:22.480
that anyone on our team has
worked with, and our work ranges

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:26.890
from using a lot of SketchUp,
that small companies use,

01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:32.360
to AutoCAD and Vectorworks,
and rendering software.

01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:36.690
I'll just stop there, because
there's so much I could say

01:52:36.690 --> 01:52:37.990
about the software that we use.

01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:40.770
The technical challenges you
ask about really have to do

01:52:40.770 --> 01:52:45.560
with the complexity and
the purchasing agreement.

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:49.360
So, you know, we generally
have to buy subscriptions.

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:53.740
We have to, you know, own
a lot of different kinds

01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:56.020
of software simultaneously,
and year by year,

01:52:56.020 --> 01:53:00.560
you have to really buy
more than you need --

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:05.600
a lot of feature-laden
packages, like the Adobe Suite,

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:07.550
where we only use pieces of it

01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:10.200
to put together what we
need for presentations.

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.740
So, you know, what
we would hope to see

01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.540
in the future is
something that's simplified

01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:16.840
and streamlined.

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:19.910
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: Noemie,
you want to take it up?

01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:21.580
&gt;&gt; Noemie Lafaurie-Debany: I
think that's also something

01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:26.030
that Aliza had started to
discuss earlier, is this idea

01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:29.720
of -- and the subscription
base of every software.

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:36.930
We used to have those disks
of 3D Studio Max, and AutoCAD.

01:53:36.930 --> 01:53:41.410
And if for any reason we
had to open an older file,

01:53:41.410 --> 01:53:43.820
we could always reinstall
that copy,

01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:46.260
but now that everything
is subscription-based,

01:53:46.260 --> 01:53:50.480
if we have -- in the
case of 3D Studio Max,

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:53.020
we no longer have
a current version

01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:54.320
of the software at the office.

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:57.860
If we need to open an older
file, we are incapable

01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:00.580
of doing it, even
though we created it,

01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:04.280
and it's our information
within that file.

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:10.880
And this idea of 3D Studio
Max was for a new city

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:15.820
that we had designed in Korea,
and the project was going

01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:20.320
to be put in an exhibition
in Los Angeles.

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:26.270
And we were incapable of
giving our own project,

01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:27.910
which was extremely frustrating.

01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:30.140
Of course, we have
the deliverable

01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:32.820
that you had mentioned earlier.

01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:36.450
We have PDF, and PowerPoint,
and whatever, but if --

01:54:36.450 --> 01:54:39.950
in the case of the exhibitions,
they wanted to do a 3D --

01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:43.150
printed 3D model of that city.

01:54:43.150 --> 01:54:48.530
And it was just impossible
for us to see our own data.

01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:53.500
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: Yeah, a couple
thoughts from the GSA side.

01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:56.050
We have two primary
challenges kind

01:54:56.050 --> 01:54:59.330
of implementing design software
and related software at GSA.

01:54:59.330 --> 01:55:02.900
One is that, since we
are a federal agency,

01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:05.920
all of our software that we
purchase, and that we put

01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.590
into our agreements with our
contractors and architects,

01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:11.810
has to comply with federal
IT security requirements,

01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:13.110
which can be quite onerous.

01:55:13.110 --> 01:55:15.320
And so we're always
balancing kind

01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:18.440
of giving our teams
all the tools they need

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:20.290
to get the job done,
working with our contractors

01:55:20.290 --> 01:55:23.540
and architects to kind of be
open to software that they use,

01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:27.610
but also trying to comply
with FedRAMP and FISMA.

01:55:27.610 --> 01:55:30.760
As more and more applications
go to the cloud, you know,

01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.470
we're trying to work with
industry to make sure

01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:35.350
that those applications
are working in alignment

01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:37.430
with our security requirements.

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:40.290
The other thing that we run
into a lot, also, is that --

01:55:40.290 --> 01:55:43.100
since we're an agency
that has regional offices

01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:47.630
across the country, and we run
about 10,000 projects a year,

01:55:47.630 --> 01:55:51.740
kind of every region is
basically responsible

01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:54.380
for thinking how to
run their own project.

01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:58.400
And so, getting the level of
consistency in terms of inputs

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.380
across all those project
teams, across our contracts,

01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:02.040
is something that, you know,

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.420
we're always striving
to do better at.

01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.830
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: Given
what you've all just said,

01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:09.580
are there some compelling --

01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:13.280
some compelling needs
of future software

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:17.970
that would help your design
processes and workflows?

01:56:19.810 --> 01:56:21.400
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: You know, one
of the frustrations I've had,

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:23.370
just in terms of presenting --

01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:28.080
and I'm frustrated by
the feedback here --

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:35.730
is the ability to present in
a fluid way to clients on top

01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:37.410
of the drawings that we have.

01:56:37.410 --> 01:56:42.020
There's an increasing dependence
on telecommunication, and --

01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:43.780
you want me to be closer to it?

01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:48.610
Okay. And -- you know,
so it's not uncommon,

01:56:48.610 --> 01:56:52.130
even for a sole practitioner,
to have a video conference.

01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:55.620
And I think, given the
dependence on drawing,

01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:59.280
having an integrated
touch-screen application --

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:03.180
I sort of see the
future of the iPad Pro.

01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:05.460
Like the Toshiba tablet I used
to have where you can draw

01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:08.220
on top of your own drawings
to present to a client,

01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:11.200
but do it in a really fluid
way that's touch-sensitive.

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:14.220
And that kind of technology
would be really valuable,

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:15.520
I think.

01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:18.970
I've seen -- as it
relates to SketchUp,

01:57:18.970 --> 01:57:24.000
to sort of incorporate the --
some of the technology I've seen

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.090
in Maya that General
Motors uses,

01:57:26.090 --> 01:57:29.330
where you can actually use your
freehand drawing to carve away

01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:30.810
at the model would
be really helpful.

01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:33.350
And so I've always imagined
somehow being to do --

01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:36.470
being able to do something
like that on my own desktop.

01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:40.130
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: I think, as
an owner, we want, you know,

01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:43.190
more integration between design
software and kind of the rest

01:57:43.190 --> 01:57:45.710
of the ownership life cycle.

01:57:45.710 --> 01:57:49.280
I work mainly in the
project space, but obviously,

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:50.580
we have building maintenance.

01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:52.640
We have portfolio decisions
that are being made.

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:55.930
We do a lot with lease
facilities, too, and right now,

01:57:55.930 --> 01:57:58.080
kind of all of those
things are segmented

01:57:58.080 --> 01:57:59.800
in our model of things.

01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:02.120
So bringing that all together,
either through integration,

01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:04.630
or additional functionalities
in software, is something

01:58:04.630 --> 01:58:07.730
that we're eager to work on.

01:58:07.730 --> 01:58:09.310
&gt;&gt; Noemie Lafaurie-Debany:
And something

01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:12.980
that was discussed earlier this
morning, too, was processes,

01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:18.230
and in our effort to prepare
our archive to be sent

01:58:18.230 --> 01:58:22.600
to Yale University Library, it's
something that is very important

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:24.660
to us, is how do we
document the process?

01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:29.020
How did we get to that
final phase in the design?

01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:35.020
And in Microsoft Word, you
can track your changes.

01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:39.240
We don't have HOK 15
minutes backup system

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:42.800
in our small practice,
but adding something,

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:49.890
or doing online GoTo Meeting,
or some sort of conference call

01:58:49.890 --> 01:58:51.820
where you can mark things up.

01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:56.730
There is no record of any of
this, and maybe a software

01:58:56.730 --> 01:58:59.760
that would somehow
help us document,

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:04.140
not only those final project
and deliverable, but processes,

01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:07.290
would be interesting to us.

01:59:07.290 --> 01:59:11.600
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: Do you have
somebody in your firm that --

01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:13.890
or somebodies who are
responsible for that --

01:59:13.890 --> 01:59:18.490
for any documentation like that
currently, without the software

01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:20.350
that you're looking for?

01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:23.130
&gt;&gt; Noemie Lafaurie-Debany:
So it's a very --

01:59:23.130 --> 01:59:28.630
we are preparing the archive
and the legacy of Diana Balmori,

01:59:28.630 --> 01:59:30.220
the founding principal
in our firm

01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:32.570
that passed away a year ago.

01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:37.700
And we have started this
process probably five --

01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:40.690
five years ago, or so.

01:59:40.690 --> 01:59:44.160
And the archiving process

01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:48.810
of older project is
informing the new projects

01:59:48.810 --> 01:59:53.230
that we are doing now, and how
we should keep record of them.

01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:55.530
But at the same time,
we are a small firm,

01:59:55.530 --> 02:00:00.510
and we don't have a
designated person to arrange

02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:01.850
and organize all this data.

02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:04.040
So it's kind of left
for all of us to do.

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:05.650
We have a set of standards

02:00:05.650 --> 02:00:09.830
that are never really
followed, or a naming system.

02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:16.570
It is just too hard
to keep and maintain.

02:00:16.570 --> 02:00:18.010
So we all do a little part.

02:00:18.010 --> 02:00:21.590
We all wear different hats, and
spend a couple of hours here

02:00:21.590 --> 02:00:26.970
and there preparing those
files to be sent to Yale.

02:00:26.970 --> 02:00:30.590
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: How's that
work in your firm, Mark?

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:33.240
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: On slightly
larger projects, or more --

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:35.130
for more sophisticated
clients, you know,

02:00:35.130 --> 02:00:42.270
our archiving process
tends to be a PowerPoint.

02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:46.530
Having a sequential story
that begins as a storyboard

02:00:46.530 --> 02:00:48.880
in the office, and ends up
being, you know, the best way

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:52.040
to explain how you got
to where you did kind

02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:56.730
of simultaneously presents
the work you've put together,

02:00:56.730 --> 02:00:59.970
and records the thoughts
that went into it.

02:00:59.970 --> 02:01:03.750
You can throw sketches into
the inside, and it also kind

02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:05.950
of documents that a
phase is complete.

02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:11.100
So, you know, often, a really
well thought out PowerPoint,

02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:14.380
you know, provides
a kind of closer

02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:17.170
that a big rolled-up
set of drawings doesn't.

02:01:17.170 --> 02:01:21.400
Because it forms this record
of design intent as a story,

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.320
and about the only
thing that would improve

02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:26.810
on that would be -- you
know, I think we all come

02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:29.430
up against some of
the fundamentals

02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:34.360
of operating systems, like
just opening images in Windows,

02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:37.830
and the ability to kind of
quickly scroll through images.

02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:40.720
So, you know, I would love
to be able to have software

02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:45.310
like Portfolio that -- Alias
Portfolio Wall that Alias,

02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:48.340
now AutoDesk has, where
you can pull out the images

02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:51.980
and arrange them on a
desktop, and not open a folder.

02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:54.300
Because the more organized
you are in archiving,

02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.760
and putting things in folders,
the harder it is to figure

02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:58.280
out -- where was
that great image?

02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:01.250
Which meeting was that that we
-- remember that sketch we did?

02:02:01.250 --> 02:02:03.050
And which presentation
was it in?

02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:08.480
Oh, it was in 17-11-15
under bar, you know,

02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:11.350
client presentation three, and
I think it was in the middle.

02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:14.870
And by that time, you know, you
get a phone call, and you've --

02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:18.550
you're unable to sort of connect
back to the original idea.

02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:22.590
So getting access to images
really quickly and sorting

02:02:22.590 --> 02:02:28.360
through them remains, you know
-- as was a dream in the origin

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.520
of Windows, it still remains
something that's a little

02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.530
out of reach for all of us.

02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:34.830
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: Interesting.

02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:36.350
Nick, do you want to talk
about that a little bit?

02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:37.650
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: Sure.

02:02:37.650 --> 02:02:38.950
At a product level, we try

02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:41.510
to collect everything that's
produced by our product teams,

02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:43.880
and they -- we've taken the
strategy to kind of worry

02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:47.320
about how to get to the
access of that data later.

02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.680
But for the design
phase, I mean,

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:52.800
we kind of collect
every iteration

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.770
of the formal design submissions

02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:56.890
that are specified
in our contracts.

02:02:56.890 --> 02:02:59.610
Once we get to construction,

02:02:59.610 --> 02:03:02.350
our existing enterprise
product management tool is built

02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:05.650
to collect all RFIs and
submittals that are generated

02:03:05.650 --> 02:03:09.400
on the project, as well as any
reports and other correspondence

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.640
that happens during the
course of a project.

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:14.230
So right now, at a product
level, we're trying to track all

02:03:14.230 --> 02:03:16.700
that throughout every
phase of the project.

02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:19.870
I think our bigger issue is,
after that product is over,

02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:21.710
you know, how does that
stuff get maintained?

02:03:21.710 --> 02:03:23.380
Does it get maintained well?

02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:25.470
Somebody mentioned
earlier about having to --

02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:27.800
you know, what's the
right level of detail

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:31.960
to have people enter
data, drawings

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:34.550
or other, you know, artifacts.

02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:36.820
And we struggle with that
a lot, because, you know,

02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:39.540
resource-wise, our building
managers are probably managing

02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:40.930
40-plus projects at a time,

02:03:40.930 --> 02:03:42.350
while also taking care
of their buildings.

02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:44.250
So they don't have
time to kind of --

02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:47.080
when a paint color
changes, or something else,

02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:48.380
to update that in the BIM file.

02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:50.470
So, you know, what do
you do with all that data

02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:54.180
that you need, but don't
have the resources to manage?

02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:56.680
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: You've
each talked a little bit

02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:58.560
about standards,
and I'm wondering

02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:02.130
if we can draw some more out
about standards, and how --

02:04:02.130 --> 02:04:05.800
what the role is of external
guidelines, or standards,

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:10.790
or vendor-neutral file
formats have in your workflow,

02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:13.960
and why they're -- and
if they're challenging,

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:15.260
how they're challenging.

02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:16.850
If we could draw out
a little bit more

02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:20.480
about that -- do
you want to start?

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:22.640
&gt;&gt; Noemie Lafaurie-Debany: Sure.

02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:24.540
So maybe I could start

02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:28.300
by introducing the
process in the office.

02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:31.730
So Aliza spoke a
little bit about it,

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:36.340
but in the schematic -- again,
not every project is the same,

02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:40.430
but in most cases, the
schematic design phase,

02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:44.260
concept design phase --
in the landscape field,

02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:47.520
we're going to want
to work in 3D.

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:53.670
And we are most likely going to
be using Rhino to think of it.

02:04:53.670 --> 02:04:58.230
So different slope, and
berms, and recessed areas --

02:04:58.230 --> 02:05:00.310
after we've started to
think about volume --

02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:03.960
and that's the sort of file that
will exchange with Architect.

02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:05.260
That file is very easy.

02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:06.700
It doesn't need to be packaged.

02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:08.730
All the information is
contained with that file,

02:05:08.730 --> 02:05:10.740
so it's very easy to share.

02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:14.260
After that, when we move
into the design development

02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:18.110
and construction document, at
that moment that we're going

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:22.940
to go into the 2D and start
documenting our design

02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:25.410
in AutoCAD.

02:05:25.410 --> 02:05:30.710
At that moment, we are
going to start using --

02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:36.100
we're going to set
the files with --

02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:39.780
following the format
of the deliverable.

02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:43.910
Each of those file is like --

02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:47.730
in the paper form is just one
sheet, and within that sheet,

02:05:47.730 --> 02:05:54.350
we are going to link in,
or to add some ex-ref,

02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:57.750
which are reference
to other files

02:05:57.750 --> 02:06:00.230
of that same AutoCAD format.

02:06:00.230 --> 02:06:06.210
And we are going to be able
to work on that sheet file

02:06:06.210 --> 02:06:11.270
and on those ex-ref file, with
multiple people being able

02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:13.550
to touch at different files.

02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:18.000
As landscape, for example, if we
do a project with an architect,

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.760
we are going to add
their building

02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:25.550
as an ex-ref to our file.

02:06:25.550 --> 02:06:33.580
If, at the end of this process,
we do not package this file,

02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:37.310
we are going to lose all the
different linked file to it.

02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:41.440
Or, in our office, all the
files are saved on the servers,

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:45.480
and the server is backed up
in two different location,

02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:49.340
on the east coast and the west
coast, and we can get copies --

02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:55.080
I think we are saving three
copies a day of those files.

02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.720
When the project
is sort of done,

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:02.110
we move it into what we call the
archive partition of our server,

02:07:02.110 --> 02:07:08.110
and in moving files -- and that
archive partition is not backed

02:07:08.110 --> 02:07:09.410
up as often.

02:07:09.410 --> 02:07:12.290
When we move those files,
if we did not package them,

02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:18.230
then we are going to have
to spend 10, 15 minutes,

02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:22.380
maybe even more, trying to
search those linked files

02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:25.410
to be able to have
-- I'm so sorry.

02:07:25.410 --> 02:07:27.810
It's very complicated.

02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:32.700
But it's just -- it's what we
need to do, and we often --

02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:35.290
because we have -- working
on 10 different projects,

02:07:35.290 --> 02:07:37.370
something's always -- one
deadline after another deadline,

02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:41.100
we often forget that one step.

02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:44.640
And then we regret it when, 10
years later, the project is back

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:49.730
on track, and we have to
find those original file.

02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:53.650
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: That all
sounds very familiar to me,

02:07:53.650 --> 02:07:57.700
since one of the most recent
projects I've been working on is

02:07:57.700 --> 02:08:02.380
with a landscape
firm collaborating

02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:04.080
with other freelancers.

02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:07.160
And it's interesting to see
just -- it's kind of a miracle,

02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:10.210
in a way, how a group of people

02:08:10.210 --> 02:08:12.490
who haven't really
met each other manage

02:08:12.490 --> 02:08:18.000
to coordinate a site plan and
a landscape architecture firm

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.530
without having a manual.

02:08:20.530 --> 02:08:24.780
And it's very complex, because
the survey will come in with all

02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:27.770
of its layers, and you'll
create these external references

02:08:27.770 --> 02:08:34.060
from maybe a Google Earth image
that you put in on one layer,

02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:39.010
and the GIS information
that shows county boundaries

02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:42.150
for sensitive areas
and steep slopes.

02:08:42.150 --> 02:08:46.450
And by the time you're
ready to draw a rectangle

02:08:46.450 --> 02:08:49.390
for where the building
goes, you've got a really,

02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:52.160
really complex file, and the
way you even edit any part

02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:57.410
of it involves a lot of care.

02:08:57.410 --> 02:09:00.540
And if someone comes in that
is in a little bit of a hurry,

02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:03.840
and puts one of those references
in a folder, or worse yet,

02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:06.630
somebody who's really into
filing systems and thinks

02:09:06.630 --> 02:09:08.710
that the names of things
should be different,

02:09:08.710 --> 02:09:11.070
and you change the name
of an image that --

02:09:11.070 --> 02:09:12.580
it's true with the
Adobe products, too.

02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:15.100
You're in the image folder, and
you change the name of an image

02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:18.240
to give it a little more
clarity -- instead of scan 32,

02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:20.250
it becomes, you know, barn.

02:09:20.250 --> 02:09:23.730
And suddenly, it's unlinked,
and no one can find it,

02:09:23.730 --> 02:09:26.310
and it doesn't come out
on your presentation.

02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:30.590
So it's a very -- it's a
very, very methodical process

02:09:30.590 --> 02:09:33.780
that many of us, you
know, became designers

02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:37.480
because we weren't really that
methodical to start out with.

02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:41.670
And so we've had to learn
how to be really methodical,

02:09:41.670 --> 02:09:43.240
and I almost -- I picture it.

02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:45.960
It's like the -- Daniel
Kahneman's book, "Thinking Fast

02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:47.260
and Slow," that you
might've read.

02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:49.900
I feel like as designers, we're
in this sort of system one,

02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:51.820
and everything's intuitive, and
we're shooting from the hip.

02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:53.940
And then, when it comes time

02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:57.270
to make sure our external
references are all filed

02:09:57.270 --> 02:10:00.500
correctly, we have to
be really methodical.

02:10:02.210 --> 02:10:03.510
System two.

02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:04.810
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: Yeah, at
GSA, we try to stay away

02:10:04.810 --> 02:10:09.090
from dictating how designers
manage the CAD files,

02:10:09.090 --> 02:10:11.060
and how they construct
the drawings

02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:12.360
that they're working on.

02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:14.790
We do have -- obviously, we're
a large federal bureaucracy,

02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:18.040
so we have lots of standards
and guides that are out there.

02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:23.770
P100 kind of dictates all of our
requirements around construction

02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:25.090
and design requirements,

02:10:25.090 --> 02:10:27.130
and also some deliverable
requirements.

02:10:27.130 --> 02:10:28.560
We do have a BIM guide
that's out there,

02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:31.980
that helps to define kind of, if
we are using BIM on a project,

02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:33.280
what the final deliverables have

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:34.990
to comply with, and
stuff like that.

02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:37.860
But a lot of the time, you
know, again, we're dealing

02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.800
with thousands of contractors,
thousands of architects.

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:45.980
So we try to stay out of the
how you do the job part of it,

02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:48.750
and just try to kind of
manage the end product

02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:51.110
by our contracts, and
satisfying, you know,

02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:53.410
what those deliverables
need to look like.

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:57.380
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: Are there
other aspects of your workflow

02:10:57.380 --> 02:11:00.810
that you think are helpful
to this conversation,

02:11:00.810 --> 02:11:05.750
in thinking about
standards and software

02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:08.130
that we've talked
about this morning?

02:11:09.630 --> 02:11:11.810
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: Oh, sorry.

02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:13.580
&gt;&gt; Noemie Lafaurie-Debany:
Sort of a --

02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:16.650
I mean, it's parallel to the
design process, but in preparing

02:11:16.650 --> 02:11:20.270
for the documents
to be sent to Yale,

02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:25.340
something that we think is
very important is writing a

02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:28.520
narrative, which is a little
bit similar to the PowerPoint

02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:31.110
that Mark was describing.

02:11:31.110 --> 02:11:35.270
But that will tell you, oh,
in 2006, there was the --

02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:37.980
yeah, this huge economic
crisis, so yes,

02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:39.280
the budget had to be cut.

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:40.580
So we had to redesign.

02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:43.750
That's why there are two
design for that same space.

02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:48.940
And this takes a little bit
of time, but it's not --

02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:50.590
it maybe takes a
couple of hours.

02:11:50.590 --> 02:11:55.520
It's not a crazy amount
of time as renaming files,

02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:59.210
or packaging them, but I think
for anyone that would want

02:11:59.210 --> 02:12:02.650
to go very much into the
project and research it,

02:12:02.650 --> 02:12:05.930
it will at least give them
some sort of direction of how

02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:08.890
to navigate this
nebulous of files.

02:12:08.890 --> 02:12:10.530
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside:

02:12:10.530 --> 02:12:15.350
From a collections
viewpoint, I really like that.

02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:17.560
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: You know, I --

02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:20.630
one of the challenges that
sole practitioners face,

02:12:20.630 --> 02:12:25.040
and we all face, is this sort of
movement towards design build,

02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:26.890
which can mean a lot
of different things,

02:12:26.890 --> 02:12:30.500
depending on whether it's, you
know, a house addition, or,

02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:34.450
you know, a major
master plan that has --

02:12:34.450 --> 02:12:36.360
is a fast-track construction
project.

02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:39.940
So -- but in either of those,

02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:44.000
the initial design brief
is really important.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.450
And, you know, as I looked at
the slide earlier about the --

02:12:47.450 --> 02:12:51.350
with all the energy
management software, you know,

02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:55.190
one can make a statement that
we would like this project

02:12:55.190 --> 02:13:01.350
to be 30% below ASHRAE 90.1,
and whatever year it is,

02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:05.510
or to meet certain lead
standard, and then --

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:08.400
but how to actually get there?

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:11.710
There are many, many pathways,
and that software is --

02:13:11.710 --> 02:13:14.120
you know, a lot of it
is really experimental.

02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:17.850
So this design brief, kind
of like the PowerPoint,

02:13:17.850 --> 02:13:21.400
I imagine it being not unlike,
you know, Boeing's design brief.

02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:23.980
There's all this technical
stuff that you need

02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:28.600
to meet that's non-visual, that
the drawing doesn't represent,

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:31.370
that are performance standards
that you hope to meet,

02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:33.980
or are required by GSA
to meet, for example.

02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:35.970
So, you know, the real --

02:13:35.970 --> 02:13:38.880
you know, one of the
things that's very hard

02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:41.790
to document is the pathway

02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:46.060
by which these non-visual
standards are met,

02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:48.670
and it's usually some
other kind of paper trail.

02:13:48.670 --> 02:13:51.260
And it may be solved
in some form of BIM.

02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:54.020
Certainly, I would
love to be able to,

02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:59.170
and hope to soon be able to,
click on a part of the drawing

02:13:59.170 --> 02:14:03.740
and come up with a Word document
that -- or an Excel spreadsheet,

02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:08.380
or some other type of file, or
chart, or graph that references,

02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:10.520
you know, why something
is a certain way.

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:11.820
Because otherwise, the --

02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:16.840
you know, explaining to somebody
retroactively why the building

02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:18.440
doesn't meet that
energy standard,

02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:21.450
and what happened along
the way, and that kind

02:14:21.450 --> 02:14:23.970
of finger-pointing
is pretty common.

02:14:23.970 --> 02:14:26.270
It's a pretty common sight.

02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:30.470
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: Yeah, my
only other comment on that --

02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:33.120
when I think of workflow,
one of our primary challenges

02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:34.860
as an owner is, you
know, we have --

02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:38.170
we usually hire somebody
for our larger projects,

02:14:38.170 --> 02:14:39.470
you know, a design firm.

02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:41.470
We usually hire a
separate contractor.

02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:44.300
We usually hire a CMA
or somebody to help kind

02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:46.060
of oversee it, and
then, you know,

02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:48.440
we might have other
contracts, commissioning agents.

02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:51.380
You know, we're involved at
that project management basis.

02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:53.590
We're dealing with customers and
all sorts of other stakeholders.

02:14:53.590 --> 02:14:56.080
So in terms of workflow
from design

02:14:56.080 --> 02:14:58.460
through that whole
process of a project,

02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:01.690
how do you get all those people
collaborating the right way

02:15:01.690 --> 02:15:06.510
in a system, or in a set of
systems, or other methods

02:15:06.510 --> 02:15:09.640
to produce kind of the
results that you want?

02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:14.680
And our experience with that
has honestly not been great.

02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:17.760
Since 2009, you know, we've had
an electronic product management

02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:22.710
system at GSA that was kind of
intended to do all that, and,

02:15:22.710 --> 02:15:25.560
you know, some teams have
gravitated towards it more,

02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:28.540
and use it for project
collaboration and workflow.

02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:29.840
So if somebody submits
the drawing,

02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:31.140
it gets approved in there.

02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:32.440
If somebody submits an RFI,

02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:35.290
the formal response is recorded
there, all that kind of stuff.

02:15:35.290 --> 02:15:37.960
But many of our projects
are still kind of working,

02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:39.930
in terms of workflow
and collaboration,

02:15:39.930 --> 02:15:41.760
outside of that tool
with other technologies

02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:43.330
that have evolved since then.

02:15:43.330 --> 02:15:45.000
So it's trying to find
kind of the median,

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:48.120
or the middle ground, between,
you know, what do we mandate,

02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:50.530
or what do we have in a
collective system or set

02:15:50.530 --> 02:15:52.050
of systems, versus, you know,

02:15:52.050 --> 02:15:56.230
how does that workflow
happen outside of it?

02:15:56.230 --> 02:15:59.270
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: Another
area that I think you touched

02:15:59.270 --> 02:16:03.430
on was accessing legacy
data, and some of the --

02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:04.730
and you've learned

02:16:04.730 --> 02:16:06.930
from accessing your legacy
data what you should do

02:16:06.930 --> 02:16:08.230
in the future.

02:16:08.230 --> 02:16:11.130
Are there other thoughts
about that that we could learn

02:16:11.130 --> 02:16:13.920
about from each of you, or
what you would do differently

02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:19.410
as you have had experiences,
unable to access legacy data?

02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:24.730
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: Well, there
-- yeah, I'm reminded that --

02:16:24.730 --> 02:16:27.340
and I know this conference
is largely about software,

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:29.870
and we were talking
about wish lists.

02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:34.500
A lot of times, our legacy data
is actually a set of drawings

02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:39.220
and sketches, but increasingly,
you know, because it's easy

02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:43.480
to store, having
record photographs --

02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:46.740
you know, it's easy
to get a point cloud

02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:48.650
of the existing building.

02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:56.850
And a lot of that kind of data
that -- but I think, you know,

02:16:56.850 --> 02:17:01.000
what -- it would be helpful
for us in our tiny office,

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:04.640
would be to have a really
great printer and scanner,

02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:06.560
and a lot of other stuff
that we can't really afford,

02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:10.800
that would just simply
allow us to digitize a lot

02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:14.700
of the documents that
are not fully digital.

02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:17.930
And, you know, I almost
feel like there could be,

02:17:17.930 --> 02:17:20.900
and probably is, a way
to partner with some

02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:26.280
of the more sophisticated
printers to have an archiving --

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:30.330
probably a -- you know, a
simple PDF archiving standard.

02:17:30.330 --> 02:17:31.630
The other kind of
data I was talking

02:17:31.630 --> 02:17:33.880
about with the energy
stuff might be a lot harder

02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:36.720
to figure out.

02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:38.020
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: Nick?

02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:40.620
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: Yeah, our issue
with accessing legacy data --

02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:43.000
so I kind of mentioned it,
I think, earlier, is that,

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.350
you know, we have many
different business lines at GSA,

02:17:47.350 --> 02:17:51.220
and kind of IT investments
over time, because of the size

02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:54.180
of our agency, have largely
been business-line driven.

02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:56.750
And so, currently, we
have an IT environment

02:17:56.750 --> 02:18:00.200
that has building
drawings over here.

02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:03.160
We have kind of a system that
takes care of work requests,

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:04.900
so if a light bulb
goes out, you know,

02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:07.570
there's a flow process there
that gets taken care of.

02:18:07.570 --> 02:18:08.870
We have a project
management system,

02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:10.170
which I described earlier.

02:18:10.170 --> 02:18:12.860
We have a portfolio
investment system.

02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:17.910
We have another system that
we use for charging rent

02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:20.320
to the other federal agencies
that are inhabiting our space.

02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:24.760
So we have these drawings
that have kind of come online.

02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:26.170
We're storing them
in all these systems,

02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:27.970
at least for the
last five years.

02:18:27.970 --> 02:18:30.950
And so, how are we -- if
I'm starting a new project,

02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:32.540
you know, am I going to
five different systems

02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:34.240
to get the inputs to
start that project?

02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:37.160
Am I now trying to tie all
these things together, so I can,

02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:39.230
you know, have a
better cohesive model?

02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:40.960
So I think as we're looking

02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:43.060
at our IT expenditures
going forward, we're trying

02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:46.320
to be more strategic
in how we bring those

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:48.600
that have been historically
separate business units

02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:51.290
and systems, you know,
together to flesh

02:18:51.290 --> 02:18:54.210
out a more cohesive
story about a building,

02:18:54.210 --> 02:18:57.640
or a project, or
set of projects.

02:18:57.640 --> 02:18:59.640
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: I
had one other thought,

02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:02.090
if I could just chime in, and
that just has to do with the --

02:19:02.090 --> 02:19:06.170
you know, the trend in
our time towards just more

02:19:06.170 --> 02:19:09.910
and more sophisticated
images of buildings.

02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:11.460
Architecture is not an image.

02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:13.510
It's a three-dimensional
construct,

02:19:13.510 --> 02:19:16.320
and I was just thinking
about some of the projects

02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:18.210
that I would love
to be able to --

02:19:18.210 --> 02:19:20.400
I'd love to be able to
look at the Form-Z models

02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:22.440
of some old projects
from my former office,

02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:27.290
and actually rotate the design
development Form-Z model,

02:19:27.290 --> 02:19:28.800
because there was
a lot going on.

02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:31.490
And when I look back -- look
at what's in my portfolio,

02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:34.520
it's the rendering
that we sent out.

02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:36.330
And somebody did a great
rendering of the front

02:19:36.330 --> 02:19:39.590
of the building, but there's
all this really great work

02:19:39.590 --> 02:19:41.180
that often -- that
often, what the Library

02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:49.650
of Congress should have is the
high-resolution model before a

02:19:49.650 --> 02:19:53.630
lot of the compromises happen in
the later phases of the building

02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:55.200
and during construction.

02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:58.000
So that you -- you know, that's
the one you would want to show.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.280
You don't want to show
the one where, you know,

02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:03.530
you've had to value
engineer out the wall panels,

02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:05.990
and the awnings go away,
and the sun shades go away,

02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:07.910
and suddenly, everything
gets very flat.

02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:10.670
And everything that -- you
know, all of the compromises

02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:11.970
that are made along the way.

02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:15.410
But usually, somewhere around
design development, there is --

02:20:15.410 --> 02:20:18.860
the design intent sort of
reaches its highest level,

02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:20.820
and then it starts to drop off.

02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:25.180
And that, historically,
has been a point

02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:30.810
where the best modeling software
available at that time is used,

02:20:30.810 --> 02:20:33.880
and now I have no idea
how you go back --

02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:38.340
how you go back and
retrieve that.

02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:39.880
I hope you figure it out.

02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:41.550
Everybody's pointing at Tim.

02:20:41.550 --> 02:20:47.040
It's all up to Tim.

02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:48.340
&gt;&gt; Noemie Lafaurie-Debany:
And just wanted

02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:50.340
to share an experience
during the archiving process.

02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:55.090
At one point, early on, we
decided that we would create PDF

02:20:55.090 --> 02:21:01.010
of the AutoCAD file at
specific important moment

02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:04.860
in the design process that were
not recorded by the deliverable.

02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:06.590
They were more like
internal meetings

02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:10.120
that sanctioned direction
into the design.

02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:15.900
And we did it for a whole
project, and we looked back

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:18.800
at those files, and
the line weight,

02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:21.490
or the way they were translated

02:21:21.490 --> 02:21:25.240
in PDF did not reflect
the design.

02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:28.830
I mean, every element was
there, but you couldn't read it.

02:21:28.830 --> 02:21:36.470
And after that experience, we
stopped transforming files.

02:21:36.470 --> 02:21:38.520
So whatever format they are in,

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:42.890
that's the format we
send them to Yale.

02:21:42.890 --> 02:21:45.120
&gt;&gt; Ann Whiteside: I'm thinking
now we might want to move

02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:48.730
into Q&amp;A, and invite
Kristine and her speakers back

02:21:48.730 --> 02:21:51.650
up to the podium so we
can have a conversation

02:21:51.650 --> 02:21:54.390
with the audience.

02:21:54.390 --> 02:21:58.090
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: So we're
handling this as a combined Q&amp;A,

02:21:58.090 --> 02:22:00.330
so it's a free-for-all.

02:22:00.330 --> 02:22:03.360
Who has a question for anyone?

02:22:07.630 --> 02:22:10.450
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander:
Okay, well, thank you.

02:22:10.450 --> 02:22:12.880
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
Oh, you need a mic.

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:21.080
&gt;&gt; Aliza Leventhal: Hi, I'm
Aliza Leventhal from Sasaki,

02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:24.350
and my question is really to
all of you, in terms of --

02:22:24.350 --> 02:22:25.650
we've talked a little --

02:22:25.650 --> 02:22:28.770
you guys talked in the second
panel about, like, your hopes

02:22:28.770 --> 02:22:30.850
and dreams of what
would be great to have.

02:22:30.850 --> 02:22:35.720
But I think what I'm -- would
be interested in talking

02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:39.280
about is more, what is a
reasonable standard for --

02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:43.230
like, what is something -- like,
Noemie, you mentioned that --

02:22:43.230 --> 02:22:45.680
Noemie, you mentioned that
you guys have standards,

02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:47.290
and they don't [inaudible] help.

02:22:47.290 --> 02:22:50.250
I can relate to that.

02:22:50.250 --> 02:22:53.160
But the -- what is
reasonable, then?

02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:55.910
How can -- is it something that
needs to be a button in Revit

02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:57.210
in order for that to be --

02:22:57.210 --> 02:22:59.310
or, you know, all these various
software -- can't just be Revit,

02:22:59.310 --> 02:23:01.520
but, like, does every
software need to have, like,

02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:04.130
perfect archive function,
and that's the answer?

02:23:04.130 --> 02:23:07.170
Because that's not reasonable,
but what would be something

02:23:07.170 --> 02:23:09.760
that you'd be -- like, you
can imagine being built

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:14.770
into your workflow,
in terms of, like,

02:23:14.770 --> 02:23:17.070
making sure things
are accessible?

02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:24.200
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: You
know, I suppose one thing

02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:26.340
that would be -- it's
interesting that sometimes,

02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:31.370
when we send a digital file
out, we like to send a PDF

02:23:31.370 --> 02:23:35.510
so that we know exactly how
it should look when it plots.

02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:37.410
So I'm not sure if
your question is sort

02:23:37.410 --> 02:23:40.520
of asking what would
the standard --

02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:43.800
what would an office standard
be, or a digital standard.

02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:47.900
But I think to the extent that
it's sometimes unclear whether

02:23:47.900 --> 02:23:51.960
or not someone on the receiving
end is going to be able to view

02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:57.060
or plot a drawing the way
it's intended, that some type

02:23:57.060 --> 02:24:01.540
of metadata that says that,
you know, all the lines

02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:06.700
that are magenta should plot at
.35 millimeters, for example --

02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:10.470
that there's actually, like,
some type of graphic interface.

02:24:10.470 --> 02:24:12.060
Because we have it
in the office.

02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:15.600
In the office, we have
a little card that shows

02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:18.850
which colors plot at
which line weight.

02:24:18.850 --> 02:24:21.260
So it's always kind of
funny, in the sophistication

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:24.920
of a digital environment,
you still have cheat sheets

02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:28.500
on scraps of paper that tell you
which colors plot at which size,

02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:31.770
depending on what your plot
file is that you've used.

02:24:31.770 --> 02:24:36.740
So somehow, that connection
between the design intent

02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:41.000
of the lines and how they
should appear graphically seems

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:46.890
to be part of the file system
that's needed, at basic.

02:24:46.890 --> 02:24:48.190
&gt;&gt; Noemie Lafaurie-Debany:

02:24:48.190 --> 02:24:49.790
One thing that's
completely unrealistic,

02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:53.900
but I'm not really
sure about discussion

02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:57.570
with industry partners --

02:24:57.570 --> 02:25:02.130
but a read-only file would
be quite interesting,

02:25:02.130 --> 02:25:04.900
when you no longer own
the copy of the software,

02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:09.130
but you could still
just look at that file,

02:25:09.130 --> 02:25:10.690
not modify anything in it.

02:25:10.690 --> 02:25:16.550
Just turn the model around,
look at different elevation.

02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:17.870
Maybe that's not too far off.

02:25:17.870 --> 02:25:20.470
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: Greg, do
you have some thoughts on that?

02:25:20.470 --> 02:25:22.340
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner:
I don't know.

02:25:22.340 --> 02:25:25.930
The answer to the question is
a tough one, because simply,

02:25:25.930 --> 02:25:30.770
if there's not a business
purpose for doing it,

02:25:30.770 --> 02:25:32.990
it's always a tough sell, right?

02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:38.250
So I'm, you know,
sort of a market --

02:25:38.250 --> 02:25:40.180
my thing is, this is a
market-based solution.

02:25:40.180 --> 02:25:42.020
So you have to figure
out what's valuable,

02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:43.680
and that's what will
become useful.

02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:47.380
So, you know, there's these
-- you know, certainly,

02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:50.390
we have contract deliverables
and so forth, but at the end

02:25:50.390 --> 02:25:52.250
of the day, a lot
of the standards are

02:25:52.250 --> 02:25:54.170
for moving between two parties.

02:25:54.170 --> 02:25:55.480
But if you don't have a standard

02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:58.080
that you ever use while you do
your work, it's not valuable

02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:01.550
to you to do the thing that you
have to hand to the next person.

02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:04.790
So that -- somewhere
in that is my thinking.

02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:06.350
I don't know exactly
what that looks like,

02:26:06.350 --> 02:26:09.600
because that basically implies
that you'd have to get vendors

02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:11.490
to work on open formats,

02:26:11.490 --> 02:26:14.080
which is not the way
they currently want

02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:16.730
to view the world.

02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:18.830
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: It
would seem to me that the --

02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:21.330
one of the big ideas
we're going to get

02:26:21.330 --> 02:26:24.410
to after lunch is
access use cases.

02:26:24.410 --> 02:26:27.090
In other words, what is it
you're trying to archive?

02:26:27.090 --> 02:26:31.720
Is it, you know, the
essence of the design at its,

02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:34.010
you know, most refined point?

02:26:34.010 --> 02:26:37.680
Is it what we told the
contractor to build?

02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:39.670
You know, what is it
you're trying to archive?

02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:43.220
And then you have kind of
different requirements,

02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:45.390
and then different methods,
it would seem to me.

02:26:45.390 --> 02:26:47.250
I don't know.

02:26:47.250 --> 02:26:50.450
Phil?

02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:52.140
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: Well,
I'm not going

02:26:52.140 --> 02:26:54.850
to answer what you
said, or address that.

02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:58.050
But I will kind of answer what
I think your question was,

02:26:58.050 --> 02:27:00.030
and actually, it's something

02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:01.360
that I'm talking
about after lunch.

02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:06.830
It's my presentation
this time, but anyway --

02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:12.250
we have an implementer forum for
software producers that write

02:27:12.250 --> 02:27:15.400
to the standard format.

02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:19.680
And, you know, we started doing
this, like, back in the '90s,

02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:23.160
and some of the software
developers started

02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:24.690
to write STEP interfaces.

02:27:24.690 --> 02:27:28.040
But they didn't necessarily
communicate or interoperate

02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:31.130
with the other software
developers' STEP interfaces,

02:27:31.130 --> 02:27:35.970
and so, you know, multi-trillion
dollar problem here.

02:27:35.970 --> 02:27:39.140
So industry had asked us to --

02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:42.290
well, how do you test
for interoperability?

02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:47.270
And so, you know, we thought
about it, and some colleagues

02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:50.000
of mine from Ford, and
Boeing, and General Motors,

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.550
and other companies
got together.

02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:55.790
And we came up with, you know,
kind of a testing scenario,

02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:57.900
and we've refined
it over the years.

02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:01.610
But, you know, I think
there's a lot of instances

02:28:01.610 --> 02:28:04.550
where there's a standard
thrown out there --

02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:09.930
like, okay, go implement it,
but it's really not that easy

02:28:09.930 --> 02:28:11.350
to implement, you know.

02:28:11.350 --> 02:28:14.970
And, you know, one vendor
might, you know, go in path A,

02:28:14.970 --> 02:28:17.670
and another vendor go in
path B, and, you know,

02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:19.490
there goes your interoperability
right there.

02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:24.000
So I think my answer to your
question is, is that there has

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.670
to be some forum for software
companies to test their products

02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:30.250
in -- you know,

02:28:30.250 --> 02:28:33.260
a non-adversarial
forum, if you will.

02:28:33.260 --> 02:28:35.450
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
So we could go

02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:36.960
on a long time on this question.

02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:38.570
Are there any others?

02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:40.950
Is there one over there?

02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:43.060
Yep. You're hiding
behind the column.

02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:44.360
I see you.

02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:45.660
Okay.

02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:46.960
&gt;&gt; Okay. I -- Noemie, I
have a question for you.

02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:48.670
I'm sorry?

02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:50.200
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm
Kurt Helfric, again,

02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:51.860
from National Gallery of Art.

02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:54.440
So, Noemie, I just
wanted you -- a comment --

02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:57.560
something you told us struck me,
which was basically this idea

02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:00.540
that at a certain point, you
had thought about creating PDFs

02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:02.060
of some of the drawings.

02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:05.000
And could you just elaborate
a little bit more on that?

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:10.190
In other words, were they --
they were actually PDFs of CAD,

02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:12.940
or sort of born-digital
materials.

02:29:12.940 --> 02:29:16.400
One of the things that Alex
Ball [assumed spelling] has done

02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:18.480
in his white paper
on CAD is to say,

02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:20.930
"You have to understand why
you're collecting things."

02:29:20.930 --> 02:29:23.840
So if you're collecting things
for image value, for instance,

02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:26.530
PDFs or TIFs are fine,
but if you're doing it

02:29:26.530 --> 02:29:28.100
for other things, then
you really need to think

02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:29.620
about the native formats.

02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:30.980
But I'm actually
really struck --

02:29:30.980 --> 02:29:35.150
I'd like to hear more about
what you found that was missing

02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:40.300
in those PDFs that
you're aware of.

02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:41.600
&gt;&gt; Noemie Lafaurie-Debany:
If we go --

02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:45.890
if I try to explain it from
the -- doing it analog,

02:29:45.890 --> 02:29:48.390
we would have done
-- to go to a meeting

02:29:48.390 --> 02:29:50.270
and discuss different
alternatives,

02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:53.490
we would have sketched out
different things on trace paper.

02:29:53.490 --> 02:29:55.020
And we would have
different layers,

02:29:55.020 --> 02:29:58.370
and maybe we would have put
them on top of one another.

02:29:58.370 --> 02:30:01.770
And we would have, you know,
been able to remove one layer,

02:30:01.770 --> 02:30:04.260
change color, highlight
something, and whatnot.

02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:07.190
And then, if we were to send
that analog piece to Yale,

02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:10.200
we could just send
all of those layers,

02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:13.370
and that would have been
documenting that moment

02:30:13.370 --> 02:30:16.580
in the design process where
we were making decision

02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:19.350
about the size of the
berms, or height --

02:30:19.350 --> 02:30:21.260
I don't know, something.

02:30:21.260 --> 02:30:24.360
If we put this in digital,

02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:28.380
we would have done maybe the
same sort of exercise, you know,

02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:30.440
drawing in CAD those
different curves,

02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:32.750
and they would have been
on different layers.

02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:34.800
And when presenting them,
we would have shown --

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:37.950
or maybe plotting them, we would
have shown them on different --

02:30:37.950 --> 02:30:39.950
you know, we would
have turned off layers,

02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:45.170
and just show certain image.

02:30:45.170 --> 02:30:48.770
But if we look at that
file 10 years later,

02:30:48.770 --> 02:30:54.090
and we try to plot it as a PDF,
because it was a turning point

02:30:54.090 --> 02:31:00.470
in internal -- at the office,
but in making design decision,

02:31:00.470 --> 02:31:02.140
with the layers history,

02:31:02.140 --> 02:31:05.140
nobody can really tell
us anything about it.

02:31:05.140 --> 02:31:09.750
The plot size -- everything
look like it's the same --

02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:12.960
I don't know, that
it's a planted area,

02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:15.990
or it was a water feature,
or whatever it was,

02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:17.430
everything is at the same level.

02:31:17.430 --> 02:31:21.180
You are losing this layering.

02:31:25.890 --> 02:31:27.190
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
Other questions?

02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:28.490
Oh, here's one.

02:31:28.490 --> 02:31:35.430
Katie has a question.

02:31:38.260 --> 02:31:40.040
&gt;&gt; Katie Pierce Meyer:
Hi, Katie Pierce Meyer.

02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:43.190
Not that this addresses that
question, but I'm wondering

02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:48.670
about how much any of you
might use screenshots as ways

02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:51.000
of capturing some
of those moments.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:54.560
And is that something
you would use as a way

02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:56.950
of sharing information on
a particular portion --

02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:59.390
or, you know, points
in a design process?

02:31:59.390 --> 02:32:02.500
And if you do, are those things
that you actually maintain

02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:05.520
as part of the archive
for a project?

02:32:07.040 --> 02:32:08.340
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: I'll take --

02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:10.790
so certainly, we use
screenshots, but they're not --

02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:14.940
I don't think they're typically
used for design discussions.

02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:17.130
They're usually more on the
technical side of things.

02:32:17.130 --> 02:32:20.630
So they're -- like, very
mundane explanatory things,

02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:23.170
like this is the wrong
color, or the wrong size,

02:32:23.170 --> 02:32:24.740
or something like that.

02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:28.350
I think this -- so they
certainly get used,

02:32:28.350 --> 02:32:31.450
and it would have to be part of
a sort of more defined process

02:32:31.450 --> 02:32:34.810
that people would follow
in our environment,

02:32:34.810 --> 02:32:39.650
which is nearly impossible
for me to get people to do.

02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:42.550
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: And there
was another question in the --

02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:45.650
yeah, the people who are
behind the column, I can't tell

02:32:45.650 --> 02:32:51.650
if you have your hands up.

02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:54.360
&gt;&gt; Following up a little
on Katie's question,

02:32:54.360 --> 02:32:59.030
I wonder whether, as you
work through these questions

02:32:59.030 --> 02:33:03.480
about archiving standard, and
the consideration is given

02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:11.250
to adding some narrative
component to the project record.

02:33:11.250 --> 02:33:16.500
In which participants
would be asked to describe

02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:21.610
or recount some of the
experiences of both creativity

02:33:21.610 --> 02:33:27.390
and collaboration that
were part of the process.

02:33:27.390 --> 02:33:29.510
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: So
she had mentioned earlier

02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:31.460
about doing the -- I
think it was you --

02:33:31.460 --> 02:33:32.910
the written narrative.

02:33:32.910 --> 02:33:35.870
So we -- so we've had
discussions internally

02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:38.590
about doing interview-based
processes --

02:33:38.590 --> 02:33:40.590
not actually for
archiving purposes,

02:33:40.590 --> 02:33:41.890
but for knowledge transfer.

02:33:41.890 --> 02:33:45.080
Because we have a
very similar problem

02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:48.630
where if it doesn't describe
well, you're not going to learn

02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:51.160
from it, and you can't move

02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:53.430
between projects,
and move information.

02:33:53.430 --> 02:33:58.760
So I think the tools
probably would be --

02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:01.960
that would be the mechanism
we would look to, and audio

02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:03.820
and video are much
simpler to use

02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:07.200
than having somebody write
something, or an e-mail.

02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:12.740
I think one of the sort of
pieces that we always struggle

02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:15.410
with is, okay, how do you
actually make an association

02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:20.700
of that simple recording to what
it's relevant to in the project?

02:34:20.700 --> 02:34:23.430
And you end up with, you know,
intranets and stuff that --

02:34:23.430 --> 02:34:27.920
oh, it's on there somewhere,
or -- and that's, again,

02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:30.380
another kind of interoperable
standard

02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:32.790
that no one has the same system.

02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:36.000
And so you upgrade systems,
and you lost a connectivity.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.340
I mean, one of the --
just as a quick aside,

02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:39.640
I once put together a list

02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:42.800
of all the stuff we don't have
standards for that makes sense

02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:45.390
for us, and it's,
like, 65 items long.

02:34:45.390 --> 02:34:48.010
Right? So, like,
just quick examples,

02:34:48.010 --> 02:34:51.420
what a 3D sketch looks like,
you know, photogrammetry.

02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:53.340
There are standards, but, like,

02:34:53.340 --> 02:34:56.370
the odds of a designer
knowing what an open format

02:34:56.370 --> 02:35:00.400
photogrammetry standard is,
I don't really even know.

02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:03.540
Point clouds, all these sort
of things -- so it's a --

02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:04.840
it's sort of a -- I don't know.

02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:06.920
I like to use the term,
"We need an internet,

02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:10.070
not more standards," that
if you think about it, like,

02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:12.170
the internet made
things connect better.

02:35:12.170 --> 02:35:13.470
We don't have that.

02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:15.050
We just have these
little piles of stuff.

02:35:15.050 --> 02:35:17.520
So, I mean, that's
my long-term view,

02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:23.420
how you make this more
simple, but I'll stop there.

02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:25.720
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: Roger?

02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:31.320
&gt;&gt; Well, my question --

02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:33.070
my question has to do
with this idea that --

02:35:33.070 --> 02:35:36.320
I mean, there's a range of you
up there from small design firms

02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:40.330
to large owners, and
different industries.

02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:44.630
And I'm wondering, you know,
the challenge of trying

02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:47.530
to collect information
and archive it --

02:35:47.530 --> 02:35:50.320
it's somewhat what you want
to do for your own practice,

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:53.370
and it's also somewhat
driven by what your client

02:35:53.370 --> 02:35:55.580
or the owner wants to require.

02:35:55.580 --> 02:35:59.870
And if the owners are clearer
about what they need and want,

02:35:59.870 --> 02:36:01.300
is that going to sort out some

02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:03.010
of the problems for
the design world?

02:36:03.010 --> 02:36:07.580
And, you know, to some
extent, standards are important

02:36:07.580 --> 02:36:09.370
for things we want to preserve.

02:36:09.370 --> 02:36:11.760
They maybe help you with
the things you just want

02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:14.870
to have access to, but if
the owners were doing more

02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:19.800
to push standardization of the
information they want at the end

02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:22.790
of a project, would
that help sort this out?

02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:25.880
And maybe, is there any
experience from the PLM world

02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:28.040
that might shed some
light on that,

02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:30.930
for us in the architecture
and design world?

02:36:30.930 --> 02:36:32.420
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: Do
you want to take it, Nick?

02:36:32.420 --> 02:36:33.720
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: Sure.

02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:35.020
Yeah, I think on the
federal side, I mean,

02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:38.240
especially for our larger
projects, we have very,

02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:42.550
very detailed contracts
and then specifications

02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:44.230
that dictate deliverables.

02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:46.580
And I think, at the end of
the day, I mean, what we want

02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:49.730
to be able to do with our
projects is that, you know,

02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:51.120
the final deliverables
that are produced,

02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:54.070
either by the architects
of record

02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:56.510
or through an as-built
modification process

02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:58.870
by our contractor, is to
turn over a set of drawings,

02:36:58.870 --> 02:37:02.470
and specs, and O&amp;M manuals, et
cetera, that allow the building

02:37:02.470 --> 02:37:05.460
to continue to be run,
you know, going forward.

02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:08.340
I think where that does break
down a little bit is, you know,

02:37:08.340 --> 02:37:10.710
we have a pretty
good grasp on that

02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:13.670
for our larger projects
above $3 million.

02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:16.340
Projects under that, you
know, there's many more,

02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:19.000
in terms of volume, and those
are the projects where --

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.890
you know, I mean,
it's $25,000 to build

02:37:20.890 --> 02:37:22.450
out a small space somewhere,

02:37:22.450 --> 02:37:24.330
and so how do you get
the smaller contractors

02:37:24.330 --> 02:37:26.960
that might be working on that
stuff to comply with some

02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:29.900
of the more complex requirements
of our bigger projects?

02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:33.790
And so working that out is,
you know, a struggle for us.

02:37:33.790 --> 02:37:35.090
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
So has anyone

02:37:35.090 --> 02:37:39.150
on the panel done a project
for the GSA, and what do you --

02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:43.270
is it just deliverables for
the GSA, Greg, or is it --

02:37:43.270 --> 02:37:46.500
you know, does it really help
you in the future go back?

02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:49.690
Of course, you can't use it,
because it's confidential,

02:37:49.690 --> 02:37:52.350
and for your eyes
only, and all of that.

02:37:52.350 --> 02:37:53.650
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: Well,

02:37:53.650 --> 02:37:55.020
so we've certainly
done GSA projects.

02:37:55.020 --> 02:37:59.310
We have examples where
we were a sub to a --

02:37:59.310 --> 02:38:01.750
in a party where none
of that information

02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:04.220
that we even produced got
handed over to the GSA,

02:38:04.220 --> 02:38:05.770
so that's one example.

02:38:05.770 --> 02:38:07.530
Even with re -- or using
models, and so forth.

02:38:07.530 --> 02:38:09.610
But I think, to Roger's
question,

02:38:09.610 --> 02:38:14.050
there's small areas during a --
and this is design-specific --

02:38:14.050 --> 02:38:16.110
small areas within
the design process

02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:20.770
that the standards can be
used from a practical sense.

02:38:20.770 --> 02:38:22.300
But most of the time,
I think they're seen

02:38:22.300 --> 02:38:25.110
as someone else's
problem, and so we can --

02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:28.210
I can meet your problem,
but I'm going to do --

02:38:28.210 --> 02:38:30.250
it's sort of an image
that came to my head.

02:38:30.250 --> 02:38:33.750
There's this TV show that they
ship things across the country,

02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:36.530
and it's a competition who
can get it there first.

02:38:36.530 --> 02:38:38.480
And they don't care
how you get it there.

02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:41.580
It just has to land there in
one piece, and that's sort

02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:42.880
of how our industry works,

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:44.320
in that we don't really
have the standards

02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:45.620
about how you get there.

02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:47.820
We have the standards
about how it lands, right?

02:38:47.820 --> 02:38:50.450
And this is, I think,
the challenge.

02:38:50.450 --> 02:38:54.020
Like, it's not a -- it's
not that we can't deliver

02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:57.500
to a standard if needed to,
but it's not one that --

02:38:57.500 --> 02:39:00.630
the standards don't really
apply in the process part.

02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:02.760
They apply in the landing part.

02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:04.770
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: So it's
actually an addition step.

02:39:04.770 --> 02:39:06.690
So you say, okay, so
we have our stuff --

02:39:06.690 --> 02:39:08.650
&gt;&gt;Drive your business
question --

02:39:08.650 --> 02:39:11.310
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: Well, so I
think the specific thing is --

02:39:11.310 --> 02:39:14.440
from a technology perspective,
is there aren't tools

02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:19.170
that utilize standards that we
can leverage for our business.

02:39:19.170 --> 02:39:21.670
There are tools that
are historically seen

02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:26.290
as handover tools, and so
it's a very big discussion.

02:39:26.290 --> 02:39:30.130
But I think it's generally the
way I view things, that it's --

02:39:30.130 --> 02:39:33.000
there's motivation
to have a status quo

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.090
of vendors provide tools
for certain workflow,

02:39:35.090 --> 02:39:39.730
and then open formats for
handover, and that's sort

02:39:39.730 --> 02:39:44.690
of at least how I
[inaudible], yeah.

02:39:44.690 --> 02:39:46.470
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander:
So, you know, I --

02:39:46.470 --> 02:39:50.790
your question is a great one,
because it sort of takes me back

02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:55.450
to imagining looking at an
owner-architect AIA agreement,

02:39:55.450 --> 02:39:58.620
and trying to use that
as a basis for explaining

02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:01.270
to a client what
is about to happen.

02:40:01.270 --> 02:40:03.800
And it's -- does not --

02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:07.650
you know, if you read the
description of schematic design

02:40:07.650 --> 02:40:13.910
in the AIA, it just basically
has a line about planning,

02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:17.030
and organization, and
maybe there's a narrative.

02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:18.330
What are you going to get?

02:40:18.330 --> 02:40:19.630
Meanwhile, books
have been written,

02:40:19.630 --> 02:40:22.220
or there have been
attempts made at explaining

02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:26.350
to a client what the
design process is like.

02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:28.480
But those descriptions
only work --

02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:31.020
are only about some
preconception.

02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:33.750
The AIA has a little film
about you and your architect,

02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:35.050
and what it could
be, but it's a --

02:40:35.050 --> 02:40:38.320
you know, about a really
pretty big building.

02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:40.070
And I would never
think about using

02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:42.380
that for a house renovation.

02:40:42.380 --> 02:40:48.020
So, you know, a great tool would
be probably for some group of us

02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:49.320
to figure out how

02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:51.580
to put together a
little introductory film

02:40:51.580 --> 02:40:54.340
about how the process
works, and that starts

02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:58.620
to adjust the behavior
of all the stakeholders,

02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:01.540
and particularly
explains who is in charge

02:41:01.540 --> 02:41:03.370
at each step, and
who to turn to.

02:41:03.370 --> 02:41:05.670
So --

02:41:11.530 --> 02:41:13.290
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
Please introduce yourself.

02:41:13.290 --> 02:41:16.120
&gt;&gt; Hi. So one of the things --

02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:17.420
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: You are?

02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:18.720
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: You are?

02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:20.020
&gt;&gt; What? Is it on?

02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:21.320
I --

02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:22.620
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: No, you.

02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:23.920
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: No, who are you?

02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:25.220
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: Who are you?

02:41:25.220 --> 02:41:26.520
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: What's
your name?

02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:27.820
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander:
What's your name?

02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:29.120
&gt;&gt; Oh, ha.

02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:30.420
I'm Karen Moran, and I'm
actually one of the people

02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:32.070
in partnership with Mark
Rylander, several occasions.

02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:36.990
One of the things that I've been
thinking about is how we are

02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:42.140
so far removed as architects
from the Thomas U. Walter era,

02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:46.400
where his office would've been
the repository of all the data,

02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:48.700
and that you could go
back to the office,

02:41:48.700 --> 02:41:50.000
and it would be there.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:53.930
Because once you start
talking about deliverables,

02:41:53.930 --> 02:41:57.620
and the deliverables are
required to be manipulated,

02:41:57.620 --> 02:42:02.280
how do we, as architects,
put our fingerprint on those?

02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:05.410
Because Ms. Leventhal brought
up that even within the office,

02:42:05.410 --> 02:42:07.590
it's hard to understand
the process

02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:10.340
by which these things
get developed.

02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:16.130
So once you release your
deliverable to the owner, and --

02:42:16.130 --> 02:42:18.820
I mean, if any architects
in the room remember,

02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:20.460
it was only a few years ago

02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:23.160
that we would never
release an original

02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:25.010
of any kind to an owner.

02:42:25.010 --> 02:42:29.220
We would release a print, and
that would be a reference.

02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:30.790
And now, we're being pressured

02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:34.820
to release manipulatable
[sic] drawings

02:42:34.820 --> 02:42:37.380
to owners for future use.

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:41.150
Had we put a fingerprint on
it so that it can go back

02:42:41.150 --> 02:42:43.850
to the originator --
because when it comes

02:42:43.850 --> 02:42:46.770
to digital archiving, you know,

02:42:46.770 --> 02:42:50.950
Thomas U. Walter had a
cornerstone with his name on it.

02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:52.560
Do we now?

02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:54.660
Probably not, for the most part.

02:42:54.660 --> 02:42:57.240
People won't even remember
who the architect was.

02:42:57.240 --> 02:43:00.400
I doubt very many people
go to Boeing and say,

02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:03.760
"Could I have a manipulatable
[sic] drawing of my B52?

02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:07.880
Because I want to screw
around with it in the future."

02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:09.180
I don't think so.

02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:10.850
That doesn't happen,
but people want to do

02:43:10.850 --> 02:43:13.010
that with buildings
all the time.

02:43:13.010 --> 02:43:18.910
So how do we actually document
what was meant to be documented

02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:24.430
in the first place, and how do
we keep that for perpetuity?

02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:26.840
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: Read-only.

02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:29.140
Read-only.

02:43:29.140 --> 02:43:30.440
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
Probably the person

02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:32.230
who might have some
thoughts on that is Greg,

02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:33.530
I mean, to some extent.

02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:34.830
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: Well,
I mean, I've thought

02:43:34.830 --> 02:43:37.490
about these problems, but, like,
the actual solutions is not,

02:43:37.490 --> 02:43:40.580
like, something I could --
like, Blockchain, right?

02:43:40.580 --> 02:43:42.530
That's how you solve all
problems today, right now,

02:43:42.530 --> 02:43:44.310
is just to say Blockchain.

02:43:44.310 --> 02:43:47.760
But, I mean, this is -- this
is a realistic interpretation

02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:49.060
of this problem, right?

02:43:49.060 --> 02:43:52.390
You have to have a ledger of
all these things that happen,

02:43:52.390 --> 02:43:54.560
and that's the promise
of these technologies.

02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:57.530
I think what we find is
they're not easily implementable

02:43:57.530 --> 02:44:02.870
in our industry, because one of
the -- even to hear Nick talk,

02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:04.170
we actually don't have owners.

02:44:04.170 --> 02:44:06.530
And when I'm saying owners,
I'm saying process owners.

02:44:06.530 --> 02:44:08.100
We're not building owners.

02:44:08.100 --> 02:44:09.520
No one owns a process.

02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:11.420
We all owned a little
piece of it.

02:44:11.420 --> 02:44:15.780
And so, you know, from a,
you know, pie-in-the-sky,

02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:17.820
if you look at what
the internet tells you,

02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:19.290
that's definitely the
way we need to go.

02:44:19.290 --> 02:44:21.520
How we get there, I
have no idea right now.

02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:24.690
So, I mean --

02:44:24.690 --> 02:44:26.820
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: Maybe
Phil could talk a little bit

02:44:26.820 --> 02:44:30.710
about the whole configuration
management,

02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:34.420
product management issue in
aerospace, and how it's sort

02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:37.150
of handled, at a high level.

02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:40.180
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: Well,
you had said something

02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:46.210
about that we don't give the
B52 CAD model to the Air Force,

02:44:46.210 --> 02:44:48.350
but -- because there isn't one.

02:44:48.350 --> 02:44:53.220
But anyway, I -- what -- I'm
going to address that first.

02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:57.220
Actually, I do see
the DOD requesting --

02:44:57.220 --> 02:45:02.460
not an entire weapons system
per se, but, you know,

02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:06.540
give me the wings on
the A7, because I want

02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:08.880
to reengineer them, or I want

02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:10.720
to have somebody
else reengineer them.

02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:12.810
So I do see that quite
a bit these days.

02:45:12.810 --> 02:45:19.700
The other part of that question
kind of had to do with --

02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:22.680
I think it had to do with
traceability, if you will,

02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:24.970
or at least that's what
I'm going to call it.

02:45:24.970 --> 02:45:31.200
But in the aerospace industry,
they're very religious about,

02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:35.990
you know, if the lefthand
bracket is your design,

02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:39.540
it is associated with you

02:45:39.540 --> 02:45:41.830
and the organization
for which you work.

02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:46.030
So if there's a question about
that lefthand bracket, you know,

02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:47.440
some number of years
down the road,

02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:50.910
they do indeed know
who designed it.

02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:54.010
But, you know, whether he's with
the company anymore, you know,

02:45:54.010 --> 02:45:56.980
that's a different story, and
that's out of our control.

02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:58.600
So --

02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:01.260
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
But how do you do that?

02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:02.560
&gt;&gt; That you --

02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:03.860
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: How
do you do what?

02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:05.160
&gt;&gt; The information --

02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:06.460
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: How do you
keep track of that information?

02:46:06.460 --> 02:46:09.320
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: Our data
model supports that.

02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:13.630
It's -- the entities are
called person and organization.

02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:14.930
It's --

02:46:14.930 --> 02:46:17.760
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: The IFC
data model supports ownership --

02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:19.060
yeah, creative -- yeah.

02:46:19.060 --> 02:46:20.980
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: But I think
-- I mean, from in your --

02:46:20.980 --> 02:46:23.270
like, let's say I'm
going to design a plane.

02:46:23.270 --> 02:46:24.700
Like, let's say I do
something smaller.

02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:27.060
I want to do a single-engine
prop plane.

02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:30.650
If I have a supply chain,
I set up a PLM platform

02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:31.950
that everybody connects to,

02:46:31.950 --> 02:46:33.680
and then that's how you
put it together, right?

02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:35.330
I mean, that's -- I
think that's the --

02:46:35.330 --> 02:46:38.130
sort of the root of your
question, that people point

02:46:38.130 --> 02:46:41.390
to that PLM system, or
platforms, and stuff like that

02:46:41.390 --> 02:46:42.720
as a way we could
solve our industry.

02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:45.030
But it -- okay, who hosts it?

02:46:45.030 --> 02:46:47.610
Who maintains it,
like in our industry?

02:46:47.610 --> 02:46:51.000
It's -- so, like, okay, who
pays the rent on the system

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.300
after the project's done?

02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:53.600
&gt;&gt; Phil Rocher: Yeah.

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:56.690
And in our case, it's Cessna,
and Gulfstream, and Embraer,

02:46:56.690 --> 02:46:59.240
ad infinitum, whoever
the company is.

02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:00.540
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: Yeah.

02:47:00.540 --> 02:47:02.610
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: But it's
interesting, in the IFC model.

02:47:02.610 --> 02:47:05.620
Because we did a bunch of what
are called the experimental BIMs

02:47:05.620 --> 02:47:09.260
for the Corps of Engineers,
and I would go to a trade show

02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:13.510
and see some company 20
steps removed from us,

02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:15.440
and they'd be showing
something they did

02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:16.740
with these experimental models.

02:47:16.740 --> 02:47:19.090
And I'd look at it, and if
you looked at created by,

02:47:19.090 --> 02:47:23.050
it would be C. Scander [assumed
spelling] at KFA-INC.com.

02:47:23.050 --> 02:47:25.170
And so that was maintained
through the model,

02:47:25.170 --> 02:47:29.480
despite all the people -- in
IFC format, all the people

02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:32.670
who were manipulating it, and
adding to it, and all of that.

02:47:32.670 --> 02:47:33.970
Roger?

02:47:33.970 --> 02:47:35.270
&gt;&gt; Well, following up on my --

02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:36.570
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, we
need you to say --

02:47:36.570 --> 02:47:37.870
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: Oh, Roger.

02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:39.170
Roger Grant.

02:47:39.170 --> 02:47:40.470
&gt;&gt; Roger Grant, National
Institute of Building Sciences.

02:47:40.470 --> 02:47:41.770
Sorry I didn't introduce
myself earlier.

02:47:41.770 --> 02:47:43.180
But following up the
question I was asking --

02:47:43.180 --> 02:47:47.070
this is interesting, because who
is driving that is Department

02:47:47.070 --> 02:47:49.810
of Defense, the owner, saying,
"We want this," and they want

02:47:49.810 --> 02:47:51.410
to be able to validate it.

02:47:51.410 --> 02:47:54.450
And I think -- you know,
that's the challenge we face.

02:47:54.450 --> 02:47:55.780
We don't -- I don't know.

02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:59.520
GSA has a lot of market
power, but do they have enough

02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:02.450
to drive this through
like manufacturing does?

02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:06.370
How do we get to that
in the AEC realm?

02:48:06.370 --> 02:48:08.290
Or we will ever get there?

02:48:08.290 --> 02:48:09.590
I don't know.

02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:13.010
Does anybody want to
take a crack at that?

02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:14.310
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: Nick?

02:48:14.310 --> 02:48:16.340
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: I mean, I
think in terms of BIM usage,

02:48:16.340 --> 02:48:19.260
GSA has been kind of
pushing that since I've been

02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:22.480
at the agency, since 2003.

02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:27.360
So, you know, today, at least
for our projects that are

02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:29.920
above $3 million, every one of
those projects has some type

02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:31.490
of BIM usage on that project,

02:48:31.490 --> 02:48:33.290
whether it's spatial data
modeling, or whether it's,

02:48:33.290 --> 02:48:35.650
you know, something more
involved, in terms of taking

02:48:35.650 --> 02:48:37.530
that model through design.

02:48:37.530 --> 02:48:41.130
I guess in terms of, though,
the idea of making sure

02:48:41.130 --> 02:48:45.900
that the architect or designer
is always attached to the work

02:48:45.900 --> 02:48:48.260
that they did, I think we
probably could do better

02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:49.560
in that area.

02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:52.510
We definitely do that for
equipment that we install.

02:48:52.510 --> 02:48:55.350
We always know who made
the faulty equipment

02:48:55.350 --> 02:48:57.150
that we now have to take
out of the building.

02:48:57.150 --> 02:49:00.410
But for, you know, the
renovations and stuff like that,

02:49:00.410 --> 02:49:02.950
you know, if you're not doing a
new building, I think over time,

02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:06.650
kind of that tracking of
who did what does get lost.

02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:10.850
&gt;&gt; Got one back there.

02:49:10.850 --> 02:49:12.150
&gt;&gt; Hi, Stacy Baez
[assumed spelling]

02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:13.830
with the Architect
of the Capitol.

02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:15.680
This kind of goes
on with my thought,

02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:18.540
because the defense industry
has in fact driven, like,

02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:19.870
records management requirements,

02:49:19.870 --> 02:49:23.640
and the space industry has
driven what we now know

02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:25.530
as the OAIS standard.

02:49:25.530 --> 02:49:29.110
Do you see the opportunity,
or is that, in fact,

02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:33.170
desirable for the AED
community to be able to drive --

02:49:33.170 --> 02:49:35.920
like, this is our
requirement, and if you want

02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:39.890
to sell us a system that is
compliant, maybe a [inaudible]

02:49:39.890 --> 02:49:46.250
or something, it must be
able to conform the data

02:49:46.250 --> 02:49:48.110
for the purpose of archiving?

02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:50.770
Because right now, what we're
faced with is, like, okay,

02:49:50.770 --> 02:49:53.660
we wrap up a project
in a massive system

02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:56.310
that a contractor has
used, and then it's like,

02:49:56.310 --> 02:49:57.750
okay, here's your zip file.

02:49:57.750 --> 02:50:01.660
You know, here are your CDs with
all the data, and it's very raw,

02:50:01.660 --> 02:50:04.630
and then the challenges of
trying to do the verification

02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:06.350
and all on the archival side.

02:50:06.350 --> 02:50:10.650
But do you see if there's an
opportunity for our industry

02:50:10.650 --> 02:50:13.860
to drive that -- the
softwares [sic] --

02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:17.230
especially the preeminent
software companies are adding

02:50:17.230 --> 02:50:23.150
modules in to their software
packages that create, you know,

02:50:23.150 --> 02:50:25.910
the archival packages that the
archivists are going to need

02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:28.310
to be able to have some
kind of reliability

02:50:28.310 --> 02:50:32.110
that we can preserve the
formats that were created.

02:50:34.060 --> 02:50:35.360
Greg Schleusner: I would say --

02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:38.200
so one of the things
that you find in a lot

02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:39.500
of client requirements is --

02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:44.580
we're good at doing what
we know can be tested --

02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:48.570
be extremely, you know,
sort of blunt about it.

02:50:48.570 --> 02:50:51.300
So if the client has a very
good standard, and they're going

02:50:51.300 --> 02:50:53.860
to test that we're delivering
to it, we can deliver to it.

02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:55.330
But the second it says --

02:50:55.330 --> 02:50:58.330
you know, someone in the meeting
says, "Eh, not a big deal,"

02:50:58.330 --> 02:50:59.790
well, it's not a big
deal to us anymore.

02:50:59.790 --> 02:51:01.250
And so one of the
things that I think --

02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:05.890
that comes with standards
is the ability

02:51:05.890 --> 02:51:07.820
to make sure you're
receiving them, right?

02:51:07.820 --> 02:51:11.560
And part of the -- I think
from a technology standpoint,

02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:13.360
the standards that exist
today could be delivered

02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:15.070
on on every project.

02:51:15.070 --> 02:51:16.560
I don't think that's a question.

02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:19.590
It's actually just a
will to enforce them

02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:24.020
that is a much more difficult
one, because it actually --

02:51:24.020 --> 02:51:25.320
you could look at
it in two ways.

02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:27.260
There are technologies that
make it easy to enforce,

02:51:27.260 --> 02:51:30.640
or there are -- you either
have the staff to enforce them.

02:51:30.640 --> 02:51:34.680
And no one has that money lying
around until somebody sees it

02:51:34.680 --> 02:51:36.520
as a business model to enforce.

02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:41.250
From a technology perspective,
it's at least how I see it,

02:51:41.250 --> 02:51:43.410
that we won't get
better at delivering it.

02:51:43.410 --> 02:51:45.900
I think that's from a
handover standpoint.

02:51:45.900 --> 02:51:47.200
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon:
Yeah, I was talking

02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:49.290
to a BIM manager
at a contractor.

02:51:49.290 --> 02:51:53.150
He said, "So, you know, when
the VA comes out with, you know,

02:51:53.150 --> 02:51:55.860
you're going to deliver this
based on our BIM standard,

02:51:55.860 --> 02:51:59.080
before we bid, I got to call
them and kind of feel them out,

02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:01.220
and figure out whether they
know what they're asking for.

02:52:01.220 --> 02:52:03.420
And if they don't, we
figure we won't do it,

02:52:03.420 --> 02:52:04.720
and we don't charge them for it.

02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:07.000
If they do, then we
figure we have to do it,

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:08.300
and we charge them for it."

02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:11.080
So that's -- I mean,
that's really the rationale

02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:13.300
that people use, and,
you know, when we --

02:52:13.300 --> 02:52:15.710
yeah, I mean, we've built
validators and things,

02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:17.740
so the clients can know they're
getting what they wanted,

02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:20.040
but yeah.

02:52:23.390 --> 02:52:25.360
&gt;&gt; Kimon Onuma, Onuma Inc.

02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:27.770
One thought here, as
far as the ownership,

02:52:27.770 --> 02:52:30.790
and how do we track
ownership of information.

02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:33.300
I think we're still stuck --
if you look at this morning,

02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:36.130
with the talk about --
we used to even be bound

02:52:36.130 --> 02:52:37.710
to the hardware that we used.

02:52:37.710 --> 02:52:40.810
The applications used to be
bound to that and fused to it.

02:52:40.810 --> 02:52:43.300
In many ways, we're
still bound with our data

02:52:43.300 --> 02:52:45.690
to the applications that we use,
and the software that we use.

02:52:45.690 --> 02:52:47.750
But if we look at a
transaction-based thing

02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:49.190
that we can track
the transaction,

02:52:49.190 --> 02:52:50.670
you can actually
track ownership,

02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:53.070
and it's actually staring us
right on the screen right there.

02:52:53.070 --> 02:52:57.130
So when we tweet to the
hashtag there, it actually says

02:52:57.130 --> 02:53:00.330
where we are, and we post that
location, that information

02:53:00.330 --> 02:53:03.920
about what we're seeing in
this room, which can be traced

02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:05.220
in many different
-- you can search it

02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:06.520
on Google, all kinds of stuff.

02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:07.820
So the technology's
already there.

02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:09.210
I would encourage
us to look in terms

02:53:09.210 --> 02:53:11.660
of how do we track information,

02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:15.600
and look in a more
transactional-based way

02:53:15.600 --> 02:53:16.900
to look at it.

02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:18.200
And then you can start
identifying ownership.

02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:19.630
It goes back to Blockchain,
and a lot of other things.

02:53:19.630 --> 02:53:21.310
Obviously, we're not going
to get there overnight,

02:53:21.310 --> 02:53:22.860
but if we think in those terms,

02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:25.420
I think we could
get there faster.

02:53:32.040 --> 02:53:34.500
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Laura
from Georgetown University.

02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:36.250
This is a comment to Mark,
and kind of following

02:53:36.250 --> 02:53:37.840
up what he was mentioning.

02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:39.140
You mentioned that
you have a problem

02:53:39.140 --> 02:53:41.230
when you try to find images.

02:53:41.230 --> 02:53:44.280
So you have a thought
about, if you tag the image,

02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:47.430
or add mirror tags, so
probably they would be easier --

02:53:47.430 --> 02:53:50.890
it would be searchable, so
you will not have to go folder

02:53:50.890 --> 02:53:55.430
by folder to find it, and you
just have to search your C drive

02:53:55.430 --> 02:53:58.770
or whatever you have, and
store or -- just a comment.

02:53:58.770 --> 02:54:00.070
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: Yeah.

02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:01.370
Well, you know, I
think if there were --

02:54:01.370 --> 02:54:02.670
if there were a package --

02:54:02.670 --> 02:54:07.050
first of all, if there were
some image management software

02:54:07.050 --> 02:54:09.600
that was better than
what's out there --

02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:11.140
a friend of mine
referred to iPhoto

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:14.550
as Satan's work last week.

02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:18.350
That, you know, I -- we
would probably use tags

02:54:18.350 --> 02:54:20.410
if you could just
have your tags as part

02:54:20.410 --> 02:54:21.710
of the software,
and you click them.

02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:23.230
You could create your own tags.

02:54:23.230 --> 02:54:24.930
You could work that out
with the client and the rest

02:54:24.930 --> 02:54:27.560
of your design team, and that
actually would be really useful.

02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:30.770
I think tagging is --
you know, it's work --

02:54:30.770 --> 02:54:33.720
it's how Google works, so.

02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:36.450
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: So
we're implementing search

02:54:36.450 --> 02:54:38.730
technologies, and we
won't touch anything

02:54:38.730 --> 02:54:41.680
that doesn't just do machine
learning on images these days,

02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:43.600
because people aren't
going to do it.

02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:46.220
I mean, we have used
tagging systems

02:54:46.220 --> 02:54:50.100
in our internal structure for a
long time, and maybe we get one

02:54:50.100 --> 02:54:52.310
of 100 people that use tags.

02:54:52.310 --> 02:54:53.740
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: Yeah.

02:54:53.740 --> 02:54:56.940
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: So
there's obviously technological

02:54:56.940 --> 02:54:59.480
solutions to bad data management

02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:01.270
that are becoming
more available.

02:55:01.270 --> 02:55:04.870
So, I mean, that's a
sliver of the problem,

02:55:04.870 --> 02:55:07.780
but I think that's a
meaningful way to look at it.

02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:10.690
So even this -- in
this discussion, like,

02:55:10.690 --> 02:55:13.590
the domain models
for image recognition

02:55:13.590 --> 02:55:15.830
for our industry are not open.

02:55:15.830 --> 02:55:17.880
There are no such -- I don't
think there's open data sets.

02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:19.860
That's a very good example.

02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:22.900
Like, the training data that you
need to -- oh, that's a crane.

02:55:22.900 --> 02:55:24.400
That's a duct.

02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:28.290
You know, those are all, as far
as I know, proprietary data sets

02:55:28.290 --> 02:55:30.050
that people are using
to train their systems.

02:55:30.050 --> 02:55:32.160
So this is a perfect
example where we're --

02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:35.320
we self-compound on the
problems, and, you know,

02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:37.380
now you just pay for
this subscription

02:55:37.380 --> 02:55:39.010
to get the machine
learning algorithm

02:55:39.010 --> 02:55:41.440
to find your images
in the future.

02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:42.760
&gt;&gt; Mark Rylander: You probably
shouldn't ask that kind

02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:44.060
of question at an architect,

02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:47.060
or they will create their own
proprietary system [laughter]

02:55:47.060 --> 02:55:54.700
that no one else can use.

02:55:54.700 --> 02:55:56.000
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: Tim?

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:57.300
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: Tim Walsh,

02:55:57.300 --> 02:55:58.600
the Canadian Center
for Architecture.

02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:01.580
You know, I think we all know
these BIM diagrams where it's

02:56:01.580 --> 02:56:05.580
like this one model will follow
a thing from its initial sort

02:56:05.580 --> 02:56:09.110
of design development
through to the deliverable.

02:56:09.110 --> 02:56:10.880
And then it goes to
the facilities manager,

02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:12.830
and then it's used for
every renovation forever.

02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:15.740
And it tracks the building
until demolition at least.

02:56:15.740 --> 02:56:17.890
You know, maybe we're
often not in there,

02:56:17.890 --> 02:56:19.590
but sometimes maybe
you also consider

02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:22.250
that that would get copied out
to a collecting institution

02:56:22.250 --> 02:56:24.710
at some point for, like,
sort of permanent retention.

02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:26.660
And I think this is mostly a
question for Nick, but, I mean,

02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:28.880
to what degree is that
actually happening?

02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:32.580
Like, these deliverables that
come to you, do they get reused?

02:56:32.580 --> 02:56:34.830
&gt;&gt; Nick Gicale: Yeah, I mean,
I think they get reused.

02:56:34.830 --> 02:56:38.750
We haven't had, I don't think,
a new building go all the way

02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:40.400
through using BIM
for the entire thing,

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.340
and now we're solely
using that model

02:56:42.340 --> 02:56:44.180
to then manage the building.

02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:46.290
I think that over
the last 10 years,

02:56:46.290 --> 02:56:49.000
we have gotten more advanced
in what we're using BIM for,

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.380
and we have had projects
take BIM all the way

02:56:51.380 --> 02:56:53.210
through design, through
construction.

02:56:53.210 --> 02:56:56.590
And you have a fairly
good dem model at the end,

02:56:56.590 --> 02:56:58.960
but the issue still that I
have, and that the agency has,

02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:01.900
is that -- you know,
maintaining that BIM model

02:57:01.900 --> 02:57:04.220
with all the small
projects that happen in it,

02:57:04.220 --> 02:57:07.600
or happen to the building after
that BIM model was turned over.

02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:10.260
Quite frankly, you know, a
lot of our people, you know,

02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:13.320
aren't -- don't have experience
doing that, so we'd have

02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:14.620
to hire contractors to do it.

02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:15.980
So I think the maintenance
of that model

02:57:15.980 --> 02:57:22.990
through after the project still
becomes a huge issue for us.

02:57:22.990 --> 02:57:26.080
&gt;&gt; Kristine Fallon: Well, I
think, on that, we've done a lot

02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:30.900
of studies for organizations
who wanted to get into some kind

02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:36.410
of data turnover, or BIM, or --
you know, some things like that.

02:57:36.410 --> 02:57:40.610
And what we always find
is there are some things

02:57:40.610 --> 02:57:42.870
that they have staff that
they really don't need

02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:44.170
to do any more.

02:57:44.170 --> 02:57:45.760
I mean, I'm talking
about large organization.

02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:47.320
These are kind of
redundant jobs,

02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:51.590
but then there are some
really missing activities,

02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:53.380
missing jobs.

02:57:53.380 --> 02:57:56.670
And, you know, I mean, we think
technology just takes away jobs,

02:57:56.670 --> 02:58:00.180
but it also creates some
requirements and some new jobs.

02:58:00.180 --> 02:58:03.820
And, you know, if you don't
staff those jobs, i.e.,

02:58:03.820 --> 02:58:06.420
you know, somebody who's going
to sort of know what's going

02:58:06.420 --> 02:58:08.990
on in the building, and make
sure the BIM gets maintained,

02:58:08.990 --> 02:58:15.000
even though you can do with many
fewer CAD operators somewhere

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.910
else, you're not really
going to get the benefits.

02:58:17.910 --> 02:58:21.600
And that's what we found over
and over with large owners.

02:58:25.050 --> 02:58:26.350
&gt;&gt; Aliza Leventhal: Sorry,
I have another question.

02:58:26.350 --> 02:58:28.180
Aliza, from Sasaki.

02:58:28.180 --> 02:58:30.740
It's just kind of an end --
maybe an end [inaudible],

02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.450
because it is close to the end.

02:58:32.450 --> 02:58:35.700
But because you all work
in various disciplines,

02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:39.040
what are some of the
struggles that you have working

02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:41.310
from your discipline to
another design discipline,

02:58:41.310 --> 02:58:42.610
and communicating?

02:58:42.610 --> 02:58:44.810
I know Greg had said
when it comes to working

02:58:44.810 --> 02:58:48.130
with another firm, you're able
to decide on what standards work

02:58:48.130 --> 02:58:49.950
for you, and develop that.

02:58:49.950 --> 02:58:52.130
But even within Sasaki,
we have conversations

02:58:52.130 --> 02:58:54.350
about how can landscape
architects better communicate

02:58:54.350 --> 02:58:56.320
with architects, and
how does that work

02:58:56.320 --> 02:58:58.960
with a planning project on
top of that kind of thing.

02:58:58.960 --> 02:59:02.160
And so I wonder if you can
explore that a little bit,

02:59:02.160 --> 02:59:04.260
because as experts who already
have the learning curve covered,

02:59:04.260 --> 02:59:07.020
it would be great to know
what are the struggle,

02:59:07.020 --> 02:59:08.560
pain points that you
experience looking

02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:10.450
at a different discipline's
files,

02:59:10.450 --> 02:59:12.810
and trying to integrate
them into your own.

02:59:12.810 --> 02:59:15.010
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: I
feel for you more than me,

02:59:15.010 --> 02:59:16.730
because you probably get
the short end of the stick,

02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:19.530
so I'll let you go first.

02:59:19.530 --> 02:59:23.190
&gt;&gt; Noemie Lafaurie-Debany:
We don't do BIM.

02:59:23.190 --> 02:59:26.520
We provide CAD drawing
for the architects

02:59:26.520 --> 02:59:32.730
to then plug into their set.

02:59:32.730 --> 02:59:40.160
We -- in -- this is getting
out of BIM for a little bit,

02:59:40.160 --> 02:59:45.520
but in different --
visualization is very important

02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:50.020
in landscape, and in
speaking with architects

02:59:50.020 --> 02:59:55.790
or other consultant on
the team, and the client,

02:59:55.790 --> 02:59:59.080
a landscape is something
that changes all the time.

02:59:59.080 --> 03:00:00.720
So it's very hard to present.

03:00:00.720 --> 03:00:03.770
It's not an AutoCAD
block or anything

03:00:03.770 --> 03:00:09.170
that would truly represent
what you are designing.

03:00:09.170 --> 03:00:12.460
So we've experienced
with different software.

03:00:12.460 --> 03:00:15.550
At the moment, we are
using Lumion in order

03:00:15.550 --> 03:00:21.560
to very quickly create a
visualization of trees,

03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:26.060
and grasses, and shrubs.

03:00:26.060 --> 03:00:30.020
No architect we're working with
are using Lumion at the moment,

03:00:30.020 --> 03:00:33.980
so that means that we
need to take their model,

03:00:33.980 --> 03:00:37.480
clean it up in Rhino,
then put it in Lumion.

03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:42.750
In Lumion, we design
the landscape in 3D,

03:00:42.750 --> 03:00:47.620
and that's [inaudible] to
create the image of the design.

03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:51.000
We cannot give that Lumion
model to the architect to figure

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.380
out what the planting
plan would be.

03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:55.900
We need to go back to
AutoCAD and then draw --

03:00:55.900 --> 03:01:01.210
so there is a lot of sort of
dead end in a ways that we need

03:01:01.210 --> 03:01:03.050
to go to in order for
the design to process.

03:01:03.050 --> 03:01:07.670
But for communicating
with other consultants,

03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:10.920
we need go back to CAD.

03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:14.630
That's how we -- where we
are stuck at the moment.

03:01:16.270 --> 03:01:18.080
&gt;&gt; Greg Schleusner: Aliza,
this particular problem,

03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:21.910
we've actually -- so the game
world is actually quite open,

03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:23.680
and Lumion is like
a game engine.

03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:25.840
It's -- we've actually
started to do things

03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:29.670
where we move towards the game
engine tools, and tools built

03:01:29.670 --> 03:01:32.330
on top of game engines, so
we can always get access

03:01:32.330 --> 03:01:35.850
to the source code and extract
the tree location, if you will,

03:01:35.850 --> 03:01:37.740
in the future, versus
having these dead ends.

03:01:37.740 --> 03:01:40.970
But these are, you know,
specialists that, you know --

03:01:40.970 --> 03:01:43.280
finding a game developer
that'll work

03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:47.550
for an architecture salary is
very hard, those sort of things.

03:01:47.550 --> 03:01:52.080
But, I mean, those are the
places that -- we're a big firm.

03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:55.000
We can try to explore, but
they're not sustainable,

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.710
and these dead ends
exist everywhere.

03:01:57.710 --> 03:02:01.280
I think on the building side,
working with partners, it's --

03:02:01.280 --> 03:02:02.850
you know, everybody knows
what the problems are

03:02:02.850 --> 03:02:04.460
if you're using certain
BIM platforms.

03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:05.760
Oh, we have to do this.

03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:08.950
Everybody has the same issues,
where we can't track changes,

03:02:08.950 --> 03:02:10.930
and things -- I have
to get an e-mail

03:02:10.930 --> 03:02:13.430
that says what's changed,
those sort of things.

03:02:13.430 --> 03:02:14.950
I don't know.

03:02:14.950 --> 03:02:17.270
It's a systemic problem.

03:02:17.270 --> 03:02:20.450
It's not unique to us, though.

03:02:20.450 --> 03:02:25.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, so thank you.
