I know there's a broad question being

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240
I know there's a broad question being
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.900
I know there's a broad question being
asked what what do I think can be done

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
asked what what do I think can be done
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.620
asked what what do I think can be done
this year and while there are many many

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630
this year and while there are many many
 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.060
this year and while there are many many
choices I decided to talk about malaria

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070
choices I decided to talk about malaria
 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.560
choices I decided to talk about malaria
the reason I talk about malaria is that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
the reason I talk about malaria is that
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.259
the reason I talk about malaria is that
there are a million children die every

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
there are a million children die every
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.740
there are a million children die every
year in Africa there we have all the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
year in Africa there we have all the
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.500
year in Africa there we have all the
tools that are necessary to prevent

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
tools that are necessary to prevent
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.080
tools that are necessary to prevent
those decks in addition there is an

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
those decks in addition there is an
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.350
those decks in addition there is an
enormous economic toll to malaria and if

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
enormous economic toll to malaria and if
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.400
enormous economic toll to malaria and if
we can prevent these this disease and to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
we can prevent these this disease and to
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.510
we can prevent these this disease and to
eliminate the mortality the child deaths

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520
eliminate the mortality the child deaths
 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.450
eliminate the mortality the child deaths
then we make a huge difference all it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
then we make a huge difference all it
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.500
then we make a huge difference all it
takes is a united effort in countries by

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510
takes is a united effort in countries by
 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.540
takes is a united effort in countries by
people who have the wherewithal and the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
people who have the wherewithal and the
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.500
people who have the wherewithal and the
capabilities to launch programs on a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
capabilities to launch programs on a
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.070
capabilities to launch programs on a
very aggressive pudding the scale of the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080
very aggressive pudding the scale of the
 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.730
very aggressive pudding the scale of the
war against malaria and such a coalition

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
war against malaria and such a coalition
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.609
war against malaria and such a coalition
has come together under roll back

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
has come together under roll back
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.539
has come together under roll back
malaria under a strong pass force that's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549
malaria under a strong pass force that's
 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.109
malaria under a strong pass force that's
designed to create these from national

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
designed to create these from national
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.390
designed to create these from national
plans or health countries prepare

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
plans or health countries prepare
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.880
plans or health countries prepare
national plans to coordinate them into a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
national plans to coordinate them into a
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.749
national plans to coordinate them into a
regional plan and go on an aggressive

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759
regional plan and go on an aggressive
 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.210
regional plan and go on an aggressive
timetable of implementation I believe

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
timetable of implementation I believe
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.179
timetable of implementation I believe
the time is right this year we should

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
the time is right this year we should
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.690
the time is right this year we should
have universal access to bed nets we

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
have universal access to bed nets we
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.550
have universal access to bed nets we
should have a universal access to the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
should have a universal access to the
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800
should have a universal access to the
next generation drugs so you have

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
next generation drugs so you have
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.660
next generation drugs so you have
universal access doing you're spraying

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
universal access doing you're spraying
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.240
universal access doing you're spraying
and if we are able to do that yeah

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
and if we are able to do that yeah
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.389
and if we are able to do that yeah
actually we can eliminate all malaria

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
actually we can eliminate all malaria
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.580
actually we can eliminate all malaria
deaths within the next three to five

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
deaths within the next three to five
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.420
deaths within the next three to five
mins that would be the one thing I would

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
mins that would be the one thing I would
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.420
mins that would be the one thing I would
take the work on this year hope you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
take the work on this year hope you
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.930
take the work on this year hope you
agree love to hear your comments
