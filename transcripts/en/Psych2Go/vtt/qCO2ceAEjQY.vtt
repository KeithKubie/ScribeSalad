00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.380
Although we have a choice in becoming the people we strive to be,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.800
it is without a doubt that our childhoods shape us to a certain extent.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.180
How we choose to react to different situations and the way we express ourselves,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.060
Are the behavioral patterns that formed starting at a young age

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.620
when we first begin to learn how to make sense of our immediate environment.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
Marriage and family counselors, Dr. Malan and Kay Yerkovich,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.340
Discovered that everyone has a certain love style based on their upbringing.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.300
A love style is comprised of our tendencies and inclinations of how we respond to our romantic partners.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.060
By understanding how we love, we can learn how our love styles affect our relationships.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.700
Here are Dr. Malan and Kay Yerkovich's "5 Love Styles"

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.360
1. The Pleaser

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.360
The Pleaser often grows up in a home with an overly protective, or angry and critical parent.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.500
As children, Pleasers do everything they can to be good and to be on their best behavior

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.540
So as to not provoke a negative response from their parent.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.760
Pleaser children don't receive comfort.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.280
Instead, they spend their time and energy giving comfort to their reactive parent.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.640
Pleasers are uncomfortable with conflict and deal with disagreements

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.180
by often giving in or making up for them quickly.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.640
They usually have a hard time saying "No" and because they want to minimalize conflict,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.760
They may not be truthful and lie to avoid difficult confrontations.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.960
As Pleaser children grow into adults,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.400
They learn to read the moods of others around them to make sure they can keep everyone happy.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.920
However, when Pleasers feel stressed or believe that they are continuously letting someone down,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.380
They can have a breakdown and flee from relationships.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.620
Pleasers often spread themselves thin, trying to be everything to everyone when it's not realistic.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.280
And instead of forming healthy boundaries for themselves,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.340
They focus more on the needs and desires of others.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.660
In order for Pleasers to cultivate stable relationships,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.860
They have to be honest about their own feelings rather than trying to do what is expected of them.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.260
2. The Victim

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.360
The Victim often grows up in a chaotic home.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.560
Victims learn to be compliant in order to survive by

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.820
Putting less attention on themselves so they can stay under the radar.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.140
To deal with their angry violent parents,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.280
Victim children learn at a very young age to hide and stay quiet.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.000
Because being fully present is painful for them,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.660
Victim children often build an imaginary world in their heads

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.120
To cope with the dangers they face on a daily basis.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.220
Victims have low self-esteem,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.460
and usually struggle with anxiety and depression.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940
They may end up marrying controllers

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.240
Who mirror the same behaviors as their parents.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.240
Victims learn to cope by being adaptable and going with the flow.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.920
They are so used to chaos in stressful situations that when they do experience calmness,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.920
It actually makes them feel uneasy because they anticipate the next blow-up.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.420
In order for victims to cultivate healthy stable relationships,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.640
they have to learn self-love and stand up for themselves when a situation calls for it,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.120
instead of letting their partner walk all over them.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.940
3. The Controller

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.660
The Controller usually grows up in a home where

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.640
there wasn't a lot of protection so they learn to toughen up and take care of themselves.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.780
They need to feel in control at all times to prevent the vulnerability

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.280
They experienced in their childhood from being exposed in their adulthood.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.320
People with this love style believe that they're in control when they can avoid

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.720
experiencing negative feelings of fear, humiliation and helplessness.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.720
Controllers, however, don't associate anger as vulnerability.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.220
So they use it as a weapon to remain in power.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.440
Controllers have rigid tendencies, but may also be sporadic and unpredictable.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.980
They don't like stepping out of their comfort zones because it makes them feel weak and unprotected.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.720
They prefer to solve problems on their own and like getting things done in a certain manner.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.860
Otherwise, they get angry.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.180
In order for controllers to form stable long lasting relationships,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.640
They need to learn how to let go, trust others, and keep their anger at bay.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.320
4. The Vacillator

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.700
The Vacillator often grows up with an unpredictable parent.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.600
As children, Vacillators learned that their needs aren't their parents top priority.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.600
Without consistent affection from their parent, Vacillators develop a deep fear of abandonment.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.340
But when the parent finally feels like giving their time and attention to them,

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.460
Vacillators are usually too angry and tired to receive it.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.220
As Vacillators enter adulthood,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.080
They try to find the consistent love they were deprived of as children.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.560
Vacillators have a tendency to idealize new relationships

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.640
But once they feel led down or disappointed, they grow dejected and doubtful.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.660
They often feel misunderstood

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.300
and experience a lot of internal conflict and emotional stress within their relationships.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.260
They can be extremely sensitive and perceptive,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.600
Which allows them to detect even the slightest change in others and knowing people are pulling away.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.240
In order for Vacillators to cultivate healthy stable relationships,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.480
They need to learn how to pace themselves and get to know someone

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.180
before committing too soon and getting hurt by their own expectations.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.740
5. The Avoider

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.080
The Avoider often grows up in a less affectionate home that values independence and self-reliance.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.700
As children, Avoiders learn to take care of themselves starting at a very young age.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.900
They put their feelings and needs on hold to deal with their anxieties

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.080
of having little to no comfort from their parents.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.420
Avoiders tend to like their space and rely on logic and detachment more than their emotions.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.400
They get uncomfortable when people around them experience intense mood swings.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.600
In order for Avoiders to cultivate healthy and long-lasting relationships,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.600
They need to learn how to open up and express their emotions honestly.
