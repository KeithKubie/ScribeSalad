00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.770
Evaluation too can play a very important role in the iterative loops in

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.770
this analogical reasoning process. One can use several different methods for

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.820
doing evaluation. In the robot that can walk on water, for example, we can do

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.170
a simulation, or we can build a physical prototype. If the evolution succeeds,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.700
then well and good, we can encapsulate the target polymer solution as a case and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.450
store it in case memory. If the evaluation fails, we may need to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.550
revisit transfer and see whether we want to transfer some of the knowledge or

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.140
revisit mapping, and perhaps align things differently or revisit retrieval and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.470
perhaps try to retrieve a different source case. As an example,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.930
supposing that the evaluation shows, then the robot that we designed for

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.990
walking on water is a little too heavy. In that particular case, we may

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.820
change the problem specification and retrieve a different kind of organism that

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.660
perhaps is a little lighter. Let us suppose that we evaluate the design of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.150
the robot that can walk on water and find that the design is a little too heavy.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.810
In that case, we can go back to the transfer stage and see whether we can

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.420
transfer some of the relationship that might make the robot a little lighter. Or

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.180
we can go back to the mapping stage and see whether we can align the source case

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.490
and the target problem slightly differently so that we can transfer a different

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.920
relationship. Or alternatively, we can go back to the retrieval state and try to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.840
retrieve a source case, a different kind of biological organism altogether.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.250
Thus, we see that the process of analogical reasoning is not linear at all and

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.150
see it can have many different kinds of iterations.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.915
Analogical reasoning continues to be an important topic in our research and

00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:39.100
biological-inspired design is becoming one.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.530
We provide several readings with both topics in the class notes.
