00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:14.980
First, let’s make sure everybody here understands
what a calorie is.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.860
A calorie is just a measurement of energy-
the amount of energy needed to raise 1 gram

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.320
of water 1 degree Celsius at standard atmospheric
pressure.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.980
This makes sense when talking about calories
in food.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.900
Food provides energy and our bodies need this
energy to function throughout the day.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.900
I’m hoping to burn about 100 calories while
writing this response.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.900
If not, this 100 calorie snack pack won’t
be as health conscious as I thought and will

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.900
go straight to my hips!

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.780
Second, it’s also important to note that
Calories in food are actually measured in

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.420
kilocalories, so 1000 actual calories for
every 1 Calorie listed.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.750
Manufacturers used to measure calories using
a “bomb calorimeter”.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.010
This process involved placing the food source
in a sealed container filled with water.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.700
They would then burn the food with electrical
energy.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.829
After the food had completely burned up, they
would measure the water temperature to see

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.719
how many degrees it was raised and thus how
many calories used.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.500
In 1990, under The Nutrition Labeling and
Education Act of 1990, the FDA began requiring

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.570
food manufacturers to label the amounts of
nutrients and calories contained in their

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.570
products.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.470
This act resulted in moving away from the
bomb calorimeter method for determining the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.330
number of calories in food.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.030
One reason for this was to make it easier
and less expensive for manufacturers to meet

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.090
the standard.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.369
Another was that the bomb calorimeter method
measures all available calories in the product.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.100
Since most foods contain indigestible components,
like fiber, that pass through our system and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.230
get excreted in the form of bum brownies,
this would lead to a consistent overestimation

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.280
of ingested calories using the bomb calorimeter.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.900
Instead, they used an easier method known
as the Atwater system.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.140
This approach adds up the calories available
through the energy containing nutrients in

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.090
the food item, like protein, carbohydrates,
fats, and alcohols.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.150
They use standard reference tables for common
ingredients based on their energy densities.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.220
Things like 4 kilocalories for proteins, 4
for carbohydrates, 3 for organic acids, 9

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.619
for fats, and 7 for drinkable alcohols (ethanol).

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.240
No wonder all that beer gives me this soft
belly!

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.640
It has over 1.5 the calories per mass as proteins
and carbohydrates (well worth it though).

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.730
So for a specific example, let’s say that
tasty snack you have before you jump on the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.270
treadmill contains 5g of protein, 10g of carbohydrates,
and 15g of fat.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.209
The label on the package would then read 225
Calories (or 225,000 calories for those who

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:54.730
can’t stand over simplification which results
in misconceptions!)
