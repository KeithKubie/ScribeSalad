00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:42.520
Prison, by design, is a place where a number
of your rights are either stripped away or

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.930
are severely limited in some manner.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.929
The right most pertinent to the topic of conversation
today is the ability to freely access your

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.639
bank account and/or manage any money or assets
you may have.

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:58.050
First though we should probably mention the
distinction between jail and prison as the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.019
terms are often, erroneously, used interchangeably.

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.010
In a nutshell, jails generally serve to hold
individuals who are awaiting trial and, in

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.420
the U.S. are typically run by county offices,
whereas prisons hold those who’ve been sentenced

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.110
and usually run by Prisons and Corrections
offices in each state.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.070
As with all things in life, there are exceptions
here and individuals sentenced to shorter

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.530
sentences (usually less than a year) can be
incarcerated in jails.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.720
Moving on, in the United States, with the
exception of a few specific types of crime

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.080
we’ll discuss in more detail in a moment,
upon being sentenced, absolutely nothing whatsoever

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.680
will happen to your money, property and assets.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.920
In fact, an often unforeseen downside of being
arrested and sent to prison is that you’re

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.940
still on the hook for all of the financial
obligations you committed to prior to being

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.200
arrested and sentenced including rent, bills
and of course debts.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.729
But, of course, at this point, you’re likely
to have lost any way to make any significant

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.110
amount of money to pay said bills.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.340
So, if you head to prison with a phone contract
or even something like a Netflix subscription,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.959
that money will continue be vacuumed out of
your account each and every month.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:12.959
And due to the fact that you’re, well, in
prison, cancelling or freezing these contracts

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.959
is made exponentially more difficult, and
from a practical standpoint resolving this

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:14.959
sort of thing can be impossible for some inmates.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:15.959
As a direct result of these problems, it’s
not unlikely to leave prison only to be immediately

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:16.959
hounded by debt collectors and the like.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:17.959
Along with now having the label of convicted
criminal, this generally doesn’t set up

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:18.959
a person recently freed from prison to easily
be able to become a productive member of society.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:19.959
For this reason and others, many lawyers strongly
advise getting your financial life, including

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:20.959
settling any debts and getting rid of any
bills you can, in order before any kind of

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.410
potential prison sentence to avoid an unnecessary
loss of funds or leaving prison in a worse

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.519
financial situation than when you entered
it, which is extremely common.

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.549
This can be difficult, however, for those
suddenly arrested and unable to post bail

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.650
in order to potentially have an interim period
between jail and prison to get everything

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.650
in order.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.010
Then again, depending on the amount of time
you’re sentenced to serve, having something

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.060
like a Netflix account or similar subscription
that takes a very small amount of money from

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.530
your account each month, can actually be a
good idea for some inmates.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.359
The reason being that it is the policy of
most banks to freeze accounts if no activity

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.879
is recorded on it for a set amount of time.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.219
(The amount varies from bank to bank, but
around 6-12 months of inactivity seems to

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.219
be a good ballpark figure for when this generally
occurs according to our research).

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.651
Further, if your account has been frozen for
more than 15 years, at least in the UK, the

00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:11.010
government is allowed to take any money in
such an account and distribute it to worthy

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.510
causes, though technically you’re still
supposed to be able to recover the money even

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.639
then, if you happen to be able to track it
down after all that time.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.690
On that note, if your account is frozen, a
bank should have no problem unfreezing it,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.989
provided you can jump through the required
hoops.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.029
The problem being that unfreezing an account
from within prison is, from a practical standpoint,

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:34.279
sometimes an effort in futility, with the
best case scenario being that you’ll be

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:38.730
able to get the account unfrozen after many
months of effort and help from someone on

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.730
the outside.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.980
Thus, lawyers generally advise making nominal
payments into or from a given account while

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.909
in prison to avoid this happening.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.060
A problem here, of course, is that while in
prison, in many regions of the world, you

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.860
are forbidden, or severely restricted, to
any direct access to any bank accounts you

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.860
have.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.969
This might all have you wondering how do you
make any payments or deposits from prison?

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.930
Well, in the UK prisoners are allowed to make
limited banking transactions “of a personal

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.370
nature” provided they are to either –

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.939
Help you to maintain your personal affairs
whilst in prison.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.230
Help assist you to resume a regular lifestyle
on release.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.980
For example, a British prisoner can issue
checks, pay debts and even authorise the sale

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.060
of property and assets, within reason or run
a (legitimate) business in a limited capacity.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.010
However, there are often severe restrictions
to access to telephone and internet banking,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.630
if access if given at all, meaning for most
inmates any banking has to be done by mail…

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.400
It should also be noted here that access to
mail and what correspondence are allowed in

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.490
and out for a given inmate can often be severely
restricted as well.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.640
In addition, most prisoners on both sides
of the pond usually have access to special

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.280
prison accounts usable within prison.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.600
This account can use to buy things from the
commissary like toiletries or even personal

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.050
items like TVs or radios at the discretion
of prison officials.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.770
In fact, if you ever find yourself in prison
and wish to watch a TodayIFoundOut video,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.151
you can actually do so in the United States,
though at a remarkably absorbent price per

00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:13.400
video that we have nothing to do with- if
it were up to us, it would be free to prisoners.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.250
Nonetheless, some inmates choose to pay that
exorbitant fee to watch our videos.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.840
To date, the most popular such video seems
to be our video on the colorful life of Colonel

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.800
Sanders, which, by the way, we go into a lot
more detail on in our BrainFood Show podcast

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.490
in the episode titled A Restaurant for a Beetle
and a $100 and a Bike- The Fascinating Stories

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.550
Behind Four Famous Businesses.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.780
That’s not to mention how prohibitively
expensive it is to use a phone to call your

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.900
kids and other family, or correspond with
a bank or debt collectors or the like from

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.900
prison.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.560
On top of the cost, there’s also the extremely
limited time inmates are allowed to talk on

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.200
the phone per day to anyone, even if they
have the money (usually about 10 minutes per

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200
day max- good luck just getting past the menu
and then being put on hold in that time frame

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200
when talking to any business.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.770
And congratulations for having to choose that
instead of talking to your kids that day.)

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.590
This is despite it being conclusively proven
that increased family communication while

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:08.600
in prison markedly reduces the rates of recidivism
among inmates.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.690
As U.S. Senator Brian Schatz recently noted,
“People in prison should not have to pay

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.270
exorbitant fees just to talk on the phone
with their kids, their clergy, or their counsel.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.400
It’s bad for human rights, it’s bad for
our justice system, and it’s bad for our

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400
taxpayers.”

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.700
Moving swiftly along, one key difference between
the way the American system works compared

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.980
to the system in the UK is that bank accounts
cannot be used directly by inmates to conduct

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.730
personal banking transactions in the United
States.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.090
In contrast, in the UK they can and an individual
can transfer money from the prison account

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.961
to a personal account or even to another person’s
account entirely to pay debts and the like-

00:06:43.961 --> 00:06:48.320
again, an option not directly available to
prisoners in the US.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.890
As Ed Ross, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau
of Prisons, notes-

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.030
Inmates can protect legitimate business interests
by executing powers of attorney.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.130
We allow that to happen.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.770
But we do not facilitate inmates paying their
bills.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.300
That all has to be scheduled from the outside.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.890
Any financial responsibility you have on the
outside unrelated to court orders, you’re

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.890
on your own.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.230
On this note, as one former inmate, Preston
Love Jr, stated, “Before I went to jail,

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:17.430
I had a car, cellphone, cable and Internet,
credit cards and many other bills and loans

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.430
that were being paid…

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.190
I contacted a few of the companies, but many
of them said there wasn’t anything they

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.770
could do until I was in jail.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.290
Once I was in jail, there was still nothing
they could do.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.130
I had people try to call and make arrangements
for me, but they wouldn’t allow them.”

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.970
As you might imagine from this, before being
sentenced, it’s strongly advised that you

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.370
give someone on the outside official full
access to all your finances and accounts with

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.330
any entities, either through something like
a blanket power of attorney or even something

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.410
as simple as opening a joint bank account
with them and putting all your money in there.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.850
Again, this must be done before you’re incarcerated,
as lawyer David O’Neil states, “Inmates

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.110
can’t set up bank accounts.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.050
We’ve called numerous banks, but they all
tell us the same thing.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.520
You have to be physically present to set up
bank accounts.”

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.980
Of course, while it is possible to give someone
else control of your financial assets, such

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.500
a loved one, lawyer or financial expert, there
are pros and cons to each option.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.110
For example, transferring control of your
financial assets to loved one usually intentionally

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.810
leaves them ability to do pretty much whatever
they want with your assets.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.889
This can be a good or bad thing, depending
on the person.

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:19.150
To quote financial advisor Andrew Bernstein,

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.150
I tell people going in to get a reliable person
— somebody that you trust with your life

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.581
— and make them power of attorney for your
bills, for your home.

00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:29.280
Essentially, you’re turning everything over
to somebody else.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.180
It’s got to be somebody that’s not going
to screw you over.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.330
Of course it’s possible to limit the access
of a given individual to your assets, but

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.520
this may also prove to be a problem if you
only grant them permission to withdraw a set

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.840
amount of money or something and there’s
a bill that exceeds this amount you need to

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840
pay.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.830
Naturally given how powerless inmates are
to do anything about it, cases of identify

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.190
theft, the entrusted person running off with
all the inmate’s money and not paying any

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.190
of the bills and the like isn’t terribly
uncommon.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.380
Thus, for those few who can afford it even
after being sent to prison and in most cases

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.740
losing any income source, it’s often advisable
to entrust a lawyer or professional financial

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.980
manager to handle things if you can.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.610
And if you’re wondering, none of what we’ve
discussed changes if you’re sentenced to

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.750
life in prison and a person on the receiving
end of such a sentence is still required to

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.430
settle any and all debts.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.210
Then again, the data shows pretty clearly
that one’s credit score and paying one’s

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.671
debts is pretty low on the priority list of
those who really think they’ll never be

00:09:13.671 --> 00:09:15.340
released from prison or that it might be decades.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.370
Although, occasionally people are paroled
from even life sentences, so most lawyers

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.760
strongly advise even these people to do their
best to settle their financial obligations,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.200
so that if they do ever get out, they’ve
not put themselves behind the 8-ball any more

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.700
than they inherently already are after committing
a crime that would get an extremely lengthy

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.700
sentence in the first place.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.140
And as to the event that a prisoner dies in
prison, it’s no different to if a person

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.210
dies outside of prison and their remaining
assets, if any, will be divided up in accordance

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.710
with their will or debt obligations.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.310
The exception to all this, though, is if the
authorities believe a person has benefited

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:49.150
financially in some way from the crimes they
are accused of, in which case many governments,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:54.440
including in the US and UK, have broad authority
to seize and distribute assets as they see

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.440
fit.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.170
In the UK, for example, the 2002 Proceeds
of Crime Act allows the authorities to distribute

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:05.780
seized money and assets to charities, use
them to fund community projects in an area

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.150
affected by a crime or even give the money
directly to the victims of a crime as a form

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.150
of compensation.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.250
For the most part, though, assets are sold
and added along with the money to government

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.460
coffers for the purpose of fighting crime.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.091
This is essentially what happens to seized
assets and monies in the US as well, with

00:10:20.091 --> 00:10:24.590
assets being sold and police auctions and
the like, with money going back to the authorities

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.650
and in some cases, directly to the State or
federal government.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.560
If the extent to which a person benefited
financially from their crimes cannot be ascertained,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.700
in both the US and the UK the authorities
will attempt to freeze their bank accounts,

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.839
essentially preventing them from being used
in any manner previously described, while

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:42.380
everything’s sorted out.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.540
The idea here being to prevent the individual
from, say, sending the money abroad so the

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.740
government can no longer easily seize it or
something like that.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.490
If no wrongdoing is found to have occurred,
the accounts can be unfrozen, at which point

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.680
the owner can use them again in the limited
scope allowed by whatever prison they’re

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.779
incarcerated in.

00:10:56.779 --> 00:10:59.970
Further, if you find yourself in prison and
some debt collectors come a calling, it’s

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.760
also possible that they’ll be able to petition
to have money directly taken from your account

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.130
without your consent to settle a debt.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.650
For some inmates who might have no good way
to settle a debt otherwise, this isn’t necessarily

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.650
a bad thing.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.650
Although, as you might expect, this is often
less than ideal for most inmates who typically

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.650
aren’t exactly rolling in the money, and
who also often have families that that money,

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.650
if it exists at all in the first place, was
supposed to be used to help support.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.710
But in a nutshell, even if one is sentenced
to life in prison or just a month, a person

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.190
(depending on where they are in the world)
usually has extremely limited access to their

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:24.010
various assets behind bars, despite still
being obligated to pay any bills and debts

00:11:24.010 --> 00:13:14.370
as if they were still gainfully employed and
a free individual.
