00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.650
PROFESSOR: I'm Sara Verilli.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.060
I'm the development director
at the MIT Game Lab.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.100
I came to the Game Lab
from the game industry,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.530
where I've worked as a producer
and a game designer and a QA

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.670
person.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.970
I've done an awful
lot of jobs and seats.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.385
I've worked on Thief, Thief
1 and 2, Flight Ultimate.

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:31.510
I started at Looking Glass.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.634
And that's actually where
most of my work was done.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.020
I then worked at
Irrational for a while.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.362
And that's when I
moved to the Game Lab.

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:42.190
I came on to be a specialist
in production, production

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.580
management, and QA testing.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.674
And those remain the areas
that I teach in the course,

00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:51.215
specifically.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.980
We all do a little
bit of everything.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.870
But I lead the lectures on
agile and organizing your team

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.300
and keeping it running.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.037
And I also do a lot of the
testing lectures and focus

00:01:06.037 --> 00:01:06.745
testing lectures.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.290
What am I playing now?

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.950
Right now I am not playing,
but I'm hoping to play soon,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.050
is the newest
release of Minecraft,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.330
which has bunnies in it,
which both I and my daughters

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.290
are very excited about.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.240
So I am hoping
that tonight I will

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.690
be able to actually go
home and arrange for a play

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.760
session of Minecraft with them.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.080
I'm also playing a fair bit of
Sentinels of the Multiverse.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.300
And most recently, we've been
tackling the Pathfinders card

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.830
game, which is
almost a way to play

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.310
an RPG in a short
amount of time,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.140
except that takes almost as long
as a full session of playing

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.049
a sit-down RPG so far.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.340
We'll see if we can get faster.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.150
Right now, I'm not actually
working on any games.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.029
I was working on a
climate change game.

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:57.570
I'm moving away from
that, and trying

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.550
to think about what is a
more interesting problem

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.280
to work on, in the area of
not just teaching game design,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.620
but using game
design, using people

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.990
learning game design to learn
other subjects, as well.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.850
So you can tie two
things together.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.380
And I'm playing around
with how do you teach that?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.092
How do you structure
a course that

00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:19.300
would do something like that?

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.117
I'm actually really excited
to having a specific design

00:02:27.117 --> 00:02:29.200
question that we're asking
the kids, the students,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.950
to look more deeply into,
into making decisions

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.580
for the player, and making
meaningful decisions.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.010
Because that's a part of games
that the simpler your game is,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.550
the harder it is to
invite your player

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.950
to make meaningful decisions,
and to set up situations

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.497
where they are making those.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.080
But that tends to
be the part of games

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.413
that I, at least, find the
most interesting-- the places

00:02:48.413 --> 00:02:50.270
where I'm making
choices, and I can

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.560
see how my choices have
completely sunk my ship

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.890
or enabled me to win the game.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.330
I like knowing that I, I
have control of my destiny.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.260
And so getting the
students to get

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.380
to explore that aspect of
games better and more deeper,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.380
I think, is really nice.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.980
I'm currently also working on
creating a game with the Step

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.170
Lab Introduction to
Game Design on MIT EdX.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.620
I think it's 11.126x, is
the number, I believe.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.500
I've spend so much
time making the course,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.730
I have not been looking into
all the administrivia tack

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.430
to do it.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.280
But working on that, trying to
condense a game course into six

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.524
weeks, has been
really hard, and has

00:03:34.524 --> 00:03:36.190
made me really stop
and think about what

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.270
is the actual important
things in game design?

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.940
I would like games
to go-- well, they've

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.820
already gone some of the
places I want them to go.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.520
Games that are looking at
more social-- integrating more

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.110
social experiences.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.360
Games that aren't just--
board games where you're not

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.030
just me playing
against everyone else,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.696
but you're playing
as a team, and you're

00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:01.650
playing cooperatively.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.514
And video games are
also doing that.

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:04.930
They've been doing
that for years,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.120
in the massive multiplayer
games, and things like that.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.720
But seeing video games go more
for how do we work together?

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.290
How do we make this a
more social experience?

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.816
And what I really
love to see is games

00:04:18.816 --> 00:04:20.399
getting to the point
where players get

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.640
to affect the games
back, especially

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.310
in the RPG space, where if
I'm a big enough player, and I

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.870
can now defeat everything
in the game trivially,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.020
can I go in and change
the game to make it more

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.420
interesting for other players?

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.420
Can I take some of that?

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.380
And then, that actually
goes all the way back--

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.660
that was already being
done back in MUDs, right?

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.200
This not actually a new concept.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.870
It's just that
production quality

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.650
has gotten so high that
you can't do that anymore.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.730
Well, with all the
tools coming online,

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.020
can we bring that really
neat players giving back

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.550
into the game and creating
experiences for other players?

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.050
Maybe we can start bringing it
back into the high-end games,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.050
too.
