Wow, that was a lot of algebra. We learned three different methods of graphing

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:07.778
using a table, using self intercept form and using x and y intercepts. We looked

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:11.554
at how math can help us rent a truck and we discovered what those numbers meant

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:15.435
for the truck rental. Maybe you can find some other scenarios in your life where

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:19.354
algebra can help you save or spend your money. If you have any ideas, share them

00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:23.444
on the forum. We hope to hear from you there. Now that we're done graphing

00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:28.115
equations, the next thing that we're going to do is write some equations. Stay

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:28.647
with us.
