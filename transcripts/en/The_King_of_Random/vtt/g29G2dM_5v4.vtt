00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
In today's video,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.600
we are taking a pile
of Himalayan salt lamps,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.413
and putting them through
some stress test

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.100
to see just what they can
and cannot handle.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:17.300
[Music]

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Guys, ironically enough,
just a few hours ago today,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.800
Veritasium released
a video that debunked

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.400
whether or not Himalayan
salt crystal lamps were

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.600
actually good for you,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.200
and released enough negative
ions into the atmosphere

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.900
to actually boost your mood.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.200
However, we still have
a bunch of salt lamps.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.021
So, we are going
to be putting these

00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:36.618
through a few tests to see just

00:00:36.618 --> 00:00:38.300
what they can
and cannot survive.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.600
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.100
We have three salt lamps,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.092
and we are going
to see just what sort

00:00:43.092 --> 00:00:44.709
of stress test they can handle.

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:46.587
This is going to
involve water, heat,

00:00:46.587 --> 00:00:48.600
and maybe a few other things.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.700
So as far as these
lamps are concerned,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.971
it has been debunked

00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:55.753
that they can't really release
that many negative ions to make

00:00:55.753 --> 00:00:58.716
a positive impact on moods
or anything like that.

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:00.792
However, there are
types of crystals

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:03.700
that have been proven
to basically boost your mood

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.150
because of the way they
release negative ions.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.738
One of those is tourmaline.

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:10.600
Now, that is much more expensive
than Himalayan salt,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.500
which is probably one
of the reasons why

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.720
these are much more
commercially available.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.460
That said, we just sort of want
to put them to the test,

00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:19.228
and see what else they can do.

00:01:19.228 --> 00:01:19.805
All right.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:21.100
So for our first test,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.900
well, we wanted to throw one
in the forge but...

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.700
It's snowing really
hard outside right now.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.646
So we're going to stick with
the indoor experiments today,

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:31.298
and then move
forward from there.

00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:31.948
So first off,

00:01:31.948 --> 00:01:32.848
while I have heard

00:01:32.848 --> 00:01:35.200
that these lamps can absorb
moisture from the atmosphere,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.908
I want to find out
whether or not they can melt.

00:01:37.908 --> 00:01:40.729
Some people say they can't,
some people say they can.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.200
Let's put it to the test.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.413
So for these videos,
we don't need the base,

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:46.100
we're just kind of
taking them apart,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.800
and I am very disappointed

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.000
because It's a lot easier
than I wanted it to be.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.340
But it's good for our purpose is.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.340
[Music]

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.240
Perfect.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.620
That's a very
large chunk of salt.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.678
So for one of our first
stress test here,

00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:07.031
I have heard it said
that you cannot melt

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:08.700
or dissolve one of these lamps.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.995
I don't know
if that's true,

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:11.100
and I want to find out.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.905
So the first thing

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:14.500
that we're going to do is run
one of these under some water

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.599
on the time-lapse.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.600
See what happens.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.188
We're also going to put one

00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:20.100
in a pot of boiling water
on the stove,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.400
see if it dissolves.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.400
All right.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.700
So we've got everything set up
for our time-lapse.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.800
Sorry about the dirty dishes,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000
but we want to see just
how long it takes to erode

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:30.600
away one of these salt lamps.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:53.620
[Music]

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.960
Stress test number one,

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:58.300
can you erode a Himalayan
salt lamp with water?

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700
Yes.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.600
So we were playing with glass
on the table earlier,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.900
so I'm hoping this is just salt.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.100
Yeah, that's salt.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.733
Okay.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.764
All right, stress
test number two.

00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:14.646
So we have seen

00:03:14.646 --> 00:03:17.243
that you can erode away one
of these salt lamps

00:03:17.243 --> 00:03:18.772
with just using tap water.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.080
So we've actually got a little
set up here on the stove.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.733
So this is going to be slightly
submerged in boiling water,

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:25.900
and while I do believe

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.600
that's just going
to dissolve it,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.295
I'm curious to see
what the steam will do.

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:29.837
I want to see

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:32.056
if that's actually going
to help erode and dissolve

00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:33.210
the outside of it as well.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:04:16.180
[Music]

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.800
We've definitely
made a mess.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.100
So the salt itself seems

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.000
like it's mostly been fine
from the steam.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.700
Like I was expecting it to get
that same glassy outside

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.900
that we were getting on the one
that had the water running

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.300
over it and eroding it away.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.000
Instead, what we've
gotten is the water

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.420
itself is turned almost opaque,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.700
and it splattered
salt everywhere,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.500
like the pot is just coated
in a powdery salt,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.700
and I'm very curious.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.500
I do think it's lost some
of its volume here.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.851
So I'm going to try
and pick it up.

00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:47.800
I want to know just

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800
how much of it sunk
through the grating.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.720
That's kind of hot to the touch.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.280
Not too--

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.277
It's not too bad,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.400
but I'm putting
on different glove.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.940
[Music]

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.500
All right.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.895
Time lapse is definitely
going to show that better,

00:05:01.895 --> 00:05:04.100
because we lost about half
of its volume there.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.300
I was not expecting that.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.100
But it is not nearly
as smooth as it was

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.200
when we eroded
the other one away.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.900
This is so very very rough,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.500
course, almost the same
as it is on the other side.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.100
Not nearly as effective as I
thought it was going to be,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.800
especially compared
to the eroding.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.360
Can you dissolve
a salt lamp using steam?

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.296
Yes, but it would probably
take a very long time.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.000
So comparatively,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.800
running it under water
versus simply allowing the steam

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.186
to do the work for you,

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:35.200
this one's going to survive,
that one, not so much.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.600
All right.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.500
So we've tried eroding one
of our salt lamps.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.657
We've tried dissolving one,

00:05:39.657 --> 00:05:41.297
and now, we want
to try melting one.

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:41.993
But to do that,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.618
we're going to need
a lot more heat.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.800
All right guys,
so we've made it up to the Dome.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.500
We've already eroded
one salt lamp.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.763
We've tried to dissolve another.

00:05:48.763 --> 00:05:50.700
So for our final one,
we're going to melt it.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.093
So we got this thing.

00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:54.200
This is an extra large crucible

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.800
that just so happens to hold
our salt lamp perfectly.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.700
So, let's drop it in,
see what happens.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.860
[Music]

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.480
Sure, that's gonna work.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:15.260
[Music]

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.800
It's very cold here, guys.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:34.120
[Music]

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.980
All right, so it's been
about 10 minutes,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.155
and we've actually had
this on time lapse.

00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:39.000
But I'm not sure

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.100
if we're actually going
to get the ambient heat

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.100
in our forge to be warm enough
to actually melt the salt.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.900
So what we're going to do
is put the lid on now.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.600
Hopefully, leave it
for a little while,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.100
and when we come back,
it should be melted?

00:06:50.100 --> 00:07:10.460
[Music]

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.100
All right, so I just
checked on this,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.000
and I think we actually managed
to do this, guys.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.700
It's been about
an hour and a half,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.700
which is not as long as we
were expecting this to take.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.794
We have successfully melted
an entire Himalayan salt lamp.

00:07:31.794 --> 00:07:32.700
Oh wow!

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.500
So I was not expecting
it to have that much

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.460
of volume left over.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.020
[Music]

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.580
Whoop.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.900
Yep, and it's on fire.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.000
I lit a stick on fire
with molten salt.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.920
That's just cool.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.802
It's actually leaking
out over the side.

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:52.720
There is so much more to that
than I thought there was.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.100
Well, I was going to try
and take it out

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.300
and pour it into something.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.380
But with how much there is here,

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.700
and with the size
of that crucible,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.800
it's not really going to be safe
for me to try and lift

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.000
that up and transport it.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.900
So we're going to let
it sit there and cool down,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.400
see what it looks like ince
it's actually solidified again.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.758
Or we can actually get our tongs
around it safely, transport it,

00:08:09.758 --> 00:08:10.700
and dump it out.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.800
That's really cool.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.700
Like I know I don't want
to touch that,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.600
but I actually really
want to touch that.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:39.240
[Music]

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.340
So, we left this about

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:42.100
30 minutes to try
and let it harden.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.800
It hasn't really cool that much.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.600
It's still radiating
a ton of heat.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.300
And I'm not sure
if it's solid yet.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.800
So the surface
is no longer molten.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.120
Now, I don't trust

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.593
that to be the case
all the way through it,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.600
but we're still going
to try and get that out.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:18.380
[Music]

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.500
That is a giant crucible
just full of salt.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.960
And the surface
isn't pink anymore.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.278
We're definitely gonna have
to reheat this crucible to get

00:09:28.278 --> 00:09:29.600
the salt out at a later date,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.600
but it's going to stay
like that for now.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.671
So, can you erode
salt lamp away with water?

00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:35.600
Yes, you can.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600
Can you dissolve it?

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.858
Not as well,
but you can still do that, too.

00:09:38.858 --> 00:09:39.800
Can you melt it?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.500
Absolutely, and that was
actually a lot faster

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.282
than we were expecting it to be.

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:45.400
That's pretty cool.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.700
Well, I am kind of sad

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.949
that Veritasium proved
that you can't actually get

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:51.000
negative ions from heating
up a salt lamp,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.559
because I think I win
the award for most

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.200
heated up salt lamp ever.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.800
Guys, that's not all,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.257
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:09:58.257 --> 00:10:00.393
That box up at the top will take
you to our latest video,

00:10:00.393 --> 00:10:01.540
and that box of the bottom is

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.400
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.600
Don't forget to hit this bomb
so you subscribe to the club,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.700
and never miss out on the fun.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.848
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:07.848 --> 00:10:09.070
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:09.880
Talk to you then.
