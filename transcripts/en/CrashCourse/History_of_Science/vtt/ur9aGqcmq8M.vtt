00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.639
We’ve talked a 
lot about advances in biotech.

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.870
But none of those could have happened without
advances in computing.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.160
It’s time to get back to data and explore
the unlikely birth, strange life, and potential

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.869
futures of the Internet.

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.369
The theme of the history of computing is that
what we mean by “computing” keeps changing.

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.859
With the invention of the transistor in 1947,
the computer started to shrink!

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.140
And speed up!

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.200
And change meaning yet again, becoming a ubiquitous
dimension of contemporary life—not to mention

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.680
a totally normal thing to yell at.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.420
Hey Google... can you roll the intro?

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.380
[long pause]

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.360
Google: I'm not sure.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:52.120
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.920
In 1965, Electronics Magazine asked computer
scientist Gordon Moore to do something scientists

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.190
are generally taught not to do: predict the
future.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.290
Moore guessed that, roughly every year, the
number of electronic switches that people

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.259
could squeeze onto one computer chip would
double.

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.579
This meant computer chips would continue to
become faster, more powerful, and cheaper—at

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.929
an absolutely amazing rate.

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.630
Which might have sounded suspiciously awesome
to readers.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.460
But Moore’s prediction came true!

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.350
Although it took eighteen months for each
doubling, and, arguably, this was a self-fulfilling

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.609
prophecy, since engineers actively worked
towards it.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.770
Moore went on to serve as CEO as Intel and
is now worth billions.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.829
His prediction is called “Moore’s law.”

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.560
Think about what this means for manufacturers:
they keep competing to invent hot new machines

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.110
that make their old ones obsolete.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:50.289
The same applies to methods of data
Today, engineers face big questions about

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.990
the physical limit of Moore’s law.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.490
Even with new tricks here and there, just
how small and fast can conventional chips

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.490
get?

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.509
Currently, teams at different chip manufacturers
are working to create transistors at the nanometer

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.509
scale.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.170
IBM made a whole computer that’s only one
millimeter by one millimeter wide and is about

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.310
as fast as a computer from 1990.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.240
As computers became smaller and cheaper, they
moved from military bases to businesses in

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.500
the 1960s and to schools and homes by the
late 1970s and 1980s.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.480
And computers changed these spaces.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.090
People got used to using them for certain
tasks.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.640
But computers were pretty intimidating.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.800
Manufacturers had to make them work better
with people.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.430
So in 1970 the Xerox Corporation founded the
Palo Alto Research Center—known as Xerox

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.430
PARC.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.630
Here, researchers invented many features of
modern computing.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.570
In 1973, they came up with the Xerox Alto,
the first personal computer…

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.840
But Xerox didn’t think there was a market
for computers in the home yet.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.290
Other Xerox PARC inventions include laser
printing, the important networking standard

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.050
called Ethernet, and even the graphical user
interface or GUI—which included folders,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.050
icons, and windows.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.180
But Xerox didn’t capitalize on these inventions.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.000
You probably know who did.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.400
In the 1970s, two nerds who dropped out of
college started selling computers you were

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.480
meant to use at home, for fun and—you know,
to do… stuff, whatever you wanted.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.190
In retrospect, that was the genius of the
Apple Two, released in 1977.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.200
Along with decades of shrewd engineering and
business moves, fun made video game designer

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.550
and meditation enthusiast Steve Jobs and engineer
Steve Wozniak into mega-billionaires.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.290
They had a commitment to computing for play,
not always just work.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.420
And they weren’t alone.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.820
In 1981, IBM started marketing the PC powered
by the DOS operating system, which they licensed

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.670
from Microsoft—founded by Harvard dropout
Bill Gates in 1975.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.190
By 1989, Microsoft’s revenues reached one
billion dollars.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.180
You can find out more about college dropouts-turned-billionaires
elsewhere.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.150
For our purposes, note that some of the inventors
who influenced the future of computing were

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.040
traditional corporate engineers like Gordon
Moore.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.130
But increasingly, they were people like the
Steves who didn’t focus on discoveries in

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.840
computer science, but on design and marketing:
how to create new kinds of interactions with,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.590
and on, computers.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.030
Compare this to the birth of social media
in the early 2000s.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.300
So new social spaces emerged on computers.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.370
And connecting computers together allowed
for new communities to form—from Second

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.410
Life to 4chan.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.400
For that, we have to once again thank U.S.
military research.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.120
ThoughtBubble, plug us in.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.479
Back in the late 1950s, the U.S. was really
worried about Soviet technologies.

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.650
So in 1958, the Secretary of Defense authorized
a new initiative called the Defense Advanced

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.560
Research Projects Agency or DARPA.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.680
DARPA set about solving a glaring problem:
what happened if Soviet attacks cut U.S. telephone

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.680
lines?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.729
How could information be moved around quickly,
even after a nuclear strike?

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.169
A faster computer wouldn’t help if itt was
blown to bits.

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.500
What was needed was a network.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.009
So in part to defend against information loss
during a war—and in part to make researchers’

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.509
lives easier—DARPA funded the first true
network of computers, the Advanced Research

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.169
Projects Agency Nework, better known as ARPANET.

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.590
People give different dates for the birthday
of the Internet, but two stand out.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.360
On September 2nd, 1969, ARPANET went online.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.990
It used the then-new technology of packet
switching, or sending data in small, independent,

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.590
broken-up parts that can each find their own
fastest routes and be reassembled later.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.410
This is still the basis of our networks today!

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.190
At first, ARPANET only linked a few universities.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.379
But it grew as researchers found that linking
computers was useful for all sorts of reasons,

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:49.379
nukes aside!

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:55.389
And then, on January 1st, 1983, several computer
networks including ARPANET were joined together

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.860
using a standard way of requesting and sharing
information: TCP/IP.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.410
This remains the backbone of the Internet
today.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.610
Meanwhile, French engineers created their
own computer network, connected through through

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.919
telephone lines, Minitel, back in 1978—five
years before TCP/IP!

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.749
Minitel was retired in 2012.

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:18.870
And the Soviets developed their own versions
of ARPANET.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.830
But after 1991, these joined the TCP/IP-driven
Internet, and the virtual world became both

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.759
larger and smaller.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:32.080
The Internet in the 1980s was literally that:
a network interconnecting computers.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.000
It didn’t look like a new space yet.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.270
For that, we can thank British computer scientist
Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.460
Wide Web in 1990.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.819
Berners-Lee pulled together existing ideas,
like hypertext and the internet, and built

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:52.569
the first web browser to create the beginnings
of the functional and useful web we know today.

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.809
The Web had profound effects.

00:06:54.809 --> 00:07:00.229
It brought the Internet to millions of people—and
brought them into it, making them feel like

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:05.860
they had a home “online,” a virtual place
to represent themselves, meet strangers all

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.169
over the world, and troll educational video
shows!

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.120
The Web also democratized the tools of knowledge
making.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.719
From World War Two until 1990, building computers
and using them to do work was largely the

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:18.789
domain of elites.

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:23.939
A short time later, we can trade software
on GitHub, freely share 3D printing templates

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:27.360
on Thingiverse, and benefit from the collective
wisdom of Wikipedia.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.990
It’s as if the Internet now contains not
one but several Libraries of Alexandria.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.830
They’ve radically changed how we learn and
make knowledge.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.930
Just as scientific journals had once been
invented as printed objects, since 1990, they’ve

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.460
moved online—though often behind steep paywalls.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.370
In fact, Russian philosopher Vladimir Odoevsky predicted way back in

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:56.520
1837—in The Year 4338—that our houses
would be connected by “magnetic telegraphs.”

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.219
But this came true only one hundred and fifty
years later—not two millennia!

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:03.120
So what will happen in another hundred and
fifty years?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.020
Well, computing seems to be changing unpredictably.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.759
Not only because computers are still getting
faster, but because of at least three more

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:11.759
fundamental shifts.

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:15.949
One, scientists are experimenting with quantum
computers, which work in a different way than

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:17.980
“classical,” binary ones.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.960
This is called superposition, and it has the
potential to make the computers of the future

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:23.740
much faster than today’s.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.099
This could lead to major shifts in cryptography:
the current method of protecting our credit

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:32.640
cards works because classical computers aren’t
strong enough to factor very large numbers

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.640
quickly.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.519
But a quantum computer should be able to do
this kind of math easily.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:41.440
To date, however, quantum computers are not
yet finished technologies that engineers can

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.779
improve, but epistemic objects: things that
scientists are still working to understand.

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:49.190
So will quantum computing change everything?

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.130
Or mostly remain a weird footnote to classical
computing?

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.889
I don’t know… we’ll find out!

00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:59.490
Fundamental shift two: some researchers across
computing, history, and epistemology—the

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.300
branch of philosophy that asks, what counts
as knowledge?—wonder if really really large

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.750
amounts of data, called Big Data, will change
how we do science.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.100
One of the main jobs of being a scientist
has been to just collect data.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.519
But if Internet-enabled sensors of all kinds
are always transmitting back to databases,

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:23.260
then maybe the work of science will shift
away from data collection, and even away from

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.980
analysis—AI can crunch numbers—and into
asking questions about patterns that emerge

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.570
from data, seemingly on their own.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:36.420
So instead of saying, I wonder if X is true
about the natural or social world, and then

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.079
going out to observe or test, the scientist
of the future might wait for a computer to

00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:46.029
tell her, X seems true about the world, are
you interested in knowing more?

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:50.720
This vision for using Big Data has been called
“hypothesis-free science,” and it would

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.620
qualify as a new paradigm.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.220
But will it replace hypothesis-driven science?

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.420
Even if AI is mostly “weak,” meaning not
like a human brain—but only, say, a sensor

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.740
system that knows what temperature it is in
your house and how to adjust to the temp you

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.160
want—once it’s very common, it could challenge
long-held assumptions about what thought is.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.700
In fact, many people have already entrusted
cognitive responsibilities such as knowing

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.550
what time it is to AI scripts on computers
in their phones, watches, cars, and homes.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.550
Will human cognition feel different if we
keep giving AI more and more human stuff to

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.649
take care of?

00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:27.820
How will society change?

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.000
I don’t know… we’ll find out!!!

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.329
And these are only some of the anxieties of
our hyper-connected world!

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:38.730
We could do a whole episode on blockchain,
a list of time-stamped records which are linked

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.500
using cryptography and (theoretically) resistant
to fraud, and the new social technologies

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.970
it enables: like cryptocurrency, kinds of
money not backed by sovereign nations but

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.940
by groups of co-invested strangers on the
Internet.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.380
Will blockchain change money, and fundamentally,
trust in strangers?

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.079
Or is it just another shift in cryptography?

00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:58.079
A fad?

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.569
I don't know... we'll find out!

00:11:00.569 --> 00:11:05.130
Let’s head back to the physical world to
look at the cost of these developments.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.830
One feature they have in common is they require
ever greater amounts of electricity and rare-earth

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.830
metals.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.810
And older computers become e-waste, toxic
trash recycled by some impoverished persons

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.990
at cost to their own bodies.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.330
Even as computers become so small they’re
invisible, so common they feel like part of

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.089
our own brains, and so fast that they may
fundamentally change critical social structures

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:31.389
like banking and buying animal hoodies on
Etsy… they also contribute to dangerous

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:34.579
shifts of natural resources.

00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:38.920
Next time—we’ll wrap up our story of the
life sciences by asking questions about the

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.750
future of medicine and the human brain that
remain unanswered as of early 2019.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.760
History isn’t finished!

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.310
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula,

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.110
MT and it's made with the help of all these
nice people.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.940
And our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.820
Crash Course is a Complexly Production.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.060
