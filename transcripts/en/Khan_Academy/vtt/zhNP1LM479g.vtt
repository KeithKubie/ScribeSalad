00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:02.189
- [Voiceover] Find the total distance

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:03.895
traveled by the particle from

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:05.826
time t equals zero to

00:00:05.826 --> 00:00:08.548
t equals one.

00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:10.987
Always remember they didn't say
find the total displacement,

00:00:10.987 --> 00:00:13.201
they said find the total distance

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.395
traveled by the particle.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:18.788
So if something goes to the right by one,

00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:21.328
and then goes up by one,

00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:23.644
their distance is two.

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:25.635
And actually, and then if they go back,

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.656
if they go back, over here,

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:30.288
just let me draw a straighter line,

00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:32.056
they then go back to

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:33.579
the original starting point.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.079
And then this distance
right here would be what?

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.187
The square root of,
the square root of two,

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:41.138
the displacement would be zero.

00:00:41.138 --> 00:00:42.661
They got back to where they started.

00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:44.978
For the distance would be one plus one

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.416
plus the square root of two.

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.265
So how do we figure out the total distance

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.417
in this scenario right over here?

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.653
Let me erase this since it's
not relevant to the problem,

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:55.116
it's just a, for remind ourselves

00:00:55.116 --> 00:00:56.782
we're talking about distance.

00:00:56.782 --> 00:00:59.058
Well distance is equal to rate times time.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.374
Or it's equal to speed times time.

00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:03.141
So in a very small amount of time,

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:04.747
if you want to figure out the distance,

00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:07.652
well, you could take your speed,

00:01:07.652 --> 00:01:11.573
which is the magnus magnitude
of your velocity function.

00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:13.564
If you took your speed,

00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:15.941
that's your speed right over there,

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:19.110
and if you multiply it by a
little small change in time,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.066
that's gonna give you

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.828
your infinitesimally
small change in distance

00:01:23.828 --> 00:01:26.527
over that infinitesimally
small change in time.

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:27.746
And if you wanted to change your,

00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:29.963
if you wanted to find the total distance

00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:33.211
over a non-infinitesimal change in time,

00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.999
well, then you could integrate.

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.072
And you can integrate those
little changes in time

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:41.196
in this case from t equals
zero to t equals one.

00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:44.711
This is going to be the
expression for the total distance.

00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:46.357
Well what is this going to be?

00:01:46.357 --> 00:01:47.941
Well this is going to
be equal to the interval

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.628
from zero to one.

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:50.664
In the last part of the problem,

00:01:50.664 --> 00:01:54.117
we already have an
expression for our speed.

00:01:54.117 --> 00:01:58.137
Our speed we saw was this
business right over here.

00:01:58.137 --> 00:02:01.922
So it's going to be
equal to the square root,

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.647
give myself a little bit more

00:02:03.647 --> 00:02:05.679
space to work with, is
going to be equal to

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.559
the square root of the
x-component of the velocity,

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.828
cosign of t squared squared,

00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:17.117
let me put the little
outer parenthesis there,

00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:21.404
squared, plus the y-component
of our velocity squared,

00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:24.452
the rate of change of y with
respect to time squared.

00:02:24.452 --> 00:02:29.002
So plus e to the 0.5 t,

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:30.052
that's the rate of change of y

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:33.148
with respect to time, or
the y-component of velocity,

00:02:33.148 --> 00:02:34.407
we're gonna square that.

00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:38.207
This is our expression for our
speed as a function of time.

00:02:38.207 --> 00:02:40.523
And then you multiply that times dt

00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:41.580
and we're gonna integrate all this

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.611
and this is gonna give us our total,

00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:45.887
this is gonna give us our total distance.

00:02:45.887 --> 00:02:48.020
And lucky for us we can use our calculator

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.023
in this part of the AP exam,
so let's evaluate this.

00:02:52.023 --> 00:02:56.005
So let me turn it on.

00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:57.462
Let me clear out.

00:02:57.462 --> 00:02:59.840
And so we're just going to evaluate,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.526
let's go to math,

00:03:01.526 --> 00:03:04.615
and function integral right over there,

00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:06.775
that's for evaluating definite integrals,

00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:10.596
and we want to evaluate the square root,

00:03:10.596 --> 00:03:12.904
an open parenthesis,

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:15.240
of, I think I'm gonna have
a lot of parenthesis here,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.643
but we'll see if we can do it.

00:03:16.643 --> 00:03:20.096
So the square root of, cosign of,

00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:22.127
and I'm gonna us x as
my variable integration

00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:24.465
cosign of x squared,

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:27.452
so that's that parenthesis,
I need another parenthesis,

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:30.966
squared, squared,

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:34.197
plus e to this business squared.

00:03:34.197 --> 00:03:35.802
Well this we already solved before.

00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:39.662
This is the same thing
as e to the t, right?

00:03:39.662 --> 00:03:41.821
If we raise something to the 0.5 t,

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.156
and then we raise that to the second power

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.859
two times 0.5 t is just t.

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.761
So I can do that if I like.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.186
I could just type in all of
this business if you like.

00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:53.538
So plus second e to the,

00:03:53.538 --> 00:03:56.323
my variable of integration here is x,

00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:58.840
e to the x,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.180
so close that, and then I close

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.815
my square root.

00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:05.891
Did I do that right?

00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.518
This closes around the x squared,

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:10.870
that closes with that,
yep ok that looks right.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.369
And then my variable of integration is x,

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:17.960
and I'm integrating from zero to one.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.577
And now let's let the calculator
munch on it a little bit.

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:25.965
And I get approximately 1.595.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:28.356
So this is approximately

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:32.206
1.595, the total distance

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:33.341
traveled by the particle

00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:35.271
in time equals zero to t equals one

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:37.039
which is kind of neat that
we can do these things,

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.722
just from, you know, the
information that they gave us

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:43.154
at the beginning of the problem.
