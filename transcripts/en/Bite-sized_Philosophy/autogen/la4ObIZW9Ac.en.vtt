there's a whole set of expectations that
 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.100
there's a whole set of expectations that
are governing what we're doing like you

are governing what we're doing like you
 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.110
are governing what we're doing like you
don't want me to take your your little

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120
don't want me to take your your little
 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.820
don't want me to take your your little
tablet there and smash it that would be

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830
tablet there and smash it that would be
 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.770
tablet there and smash it that would be
shocking right you wouldn't know what

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780
shocking right you wouldn't know what
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.140
shocking right you wouldn't know what
the hell to do right you'd be somewhere

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
the hell to do right you'd be somewhere
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.110
the hell to do right you'd be somewhere
different if I did that and you wouldn't

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
different if I did that and you wouldn't
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.230
different if I did that and you wouldn't
know where you were and that's another

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
know where you were and that's another
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.960
know where you were and that's another
thing to know because that's a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
thing to know because that's a
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.730
thing to know because that's a
fundamental difference there's a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
fundamental difference there's a
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.980
fundamental difference there's a
fundamental difference between knowing

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
fundamental difference between knowing
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.160
fundamental difference between knowing
where you are and not knowing where you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
where you are and not knowing where you
 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.279
where you are and not knowing where you
are I think it's in some sense the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
are I think it's in some sense the
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.720
are I think it's in some sense the
fundamental difference you can think

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
fundamental difference you can think
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.040
fundamental difference you can think
about it as the distinction between

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
about it as the distinction between
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.799
about it as the distinction between
explored and unexplored territory but

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
explored and unexplored territory but
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:45.110
explored and unexplored territory but
you have to I don't know if you've ever

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
you have to I don't know if you've ever
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.540
you have to I don't know if you've ever
taken a cat to a new house cats hate

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
taken a cat to a new house cats hate
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.869
taken a cat to a new house cats hate
that and because in their old house and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
that and because in their old house and
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.660
that and because in their old house and
maybe in their old neighborhood they've

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670
maybe in their old neighborhood they've
 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.869
maybe in their old neighborhood they've
slunk around you know at the edges check

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
slunk around you know at the edges check
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.270
slunk around you know at the edges check
and eye everything out they start out

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
and eye everything out they start out
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.459
and eye everything out they start out
fray afraid they check everything out

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
fray afraid they check everything out
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.020
fray afraid they check everything out
they know where to hide they know where

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
they know where to hide they know where
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.640
they know where to hide they know where
to they do what they do they know what

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
to they do what they do they know what
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.080
to they do what they do they know what
what's safe and they know that because

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
what's safe and they know that because
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.210
what's safe and they know that because
they go somewhere and nothing happens

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
they go somewhere and nothing happens
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.620
they go somewhere and nothing happens
and so then they assume that it's safe

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
and so then they assume that it's safe
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.190
and so then they assume that it's safe
and they slowly build up a neighborhood

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
and they slowly build up a neighborhood
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.380
and they slowly build up a neighborhood
that they're comfortable with my dad

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
that they're comfortable with my dad
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.179
that they're comfortable with my dad
used to take the dog for a walk and then

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
used to take the dog for a walk and then
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.859
used to take the dog for a walk and then
the cat got lonesome and so it started

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
the cat got lonesome and so it started
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630
the cat got lonesome and so it started
to follow him and first of all it would

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
to follow him and first of all it would
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.550
to follow him and first of all it would
just go along the building's the houses

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
just go along the building's the houses
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.460
just go along the building's the houses
on their route you know hiding really

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
on their route you know hiding really
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.819
on their route you know hiding really
from predators and after a while I got

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
from predators and after a while I got
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.170
from predators and after a while I got
kind of comfortable with that and then

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
kind of comfortable with that and then
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539
kind of comfortable with that and then
it would follow right behind the dog but

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
it would follow right behind the dog but
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.859
it would follow right behind the dog but
it had a border and if my dad took the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
it had a border and if my dad took the
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.830
it had a border and if my dad took the
dog over one Street too many for the cat

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
dog over one Street too many for the cat
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.340
dog over one Street too many for the cat
the cat would just sit on the corner and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350
the cat would just sit on the corner and
 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.770
the cat would just sit on the corner and
you know cry like a cat cries it was

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
you know cry like a cat cries it was
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.590
you know cry like a cat cries it was
like that's it for me man I'm not going

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
like that's it for me man I'm not going
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.780
like that's it for me man I'm not going
any farther out into the unknown

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
any farther out into the unknown
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.160
any farther out into the unknown
and so the distinction between the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
and so the distinction between the
 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.359
and so the distinction between the
territory that you have mastered and the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
territory that you have mastered and the
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.190
territory that you have mastered and the
territory that you haven't mastered is a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
territory that you haven't mastered is a
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.389
territory that you haven't mastered is a
fundamental distinction

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
fundamental distinction
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.660
fundamental distinction
it's the distinction between Holmen and

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670
it's the distinction between Holmen and
 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.050
it's the distinction between Holmen and
the strange land and the thing about

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
the strange land and the thing about
 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.760
the strange land and the thing about
familiar territory for people is that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
familiar territory for people is that
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.710
familiar territory for people is that
most of the familiar territory that we

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
most of the familiar territory that we
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.670
most of the familiar territory that we
inhabit is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
inhabit is
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.759
inhabit is
other people because we're so social she

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769
other people because we're so social she
 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.619
other people because we're so social she
can't really think it's a weird way of

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629
can't really think it's a weird way of
 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.910
can't really think it's a weird way of
thinking about territory it's not

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
thinking about territory it's not
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.119
thinking about territory it's not
exactly geographical objective territory

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129
exactly geographical objective territory
 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.940
exactly geographical objective territory
its territory with a dominance hierarchy

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
its territory with a dominance hierarchy
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.670
its territory with a dominance hierarchy
in it and the dominant hierarchy has a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
in it and the dominant hierarchy has a
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.259
in it and the dominant hierarchy has a
predictable structure and you know where

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269
predictable structure and you know where
 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.539
predictable structure and you know where
you fit in it most of the time and so

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549
you fit in it most of the time and so
 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.160
you fit in it most of the time and so
that when you act out in that territory

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170
that when you act out in that territory
 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.920
that when you act out in that territory
surrounded by your people then often you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930
surrounded by your people then often you
 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.380
surrounded by your people then often you
get what you want and you're so thrilled

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
get what you want and you're so thrilled
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.929
get what you want and you're so thrilled
about that because you just don't want

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939
about that because you just don't want
 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.970
about that because you just don't want
someone acting erratically around you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
someone acting erratically around you
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.490
someone acting erratically around you
like and you know that so you walk down

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
like and you know that so you walk down
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.940
like and you know that so you walk down
Bloor and there's people there that

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950
Bloor and there's people there that
 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.740
Bloor and there's people there that
should really be institutionalized but

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
should really be institutionalized but
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.780
should really be institutionalized but
we D institutionalize them all so they

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790
we D institutionalize them all so they
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.210
we D institutionalize them all so they
could be free and free to be you know

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220
could be free and free to be you know
 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.770
could be free and free to be you know
suffering and malfunctioning out on the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780
suffering and malfunctioning out on the
 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.330
suffering and malfunctioning out on the
street that's what the freedom ended up

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
street that's what the freedom ended up
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.339
street that's what the freedom ended up
being but you know you'll walk by

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349
being but you know you'll walk by
 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.030

someone like that who's muttering away

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040
someone like that who's muttering away
 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.309
someone like that who's muttering away
to the voices in his head and you know

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319
to the voices in his head and you know
 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.839
to the voices in his head and you know
maybe striking out against whatever it

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849
maybe striking out against whatever it
 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.990
maybe striking out against whatever it
is that's plaguing him and you will make

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000
is that's plaguing him and you will make
 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.439
is that's plaguing him and you will make
eye contact you might even go across the

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449
eye contact you might even go across the
 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:22.670
eye contact you might even go across the
street you're certainly going to give

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680
street you're certainly going to give
 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.559
street you're certainly going to give
him a wide berth you're going to keep a

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569
him a wide berth you're going to keep a
 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.129
him a wide berth you're going to keep a
distance between him and you and you're

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139
distance between him and you and you're
 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.199
distance between him and you and you're
going to hope that you don't attract his

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209
going to hope that you don't attract his
 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.449
going to hope that you don't attract his
attention because he's not in the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459
attention because he's not in the
 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.430
attention because he's not in the
dominant hierarchy and you don't know

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440
dominant hierarchy and you don't know
 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.159
dominant hierarchy and you don't know
what the hell he might do and that's

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169
what the hell he might do and that's
 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.770
what the hell he might do and that's
unexplored territory too that's another

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780
unexplored territory too that's another
 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.339
unexplored territory too that's another
way of thinking about it like we inhabit

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349
way of thinking about it like we inhabit
 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.189
way of thinking about it like we inhabit
time and space not just space and not

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199
time and space not just space and not
 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.469
time and space not just space and not
just time we inhabit time and space and

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479
just time we inhabit time and space and
 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.960
