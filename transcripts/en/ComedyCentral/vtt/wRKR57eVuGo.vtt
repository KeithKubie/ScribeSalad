- Hi, I'm Patti Harrison.

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:03.402 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Huge bitch, and
I'm Joel Kim Booster.

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:04.303 line:0%
(bleeps)

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:05.805
- And you're watching Unsend,

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.773
where we celebrate the best
and the worst of the web,

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:09.008
but mostly the worst.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.246
(upbeat electronic
industrial music)

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:20.320
(audience cheers)

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.788
(paper crunches)

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Listen, it's time to
tackle a hard-hitting issue

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:24.657
that rubs each and every
one of us the wrong way.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.258
I'm not talking about ISIS,

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:27.660
I'm talking about Instagram ads.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.462
- Ugh, the worst!

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.864
Yay, ISIS.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.698
(dramatic music)

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.999
(glass breaking)

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.167
- Look, we're going
to Instagram to gawk

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:36.435
at shapely male bodies,

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.637
and to find out what
our ex, Alex is doing.

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:40.005
Did he book that Broadway show?

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.141
I'm dying to know,
he will update me.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.477
- Right, but these
ads are coming at us

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.945
every other scroll down,

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.348
and it's pissing my
ass off, you bitch!

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:50.850
- Language.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.519
If you're gonna invade our
feed, at least be better

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.953
than this yotpo ad.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.889
Look at this disaster, ugh!

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.658
(both exclaiming in disgust)

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:01.227
- This fellow looks like he
tried to pledge a fraternity

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.029
but lost his way
during Hell Week.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.497
- Ugh.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.233 align:start position:0%
- I'm sorry, yotpo, but I'm
reading and re-reading this ad,

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.870
and I still don't know-po
what it is you're selling.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.338
- Hmm, good.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.206
Yeah, before you boast
about your 5,000 reviews,

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:16.742
maybe let us in on who you are.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.478
- We don't know Jake Kassan,

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:22.548 align:start size:97% position:3%
We don't know MVMT Watches,
and we don't know you.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.384
- Now let's move on to
the most nefarious evil

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.984
in this rat king of evil:

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:27.987
attractive females peddling tea.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.222
Let's examine FitTea in ads.

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:32.158 align:start size:84% position:16%
- (raspy voice)
Baby, I love butts!

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:33.392
- Uh-uh.

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:34.661
- (raspy voice) This one
really takes the cake,

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.263
pun intended, like an ass.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.499
An ass made of cake.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.434 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's no better sales
person than a big booty Judy.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.670
These girls let their
asses do the talking

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.172
and spoiler alert:

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.075 align:start size:97% position:3%
(raspy voice) I'm listening
with my little pud out.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.277
(laughs)

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.112 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I had an eating
disorder for six years.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.547
(paper crunching)
(air whistling)

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:57.750 align:start position:0%
- We're here with the
effortlessly cool Jimmy O. Yang.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.618 line:0%
You can find him on all
his social media handles

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:02.255 line:0%
@FunnyAsianDude, and he
is a funny Asian dude,

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.256 line:0%
but was he always
a funny Asian dude?

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.457
I guess we're about to find out

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:07.927 align:start size:84% position:16%
when we dive into your
old Instagram posts

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.596 align:start size:84% position:16%
in a little segment
we like to call

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.931 align:start size:81% position:19%
Defend or Delete.
(horn blares)

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.866 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Patti] We have
this first post here.

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:17.103
- "Got my sag card in the
mail today, now waiting

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.638
"for my v card to arrive."

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:21.874
- "Hashtag acting, hashtag sag."

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:23.376
- Wow.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.445
- Yo, okay, the post, I got
no problem with the post,

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.147
but the hashtag is sad as ****.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.616
- I feel that.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.584 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Like, this is, I hate
people when they do #setlife,

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.152
#acting is so whack.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:36.155 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You think a lot of people
are searching #acting,

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:36.989 align:start size:97% position:3%
just perusing?
- Yeah, when they're looking

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.157
for actors.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.392 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well, no, casting
directors, do.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.793 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah, that's
what they told me.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:44.997 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Um, I saw, this is crazy,
I saw Steven Spielberg

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:47.733
on a laptop at a coffee
shop, and I like kind of

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:48.968 align:start size:84% position:16%
creeped behind him,
and I was like:

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.469
Whoa, what's he looking at?

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.138 align:start size:97% position:3%
He was on Twitter and
Instagram at the same time,

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:57.277 align:start size:88% position:13%
just looking at
#actor, #setlife, #sag,

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.245
and was casting.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.246
- That's how he found me.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.481
- From these hashtags.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.315
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.750
- Please don't, no.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.650 align:start size:97% position:3%
- See go like this.
- I don't wanna be involved.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.852
- I wanna do a #setlife, guys.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.521
(Joel sighs)

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:09.822
(camera clicks)

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.324
- Huh, see, that's, I
missed that, hang on.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:15.261 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I just have to get my
genitals out for it get likes.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.864
(Patti grunts)

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:18.697
(camera clicks)

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.166
- Good, see?

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.100 align:start size:94% position:6%
You're gonna, we're gonna
get so many followers

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.334
from the #setlife.

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:26.005
- Next, "I just joined
the #Darkside" (laughs).

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:27.941
- Wow.

00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:30.342
Wait, this is on my Instagram?

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:31.511
- Um, yeah, that's you.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.178 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, ****.
- Oh my god, Jimmy!

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:37.116
You really threw down and
you bought an iPad, whoa!

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:42.121 align:start size:97% position:3%
- On February 5th, 2013,
Jimmy O. Yang bought an iPad.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.490
- Ooh, it's dark!
- You gotta (sighs)

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.725
- Oh, oh my god!

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You gotta understand
how poor I was

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.530 align:start size:81% position:19%
when it was 2013.
- Oh!

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.732
- And this was like a
milestone in my life.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.366
- Ooh, you know what,
some people are good,

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:56.535
and some people are bad
to the ******* bone,

00:03:56.535 --> 00:04:00.506
and they don't have keyboards.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:01.874
- 2013.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.211
You got an iPad.

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.545
You joined SAG.

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:08.381
- Whoa, that was a big
year for you, Jimmy.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.548 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That was a good
year for you, Jimmy.

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:12.418 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It was, it was, it
was, it was a good year.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.320 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you gonna
defend or delete this?

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.754
- I feel like it's so bad,

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.223
and now people will
see it on the show,

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:19.091 align:start size:88% position:13%
I don't know if anybody
watches the show,

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.394 align:start size:81% position:19%
but if they do see
it on the show,

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.996
then I'm gonna look like an
idiot deleting this like:

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:26.866 align:start position:0%
Oh, I'm ashamed of it, so I
might as well just live with it,

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.200 align:start size:88% position:13%
and like be proud of it.
- Yeah.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.669
(bell dings)

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:30.903 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You guys at home, I
want you to find this post

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:34.072 align:start size:84% position:16%
on Instagram, and like
it, and tell Jimmy

00:04:34.072 --> 00:04:37.509
you're with him on the
dark side, honey, okay.

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.745 align:start size:94% position:6%
Thank you so much, Jimmy,
for coming in today.

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:42.748
This was so much fun, we've
learned a lot about you,

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:46.252
and your stupid little brain.

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:48.587
- I really thought there were
some good photos in there,

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:50.122
and I think you're
a really cool guy,

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:52.091
and I think there's
a lot of cool things

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.892 align:start size:84% position:16%
that you are gonna
show us in the future.

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.129
- I can't wait to see
what you do, you idiot.

00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:01.267
(happy upbeat music)

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:05.738 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I love each and every
one of you so much.

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:09.041
I know that this time is
a hard time to live in.

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:09.875 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I wanna feel what
your insides feel like.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:12.444
- But just keep going.

00:05:12.444 --> 00:05:14.914
Wake up every day, say:
I'm gonna do something

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:17.450
that makes me happy, even
if it's one little act

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.118 align:start size:97% position:3%
of kindness to yourself.
- I'm just gonna get in there

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.552 align:start size:84% position:16%
Do that for me.
- and feel your guts.

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:21.787 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you do that
- I'm gonna feel all around

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:23.055
for anyone else,
- inside your guts

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:24.456 align:start size:97% position:3%
do it for me.
- and your body and I'm gonna

00:05:24.456 --> 00:05:25.924 align:start size:97% position:3%
I grew up a Christian,
- I'm gonna be like a parasite

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:27.126 align:start size:97% position:3%
and even though I don't
- growing deeper and deeper

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.294
necessarily identify
- and bigger and bigger

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.795 align:start size:88% position:13%
as a Christian any more,
- inside your body

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.463
I think that spirituality
- and that's... (laughs)

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:33.465
is important and I
hope you do, too.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:34.834
Thanks for watching Unsend.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:36.969
Joel, don't come in that.

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.139
(heavy hip-hop music)
