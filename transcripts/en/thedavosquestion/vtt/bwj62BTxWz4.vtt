YURI LANE &gt;&gt; Hello. My name is dwat-dwer-Yuri
Lane-bbbd-bbbt-tssp-sshk-tssp-sshk-dowwa Human

00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:14.579
Beatbox. And-uh-uh-the question that's been
going around is how would I make a world a

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:21.269
better place. Dwoh! Well, number one, every
human being should have access to drinking

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.730
water-bwoop!
They should be able to grow their own food

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.140
and freedom of movement. We are-we take for
granted that we can go anywhere. I'm an American

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.030
citizen--I know, I know. I can go pretty much
anywhere. So I think that if you have the

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.629
opportunity to travel and to see other people
and to experience how other human beings live

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.329
in other parts of the world, I think that
can bring people together.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.590
But me being an artist, I think everyone should
be able to put something out there through

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.560
art. SO my art is pfft-ppp beatbox. And every
character has their own soundtrack. So maybe-ah-Bill

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:14.200
Gates has a song in his head. So he should
get that song and bring it out with the ppsss-ppssh-pppt

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.880
the beatbox.
So if we can exist and learn about each other

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.329
through sound. Because everyone has a sound
they can make. So maybe we don't have to speak

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:32.229
a language. We'll speak a language that is
just: bzzzt-ppmph-p-p-mmm-p-p-mmm-p-p-mmm

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.509
music because music is universal and everyone
understands that language. So that is my take

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.210
to make a world psst-pssh-pp a better place.
Pkeooww...
