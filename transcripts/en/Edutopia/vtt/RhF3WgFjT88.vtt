00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:08.896
&gt;&gt;Student: I want the book.

00:00:08.896 --> 00:00:10.036
&gt;&gt;Student: No, it's mine.

00:00:10.036 --> 00:00:11.296
&gt;&gt;Student: No, it's mine.

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this second grade
classroom, a tussle over a book,

00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:16.286
becomes a teachable moment.

00:00:16.286 --> 00:00:17.966
&gt;&gt;Emma: Okay, we're
having a problem here.

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.616
Would you like the
teacher to help you,

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:21.186
or would you like to
go to the peace corner?

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:21.746
&gt;&gt;Student: Peace corner.

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:25.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With older students
teaching younger ones a lesson

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.766
in conflict resolution.

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:30.356
&gt;&gt;Alexus: Let's say, if me
and Gabriella had a problem,

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.666
then we're going to go
inside the peace corner

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.656
and express our feelings,
with a peace helper.

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:40.806
And I think everybody knows
what a peace helper is.

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:43.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Learning to be
a peace helper is just part

00:00:43.556 --> 00:00:47.766
of the unique curriculum at
PS 24, a K through five school

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:51.536
in an underserved neighborhood in
Brooklyn, which has been transformed

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:55.316
by building a culture of
social and emotional wellbeing.

00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:57.066
&gt;&gt;Sherley: I grew up
in the neighborhood,

00:00:57.136 --> 00:00:59.376
and I know that the
issues that, you know,

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.776
the children are dealing
with are real issues.

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:03.696
How can you learn when
you're thinking

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:06.806
about the problems
you're having elsewhere?

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.346
How can you learn when you're
feeling horrible about yourself,

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:12.626
how can you learn when you think
you don't have any friends,

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:13.966
or no one cares for you.

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:18.626
I mean, we have to address all these
issues before they can even care

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:19.546
about anything else.

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:22.156
These are like, basic needs.

00:01:22.196 --> 00:01:27.336
&gt;&gt;So I want you to stand up if you
ever said something that wasn't nice

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:29.556
to someone, that hurt
their feelings, made--

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.536
&gt;&gt;Christina: Our school was
called a Failing School,

00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:32.966
according to, No Child Left Behind.

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:35.856
What we decided was that
the way to address it is not

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:41.746
to kill the children by drilling
them on, you know, very flat kind

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:45.286
of learning, you know, skill
and drill, but to really look

00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:48.876
at the whole child and give
them what you would find in,

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:50.106
say, a private school.

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:53.386
And part of that is, certainly,
social emotional learning.

00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:54.496
&gt;&gt;Sherley: Listen carefully.

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:59.726
I want you to stand up if
someone ever put you down.

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:00.816
If someone--

00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:03.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Social emotional
learning happens everywhere

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:05.726
at PS 24, throughout the day.

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:10.256
The Reading, Writing, Respect and
Resolution Curriculum features books

00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:11.906
with character building lessons.

00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:15.426
Conflict mediators, trained

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:18.146
in the Resolving Conflict
Creatively Program,

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:22.276
help their peers resolve disputes
on and off the playground.

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:25.206
&gt;&gt;Student: Do you guys need
help solving this problem?

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:26.326
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:27.786 --> 00:02:31.896
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, what could
you have done differently?

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:33.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Say sorry?

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:36.836
&gt;&gt;Student: You're saying that, what
could you have done differently,

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:38.346
you could have say sorry to him?

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:39.576
Okay.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.836
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What is
going on with us today?

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:46.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Once a week, during lunch
period, a small group of boys gathers

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:49.836
to express their concerns
in discussion and art work.

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.486
&gt;&gt;Student: In the club, you
can, like, just draw a picture,

00:02:52.486 --> 00:02:55.656
or write about what happened
during, in the problem.

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:58.436
Is a lot more easier just to--

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:02.126
you draw a picture of something
that happened, than having to--

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:03.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: To talk about.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:06.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Right, because
sometimes people are very nervous.

00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:09.906
&gt;&gt;Student: I don't like when
people make fun of me, like,

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:14.676
call me four eyes, and stuff,
because I wear glasses.

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:18.036
I start getting mad, and
then I can't control myself.

00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:21.076
So now my friends are
helping me more to not fight.

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.636
They just tell me to go calm down.

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.726
I'll calm down, and
sometimes I told the teacher.

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:26.956
&gt;&gt;Emma: Okay, what would
solve it for you, Julian?

00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:29.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Twice a
week, Emma Gonzalez,

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:32.866
of the nonprofit Morningside Center
for Teaching Social Responsibility,

00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:38.426
comes to PS 24 to train teachers
and students in conflict resolution.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.736
&gt;&gt;Emma: I really wanted
a leadership model.

00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:43.256
I really wanted kids
teaching other kids.

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:44.986
Kids listen to each other.

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:48.576
&gt;&gt;Student: So you had a book first,
and a girl snatched it from you?

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:48.886
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:49.706 --> 00:03:51.166
&gt;&gt;Student: How do you feel?

00:03:51.426 --> 00:03:52.156
&gt;&gt;Student: I feel mad.

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.196
&gt;&gt;Emma: Young people really
begin to think critically

00:03:55.196 --> 00:03:58.836
about their own actions,
and begin to have a place

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.556
where they can talk
about feeling bad.

00:04:01.296 --> 00:04:03.646
If there was a fight at
home, if there was a problem,

00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:06.836
they didn't have enough to eat,
where they could really, you know,

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:10.476
feel free in a safe environment,
to express what they were feeling.

00:04:10.976 --> 00:04:12.156
&gt;&gt;Student: Do you need my help?

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:12.856
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:04:13.396 --> 00:04:14.026
&gt;&gt;Student: What happened?

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:17.416
&gt;&gt;Emma: And it's very easy
to train kids to be helpers.

00:04:17.416 --> 00:04:18.726
It's very easy.

00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:21.796
&gt;&gt;Okay, so do you want to ask what
they're doing, what did they want?

00:04:22.726 --> 00:04:25.366
&gt;&gt;Alexus: I like doing it,
because I like helping other kids,

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.006
and it's very fun for me,
because I get to have fun,

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:31.906
and then be serious at the same time.

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:35.546
&gt;&gt;When the peace helpers were
helping solve the conflict,

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:37.866
what did you see the
peace helpers do?

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:43.986
&gt;&gt;When I do stuff like the mini
lesson, I have to stay focused

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:48.626
and especially when I'm working like,
first graders or kindergarteners--

00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:51.546
&gt;&gt;So anybody else want to try?

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:56.426
&gt;&gt;I'm still learning, because if
I go into sixth grade next year,

00:04:56.716 --> 00:04:58.836
I need to learn how
to control my anger,

00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:02.376
because I have a serious
temper problem.

00:05:02.976 --> 00:05:07.376
&gt;&gt;Sherley: I want you to think
about what makes you really angry.

00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:08.156
Angry, that--

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:09.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One period each week,

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:13.806
Sherley Guerrero's fourth graders
practice conflict resolution skills.

00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:14.586
&gt;&gt;Sherley: Okay, stop.

00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:16.686
Shamara punched him.

00:05:16.686 --> 00:05:18.866
So was she being strong,
mean or giving in?

00:05:18.866 --> 00:05:20.796
All: Mean.

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:21.426
&gt;&gt;Student: Giving in.

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:23.946
&gt;&gt;Sherley: But I thought it
was interesting that Shamara

00:05:23.946 --> 00:05:27.456
and Gabriella actually
looked at their choices,

00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:29.436
but they chose to be mean.

00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:34.556
&gt;&gt;My class did a lot of this
work last year, and by the end

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:39.206
of the year, they were so confident,
it was great, it was just amazing,

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:41.876
the work they were producing, the
way they presented themselves,

00:05:41.926 --> 00:05:43.136
the way they spoke to others.

00:05:43.136 --> 00:05:45.316
&gt;&gt;Does that happen in the real world?

00:05:45.346 --> 00:05:47.526
So let's turn and talk
to your partner.

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:50.456
What can happen because
she chose to be mean?

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:54.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Principal
Fuentes, PS 24's modest investment

00:05:54.526 --> 00:05:57.556
in the programs has
paid big dividends.

00:05:58.076 --> 00:05:59.526
&gt;&gt;Christina: It's actually
not that expensive,

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.486
it's a minimal investment
of resources.

00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:04.936
It's really more the will to
do it, and the time to spend

00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:06.996
with the professional
development and thinking

00:06:06.996 --> 00:06:09.316
about how this really
just gets infused

00:06:09.316 --> 00:06:10.776
into what you're doing normally.

00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:13.666
&gt;&gt;Sherley: Okay, so we're going
to put our arms around each other.

00:06:13.976 --> 00:06:15.906
&gt;&gt;Christina: We have
definitely moved.

00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:17.816
We were considered a failing school,

00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:20.276
and now we have met our
adequate yearly progress.

00:06:20.406 --> 00:06:22.016
&gt;&gt;Sherley: Together we stand.

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:24.096
&gt;&gt;All: Together we stand.

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:25.796
&gt;&gt;Christina: So I think
that all those kinds

00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:28.436
of very objective measures
are showing

00:06:28.436 --> 00:06:31.000
that what we are doing is working.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.000
&gt;&gt;Sherley: Strong, together.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.976
&gt;&gt;All: Together.

00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:36.036
