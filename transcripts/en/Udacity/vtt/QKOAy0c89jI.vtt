00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.490
Yeah, so
one thing that'll be really helpful for

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.140
this project is using the developer
tools provided to you by Chrome.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.360
In our particular,
the JavaScript console be really,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.980
really useful in giving
you information on

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.660
what still isn't being defined or
what you still need to call.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.020
And make sure you make use
of the console.log function.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.120
So I've noted things on my local host,
I've, there you go,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.520
see I have two errors already.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.460
I enter these as not defined and
then you know player is not defined.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.820
So basically I have this error here.

00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:41.050
I'm like okay, well where,
how do i go and look into this error?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.510
Well, Google Tools has some
awesome tool sets for you and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.680
you can just like really expand
the error, it's going to tell you.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.240
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.230
&gt;&gt; In your stack.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.760
So basically I am going in.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.890
&gt;&gt; First thing is, on the right side,
it tells you the finding.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.960
&gt;&gt; The founding or the line numbers?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.530
&gt;&gt; Line number.
&gt;&gt; Line numbers, yes, exactly.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.480
&gt;&gt; And essentially you can go to that
line number, go to the first error.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.690
Also the files come with lots of
comments that explain what you

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.520
need to do.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.490
&gt;&gt; What your code should look like.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.080
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.870
&gt;&gt; And that's a good start,
give it a try.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.070
I really recommend, I mean personally,
I don't like to go look for

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.210
an answer before I try it.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, try it.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.259
Just be like a detective or
be there's a picture, like you could

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.821
be a detective or could be a dare devil,
like you're the coding dare devil,

00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:42.910
you just dive straight in,
try to break things up.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.690
&gt;&gt; Be at three year old
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.840
&gt;&gt; Yes tha's what they do.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you have a three year old.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.338
Right?

00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:48.130
Six.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.470
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; So I mean,

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.520
yeah, be that daring person and try to
explore and purposely break things.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.370
So I'm exploring,
I'm breaking things right now.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.870
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to click on engine.js on

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.790
line number 94.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.610
So the engine will say okay, I'm going
to do function of the entities and

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.602
says are enemies for each enemy.

00:02:11.602 --> 00:02:12.476
&gt; Exactly
&gt;&gt; And

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:16.898
then it says on [CROSSTALK] references
our enemies is not defined.

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:18.798
I'm not define myself all enemies.

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:20.418
&gt;&gt; Go ahead define all enemies.

00:02:20.418 --> 00:02:23.278
&gt;&gt; Let's just go define all enemies and
then go through the code.

00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:27.496
If you look through
the code a little more you

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:31.718
will find that all
enemies will be in f.js.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:36.138
Here, now there it goes, see here's
instructions now instantiate your

00:02:36.138 --> 00:02:39.858
objects place all enemy objects
in a raid called all enemies.

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:40.720
&gt;&gt; There you go.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.720
&gt;&gt; Now why don't i just
to create something

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.560
in my code that says for
all enemies equals that.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.910
&gt;&gt; See what happens.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.440
&gt;&gt; See what happens.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.960
Can I save this?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.770
No I don't think I can save this.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.390
If you run suggest you'll
get some more errors.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.770
And then you need to find out okay,
what's next step.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.690
&gt;&gt; What's the next step?

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.090
&gt;&gt; What's the next step, error.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.150
I need to I'll give you a hint.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.980
I actually have nothing in all enemies
because I was supposed to have some

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.510
sort of like new enemy I think.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.020
New enemy, maybe new enemy,
now I instantiate it.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.810
Actually in your js course,
I create a new object by putting new.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.690
So okay, save that and
see what else writes.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.620
Now handle these errors
one step at a time, and

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.600
just think of errors as bread crumbs,
they are clues to what you need to do.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.100
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
