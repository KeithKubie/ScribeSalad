00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.480
Glow in the Dark Urine... and 8 Other Animal
Facts

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.480
1.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.089
The “Hercules beetle” lives in the rainforests
of Central and South America and is known

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:14.909
for being able to lift more than 850 times
its own weight, or about 8 kilograms (17.6

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:15.909
lbs).

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.260
Pound for pound, this makes it one of the
strongest animals on the planet.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.810
For reference, if a 90 kg (200 lb) male human
could do the same, he would be able to lift

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.789
76,500 kg or 170,000 lbs.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.130
(QF: 721)
2.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.250
Cats are the only known animal, including
humans, that prefer to be given things freely,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.680
rather than needing to do some task to get
them.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.680
Don’t believe us?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.030
Google Contrafreeloading if you’re interested
in learning more.)

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.030
(QF: 445)

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.030
3.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.030
Wombat poop is cubic.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.030
(QF: 455)

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.030
4.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.060
Hippopotamus kill more people in Africa than
any other large animal, including more than

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.060
lions, crocodiles, and elephants.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.360
(QF 497)

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.360
5.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
Wild American bison, often incorrectly called
buffalo, are one of the most dangerous animals

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.690
to encounter in the United States.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.070
In Yellowstone National Park alone, nearly
five times as many people are killed by bison

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620
than by bears every year.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.670
The bison can reach speeds of up to 35 miles
per hour and are surprisingly nimble, making

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.370
them difficult to avoid if they attack, which
they do with little provocation.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.540
6.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.730
The testes of the Right whale are the largest
of any animal, each weighing around 500 kg

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.610
(1,100 lb).

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.610
7.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.979
Animals such as dogs, rabbits, rodents, gorillas,
etc. often eat their poop to maintain proper

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:30.979
health.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.490
For animals like rabbits, who eat a lot of
plants, their poop contains quite a bit of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.910
undigested plant matter; so eating their poop
is a nice easy way to get more out of the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.260
food they have available.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.440
For other animals, like dogs, their poop can
also be very vitamin rich with the bacteria

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.770
in their intestines producing essential vitamins
they wouldn’t get otherwise.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.909
Dogs particularly like cat poop because it
is very high in protein.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:53.909
8.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.940
Mouse urine glows under florescent light.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.979
Further, despite their propensity to spread
disease and the like, surprisingly, mice are

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.229
very clean animals.

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.300
They clean themselves regularly, not unlike
cats, and they organize their homes with specific

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.479
areas for storing food, going to the bathroom,
sleeping, etc.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.479
9.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.080
The Honeyguide is a type of bird that will
lead certain animals, most notably the Honey

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.359
Badger, to beehives.

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.079
The bird will then wait for the Honey Badger
to break open the beehive and to have its

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.079
fill.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.459
Once the Honey Badger has left, the Honeyguide
will fly in and eat the leftover larvae and

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.459
beeswax.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.489
Honeyguides are also known to lead humans
to honey, again so that they can feed on the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.939
scraps left behind.

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.849
The Boran people even use a special type of
whistle to try to attract a Honeyguide when

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:48.430
they want 
to search for honey.
