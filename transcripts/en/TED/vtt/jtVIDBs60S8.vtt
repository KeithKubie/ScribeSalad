00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:15.546
Joan Blades: Do you have
politically diverse friends?

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:17.577
What do you talk about with them?

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:20.906
I'm a progressive; I live
in a town full of progressives,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.578
and 15 years ago, I didn't have
any conservative friends.

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:27.366
Now I have a wonderful mix of friends,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.777
and they include John.

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:31.107
John Gable: I am not a progressive.

00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:34.551
I'm a Republican who grew up
in a Republican family

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:35.856
in the conservative South,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.560
and even worked in Republican politics,
locally and at the national level.

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:42.132
But the last 24 years,
I've been in technology

00:00:42.156 --> 00:00:44.459
and living in a very progressive area.

00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:46.383
So I have a lot of progressive friends,

00:00:46.407 --> 00:00:47.840
including Joan.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.170
JB: I was born in Berkeley, California,

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:53.677
a notoriously progressive college town.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:55.988
And I live there now.

00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:02.590
In 1998, six months into the Monica
Lewinsky-Clinton impeachment scandal,

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:07.171
I helped cofound MoveOn.org
with a one-sentence petition:

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:10.502
"Congress must immediately
censure the president

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:13.483
and move on to pressing issues
facing the nation."

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:17.083
Now, that was actually
a very unifying petition in many ways.

00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:19.325
You could love Clinton or hate Clinton

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:23.326
and agree that the best thing
for the country was to move on.

00:01:23.858 --> 00:01:28.433
As the leader of MoveOn,
I saw the polarization just continue.

00:01:28.457 --> 00:01:30.389
And I found myself wondering

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:34.040
why I saw things so differently

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:36.741
than many people
in other parts of the country.

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:42.971
So in 2005, when I had an opportunity
to get together with grassroots leaders

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:45.202
across the political divide,

00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:46.692
I grabbed it.

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:49.850
And I became friends with a lot of people

00:01:49.874 --> 00:01:53.026
I never had a chance to talk to before.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.324
And that included leadership
in the Christian Coalition,

00:01:56.348 --> 00:02:00.773
often seen as on the right
the way MoveOn is seen as on the left.

00:02:00.797 --> 00:02:04.144
And this lead to me
showing up on Capitol Hill

00:02:04.168 --> 00:02:08.432
with one of the Christian Coalition
leaders, my friend,

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:10.428
to lobby for net neutrality.

00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:11.603
That was powerful.

00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:13.005
We turned heads.

00:02:13.915 --> 00:02:17.607
So this work was transformational for me.

00:02:17.997 --> 00:02:20.377
And I found myself wondering:

00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:24.242
How could vast numbers of people
have the opportunity

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:27.840
to really connect with people
that have very different views?

00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:30.989
JG: I was born Oneida, Tennessee,

00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:35.675
right across the state border
from a small coal mining town,

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.016
Stearns, Kentucky.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.556
And I lived there
for the first few years of my life,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.324
before moving to another small town,
Frankfort, Kentucky.

00:02:42.348 --> 00:02:44.448
Basically, I grew up
in small-town America,

00:02:44.472 --> 00:02:45.856
conservative at its heart.

00:02:46.908 --> 00:02:50.574
Now, Stearns and Berkeley --
they're a little different.

00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:52.657
(Laughter)

00:02:53.543 --> 00:02:57.155
So in the '90s I moved out west
to a progressive area

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.706
to work in technology --

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.802
worked at Microsoft, worked at Netscape.

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:04.015
I actually became the product manager lead
for Netscape Navigator,

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.557
the first popular web browser.

00:03:06.204 --> 00:03:08.095
Now in the early days of the internet,

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.295
we were just moved
and inspired by a vision:

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.566
when we're connected to all
these different people around the world

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.108
and all these different ideas,

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:17.958
we'll be able to make great decisions,

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:20.002
and we'll be able to appreciate each other

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:22.995
for the beautiful diversity
that the whole world has to offer.

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.932
Now I also, 20 years ago, gave a speech

00:03:24.956 --> 00:03:26.788
saying it might not work out that way,

00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:31.330
that we might actually be trained
to discriminate against each other

00:03:31.354 --> 00:03:32.644
in new ways.

00:03:34.357 --> 00:03:35.757
So what happened?

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:39.858
It's not like we just woke up one day
and decided to hate each other more.

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:42.225
Here's what happened.

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.361
There's just too much noise --
too many people, too many ideas --

00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:47.897
so we use technology
to filter it out a little bit.

00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:49.393
And what happens?

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:52.056
It lets in ideas I already agree with.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.992
It lets in the popular ideas,

00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:56.810
it lets in people just like me
who think just like me.

00:03:56.834 --> 00:03:58.526
That sounds kind of good, right?

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:01.067
Well, not necessarily,

00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:04.014
because two very scary things happen

00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:06.216
when we have such narrow worldviews.

00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:10.326
First, we become more extreme
in our beliefs.

00:04:11.272 --> 00:04:15.909
Second, we become less tolerant
of anybody who's different than we are.

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:19.849
Does this sound familiar?

00:04:20.856 --> 00:04:23.789
Does this sound like modern America?
The modern world?

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:26.828
Well, the good news is
that technology is changing,

00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:28.538
and it could change for the better.

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:30.999
And that's, in fact,
why I started AllSides.com --

00:04:31.023 --> 00:04:34.768
to create technologies and services
to free us from these filter bubbles.

00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:38.953
The very first thing we did was create
technology that identifies bias,

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:42.222
so we could show different
perspectives side by side

00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:45.622
to free us from the filter
bubbles of news media.

00:04:46.193 --> 00:04:48.130
And then I met Joan.

00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:52.660
JB: So I met John outside
of Washington, DC,

00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:58.458
with an idealistic group
of cross-partisan bridge builders,

00:04:58.482 --> 00:05:02.085
and we wanted to re-weave
the fabric of our communities.

00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:06.510
We believe that our differences
can be a strength,

00:05:06.534 --> 00:05:09.393
that our values can be complimentary

00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:12.368
and that we have to overcome the fight

00:05:12.392 --> 00:05:14.888
so that we can honor everyone's values

00:05:14.912 --> 00:05:16.597
and not lose any of our own.

00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.081
I went for this wonderful walk with John,

00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:21.601
where I started learning
about the work he was doing

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.101
to pierce the filter bubble.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.093
It was powerful;

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:26.367
it was brilliant.

00:05:27.137 --> 00:05:30.533
Living in separate narratives is not good.

00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:34.768
We can't even have a conversation
or do collaborative problem-solving

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:37.116
when we don't share the same facts.

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:40.583
JG: So one thing you take away from today

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:42.977
is if Joan Blades asks you
to go on a walk,

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:44.287
go on that walk.

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:45.420
(Laughter)

00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:49.464
It changed things. It really changed
the way I was thinking about things.

00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:51.582
To free ourselves from the filter bubbles,

00:05:51.606 --> 00:05:54.146
we can't just think about
information filter bubbles,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.858
but also relationship
and social filter bubbles.

00:05:56.882 --> 00:06:00.342
You see, we human beings -- we're not
nearly as smart as we think we are.

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:02.823
We don't generally make
decisions intellectually.

00:06:02.847 --> 00:06:04.754
We make them emotionally, intuitively,

00:06:04.778 --> 00:06:06.499
and then we use our big old brains

00:06:06.523 --> 00:06:08.937
to rationalize anything
we want to rationalize.

00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.376
We're not really like Vulcans
like Mr. Spock,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.762
we're more like bold cowboys
like Captain Kirk,

00:06:15.786 --> 00:06:19.112
or passionate idealists like Dr. McCoy.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.393
OK, for those of y'all who prefer
the new "Star Trek" crew,

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:23.569
here you go.

00:06:23.593 --> 00:06:24.609
(Laughter)

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:26.530
JB: Don't forget the strong women!

00:06:26.863 --> 00:06:28.326
JG: Come on, strong women. OK.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.527
JB: All right.

00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:31.384
John and I are both "Star Trek" fans.

00:06:31.408 --> 00:06:35.798
What's not to love about a future
with that kind of optimism?

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:40.118
JG: And having a good future in mind
is a big deal -- very important.

00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:42.890
And understanding what the problem is
is very important.

00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:44.292
But we have to do something.

00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:45.499
So what do we do?

00:06:45.523 --> 00:06:46.873
It's actually not that hard.

00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:48.908
We have to add diversity to our lives --

00:06:48.932 --> 00:06:52.249
not just information,
but relationship diversity.

00:06:52.273 --> 00:06:54.964
And by diversity,
I mean big "D" diversity,

00:06:54.988 --> 00:06:57.853
not just racial and gender,
which are very important,

00:06:57.877 --> 00:06:59.095
but also ...

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.540
diversity of age, like young and old;

00:07:02.564 --> 00:07:04.763
rural and urban;

00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:06.869
liberal and conservative;

00:07:07.428 --> 00:07:10.394
in the US, Democrat and Republican.

00:07:10.418 --> 00:07:13.650
Now, one of the great examples
of somebody freeing themselves

00:07:13.674 --> 00:07:14.917
from their filter bubbles

00:07:14.941 --> 00:07:16.554
and getting a more diverse life

00:07:16.578 --> 00:07:18.813
is, once again, next to me -- Joan.

00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:20.921
JB: So the question is:

00:07:21.388 --> 00:07:25.854
Who among you has had
relationships lost or harmed

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:29.460
due to differences in politics,
religion or whatever?

00:07:29.484 --> 00:07:30.807
Raise your hands.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.108
Yeah.

00:07:33.132 --> 00:07:35.905
This year I have talked to so many people

00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:40.233
that have experienced that kind of loss.

00:07:41.487 --> 00:07:45.800
I've seen tears well up in people's eyes
as they talk about family members

00:07:45.824 --> 00:07:47.363
from whom they're estranged.

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:51.864
Living Room Conversations were designed

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:57.241
to begin to heal political
and personal differences.

00:07:57.891 --> 00:07:59.603
They're simple conversations

00:07:59.627 --> 00:08:03.246
where two friends with different
viewpoints each invite two friends

00:08:04.274 --> 00:08:05.890
for structured conversation,

00:08:05.914 --> 00:08:08.946
where everyone's agreed
to some simple ground rules:

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.059
curiosity, listening,
respect, taking turns --

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:14.191
everything we learned
in kindergarten, right?

00:08:14.215 --> 00:08:15.490
Really easy.

00:08:16.017 --> 00:08:20.883
So by the time you're talking about
the topic you've agreed to talk about,

00:08:20.907 --> 00:08:22.548
you actually have the sense that,

00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:24.522
"You know, I kind of like this person,"

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.862
and you listen to each other differently.

00:08:26.886 --> 00:08:28.480
That's kind of a human condition;

00:08:28.504 --> 00:08:30.774
we listen differently
to people we care about.

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:33.135
And then there's reflection

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.818
and possibly next steps.

00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:38.940
This is a deep listening practice;

00:08:38.964 --> 00:08:40.360
it's never a debate.

00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:43.342
And that's incredibly powerful.

00:08:43.366 --> 00:08:47.680
These conversations
in our own living rooms

00:08:47.704 --> 00:08:50.397
with people who have different viewpoints

00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:52.437
are an incredible adventure.

00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:55.880
We rediscover that we can respect
and even love people

00:08:55.904 --> 00:08:57.638
that are different from us.

00:08:58.148 --> 00:08:59.915
And it's powerful.

00:09:01.014 --> 00:09:03.628
JG: So, what are you curious about?

00:09:04.061 --> 00:09:06.775
JB: What's the conversation
you yearn to have?

00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:08.594
JG: Let's do this together.

00:09:09.177 --> 00:09:10.327
Together.

00:09:10.698 --> 00:09:11.849
JB: Yes.

00:09:11.873 --> 00:09:12.896
(Laughter)

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.110
(Applause)

00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:16.294
JB and JG: Thank you.
