DESTIN&gt;&gt; That's right You stand on the right

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.950
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day, I'm teaching my kids that you're supposed to stand on the right. Stand on the right.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.529
He's standing.. she's there.. you go. All right we're in Detroit and we came here to see

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.350
the American Record for Dominoes

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.140
toppling

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.789
we're really excited about it. There's a young lady on YouTube her name is Lily and we watch her videos and we came to learn

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.549
about dominoes. But first we're in the Detroit airport so you have to see this fountain. What do you call this flow?

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.710
That flow right there.
SON&gt;&gt; Laminar flow.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.750
What's it called?
CHILDREN&gt;&gt; Laminar flow.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.200
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Laminar flow. Some Daddies don't teach their kids cool words like this

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200
SON&gt;&gt; Oh, I already know "Alias"

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.629
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Yeah?
SON&gt;&gt; And all that other stuff.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.680
You don't you don't appreciate this

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.349
What you don't appreciate laminar flow. I choose

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.800
To believe that it's not that the laminar flow doesn't impress them, it's that they were turbo

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.459
Excited that we got there a day early in detroit so we could see a Behind-The-Scenes look at the largest domino fall in American History

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.309
Seriously, these videos get millions of views online but you don't get to see the people behind it and how much care and time they

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.720
Put into it. That's why we came to Detroit a day early. Oh my goodness.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.680
This is it ? Okay so you're Lily? 
LILY&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm Lily.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.119
DESTIN&gt;&gt; i'm Destin Nice to meet you. Alright so i don't -

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.800
I'm too scared to move anywhere. Where do we - Where do we go? 
&gt;&gt; You can stay outside of the Caution tape

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Outside of The Caution tape.
LILY&gt;&gt; Walk along here.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.080
DESTIN&gt;&gt; okay... this is way...

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810
Way more impressive in person

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.499
You Know what i mean? 
LILY&gt;&gt; Yeah it's different when you actually see it live

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.520
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Yeah, like I've seen - i've seen your videos - a lot of your videos but this is

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.369
Insane. This is what you did for us.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.000
That's crazy. So this is the night before the competition or it's not a competition.
LILY&gt;&gt; It's an event.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; It's an event.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.970
STEVE&gt;&gt; Or a demonstration 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; A demonstration? Ok
STEVE&gt;&gt; By the way, we have the Floor Plan right here.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.679
DESTIN&gt;&gt; That's the Floor Plan? 
STEVE&gt;&gt; Yeah i designed the setup this year. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Oh Wow!

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.159
If somebody were to mess up and knock over one thing, how do you keep It from from moving on to the other ones?

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.699
You've gotta have like - There's got to be a Domino Builder terminology, like Safeties or

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.389
LILY&gt;&gt; We call it Safety Gap where you take like six dominoes out and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.449
Because there's a gap if you knock it down, it'll stop at the gap

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.989
and we do... 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Is that what that is right there? 
LILY&gt;&gt; Yeah right there in the corner

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.720
You'll see if it if it falls this way it won't continue

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.549
So at the end we just fill in all the gaps very carefully and this way

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.600
Just like a small portion of the domino setup will be toppled if we do knock it down by accident

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.199
Instead of the whole thing. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; And this is like - This is your "thing", right?

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.859
This is What you're good at 
BOTH&gt;&gt; Yeah 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; How long have you guys been working together?

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.519
STEVE&gt;&gt; Three years now. Yeah we've each been building for over ten years. we've been working together for

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.390
three Years and we've done lots of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.110
professional projects for companies where we build advertisements, logos, and things like that

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.690
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Will you walk me through what we have right now

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.960
Steve and Lilly showed me around the entire set up and seriously, please go check out that video on the second channel. It's an awesome

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.670
Behind-The-Scenes tour of the whole set up. Every little thing... It's amazing, you're gonna like it.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.479
I learned tons of Domino Builders secrets that I had never thought about before. For example these guys make custom tools out of Lego so they can

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.780
Speed up the process and make nice neat lines. Check out how they make pictures. Steve wrote an entire computer program that would translate

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.940
Pixels into dominoes. The next day, we got there early and got to meet the entire team

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.790
On the count of three, say your name. One two three...

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.330
(names)

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:40.119
Yeah, nice to meet you. So anyway how many hours do you think, like Man-Hours/Woman-Hours, do you think this represents?

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.119
STEVE&gt;&gt; Seven days times 12 hours
(Mumbling)

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.820
Domino People are very precise people so you can't just ask a question and get a quick answer you have to get the actual answer

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.820
1512 hours

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.000
There's two American Records in this particular Fall right? 
STEVE&gt;&gt; Three. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Three? Yeah okay what are they?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.370
STEVE&gt;&gt; Okay so the first one is

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.320
Most total dominoes toppled in America. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Just like in General General? 
STEVE&gt;&gt; Yep in one complete Fall Down. The second American Record is

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.798
The domino - largest domino field
DESTIN&gt;&gt;That's the White rain there right? 
STEVE&gt;&gt; So That's the Pokemon Field That Has Over

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.060
12,000 dominoes 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.399
STEVE&gt;&gt; And The Third record is the largest

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.590
Domino structure in America which is game over which is the finale. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; So That's - That's the largest

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.910
Three-dimensional wall structure in America? 
STEVE&gt;&gt; Yep, but that also has over

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.130
12,000 dominoes. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; So this is pretty fun. You get all these people showing up to see this and then you get the Dominoe

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.189
Team over there

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.828
They're getting in the zone. It's really fun to watch.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.619
What do you think? 
LILY&gt;&gt; I Feel amazing. This toppled without any breaks at all and I'm just i'm so happy right now

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:52.719
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Oh wait so so you said every 60 dominoes is one second.
STEVE&gt;&gt; Yep. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Really? Is that is that a constant?

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.409
STEVE&gt;&gt; No it's not a constant. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; What do you mean? 
STEVE&gt;&gt; It really depends on a lot of different things like

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.919
The friction on the floor is probably the biggest thing

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.330
The spacing of the dominoes is another thing obviously. When they're more far apart they fall slower and

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.600
Some of the European Builders actually have this theory that different colors fall at different speeds.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.979
DESTIN&gt;&gt; European Builders think different colours fall at different speeds.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:28.479
STEVE&gt;&gt; It could be due to the paint being different or the colouring, the dye, whatever is used. It could have slightly different mass

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.810
Maybe that's it

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:36.619
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay, will you send me different color dominoes and build me a gauge stick so i could do it in a High-Speed video?

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.660
Okay i'm in the garage, we're about to do a domino motion analysis. I want you to look at Trent's hat look at this hat

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.610
Do you like it?

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.649
It's great. It looks like something you would wear wherever you're doing domino motion Analysis okay so

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.619
Here is the High-speed camera. What we're gonna do is -

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:04.580
This is what i call the Swagger Stick that Steve sent me it's an index so you can set up the dominoes and

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.450
Set them up the same every time

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.589
We've got a ruler for motion Analysis here and

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.350
we can change out the type of material that we're knocking the domino's over on. We've got different kinds of

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:22.160
felts and things like that, we've got this dry erase board, we've got some metal down here... We're gonna look at all the variables

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
TRENT&gt;&gt; Here we go
DESTIN&gt;&gt; And we're going in

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.709
It's pivoting about.. That's - what - exactly what it's doing

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.459
Oh dude i just had the moment where it all clicks. It's - it's rotating about the center of gravity

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:07.530
It's exactly what's happening. As it's falling you have translation and rotation and so that front edge is a pivot point

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:14.760
But if there's not enough friction.. are you seeing it? Yeah, it's - it's trying to rotate about its center of gravity

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.670
If there's not enough friction.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.050
Let's put the foam or paper towel down so it can't slip and it's not gonna rotate.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.470
That's gonna translate more of that energy forward isn't it?

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.959
So it's faster on a grippy surface. No? Yeah?

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:37.770
On the felt surface the bottom of the domino is slipping backwards again but it catches due to higher friction.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:44.369
So the question is, because it's slipping less, does that mean the whole line is going to topple forward faster?

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.619
So just did a hard plastic and a clear plastic

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.930
side-by-side and right at the end you can see, it's very very clear...

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:05.160
It's very clear there's a difference. Back it up, back it up. Did you see the clear in the back?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.719
The clear plastic ones kick out more so maybe yhey're slower

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.989
Do you want a domino to grip or not grip? Dunno...

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.320
So clear dominoes are heavier

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:39.489
And they go faster. That - that is counterintuitive. So it's 4 A.M.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.240
Smarter Every Midnight

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.350
Okay look I feel like I owe you an apology because on Smarter Every Day when I break out the High-Speed camera

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:55.900
It's like the mysteries of the Universe are revealed but when I turn it on this little block of

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.690
Plastic. We only get more questions. For example the first 20 dominoes in our setup - it's

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:07.449
Accelerating so we're not getting a steady state velocity of the topple until after that so i think

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:13.780
My setup is inadequate to do what we're trying to do. I mean, also the fact that this thing

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.489
Doesn't pivot like a hinge like every research paper says it does, it slips

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:24.939
we're in an area of Physics now called Tribology which is the study of two frictional services in relative motion.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.660
This is complicated. There's a lot more Greek letters in the math now

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.820
Another thing, like right here, the way I've been triggering this, I've been touching that

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.290
That's inconsistent how I'm doing that. If you have better ideas I

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.609
Feel like we need to redo this entire setup and do it right so

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.359
If you would leave comments below on ideas for how to trigger that,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:54.100
Things on the setup, I want to do this right but for right now I mean we've done complicated things on Smarter Every Day

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.010
But the simple domino, the

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.810
Simple domino is a challenge. It's hard stuff

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.359
Did you know that each time you buy a Casper you get a free time machine?
SON&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:11:07.359 --> 00:11:13.869
DESTIN&gt;&gt; I want to thank the sponsor for today's video which is Casper. You can get a mattress at casper.com/smarter

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.869
Tara and I have slept on a Casper for over two years

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.979
Everybody asks me face to face "are you just saying that on YouTube or do you actually like it?"

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.650
Of course I actually like it which is why I got one for the guest bedroom

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.490
Which my daughter took over

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:31.570
Now we have one for the boys. So if you want a mattress go to casper.com/smarter use the promo code smarter to

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:36.220
Get $50 off. There's a lot of cool things about it they'll ship it directly to your house you get to open it up it's kind of fun.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.779
Also you get to bypass the mattress company in the middleman so you get

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.969
a high quality mattress for a less expensive price. It's a good thing. There's multiple types of foam so you get the right balance between comfort and

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:52.430
Support without it being too hot and you get a hundred nights free trial if you don't like it, they'll come pick it up at

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:57.349
Your house you don't have to worry about it. This is my favorite part. I'm not just saying this, I actually do like the product

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.070
and when you support the sponsor

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.969
You support Smarter Every Day which allows me to do things like support the Zeal Incredible Science Machine which is a really cool way

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.690
for really neat smaller YouTube channels like Lily and Steve

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.330
To create videos that they love. They make good stuff. I think the reason it's so good is because they are

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.539
Seriously passionate about dominoes and that is contagious.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.639
It's your support of the sponsors that make that sort of thing happen so thank you very much. Also

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:27.080
Go check out that video in the second Channel. It is rad. It's a long video

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:34.099
But I learned stuff I have never ever thought about in my entire life. New stacking methods, how they index them, the speed of dominoes?

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.600
It's really fun I think you'll really enjoy it. Feel free to subscribe if this earned it, if not

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.430
No big deal i'm Destin and you're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one now.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:50.030
Thank you very much for letting me do that so this you did that last year

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:55.219
too right? 
LILY&gt;&gt; Yep 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; You know i'm actually changing the logo on Smarter Every Day after this video.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.659
This video is like the last video using this logo. It's going to be something similar.
