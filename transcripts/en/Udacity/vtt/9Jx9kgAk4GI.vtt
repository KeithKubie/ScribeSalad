So if you're really good at counting or, I guess just careful with

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.490
counting, then you should've arrived at

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.050
46 chromosomes and you should've been able

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.660
to get that answer by looking at these chromosome structures which are just

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.630
these x shapes and there should be a grand total of 46 chromosomes.
