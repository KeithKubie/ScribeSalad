[Captions by Y Translator]
In today's video,

00:00:00.745 --> 00:00:02.895
we're putting a popular
internet myth to the test,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:04.650
to see if you can make a crystal

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.600
out of a hot charcoal
and peanut butter.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.240
[Music]

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.040
All right Calli, have you seen
this video going around?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.480
It has like 195
million views so far,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.640
and it shows how you
can turn a charcoal briquette

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.977
and some peanut butter
into a clear crystal.

00:00:20.977 --> 00:00:21.768
There's no way.

00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:23.750
I don't know,
but we've had like dozens,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.400
if not hundreds of people
ask me to see if this works.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.934
So we are going to try this out.

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:28.853
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:31.400
Following the video and the
instructions as closely as possible,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.300
we're going to see

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.400
if we can replicate the results of
turning a piece of charcoal into a crystal.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.860
My goal is to replicate
is exactly as possible

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.740
how they show this being done
in the other video.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.440
They also have
some written instructions,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.382
which don't really show anything
more than what the video does,

00:00:46.382 --> 00:00:48.680
but talk us through
what equipment we've got,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.892
and what we're going
to be doing.

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:51.800
It's really just
a charcoal briquette,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.458
some peanut butter,
and some ice.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.900
Now, we've done everything
we could to replicate as

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.360
closely as possible to
what we saw in the video.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.900
So in the video,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.943
I think we were able to make
out a K on the briquette.

00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:04.093
So we've got
a Kingsford charcoal briquette.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.900
You couldn't see what brand
of peanut butter they're using,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.211
but it was smooth peanut butter
in a fairly large jar,

00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:10.128
so we've got that.

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:12.696
They used a metal bowl,
we've got a metal bowl.

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:14.044
They used small metal tongs.

00:01:14.044 --> 00:01:15.900
We've got small metal tongs.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.796
I think we've got everything

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:19.850
about as close as we can get,
so it's time to get started.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.000
First step, let's get
some charcoal burning.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.840
We're going to make
a little pile of charcoal.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.978
We're going to get some burning,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.880
and then we're going to try
and find a briquette that looks

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.140
like it's just exactly

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.720
the same amount of burnt
as the one in the video.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.240
Okay.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.280
No!

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:45.320
[Music]

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.500
So now, we're going to take
a burning charcoal inside the house,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.980
which don't take burning
charcoal inside the house guys.

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:52.642
Carbon monoxide's a real thing.

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:55.388
The entire house already smells
like burning charcoal you guys.

00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:56.800
This is a terrible idea.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.452
If you don't have
good ventilation, well,

00:01:58.452 --> 00:01:59.550
don't do this anyways,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.020
but especially, don't do this in
like a closed room.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.700
That's not how you do it.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.480
Not all the way.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.360
But yeah, mostly.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.720
A little more.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.620
Little more.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.500
We're gonna dump some on top.

00:02:14.502 --> 00:02:15.552
That looks good.

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:17.800
Charcoal into the peanut butter.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.612
Swirling it around.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.660
I don't--

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.380
Yeah, this is--

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.480
Okay, that looks pretty well coated.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Into ice.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.452
Okay, more ice on top,
more ice on top.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.940
More!
More!

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.720
A little bit more.

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:34.664
Okay, that's good.

00:02:34.664 --> 00:02:36.185
Now, we put it in the freezer.

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:37.460
Okay, now real quick.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.860
We have to leave it
in here for 24 hours.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.820
Real quick.

00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:41.300
Okay, wait for it.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.800
We're just going to live
stream the next 24 hours.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.040
All right, we've let the peanut butter
covered charcoal sit overnight.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.500
Now, we need to rinse this off
in a bowl of warm water.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.160
There's the--

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.060
It's just charcoal.

00:02:55.073 --> 00:02:55.873
Briquette.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.866
But in the video,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.312
there's like a layer of it .You
kind of got to work through.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.540
Oh, come on.
Come on.

00:03:06.022 --> 00:03:06.522
Wait.

00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:07.482
I think see something.

00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:08.222
What?

00:03:08.692 --> 00:03:10.642
No way!
No way.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.540
What?

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.320
Guys, there's a
crystal in there.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.180
[Music]

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.200
Okay, we've got a couple more.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.700
Let's try these.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.749
Okay.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.700
[Music]

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.600
What the--

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.740
What is that?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.060
What the heck?

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.472
It's like a metallic crystal.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.080
Has anybody else ever
gotten this result before?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.920
Checkout.
What's that?

00:03:39.923 --> 00:03:40.876
Yeah, what's this?

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.600
What's this?

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.760
Whoa!

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.700
Hang on.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.500
Guys!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.560
Oh my gosh.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.900
I think it's a Pokemon.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.420
Guys!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.880
It's a Bulbasaur.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.960
I made a Bulbasaur.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.200
Look at that.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.340
The metal, the Bulbasaur,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.100
and the crystal are
all equally real.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.940
None of these worked.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.040
In fact, that's
not even crystal.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.780
That's isomalt.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.680
It's a sugar substitute.

00:04:15.695 --> 00:04:17.279
This is completely edible.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.080
Do you guys want to know
why this doesn't work?

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.840
There's about a
thousand reasons honestly.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.860
But let's break it down for you.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.180
So we did have

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.580
actual charcoal briquettes
to put in the freezer,

00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:29.408
but what we showed
pulling out of the bowl,

00:04:29.408 --> 00:04:30.810
and then putting
in warm water,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.906
and you saw the reveal.

00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:33.860
We rubbed away some charcoal
and like, oh,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.100
there's crystal behind it.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.200
We just took one
of these pieces of isomalt

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.747
that was kind of
shaped like crystal.

00:04:38.747 --> 00:04:41.051
We took some charcoal powder,
we mix it with some water,

00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:41.800
some corn syrup,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.160
and some peanut butter
to give it a good consistency,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.660
and then we just stuck it
to the outside of our Bulbasaur,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.439
this is a small
piece of gallium,

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.851
and our isomalt crystal,

00:04:49.851 --> 00:04:52.632
and we just formed it into
a sort of a briquette shaped,

00:04:52.632 --> 00:04:54.250
froze it, we
had liquid nitrogen.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.908
So we use that,
but you could have just as

00:04:55.908 --> 00:04:57.850
easily said it in the freezer
for a couple hours.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.709
We just froze it,

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:00.643
and we just spread
peanut butter on it,

00:05:00.643 --> 00:05:02.400
and we put it in a bowl of ice.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.614
None of these were
even close to real.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.920
Let's take a look
at the real ones,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.300
and see how those are different.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.050
We're doing a real test as well.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.100
We want to see what happens
if we don't fake this,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.020
and try and get
some real results.

00:05:14.038 --> 00:05:16.332
So we're going to take
three more charcoal briquettes

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.477
from our little barbecue bonfire
in the backyard.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.320
We're going to did those
in peanut butter,

00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:21.350
and try and coat them.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.043
But as you saw,

00:05:22.043 --> 00:05:24.120
the peanut butter
doesn't actually coat that well,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.972
so I think even
that part was fake.

00:05:25.972 --> 00:05:28.772
And then we're also going to see
if we can microwave one.

00:05:28.772 --> 00:05:30.514
Calli, why are we
trying to microwave?

00:05:30.514 --> 00:05:32.127
So I looked
at several videos online.

00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:33.959
Yes, there is a really
really popular one,

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.435
but it doesn't actually show you

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.444
how you're heating up
that charcoal briquette.

00:05:37.444 --> 00:05:38.652
I saw multiple other videos

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.700
that say that your
microwaving that briquette,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.280
and so that's what I'm trying.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.700
You think 90 minutes is enough?

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.800
That should do it.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.599
Okay.

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.100
Sorry about your house, Grant.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.400
All right.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.650
So what's the difference
between this one, and the last one?

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.591
This one's real.

00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:58.050
We're not going to take it out
and put a crystal

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.760
inside of it before--

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.700
Before the reveal.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.200
Oh, that smells so bad.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.240
Also, the microwave's smoking.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.720
This can't be healthy.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.240
And that was two minutes.

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:16.784
Can you see
how much time is left?

00:06:18.342 --> 00:06:19.692
Oh, so the video I watched.

00:06:19.692 --> 00:06:21.650
This guy put his briquette
in the microwave,

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.517
took it out, dumped it
in the peanut butter,

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:25.600
and then said, must leave
for a hundred minutes.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.950
I'm going to take this out
and dunk it in there,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.800
and I'm going to pull it out
in like an hour and a half.

00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:35.270
Don't show that part.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.660
Please show that part.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.980
[Music]

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.500
Microwave briquette.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.660
[Music]

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.840
The briquette that we
left in longer,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.140
that had most of the briquette
was like turning gray,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.451
and it was on fire little bit.

00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:57.323
Like that's been dunked
in a lot of peanut butter.

00:06:57.323 --> 00:06:58.115
It's under the ice.

00:06:58.115 --> 00:06:59.950
It's burning right
through the peanut butter,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.832
still like smoke coming
up out through everything,

00:07:02.832 --> 00:07:03.789
and I can hear it.

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.500
It's like boiling some
of the ice away too, I think.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.740
So, I don't know if that's smoke
from the peanut butter,

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.100
or steam from the heat and ice.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.200
But our microwave looks like it
might be about to light on fire.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.740
So I think it's time
to take that charcoal out.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.700
We are about to set
off the fire alarm.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.900
[Music]

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.200
It's going to be there a while.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.300
Okay, so we have let the
charcoal from the microwave sit

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.300
in the peanut butter
for a hundred minutes.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.440
Aha!

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.380
Turned into a crystal.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.380
It turned into a crystal.

00:07:35.383 --> 00:07:36.940
It turned into-- Ah that is--

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.272
That is a really--

00:07:38.482 --> 00:07:40.702
I can get it.
I know I can.

00:07:41.152 --> 00:07:42.032
Aha.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.420
Yep, seems right.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.380
[Music]

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.280
You know what?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.200
I'm gonna call that good enough.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.660
All right.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.880
Let's let that sit for 24 hours.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.900
It's now been 24 hours.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.040
It's time for the reveal.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.760
All right, moment of truth.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.080
This is the real one.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.280
An actual charcoal that was hot,
we put in peanut butter,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.580
and then we froze overnight.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.120
Now, we're going to see
what's really on the inside.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.900
If there's actually
a crystal in here,

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.500
I am gonna laugh.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.840
Guys!

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.960
Guys, look at this.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.760
It's still a briquette.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.760
A slightly burnt
piece of charcoal?

00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:32.053
Can I break it?

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.312
Nope, Nate get the hammer.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.120
Guys, the truth.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.960
Whole lot of charcoal
inside that charcoal.

00:08:40.967 --> 00:08:41.932
Nothing else.

00:08:41.932 --> 00:08:45.166
Our three briquettes
at different temperatures.

00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:47.050
So these were all on fire.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.812
We let that fire burn out.

00:08:48.812 --> 00:08:50.100
One was a low heat,

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.600
one was a medium,
one was high,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.240
and then this is our--

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.302
Microwaved.

00:08:54.332 --> 00:08:56.350
And then left
in the peanut butter

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.802
for a hundred minutes
just to be safe.

00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:01.562
Oh, look.

00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:02.860
It's a charcoal briquette.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.000
You better break
it just to be safe.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.160
There's the inside.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.140
It's charcoal.

00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:11.069
Here, try your medium
one just in case.

00:09:11.882 --> 00:09:14.242
Oh look,
another charcoal briquette.

00:09:14.242 --> 00:09:15.042
What?

00:09:17.192 --> 00:09:18.312
Please.

00:09:21.696 --> 00:09:23.158
Yay, more charcoal.

00:09:23.158 --> 00:09:23.583
Shocker.

00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:25.060
What about the one
that was like--

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.159
Super heated.

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:27.435
Most of it was burning.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.660
So first off,

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.140
you can see the scorch marks
from when we dropped it

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.199
in the peanut butter.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.413
&gt;&gt; Again.
&gt;&gt; What?

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.060
No crystal inside?

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.440
All right, my microwave one,

00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:41.200
but I followed all
of the instructions correctly.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.580
What's this?

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.840
Nate, Nate!

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.500
Is it charcoal?

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.232
&gt;&gt; It's charcoal.
&gt;&gt; No way.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.060
Oh look, a charcoal briquette.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.400
Guys, you can't make
crystals out of charcoal

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.140
and peanut butter.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.820
Crystals are formed
from volcanic activity,

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.613
different kinds of rocks
are slowly cooling down,

00:10:02.613 --> 00:10:04.907
often under massive
amounts of pressure,

00:10:04.907 --> 00:10:05.681
and I say slow.

00:10:05.681 --> 00:10:08.089
I mean like it usually
takes thousands of years

00:10:08.089 --> 00:10:09.780
for good crystals to form.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.744
You can get those kits
in the store that you

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:14.447
can make chemical crystals
over a couple of weeks.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.247
But again,

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:17.100
that's a couple
of weeks with chemicals,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.950
that's different.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.200
There are ways you can do
it even faster than that.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.400
Sometimes, I think Grant

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.150
has done somewhere he boiled
off all the water in a pot,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.477
and you are left with a bunch
of crystals growing in there.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:26.980
That looks pretty cool.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.540
Yeah.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.000
But like this doesn't even have
an evaporation of water to leave

00:10:31.003 --> 00:10:31.803
behind a residue

00:10:31.803 --> 00:10:33.450
that's going to form
into a crystal.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.250
That's something else
we should talk about.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.810
Coal and charcoal,
not the same thing.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.162
Calli, what is coal?

00:10:39.162 --> 00:10:42.000
So coal is actually
the mineral anthracite,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.040
and what that basically
is is it's a mineral

00:10:44.052 --> 00:10:45.242
composed of carbon.

00:10:45.242 --> 00:10:47.242
It takes millions
of years to make,

00:10:47.242 --> 00:10:48.203
a lot of pressure,

00:10:48.203 --> 00:10:50.845
and it's basically the breakdown
of plant remains.

00:10:50.845 --> 00:10:53.560
Whereas what we've been using,
the charcoal briquettes,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.720
charcoal is a
sometimes called coal

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:57.345
because it kind of resembles it

00:10:57.345 --> 00:10:59.650
and is used in similar ways
when you burn it.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.944
But charcoal is just wood
or other similar plant material

00:11:02.944 --> 00:11:05.251
that's been burned
in the absence of oxygen.

00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:08.202
It's something that you
can make pretty easily yourself,

00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:10.423
and happens pretty much
every time you have a campfire.

00:11:10.423 --> 00:11:11.112
You make a fire,

00:11:11.112 --> 00:11:12.912
and then there's
like the black stuff

00:11:12.912 --> 00:11:15.212
at the bottom that is
still just in lump shape.

00:11:15.212 --> 00:11:16.136
That's just charcoal.

00:11:16.136 --> 00:11:18.132
And the briquettes are charcoal
that's been made,

00:11:18.132 --> 00:11:19.638
and then broken up
into like dust,

00:11:19.638 --> 00:11:21.828
and then compress down
into just the right shape,

00:11:21.828 --> 00:11:23.700
with maybe a little bit
of other chemicals

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.600
in to make it burn
a little bit better.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.667
At least, with this kind
that we're using.

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:29.149
Not the same thing as coal,

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:31.950
and doesn't turn into crystals
under this situation,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.762
or possibly any situation.

00:11:33.762 --> 00:11:37.287
So pretty much everything about
this is just 100% nonsense.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.820
And I think honestly,

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.040
the people making the video knew
that it was 100% nonsense.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.120
I don't think they are actually
trying to convince anyone.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.420
Well, they were trying
to convince people it was real.

00:11:46.423 --> 00:11:48.899
I don't think they thought
it was real when they faked it,

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:50.500
because they
definitely faked it.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.500
They made a crystal.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.450
We made a Bulbasaur.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.240
We win.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.320
Bulbasaur.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.300
Can you make Pokemon?

00:11:55.852 --> 00:11:56.950
Guys, that's not all,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.750
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.135
If you hit this box
up at the top,

00:12:00.135 --> 00:12:01.682
it will take you
to our latest video.

00:12:01.682 --> 00:12:03.257
The box at the bottom
will take you to

00:12:03.257 --> 00:12:05.243
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:12:05.243 --> 00:12:06.873
Go ahead and hit
this bomb in the middle.

00:12:06.873 --> 00:12:08.010
It'll subscribe to the channel

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.273
so you never miss
out on the fun.

00:12:09.273 --> 00:12:10.661
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.138
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:12:12.138 --> 00:12:12.900
Talk to you then.
