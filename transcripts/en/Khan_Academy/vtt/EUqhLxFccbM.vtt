00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:03.699
- [Voiceover] How many dogs do you see?

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.370
And I have the dogs down here,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.926
we just need to count them.

00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:08.691
So, if I'm starting with this dog,

00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:10.593
and I wanna make sure that
I don't count him again,

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:13.356
so I wanna remember, I'm
starting with this top dog.

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:16.769
One, two, three, four,

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.881
five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:20.995
I see eight dogs.

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:22.737
You might be tempted to go, nine.

00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:24.385
But I already counted this dog.

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:26.893
So there's only eight dogs.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.075
So I see eight dogs.

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:30.677
So let's check our answer.

00:00:30.677 --> 00:00:31.862
Got it right.

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:33.510
How many mice do you see?

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.111
Same thing, I like to
start with the top mouse,

00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:36.900
but we have to remember,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.827
if I'm gonna start counting
with the top mouse,

00:00:38.827 --> 00:00:41.103
I don't wanna keep counting the top mouse.

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.982
So one, two, three,

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:47.674
four, five, six, seven.

00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:49.565
Now, you might be tempted to go

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:52.109
eight, but we already
counted this top mouse.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.082
So there's only seven mice here.

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:55.290
Seven mice.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.404
You gotta be careful not to keep going

00:00:56.404 --> 00:00:57.751
in circles and counting the mice

00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:59.051
over and over and over again.

00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:01.930
You only wanna count
each of the mice once.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:02.720
Let's do another one.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.973
This is too much fun.

00:01:03.973 --> 00:01:05.227
How many cookies do you see?

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:07.224
All right, they're all jumbled up here,

00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:08.617
and we just have to be careful

00:01:08.617 --> 00:01:10.612
not to count the cookie twice.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:13.724
So let's see, one, two, three,

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:16.696
four, five, six, seven,

00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:18.669
eight, nine.

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:20.434
There are nine cookies.

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:23.290
I see nine cookies.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.683
How many mice are there?

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.703
Okay, now, here there are a lot of mice.

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:28.050
So there's one, two, three,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.281
four, five, six, seven,

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:32.669
eight, nine, 10, 11,

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:35.236
12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:38.742
17, 18 19 mice.

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:40.855
There are 19 mice there.

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:42.916
That's a lot of mice.
