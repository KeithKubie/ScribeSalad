00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.420
[Introduction music]

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.460
Parties are a great way to celebrate and have fun with your good friends.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.560
So to make sure your next party rocks, I've assembled the biggest lifehackers on Youtube,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.140
to bring you 10 outrageous party tricks, your guests will not forget.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.260
Number one is Brusspup with how to make ice cubes that glow in the dark.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.880
When the sun goes down, you can take your party to a whole new level,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.240
with a blacklight and a bit of tonic water.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.760
Make sure to visit Brusspup for the full tutorial and a bunch of other tricks I didn't get to show you here.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.300
He does illusions, experiments and has over 200 other videos for you to see.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.020
Now your guests are gonna need a place to relax

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.200
and you'll be amazed at what can be done with a few rolls of duck tape.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.420
Kipkay is here with #2 the star spangled hammock.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.480
"You'll want to roll the duck tape around the dowel,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.660
now I did it about three times around to make sure it was secure.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.660
And then unrolled it to the other dowel.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.560
Then when you get there, you're just going to wrap it around,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.160
and then carefully start applying it to the sticky side going back the other way.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.380
Repeat this process, take your time for a good job.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.040
When you are done, you've got your initial main straps on your hammock!

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.620
I've found this blue tape with white stars, which is gonna be perfect for the cross straps!

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.660
I was able to eyeball it pretty good about 4 inches apart for all of my cross straps.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.860
Then using some rope, I secured our star spangled hammock to a couple of trees!

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.040
You'll find the full tutorial and over 200 more videos on Kipkay's channel,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.800
so be sure to check him out for more awesome ideas!

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.040
Now every kid loves bubbles,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.560
but what if you could make some that were bigger than your car?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.560
NightHawkInLight is here with #3

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.260
exposing his recipe for monster bubbles.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.260
"The base of my bubble mix is an entire

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.200
24 or 30 oz bottle of dish washing liquid.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.380
To this soap I measure and add 1 tablespoon  of J- Lube powder.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.900
On top of this is added 3 gallons of water.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.180
This simple 3 component formula is all it takes to make giant bubbles,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.880
though perhaps it can be improved with your own experimenting.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840
The bubbles made with a net will be smaller

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.920
but easy for anyone to make, even on hot dry days

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.640
where evaporation can cause giant bubbles to pop.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.820
There are more projects and videos just like this on his channel-

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.240
so head over to NightHawkInLight.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.200
You'll be amazed at what you find.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.320
When your guests need something to drink there's a crazy way to get them served!

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.400
Steve Spangler is here with #4

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400
the instant soda dispenser.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.640
"If I pull this, theoretically it should shoot up this way and now cascade down.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.940
So when it comes time to serve the carbonated beverage you know what's gonna happen.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.940
Ready.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.400
3. 2. 1. Drop.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.000
Perfect!

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400
That's a great way to serve 6 sodas!

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.700
I think.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.020
If you like Steve Spangler just hold tight- you'll see more of him in just a minute.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.960
Doctor Lithium of NurdRage is here with #5 showing how to light a barbecue like a chemist.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.040
"Greetings fellow nerds. In this video we're gonna start a charcoal barbecue

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.260
with chemistry.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.920
Now normally charcoal is started with some lighter fluid,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.320
but since we're nerds I'm going to use a mixture of 250 grams of potassium chlorate

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.020
and 50 grams of sugar.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.220
Now for the fun part- lighting it up.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.840
[Hissing flames]

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.340
Yeah!

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.200
Forget the manly way of starting a barbecue, this is the nerdy way!

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.320
The reaction is an extreme fire hazard and fire safety protocols must be in place.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.180
Put on the grill and now you're ready to get cooking.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.600
And that is how a chemist lights a barbecue.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.940
Thanks for watching!

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.940
This full video is on his channel along with 100 other NurdRage experiments,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.400
so go see what other ideas you can find that'll get a reaction or at least cause one.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.940
A party is a great place to joke around with people so these next two are with Brian Brushwood of Scam School.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.040
#6 is how to prank your friends with a foaming toast.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.340
"It's the oldest trick in the book- go to toast your buddy,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.220
but use your beer bottle to slam his and seconds later it'll foam right over.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.580
I say this mainly to all those kids out there who want to mess with their uncle drinking the beer.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.580
Just go up to with your root beer and be like lets toast.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.080
Boom.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.260
Now if you want to blow their minds with drinks that freeze themselves

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.420
here's Brian again with #7.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.900
"Grab a whole bunch of beers that have clear bottles and throw them in the freezer.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.360
When you open it up an hour or two later you'll find that about a third of them have become super cooled.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.680
This is when they're in a state below freezing but haven't created a nucleation to form that ice yet.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.900
The moment you slam it onto the table it will freeze the beer instantly!

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.380
Side note: You can do this with water but you gotta use pure water like fiji.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.060
There are all kinds of awesome tricks, scams and ways to win a bet at Scam School,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.940
so look for more ways pump up your party by heading over to see what else they've got.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.680
How are you gonna grill if you don't have a barbecue?

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.080
#8 is HouseholdHacker with some terracotta cooking.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.480
"Go digging in your garage or basement for an old clay pot.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.400
You're gonna need wanna carefully line the pot now and make sure you cover the hole at the bottom,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.020
so bust out that tinfoil and cover it up.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.420
You're gonna need some type of surface to cook on.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.380
I used this little grate I found in my scrap metal pile.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.780
Now get your charcoal and fill the pot up about 2 inches from the top.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.440
Now light it and lay your grill top back on.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.920
Toss down your favourite grillables and save the day with your ingenious improvised terracotta grill.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.900
Mmmm. Looks delicious and clean up's a breeze- just toss out the foil.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.020
HouseholdHacker has over 300 videos with loads of cool things to try,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.740
so watch more HouseholdHacker and grab as many ideas as you can.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.260
There's always some trick you can do that'll get everyone's attention every time.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.420
Steve Spangler is doing that with #9

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.020
by turning a garbage can into a rocket.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.880
"If you were coming to my party I would do this for you-

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.100
you can't do this at home but I'd do this for you.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.440
Put a little bit of liquid nitrogen right there in the bottom.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.500
Don't try this at home!

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.500
So this gets capped off here like this.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.460
Now, you just gotta stand back.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.720
Finally the pressure can't stand it anymore.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.420
[Loud Pop]

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.840
That's awesome to do in the back yard!

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.600
Steve is a science teacher and has around 500 videos on his channel,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.280
so check out more of his awesome experiments at Steve Spangler Science.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.580
Now if you want to serve your guests something that will really make an impression

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.580
I've got just the thing.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.020
I'm Grant Thompson here with #10

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.780
super breath refreshments.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.860
To get started we need a couple litres of liquid nitrogen

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.520
and if you're one of the few people that actually have access to it you should know it needs to be handled with respect.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.760
Now if we spray a nice long line of whipped cream into the fluid it'll freeze in about 5- 10 seconds

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.140
mainly because the stuff is so light and fluffy and full of air.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.980
All we need to do is break the cream into pieces with something like a slotted spoon,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.080
so we end up bite sized pieces that look something like this.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.040
Now when you put it in your mouth roll it around on your tongue and chew it gently.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.480
You'll blow out dragon smoke with every bite.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.960
This snack is well below freezing but it's okay to eat because it's mostly air and warms up really fast

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.260
however it does make your mouth pretty cold so just have some warm drink standing by.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.160
In the most literal way these might be the coolest party treats your guests have ever tried!

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.560
Well there are 10 crazy party tricks your friends will not forget!

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.760
