00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.390
I have one last -- I was going
to say, trick property.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.150
One last logarithm
property to show you.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.390
So let me pick a suitably
festive color for

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.950
this last property.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.620
So let's say that just, I don't
know, x to the n is equal to a.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.720
Nothing fancy there.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.510
Well, that's just another way
of saying that log base x

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.720
of a is equal to n, right?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.180
That's the exact same -- this
is just the exact same way of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150
writing the exact same thing.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.410
One's a logarithm, one's
an exponent, right?

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.240
These imply the same thing.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.890
But what we can do is, if n is
actually equal to this

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.140
expression, we can, like I did
a couple of videos ago, you

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.150
could just substitute
this for n.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:01.220
So we could write x to
this thing, log base x a.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.470
And we could set that
as equal to what?

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950
a.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.260
Fascinating.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.980
So now what I'm going to do
and, actually, this is going to

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.000
get pretty messy is, I'm going
to raise -- actually, let me

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.480
write this a little more space.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.685
Undo.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.550
Oh I can't keep undoing.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.260
Anyway, so let me write
down here with more space.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.100
Because I'm going to
do something fancy.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.870
So, ignore this.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:47.350
So, if I set x to the log base
x of a, that equals -- and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.060
you'll see why I'm giving you
so much space right now.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.100
Equals a.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.540
Now, what I want to do is,
I want to raise both sides

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.690
of this equation to 1
over this exponent.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.320
So I'm going to raise that
to 1 over log base x of a.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.060
If I do something to one side
of the equation, I have

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.520
to do it to the other.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.490
So that's also, that's equal to
a, to 1 over log base x to a.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.590
I know, this is quite
daunting already.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.490
But you'll see where I'm going.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.140
And hopefully nothing
I've done is completely

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.750
not-intuitive, right?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.500
This expression is just another
way of writing this expression.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.680
And I substitut it for n.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.800
And now I'm raising
both to this exponent.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.280
And you'll see why
I'm doing that.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.870
Well, if you're raising
something to an the exponent

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.000
and then you're raising that
to an exponent, you just

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.940
multiply the two, right?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.340
So they cancel out.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.655
Because this will
be the numerator.

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:43.600
And this'll be the denominator.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.140
So that gets us to this.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.750
x to the 1 power, right?

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.610
Because log base x of a over
log base x of a is equal to 1.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.100
So that's the same thing
as x is equal to a to the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.460
1 over log base x of a.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.770
You're probably saying, Sal,
where are you going with this.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.300
And I will sort
show you shortly.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.280
So, we could also just replace
a with another variable, right?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.660
I could also write x is also
equal to b to the 1 over

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.980
log base x of b, right?

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.110
Nothing strange there.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.990
The same exact thing I did
with a, I could do with a.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.350
The same thing I did with
a, I could do with b.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.840
So I've written these
two expressions.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.020
I said x is equal to
both of these things.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.020
So let's set them
equal to each other.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:55.230
So, we know that a to 1 over
log base x of a, is equal to b

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.370
to the 1 over log base x of b.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.730
So, what can we do now?

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.200
Well let's raise both of these
-- actually, I'm running

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.220
out of so much space.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.060
Let me clear this and go
to the next page, or

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.260
go to another page.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.040
Clear image.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.610
Invert.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.960
So what did I just write?

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.590
I said that, because I
need a lot of space

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.860
for what I plan to do.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:33.050
So, I said, a to the 1 over log
base x of a -- well, that

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:41.380
equals b to the 1 over
log base x of b.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.640
And hopefully you're
satisfied with that.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.980
Now, let's raise both of
these sides to the log

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.820
base x of b power.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.100
This long base x's of b power.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.800
Now, hopefully you'll
see why I'm doing this.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.400
On this side they'll
cancel out, right?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.520
Because this becomes
a numerator, that's

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.630
the denominator.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:10.260
And on this side, you get a
to the -- this becomes the

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.420
numerator, right, because we
just multiply the exponents.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.440
Log base x, that
little dot is an x.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:26.520
Of b over log base x of a.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.370
And what does that equal?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.080
Well, that equals
just b, right?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.580
Because this over this is 1.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.890
This b to the 1.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.920
That equals b.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.860
Now let's write this entire
thing as a logarithm.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.710
a to this thing is equal to b.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:49.840
That's the exact same thing as
saying that the logarithm base

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.730
a of b is equal to this thing.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:05.350
Is equal to the log base x of b
divided by the log base x of a.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.890
This might seem confusing, it
might seem daunting, but we're

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.020
actually going to do a lot
of examples with this.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.780
And this is probably the single
most useful identity, I

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.700
guess you could call it, if
you're using a calculator.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.490
Why?

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.135
Because your calculator
only has two bases.

00:06:20.135 --> 00:06:27.460
It either has log base, you
know base 10, or base e, right?

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.280
And most of them, when
you press the log button

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.390
on your calculator, it
assumes log base 10.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:40.170
So if I gave you a problem
where I wanted to know what is

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.580
the log base 7 of 3, right?

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.130
Who knows?

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.620
7 to what power is 3?

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.380
And there's no easy way, on
most calculators, to do this.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.520
Well, you can use
this identity.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.150
That this is the same thing as
the log base 10 of 3, divided

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.530
by the log base 10 of 7.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.440
And these are very easy to
calculate on your calculator.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.130
You just type 3 and press log.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.970
It'll give you this number.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.170
And you press 7 and click
on log, it'll give

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.930
you this number.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.120
And then you're done.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.230
So hopefully you're satisfied
that this is true and you

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.940
have a little bit of an
intuition of how to use it.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.920
And I'll make a bunch of videos
now, on actually how you can

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.280
use these logarithm properties.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.140
I just wanted to get it out
of the way so that you're

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.450
satisfied that they are true.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.230
I'll see you soon.
