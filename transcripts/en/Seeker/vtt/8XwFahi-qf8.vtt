00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.180
I just changed the
structure my brain--

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.860
or broke something up there.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.090
We should have an ambulance
standing by, guys.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.900
Anthony here for D News.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.570
And your brain is adapting
and changing all the time

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.510
based on everything you do.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.550
A new study from
Imperial College London

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.066
shows that ballet dancers'
brain structures actually

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.690
change to keep them
from getting dizzy.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.082
They just suppress the
signal from the inner ear

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:28.540
that tells them to
get disoriented.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.120
Just, nope, not needed.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.920
Filter that information, please.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.940
But it's not just a
switch or a filters.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.490
The bits of the
cerebral cortex that

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.240
process those signals
actually shrink.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.750
They get out of the way to allow
other bits to get stronger.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.670
This is neuroplasticity,
and is the jam.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.410
It's a fairly new
idea, even though it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.510
was proposed in 1890
by William James.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.659
Up until the 1960s,
everyone pretty much

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.200
thought that once
childhood was over,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.370
your brain just froze,
stopped developing.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.540
Not only is that
false-- the extent

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.720
to which your brain
can change is crazy.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.710
A study of London
cab drivers actually

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.110
found that they have more
fully developed hippocampuses

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.970
than most people.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.595
That's the part of
the brain associated

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:11.560
with space and memory.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.450
Animals that hide food for
the winter and have to find it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.580
later have more fully developed
hippocampuses than animals that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.100
don't.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.740
And years of having to know
their way around all 25,000

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.700
streets of London made the cab
drivers' brains restructure

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.060
to become good at it.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.970
Studies of the brains
of high-level athletes

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.890
have showed that having
to focus on precision

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.910
and constantly integrate
feedback into their routine

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.470
actually thickens the outermost
layers of their brains.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.840
Scientists can
actually tell how long

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.100
somebody has been intensely
practicing a sport by how thick

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.240
those layers are.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.060
But it doesn't take years
of practiced routine

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.720
to make this stuff happen.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.120
Your brain is insanely adaptive,
even in the short-term--

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.900
even if you just think
about changing it.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.770
A Harvard study a few years
back gave two groups of people

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.220
a couple days of piano lessons.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.700
Then one group practiced
for another five days

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.482
and the other group imagined
practicing for five days.

00:02:05.482 --> 00:02:07.190
They just mentally
went through the steps

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.840
of playing the
song in their head.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.600
And after scanning
everyone's brains,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.420
they found that the motor
cortexes of both groups

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.420
expanded just as much, at
least for the first few days.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.320
Now, on the other hand,
neuroplasticity could

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.860
be part of why habits
can be so hard to break,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.180
and might also have
a hand in addiction.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.890
Mice given cocaine just once
grew new brain circuitry

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.920
within two hours.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.670
They adapted quickly
to love the drug

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.470
and to seek out the environment
where it was given to them.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.410
But it also means
that if you need

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.910
to change a habit that
seems impossible to kick,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.830
you might still be
able to strengthen

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.170
the parts of your brain
you need to get rid of it.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.910
A study of musicians'
brains show

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.180
that they have highly
developed frontal lobes

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.080
and are more likely to be
calmer and open-minded.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.560
So if you have anger or
defensiveness issues,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.730
you could potentially
take up an instrument

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.550
to help train
yourself out of them.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.480
Basically, your brain
becomes the brain

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.880
you make it through
what you do every day.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.810
You can train it just like
any other part of your body.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.600
Now I just need to know
which part of my brain

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.840
hits the snooze button too
many times in the morning.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.756
What would you like to
train your brain to do?

00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:15.780
