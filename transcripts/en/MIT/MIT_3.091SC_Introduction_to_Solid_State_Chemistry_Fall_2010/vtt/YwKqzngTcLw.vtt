00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.990
JOCELYN: Hi.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.750
Jocelyn here.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.930
And today we're going to go over
fall 2009's final exam,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.900
problem 10.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.420
As always we're going to start
by reading the question.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.450
You have 333 milliliters of
alkaline solution at a pH

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.330
equal to 9.9.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.490
You wish to neutralize this
by reacting it with 222

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.380
milliliters of acid.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.500
What must be the value of
the pH of the acid?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.940
So first off let's write down
the information that was given

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.670
and the information that
he's asking for.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:04.990
So we have 333 milliliters
of a solution

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.360
with pH equal to 9.9.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.590
And he's asking you what must
the pH be if you want to put

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.330
in 222 milliliters in order to
completely neutralize that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.030
basic solution.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.040
And the key here
is to recognize

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.150
what neutralize means.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.350
And a neutralization is when you
take acid, or protons, and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.960
base and it reacts to
form water, thus

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.950
creating a neutral solution.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.780
So the next step would probably
be to figure out how

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.590
much excess hydroxide we
have in this solution.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.950
And then we can figure out how
much hydrogen we need to react

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.340
with that hydroxide and to
form water in order to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.610
completely neutralize
this solution.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.630
So first step is to
find out what our

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.840
concentration of OH minus is.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.920
And we do that by remembering
a few things

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.900
about acid/base solutions.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.330
Right?

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.550
We know that if you have the pH
plus the pOH it equals 14.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.370
And this is from the equilibrium
constant of this

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.810
neutralization reaction.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.530
And then we can figure out what
the pOH is because we're

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.100
given the pH of our
initial solution--

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.920
9.9--

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.660
and that equals 4.01.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.720
Now using the definition of
pOH, which is that the pOH

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.300
equals the negative log of the
concentration of the OH minus,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.840
we can rearrange that and
get that our OH minus

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.350
concentration equals 10
to the negative pOH.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.630
Right?

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.740
Just using our log
rules there.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.930
So this gives us that our
current concentration of the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.700
hydroxide ion is 10 to
the negative 4.1.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.220
That gives us the concentration
of the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.110
hydroxide, but what we really
want to know, if we're going

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.720
to use our neutralization
reaction here, is we want to

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.960
know how many moles
of hydroxide we

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.840
have in that solution.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.390
And we can just do that
with stoichiometry.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.220
Right?

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.290
The concentration is
in moles per liter.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.810
And we know--

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:11.370
so our moles hydroxide equals
our concentration, which is 10

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.630
to the negative 4.1
moles per liter.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.080
Times--

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.640
if we want to get rid of that
liter unit we multiply it by

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:37.890
our volume, which is 333
milliliters, converting it

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.970
from milliliters to liters.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:58.720
And this gives us 2.65 times 10
to the negative 5 moles of

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.950
OH minus in solution.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.990
So that's just the first
step of this problem.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.600
Now that we have the number of
moles of OH minus we need to

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.350
find the number of moles of H
plus necessary to react with

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.110
this excess hydroxide, and then
we will be able to find

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.920
the concentration of hydrogen,
or protons,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.650
in that second solution.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.730
So first off we're going to
look at our neutralization

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.470
reaction over here and realize
that it's a one-to-one

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.340
stoichiometric ratio.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.990
That means in order to react
with 2.65 times 10 to the

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.760
negative 5 moles of hydroxide,
we need the same number of

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.300
moles of hydrogen.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.420
So over here I'm going to say
that this also equals the

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.960
moles of H plus needed.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.690
All right.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.690
Now that we have our moles H
plus needed, we need to do the

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.630
same process here
but in reverse.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.700
So first we need to find the
concentration of protons that

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:18.270
we have. So given that we want
to only have 222 milliliters

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.190
of this solution, right?

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.440
So we have--

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:38.140
and we just divide that by
our volume, 0.222 liters.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.430
Right?

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.740
Because we divide by 1,000 to
convert from milliliters.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:52.500
And that equals 1.19
times 10 to the

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.716
negative 4 moles per liter.

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:59.670
So this is another problem where
you could get the answer

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.170
but not actually be answering
the question.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.490
Right?

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.370
Because this is the
concentration of protons that

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.670
we need, but now we need
to convert that to pH.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.390
So moving over here we'll just
write the final steps.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:21.100
We know the definition of pH
is the negative log of the

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.750
concentration.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.740
And so because we know the
concentration of protons we

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.430
know that the--

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:42.450
we just need to plug this into
our calculator and we get our

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:51.180
answer, which is a pH of 3.92.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.110
Put a box around that one
because it's our correct final

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.200
answer, and you'll
be good to go for

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.230
this part of the problem.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:04.740
Now moving on to part b we are
asked, name the conjugate base

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.790
of each of the following.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:13.030
So we'll just start
part b right here.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.870
And the first thing to recognize
is what does a

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.170
conjugate base mean.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.520
And in an acid/base pair, or
when you have a kind of

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.470
dissociation of an acid, in the
most simple terms we can

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.430
think about it just
losing a proton.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.570
In the leftover molecule, that's
the conjugate base

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.900
right there.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:45.095
So in this problem we're asked
if the molecule loses a

00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:48.760
proton, what is the resulting
molecule?

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.050
Ion, basically.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:09:02.800
So part i we have HPO4, and
that will dissociate to

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.820
hydrogen phosphate ion.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.260
Simple enough.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.910
This is your conjugate base.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.930
So that's your answer
for part i.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.280
Moving to part ii.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:32.010
We have CH3NH3 plus.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.810
So it's kind of like an ammonia
ion but not quite--

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.390
sorry, ammonium.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.310
And we know that this
dissociates by losing a

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.440
hydrogen off of the nitrogen,
because that's where the

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.576
positive charge is.

00:09:47.576 --> 00:09:50.490
It makes more sense there.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.990
And we get--

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.930
sorry, keeping the same
order as above--

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.180
a proton plus.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.850
And this would be your
conjugate base.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.100
If you were a little bit
confused on this one it might

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.130
help to draw the Lewis
structure, and you would see

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:17.360
that the formal charge does
actually reside on nitrogen

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.000
and, therefore, it makes
sense that the nitrogen

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.380
would lose a proton.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.560
In addition, if you think about
the ammonia/ammonium ion

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.600
relationship you know that you
have NH3 going to NH4.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.760
And in this case we just have
one of the hydrogens replaced

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.050
with a methyl group, and so you
can make the analogy there

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.850
that, oh, the hydrogen
would come from the

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.190
nitrogen in that case.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.640
All right.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.120
So hopefully this was pretty
straightforward.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.340
As long as you're comfortable
with what a conjugate base is

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.120
and what the dissociation
reactions look like for acids.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.150
So now on part c we are asked
to classify each of the

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.760
following as a Lewis acid
or a Lewis base.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.062
Now first we need to remember
what a Lewis acid and

00:11:09.062 --> 00:11:10.890
a Lewis base are.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:20.450
So if you remember from lecture
or in your reading, we

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:31.960
know that a Lewis acid is an
electron-pair acceptor and a

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.230
Lewis base is an electron-pair
donor.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.780
These definitions are just a
little more general than the

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.420
classic proton acceptor
or proton donor.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:55.220
The first part is asking us
about the cyanide ion.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:01.380
And to kind of clarify it for
yourself and because we're

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.350
asked about Lewis acids and
bases, which are to deal with

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.440
electron pairs, it might
be helpful to

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.480
draw the Lewis structure.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.900
So for this molecule a good
Lewis structure looks like

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:22.310
this, and it has a net
negative charge.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:27.700
And you can see that we have a
couple of lone electron pairs

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.130
there that aren't involved
in bonding.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.260
And because it has a net
negative charge you can

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.080
imagine that these electron
pairs would want to kind of

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.170
grab onto something else that's
a little bit more

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.110
electron positive.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.390
And because of that we
know that this is

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.540
actually a Lewis base.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.230
It acts as a base and would grab
something like a proton

00:12:53.230 --> 00:13:01.790
and thus become more, I don't
know, stable in some cases.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.190
All right.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.540
Moving to part 2.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.120
We are asked about water, which
is a molecule that we

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.200
deal a lot with in acid/base
chemistry.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.880
Again, you might be able to
answer this right off the bat,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.910
but we're going to look at
the Lewis structure here.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.580
Water has two lone pairs.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:28.560
So that means it could very
well act as a Lewis base.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.850
Hopefully that makes a
little bit of sense.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.130
Right?

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:34.200
Because these electrons can go
and grab something like a

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:42.140
proton and form the hydronium
ion with a positive charge,

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.950
thus acting as a Lewis base.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.260
It's important to remember
that even though we're

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.210
creating an acid in the
hydronium ion, this water

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:04.400
molecule in converting to the
acid acts as a Lewis base.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.630
However, we also know that water
can lose a hydrogen and

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:22.700
accepts those electrons to form
the hydroxide ion, and

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.040
thus acts as a Lewis acid.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.780
So in the case of water either
Lewis acid or Lewis base was a

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.580
correct answer in this case.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.300
Now moving on to part d.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.700
We will go over here, I think.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.300
I'm sorry.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.550
d, not b.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.660
Again, it's going to be
about acids and bases.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.320
Consider the effect each of the
following substances has

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.510
on the ionization of the
weak base ammonia.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.620
For each state whether the
substance, one, suppresses

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.110
ionization, two, enhances
ionization, or, three, has no

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.550
effect on the ionization
of ammonia.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:14.040
In each instance give a reason
for your choice.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.290
Going back to the first part of
this question we see that

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:21.170
it's asking us about the
ionization of ammonia.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.370
A good place to start from here
would be to write down

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.870
the reaction, just so we have
that on our paper, in our

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.580
mind, ready to think about it.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.460
So we have ammonia--

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:39.910
and aqueous means that
it's in water, right?

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.260
And that is reacting
with water to form

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
the ammonium ion--

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.740
sorry--

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:54.530
by adding a proton and
a hydroxide ion.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.710
OK.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.440
So this is the reaction
we're asked about.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.360
Now we need to look at each of
the three substances listed

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.510
and decide how it affects
this ionization.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:10.020
So number i, we have KOH.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.860
Again, a good place to start
is to write what happens to

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.050
potassium hydroxide when
it goes into water.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.600
And we know that KOH is
a strong base and will

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.700
dissociate into potassium
plus hydroxide.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:37.110
So we see that it produces
hydroxide.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:41.430
And this should indicate to
you that, well, it has the

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.640
same product as one of
the products of the

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.320
ionization of ammonia.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.240
And if we remember back a
little bit before this

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.120
section, we know that if you
have the same ion in solution

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.330
it will definitely affect the
solubility, or ionization.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.330
So that's one way to think about
it, is that I now have a

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:16.510
common ion effect that will,
because there's more hydroxide

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:21.050
in solution now, it will push
this reaction, this

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.850
equilibrium, back to the left.

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.790
Another way to think
about that is

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.040
Le Chatelier's Principle.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.830
Kind of the same thing, although
it's a little bit

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.280
more versatile, I think, so
pretty easy to think about.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:43.650
Right?

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.060
If you add a product
your reaction will

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.940
shift to the left.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.050
If you add a reactant
your reaction will

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.750
shift to the right.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.360
So here we're adding a product,
our reaction will

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.710
shift to the left.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:03.550
Same as a common ion effect,
these two combine to decrease,

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:08.780
or both suggest that we will
decrease, ionization.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.510
Moving to the second part
of this problem.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:25.430
We're asked about hydrogen
chloride.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.970
Again, let's look at what
that does in water.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:34.090
We know that it's a strong acid,
so it will dissociate

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:40.850
into hydrogen, or protons,
and chloride.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.070
Now this one's a little bit
trickier because we don't have

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:48.390
either of these ions in our
initial ionization reaction,

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.070
but if we think about the fact
that ammonia is a weak base we

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.940
can write an additional
ionization reaction.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:07.390
So that additional would be
ammonia reacting with a proton

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.400
to form ammonium.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:12.460
Right?

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:18.110
So this is another way
that the ammonia

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.390
molecule would be ionized.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:27.160
And we can see that if we add
protons from this acidic

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.800
molecule there we will increase
the ionization,

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.040
because it will allow the
ammonia to work more as a base

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.900
because of this reaction here.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:46.505
So we are increasing
ionization.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.020
Another way to think about this
is completely valid and

00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:01.350
kind of the same thing, but if
we look at this ionization

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.010
reaction here where the
hydrogen chloride is

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.320
dissociating into protons and
chlorides we can recognize

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:13.960
that these protons will then
react with the hydroxide that

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.980
is produced in the initial
ionization reaction.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.500
This will result in a decrease
of hydroxide

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.280
in solution, right?

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.040
And so by Le Chatelier's
Principle we know that a

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.560
decrease in a product causes the
reaction to shift towards

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.645
the product, to make
more hydroxide.

00:20:32.645 --> 00:20:34.750
So that's just another way of
thinking about the same

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:39.510
process, and it results in the
same conclusion that addition

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:45.300
of hydrogen chloride increases
the ionization of ammonia.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:45.600
OK.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.850
Moving to part iii.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:21:04.560
We have ammonium chloride, and
this will dissociate into

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.210
ammonium and chloride.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.360
And even if you're not sure how
much it will dissociate,

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.160
it will still dissociate
to some amount.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:20.210
So it will have at least a
little bit of an effect on our

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.890
initial ionization reaction.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:28.200
So here we see the dissociation
produces ammonium

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.690
ions, and just like the first
case that is one of the

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.840
products in our ionization
reaction.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.590
And so Le Chatelier's Principle,
common ion effect,

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.575
whatever you want to call it,
tells us that it will shift

00:21:42.575 --> 00:21:57.030
the equilibrium to the left
and decrease ionization.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.720
So with that we're done with
problem 10 from the final.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.980
It had a lot to do with
acid/bases, so hopefully you

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.900
feel more comfortable with
them after this.
