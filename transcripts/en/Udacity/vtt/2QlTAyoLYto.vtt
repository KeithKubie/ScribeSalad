People forget things because of interference. They can also forget things

00:00:03.798 --> 00:00:08.832
because of brain injury of disease. Forgetting things because of brain injury

00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:13.046
or disease is what we call amnesia. Now, there's two types of amnesia that

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:17.747
psychologists study. The first is anterior grade amnesia. Someone with an

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:21.968
anterior grade amnesia can't remember anything after the onset of a disease, or

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:27.480
a brain injury. Do you remember HN that we talked about earlier in the lesson?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.957
He had anterior grade amnesia. That was a perfect example of that. Now, the

00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:36.674
second type of amnesia is retrograde amnesia. Someone with retrograde amnesia

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:40.096
can't remember anything before a brain injury, or before the onset of a

00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:44.892
disease. Let's go to Greg to talk about a personal experience with both of

00:00:44.892 --> 00:00:46.490
these types of amnesia.
