00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.170
Boobs.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.810
They’re complicated, and they’re also
cannibals.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.840
Well, sort of…

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.330
Hey mammary-gland mavens, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.850
So we all know that after women give birth,
their breasts swell to become milk machines

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.850
for their newborns.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.070
But biologists have long tried to explain
how, when a woman stops producing milk for

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.480
breastfeeding, the breasts shrink back to
normal size in a matter of days.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.300
New research gives us some answers – they
effectively “eat” themselves to regenerate.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.260
According to a September 2016 study in the
journal Developmental Cell, when a woman is

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.870
done lactating, certain cells in her breast
consume other dead neighboring cells, which

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.149
are left over from the breastfeeding process.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.850
In other words, the breast’s cells turn
on each other and become cannibals!

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.850
Whoa!

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.789
Before we go into the details, we have to
know more about how breasts work.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.589
Breasts are made up of a network of ducts,
surrounded by a layer of fatty tissue.

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.519
When a woman is pregnant, hormones increase
the number of epithelial cells that line these

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.819
ducts.

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.359
Epithelial cells line our skin, digestive
tract and other internal organs, acting as

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.719
a barrier between our bodies and contaminants
in the environment; and depending on where

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.799
they are in the body, they can perform different
functions -- like allowing us to taste, touch

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.570
and smell, or secreting mucus to process nutrients.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.530
When these cells increase in the breast ducts,
they form alveoli, tiny sacs that hold the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.530
milk.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.000
But when a woman stops breastfeeding, the
sacs self-destruct and become debris that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.310
needs to be removed.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.840
And they do so with the help of a Pac-Man-like
protein called Rac1.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.250
Normally, the body’s immune cells get rid
of foreign matter in a different way – a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.030
process called phagocytosis.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.509
This complex series of steps allows immune
cells called phagocytes to identify dead and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.979
dying cells and destroy them, which causes
inflammation, pain and tissue damage.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.140
But women who finish breastfeeding don’t
typically experience the pain associated with

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.310
this process– so scientists surmised that
something else must be responsible for the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.929
clean-up of dead cells.

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.250
They singled out the protein Rac1, which plays
a key role in both milk production and phagocytosis.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.719
To investigate, they bred a litter of mice
that couldn’t produce the protein.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.299
Then those mice reproduced.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.140
Turns out, most of their pups didn’t survive
because their mice mothers stopped being able

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.509
to produce milk for them.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.930
The lack of Rac1 caused a buildup of dead
cells, which blocked normal milk production.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.980
Excess milk then accumulated in the breast
tissue, which became inflamed and swollen.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.379
This showed that Rac1 is crucial for getting
rid of dead cells and preventing harmful inflammatory

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.379
responses.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.879
It also seemingly keeps dead cells attached
to the alveoli for longer, encouraging the

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.640
epithelial cells to eat each other.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.310
It’s possible that this cell-eating-cell
process happens in other organs, since epithelial

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.970
cells form the building blocks of our bodies.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.349
Scientists in the same study noted that it
is thought humans shed the equivalent of their

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.980
own body weight in dead cells every year.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.260
If phagocytosis were solely responsible, we’d
be constantly inflamed... so maybe this cannibalization

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.120
is happening all over your body.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.730
The findings could also provide more insight
into the development and progression of breast

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.800
cancer, since lingering dead cells and resulting
inflammation could allow cancer cells to grow.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.610
After all, women have an increased risk of
breast cancer in the first five to ten years

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.230
following pregnancy and a whopping 80-90 percent
of all cancers come from epithelial cells.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.239
While further research is needed, Rac1 may
have a crucial role in the development of

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.760
anticancer therapies.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.060
So there you have it – a woman’s body
heals itself by eating itself in a bizarre

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.750
form of regeneration.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.020
Consider yourself now a little less confused
about women.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.360
And if you want to know more about breast
milk and maybe if it could be used as a sports

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.210
drink substitute, I have a video on that right
over here.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.740
So, do you have any other questions about
some weird stuff the body does you want us

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.740
to look into?
