00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.267
This is also written in the
form, it's the k that's on the

00:00:45.267 --> 00:00:49.425
right hand side.
Actually, I found that source

00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:53.676
is of considerable difficulty.
And, in general,

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:56.633
it is.
For these, the temperature

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:01.161
concentration model,
it's natural to have the k on

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:05.874
the right-hand side,
and to separate out the (q)e as

00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:10.656
part of it.
Another model for which that's

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:14.553
true is mixing,
as I think I will show you on

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:16.767
Monday.
On the other hand,

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:21.107
there are some common
first-order models for which

00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:25.092
it's not a natural way to
separate things out.

00:01:25.092 --> 00:01:29.608
Examples would be the RC
circuit, radioactive decay,

00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:34.488
stuff like that.
So, this is not a universal

00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:38.083
utility.
But I thought that that form of

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:43.430
writing it was a sufficient
utility to make a special case,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.486
and I emphasize it very heavily
in the nodes.

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:52.463
Let's look at the equation.
And, this form will be good

00:01:52.463 --> 00:01:56.611
enough, the y prime.
When you solve it,

00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:00.298
let me remind you how the
solutions look,

00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:05.000
because that explains the
terminology.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.667
The solution looks like,
after you have done the

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.867
integrating factor and
multiplied through,

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:16.236
and integrated both sides,
in short, what you're supposed

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:20.997
to do, the solution looks like y
equals, there's the term e to

00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:25.523
the negative k out
front times an integral which

00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:30.205
you can either make definite or
indefinite, according to your

00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:34.013
preference.
q of t times e to the kt inside

00:02:34.013 --> 00:02:37.911
dt,
it will help you to remember

00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:41.614
the opposite signs if you think
that when q is a constant,

00:02:41.614 --> 00:02:44.408
one, for example,
you want these two guys to

00:02:44.408 --> 00:02:47.136
cancel out and produce a
constant solution.

00:02:47.136 --> 00:02:50.645
That's a good way to remember
that the signs have to be

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:53.113
opposite.
But, I don't encourage you to

00:02:53.113 --> 00:02:56.751
remember the formula at all.
It's just a convenient thing

00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:00.000
for me to be able to use right
now.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.724
And then, there's the other
term, which comes by putting up

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:09.042
the arbitrary constant
explicitly, c e to the negative

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:12.707
kt.
So, you could either write it

00:03:12.707 --> 00:03:17.514
this way, where this is somewhat
vague, or you could make it

00:03:17.514 --> 00:03:21.179
definite by putting a zero here
and a t there,

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:26.067
and change the dummy variable
inside according to the way the

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:31.102
notes tell you to do it.
Now, when you do this,

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:35.784
and if k is positive,
that's absolutely essential,

00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:39.224
only when that is so,
then this term,

00:03:39.224 --> 00:03:45.053
as I told you a week or so ago,
this term goes to zero because

00:03:45.053 --> 00:03:48.397
k is positive as t goes to
infinity.

00:03:48.397 --> 00:03:53.940
So, this goes to zero as t
goes, and it doesn't matter what

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.291
c is, as t goes to infinity.
This term stays some sort of

00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:03.113
function.
And so, this term is called the

00:04:03.113 --> 00:04:08.368
steady-state or long-term
solution, or it's called both,

00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:14.165
a long-term solution.
And this, which disappears,

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:17.373
gets smaller and smaller as
time goes on,

00:04:17.373 --> 00:04:21.704
is therefore called the
transient because it disappears

00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:24.350
at the time increases to
infinity.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.922
So, this part uses the initial
condition, uses the initial

00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:31.248
value.
Let's call it y of zero,

00:04:31.248 --> 00:04:35.498
assuming that you
started the initial value,

00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:40.150
t, when t was equal to zero,
which is a common thing to do,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.000
although of course not
necessary.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.627
The starting value appears in
this term.

00:04:47.627 --> 00:04:53.395
This one is just some function.
Now, the general picture or the

00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:57.860
way that looks is,
the steady-state solution will

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.116
be some solution like,
I don't know,

00:05:01.116 --> 00:05:05.395
like that, let's say.
So, that's a steady-state

00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:09.989
solution, the SSS.
Well, what do the other guys

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:12.902
look like?
Well, the steady-state solution

00:05:12.902 --> 00:05:16.810
has this starting point.
Other solutions can have any of

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.292
these other starting points.
So, in the beginning,

00:05:20.292 --> 00:05:23.560
they won't look like the
steady-state solution.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.468
But, we know that as time goes
on, they must approach it

00:05:27.468 --> 00:05:31.944
because this term represents the
difference between the solution

00:05:31.944 --> 00:05:37.464
and the steady-state solution.
So, this term is going to zero.

00:05:37.464 --> 00:05:41.041
And therefore,
whatever these guys do to start

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:45.492
out with, after a while they
must follow the steady-state

00:05:45.492 --> 00:05:49.546
solution more and more closely.
They must, in short,

00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:53.043
be asymptotic to it.
So, the solutions to any

00:05:53.043 --> 00:05:56.302
equation of that form will look
like this.

00:05:56.302 --> 00:05:58.846
Up here, maybe it started at
127.

00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:00.912
That's okay.
After a while,

00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:06.000
it's going to start approaching
that green curve.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.413
Of course, they won't cross
each other.

00:06:09.413 --> 00:06:13.635
That's the rock star,
and these are the groupies

00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:18.756
trying to get close to it.
Now, but something follows from

00:06:18.756 --> 00:06:22.170
that picture.
Which is the steady-state

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.326
solution?
What, in short,

00:06:24.326 --> 00:06:27.560
is so special about this green
curve?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.040
All these other white solution
curves have that same property,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.609
the same property that all the
other white curves and the green

00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:44.000
curve, too, are trying to get
close to them.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.606
In other words,
there is nothing special about

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:51.374
the green curve.
It's just that they all want to

00:06:51.374 --> 00:06:54.419
get close to each other.
And therefore,

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.908
though you can write a formula
like this, there isn't one

00:06:58.908 --> 00:07:01.874
steady-state solution.
There are many.

00:07:01.874 --> 00:07:07.116
Now, this produces vagueness.
You talk about the steady-state

00:07:07.116 --> 00:07:09.915
solution; which one are you
talking about?

00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:13.602
I have no answer to that;
the usual answer is whichever

00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:16.742
one looks simplest.
Normally, the one that will

00:07:16.742 --> 00:07:19.473
look simplest is the one where c
is zero.

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:23.297
But, if this is a peculiar
function, it might be that for

00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:26.369
some other value of c,
you get an even simpler

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.168
expression.
So, the steady-state solution:

00:07:29.168 --> 00:07:32.650
about the best I can see,
either you integrate that,

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.269
don't use an arbitrary
constant, and use what you get,

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:41.657
or pick the simplest.
Pick the value of c,

00:07:41.657 --> 00:07:46.307
which gives you the simplest
answer.

00:07:46.307 --> 00:07:53.881
Pick the simplest function,
and that's what usually called

00:07:53.881 --> 00:08:00.377
the steady-state solution.
Now, from that point of view,

00:08:00.377 --> 00:08:05.052
what I'm calling the input in
this input response point of

00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:08.988
view, which we are going to be
using, by the way,

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:12.514
constantly, well,
pretty much all term long,

00:08:12.514 --> 00:08:16.860
but certainly for the next
month or so, I'm constantly

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.206
going to be coming back to it.
The input is the q of t.

00:08:21.206 --> 00:08:23.173
In other words,

00:08:23.173 --> 00:08:27.766
it seems rather peculiar.
But the input is the right-hand

00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:31.783
side of the equation of the
differential equation.

00:08:31.783 --> 00:08:35.966
And the reason is because I'm
always thinking of the

00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:41.044
temperature model.
The external water bath at

00:08:41.044 --> 00:08:44.741
temperature T external,
the internal thing here,

00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:47.494
the problem is,
given this function,

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:51.112
the external water bath
temperature is driving,

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:54.415
so to speak,
the temperature of the inside.

00:08:54.415 --> 00:08:57.955
And therefore,
the input is the temperature of

00:08:57.955 --> 00:09:01.916
the water bath.
I don't like the word output,

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:05.219
although it would be the
natural thing because this

00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:07.796
temperature doesn't look like an
output.

00:09:07.796 --> 00:09:11.628
Anyone might be willing to say,
yeah, you are inputting the

00:09:11.628 --> 00:09:15.130
value of the temperature here.
This, it's more likely,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.028
the normal term is response.
This thing, this plus the water

00:09:19.028 --> 00:09:22.728
bath, is a little system.
And the response of the system,

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.710
i.e.
the change in the internal

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.608
temperature is governed by the
driving external temperature.

00:09:28.608 --> 00:09:32.044
So, the input is q of t,
and the response of

00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:37.000
the system is the solution to
the differential equation.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.876
Now, if the thing is special,
as it's going to be for most of

00:09:49.876 --> 00:09:54.427
this period, it has that special
form, then I'm going to,

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:58.328
I really want to call q sub e
the input.

00:09:58.328 --> 00:10:02.961
I want to call q sub e the
input, and there is no standard

00:10:02.961 --> 00:10:06.862
way of doing that,
although there's a most common

00:10:06.862 --> 00:10:10.209
way.
So, I'm just calling it the

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.663
physical input,
in other words,

00:10:12.663 --> 00:10:16.672
the temperature input,
or the concentration input.

00:10:16.672 --> 00:10:21.090
And, that will be my (q)e of t,
and by the

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:26.327
subscript e, you will understand
that I'm writing it in that form

00:10:26.327 --> 00:10:30.418
and thinking of this model,
or concentration model,

00:10:30.418 --> 00:10:35.000
or mixing model as I will show
you on Monday.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.997
By the way, this is often
handled, I mean,

00:10:37.997 --> 00:10:41.140
how would you handle this to
get rid of a k?

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.015
Well, divide through by k.
So, this equation is often,

00:10:45.015 --> 00:10:47.574
in the literature,
written this way:

00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:51.156
one over k times y prime plus y
is equal to, well,

00:10:51.156 --> 00:10:55.031
now they call it q of t,
not (q)e of t because they've

00:10:55.031 --> 00:10:59.637
gotten rid of this funny factor.
But

00:10:59.637 --> 00:11:04.591
I will continue to call it (q)e.
So, in other words,

00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:09.031
and this part this is just,
frankly, called the input.

00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:11.963
It doesn't say physical or
anything.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:16.068
And, this is the solution,
it's then the response,

00:11:16.068 --> 00:11:19.753
and this funny coefficient of y
prime,

00:11:19.753 --> 00:11:23.942
that's not in standard linear
form, is it, anymore?

00:11:23.942 --> 00:11:28.382
But, it's a standard form if
you want to do this input

00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:31.984
response analysis.
So, this is also a way of

00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:38.031
writing the equation.
I'm not going to use it because

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:43.899
how many standard forms could
this poor little course absorb?

00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:47.615
I'll stick to that one.
Okay, you have,

00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:52.798
then, the superposition
principle, which I don't think

00:11:52.798 --> 00:11:57.003
I'm going to-- the solution,
which solution?

00:11:57.003 --> 00:12:02.381
Well, normally it means any
solution, or in other words,

00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:07.909
the steady-state solution.
Now, notice that terminology

00:12:07.909 --> 00:12:10.840
only makes sense if k is
positive.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.431
And, in fact,
there is nothing like the

00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:17.318
picture, the picture doesn't
look at all like this if k is

00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:20.931
negative, and therefore,
the terms would steady state,

00:12:20.931 --> 00:12:24.272
transient would be totally
inappropriate if k were

00:12:24.272 --> 00:12:26.727
negative.
So, this assumes definitely

00:12:26.727 --> 00:12:30.000
that k has to be greater than
zero.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.654
Otherwise, no.
So, I'll call this the physical

00:12:33.654 --> 00:12:35.928
input.
And then, you have the

00:12:35.928 --> 00:12:40.152
superposition principle,
which I really can't improve

00:12:40.152 --> 00:12:44.538
upon what's written in the
notes, this superposition of

00:12:44.538 --> 00:12:47.137
inputs.
Whether they are physical

00:12:47.137 --> 00:12:51.766
inputs or nonphysical inputs,
if the input q of t produces

00:12:51.766 --> 00:12:54.852
the response, y of t,

00:12:54.852 --> 00:12:59.401
and q two of t produces the
response, y two of t,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.326
-- then a simple calculation
with the differential equation

00:13:07.326 --> 00:13:10.081
shows you that by,
so to speak,

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:15.591
adding, that the sum of these
two, I stated it very generally

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:21.102
in the notes but it corresponds,
we will have as the response

00:13:21.102 --> 00:13:25.877
y1, the steady-state response y1
plus y2,

00:13:25.877 --> 00:13:30.359
and a constant times y1.
That's an expression,

00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:32.041
essentially,
of the linear,

00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:35.536
it uses the fact that the
special form of the equation,

00:13:35.536 --> 00:13:38.837
and we will have a very
efficient and elegant way of

00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:41.943
seeing this when we study higher
order equations.

00:13:41.943 --> 00:13:45.179
For now, I will just,
the little calculation that's

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:48.803
done in the notes will suffice
for first-order equations.

00:13:48.803 --> 00:13:52.686
If you don't have a complicated
equation, there's no point in

00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:54.887
making a fuss over proofs using
it.

00:13:54.887 --> 00:13:57.540
But essentially,
it uses the fact that the

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.180
equation is linear.
Or, that's bad,

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.250
so linearity of the ODE.
In other words,

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:09.052
it's a consequence of the fact
that the equation looks the way

00:14:09.052 --> 00:14:12.043
it does.
And, something like this would

00:14:12.043 --> 00:14:15.349
not, in any sense,
be true if the equation,

00:14:15.349 --> 00:14:18.498
for example,
had here a y squared

00:14:18.498 --> 00:14:21.568
instead of t.
Everything I'm saying this

00:14:21.568 --> 00:14:27.000
period would be total nonsense
and totally inapplicable.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.142
Now, today, what I wanted to
discuss was, what's in the notes

00:14:32.142 --> 00:14:36.685
that I gave you today,
which is, what happens when the

00:14:36.685 --> 00:14:41.142
physical input is trigonometric?
For certain reasons,

00:14:41.142 --> 00:14:44.485
that's the most important case
there is.

00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:49.200
It's because of the existence
of what are called Fourier

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.485
series, and there are a couple
of words about them.

00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:58.542
That's something we will be
studying in about three weeks or

00:14:58.542 --> 00:15:01.699
so.
What's going on,

00:15:01.699 --> 00:15:06.053
roughly, is that,
so I'm going to take the

00:15:06.053 --> 00:15:12.424
equation in the form y prime
plus ky equals k times 

00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:17.415
(q)e of t,
and the input that I'm

00:15:17.415 --> 00:15:23.893
interested in is when this is a
simple one that you use on the

00:15:23.893 --> 00:15:30.371
visual that you did about two
points worth of work for handing

00:15:30.371 --> 00:15:36.000
in today, cosine omega t.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.504
So, if you like,
k here.

00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:41.362
So, the (q)e is cosine omega t.
That was the physical input.

00:15:41.362 --> 00:15:44.959
And, omega, as you know,
is, you have to be careful when

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:48.425
you use the word frequency.
I assume you got this from

00:15:48.425 --> 00:15:52.544
physics class all last semester.
But anyway, just to remind you,

00:15:52.544 --> 00:15:56.272
there's a whole yoga of five or
six terms that go whenever

00:15:56.272 --> 00:16:00.000
you're talking about
trigonometric functions.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.939
Instead of giving a long
explanation, the end of the

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:08.420
second page of the notes just
gives you a reference list of

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.978
what you are expected to know
for 18.03 and physics as well,

00:16:12.978 --> 00:16:17.227
with a brief one or two line
description of what each of

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:20.549
those means.
So, think of it as something to

00:16:20.549 --> 00:16:23.253
refer back to if you have
forgotten.

00:16:23.253 --> 00:16:27.502
But, omega is what's called the
angular frequency or the

00:16:27.502 --> 00:16:31.055
circular frequency.
It's somewhat misleading to

00:16:31.055 --> 00:16:36.000
call it the frequency,
although I probably will.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.531
It's the angular frequency.
It's, in other words,

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:42.474
it's the number of complete
oscillations.

00:16:42.474 --> 00:16:47.110
This cosine omega t
is going up and down right?

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.598
So, a complete oscillation as
it goes down and then returns to

00:16:51.598 --> 00:16:55.056
where it started.
That's a complete oscillation.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:58.735
This is only half an
oscillation because you didn't

00:16:58.735 --> 00:17:03.150
give it a chance to get back.
Okay, so the number of complete

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.535
oscillations in how much time,
well, in two pi,

00:17:06.535 --> 00:17:09.698
in the distance,
two pi on the t-axis in the

00:17:09.698 --> 00:17:13.083
interval of length two pi
because, for example,

00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:16.394
if omega is one,
cosine t takes two

00:17:16.394 --> 00:17:20.000
pi to repeat itself,
right?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.448
If omega were two,
it would repeat itself.

00:17:23.448 --> 00:17:28.074
It would make two complete
oscillations in the interval,

00:17:28.074 --> 00:17:31.418
two pi.
So, it's what happens to the

00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:35.304
interval, two pi,
not what happens in the time

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:39.190
interval, one,
which is the natural meaning of

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.336
the word frequency.
There's always this factor of

00:17:43.336 --> 00:17:48.259
two pi that floats around to
make all of your formulas and

00:17:48.259 --> 00:17:51.195
solutions incorrect.
Okay, now, so,

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:55.772
what I'm out to do is,
the problem is for the physical

00:17:55.772 --> 00:17:59.918
input, (q)e cosine omega t,

00:17:59.918 --> 00:18:02.768
find the response.
In other words,

00:18:02.768 --> 00:18:07.000
solve the differential
equation.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.065
In short, for the visual that
you looked at,

00:18:11.065 --> 00:18:14.279
I think I've forgot the colors
now.

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:19.196
The input was in green,
maybe, but I do remember that

00:18:19.196 --> 00:18:24.018
the response was in yellow.
I think I remember that.

00:18:24.018 --> 00:18:28.556
So, find the response,
yellow, and the input was,

00:18:28.556 --> 00:18:30.825
what color was it,
green?

00:18:30.825 --> 00:18:34.168
Blue, blue.
Light blue.

00:18:34.168 --> 00:18:39.799
Okay, so we've got to solve the
differential equation.

00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:46.387
Now, it's a question of how I'm
going to solve the differential

00:18:46.387 --> 00:18:49.893
equation.
I'm going to use complex

00:18:49.893 --> 00:18:54.993
numbers throughout,
A because that's the way it's

00:18:54.993 --> 00:18:59.456
usually done.
B, to give you practice using

00:18:59.456 --> 00:19:04.131
complex numbers,
and I don't think I need any

00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:09.812
other reasons.
So, I'm going to use complex

00:19:09.812 --> 00:19:13.027
numbers.
I'm going to complexify.

00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:18.452
To use complex numbers,
what you do is complexification

00:19:18.452 --> 00:19:23.073
of the problem.
So, I'm going to complexify the

00:19:23.073 --> 00:19:29.000
problem, turn it into the domain
of complex numbers.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.189
So, take the differential
equation, turn it into a

00:19:33.189 --> 00:19:37.207
differential equation involving
complex numbers,

00:19:37.207 --> 00:19:42.080
solve that, and then go back to
the real domain to get the

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.440
answer, since it's easier to
integrate exponentials.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.090
And therefore,
try to introduce,

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.621
try to change the trigonometric
functions into complex

00:19:53.621 --> 00:19:57.383
exponentials,
simply because the work will be

00:19:57.383 --> 00:20:02.000
easier to do.
All right, so let's do it.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.631
To change this differential
equation, remember,

00:20:05.631 --> 00:20:09.184
I've got cosine omega t here.

00:20:09.184 --> 00:20:14.000
I'm going to use the fact that
e to the i omega t,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.868
Euler's formula,
that the real part of it is

00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:22.684
cosine omega t.
So, I'm going to view this as

00:20:22.684 --> 00:20:25.684
the real part of this complex
function.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.763
But, I will throw at the
imaginary part,

00:20:28.763 --> 00:20:31.842
too, since at one point we will
need it.

00:20:31.842 --> 00:20:36.184
Now, what is the equation,
then, that it's going to turn

00:20:36.184 --> 00:20:41.433
into?
The complexified equation is

00:20:41.433 --> 00:20:46.707
going to be y prime plus ky
equals, and now,

00:20:46.707 --> 00:20:53.330
instead of the right hand side,
k times cosine omega t,

00:20:53.330 --> 00:21:00.320
I'll use the whole complex
exponential, e i omega t.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:06.017
Now, I have a problem because

00:21:06.017 --> 00:21:09.982
y, here, in this equation,
y means the real function which

00:21:09.982 --> 00:21:13.460
solves that problem.
I therefore cannot continue to

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.939
call this y because I want y to
be a real function.

00:21:16.939 --> 00:21:20.834
I have to change its name.
Since this is complex function

00:21:20.834 --> 00:21:24.591
on the right-hand side,
I will have to expect a complex

00:21:24.591 --> 00:21:28.000
solution to the differential
equation.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.801
I'm going to call that complex
solution y tilda.

00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:38.827
Now, that's what I would also
use as the designation for the

00:21:38.827 --> 00:21:42.403
variable.
So, y tilda is the complex

00:21:42.403 --> 00:21:46.080
solution.
And, it's going to have the

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.860
form y1 plus i times y2.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.639
It's going to be the complex
solution.

00:21:53.639 --> 00:21:57.317
And now, what I say is,
so, solve it.

00:21:57.317 --> 00:22:03.241
Find this complex solution.
So, find the program is to find

00:22:03.241 --> 00:22:08.733
y tilde, --
-- that's the complex solution.

00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:12.700
And then I say,
all you have to do is take the

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.403
real part of that,
and that will answer the

00:22:16.403 --> 00:22:20.547
original problem.
Then, y1, that's the real part

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:23.104
of it, right?
It's a function,

00:22:23.104 --> 00:22:28.394
you know, like this is cosine
plus sine, as it was over here,

00:22:28.394 --> 00:22:31.921
it will naturally be something
different.

00:22:31.921 --> 00:22:36.417
It will be something different,
but that part of it,

00:22:36.417 --> 00:22:40.385
the real part will solve the
original problem,

00:22:40.385 --> 00:22:44.000
the original,
real, ODE.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.469
Now, you will say,
you expect us to believe that?

00:22:47.469 --> 00:22:51.012
Well, yes, in fact.
I think we've got a lot to do,

00:22:51.012 --> 00:22:54.771
so since the argument for this
is given in the nodes,

00:22:54.771 --> 00:22:58.891
so, read this in the notes.
It only takes a line or two of

00:22:58.891 --> 00:23:02.000
standard work with
differentiation.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.954
So, read in the notes the
argument for that,

00:23:05.954 --> 00:23:09.908
why that's so.
It just amounts to separating

00:23:09.908 --> 00:23:13.586
real and imaginary parts.
Okay, so let's,

00:23:13.586 --> 00:23:17.356
now, solve this.
Since that's our program,

00:23:17.356 --> 00:23:20.574
all we have to find is the
solution.

00:23:20.574 --> 00:23:25.080
Well, just use integrating
factors and just do it.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.678
So, the integrating factor will
be, what, e to the,

00:23:29.678 --> 00:23:34.000
I don't want to use that
formula.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.831
So, the integrating factor will
be e to the kt is the

00:23:38.831 --> 00:23:42.283
integrating factor.
If I multiply through both

00:23:42.283 --> 00:23:46.884
sides by the integrating factor,
then the left-hand side will

00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:50.259
become y e to the kt,
the way it always does,

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:53.174
prime, Y tilde, sorry,

00:23:53.174 --> 00:23:57.315
and the right-hand side will
be, now I'm going to start

00:23:57.315 --> 00:24:03.913
combining exponentials.
It will be k times e to the

00:24:03.913 --> 00:24:11.594
power i times omega t plus k.

00:24:11.594 --> 00:24:20.000
I'm going to write that k plus
omega t.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.551
i omega t plus k.

00:24:36.551 --> 00:24:40.959
Thank you.
i omega t plus k,

00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:47.000
or k plus i omega t.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.469
kt?
Sorry.

00:24:48.469 --> 00:24:57.612
So, it's k times e to the i
omega t times e to the kt.

00:24:57.612 --> 00:25:06.347
So, that's (k plus i omega)

00:25:06.347 --> 00:25:10.440
times t. Sorry.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:17.011
So, y tilda e to the kt
is k divided by,

00:25:17.011 --> 00:25:23.087
now I integrate this,
so it essentially reproduces

00:25:23.087 --> 00:25:30.155
itself, except you have to put
down on the bottom k plus i

00:25:30.155 --> 00:25:35.625
omega.
I'll take the final step.

00:25:35.625 --> 00:25:38.940
What's y tilda equals,
see, when you do it this way,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.190
then you don't get a messy
looking formula that you

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.855
substitute into and that is
scary looking.

00:25:44.855 --> 00:25:48.170
This is never scary.
Now, I'm going to do two things

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.990
simultaneously.
First of all,

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.785
here, if I multiply,
after I get the answer,

00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:56.359
I'm going to want to multiply
it by e to the negative kt,

00:25:56.359 --> 00:26:00.000
right,
to solve for y tilda.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.472
If I multiply this by e to the
negative kt, then that just gets

00:26:04.472 --> 00:26:08.512
rid of the k that I put in,
and left back with e to the i

00:26:08.512 --> 00:26:10.676
omega t.
So, that side is easy.

00:26:10.676 --> 00:26:14.716
All that is left is e to the i
omega t.

00:26:14.716 --> 00:26:18.034
Now, what's interesting is this
thing out here,

00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:22.218
k plus i omega.
I'm going to take a typical

00:26:22.218 --> 00:26:24.815
step of scaling it.
And you scale it.

00:26:24.815 --> 00:26:29.000
I'm going to divide the top and
bottom by k.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.675
And, what does that produce?
One divided by one plus i times

00:26:35.675 --> 00:26:40.088
omega over k.

00:26:40.088 --> 00:26:45.859
What I've done is take these
two separate constants,

00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:51.290
and shown that the critical
thing is their ratio.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:57.400
Okay, now, what I have to do
now is take the real part.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.247
Now, there are two ways to do
this.

00:27:01.247 --> 00:27:08.214
There are two ways to do this.
Both are instructive.

00:27:08.214 --> 00:27:13.487
So, there are two methods.
I have a multiplication.

00:27:13.487 --> 00:27:17.705
The problem is,
of course, that these two

00:27:17.705 --> 00:27:23.083
things are multiplied together.
And, one of them is,

00:27:23.083 --> 00:27:26.247
essentially,
in Cartesian form,

00:27:26.247 --> 00:27:29.305
and the other is,
essentially,

00:27:29.305 --> 00:27:35.000
in polar form.
You have to make a decision.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.599
Either go polar,
it sounds like go postal,

00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:45.107
doesn't it, or worse,
like a bear,

00:27:45.107 --> 00:27:52.209
savage, attack it savagely,
which that's a very good,

00:27:52.209 --> 00:27:58.765
aggressive attitude to have
when doing a problem,

00:27:58.765 --> 00:28:05.191
or we can go Cartesian.
Going polar is a little faster,

00:28:05.191 --> 00:28:08.089
and I think it's what's done in
the nodes.

00:28:08.089 --> 00:28:11.835
The notes to do both of these.
They just do the first.

00:28:11.835 --> 00:28:14.803
On the other hand,
they give you a formula,

00:28:14.803 --> 00:28:18.408
which is the critical thing
that you will need to go

00:28:18.408 --> 00:28:21.306
Cartesian.
I hope I can do both of them if

00:28:21.306 --> 00:28:24.204
we sort of hurry along.
How do I go polar?

00:28:24.204 --> 00:28:27.172
To go polar,
what you want to do is express

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:32.357
this thing in polar form.
Now, one of the things I didn't

00:28:32.357 --> 00:28:35.930
emphasize enough,
probably, when I talked to you

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:40.188
about complex numbers last time
is, so I will remind you,

00:28:40.188 --> 00:28:43.838
which saves my conscience and
doesn't hurt yours,

00:28:43.838 --> 00:28:47.032
suppose you have alpha as a
complex number.

00:28:47.032 --> 00:28:50.073
See, this complex number is a
reciprocal.

00:28:50.073 --> 00:28:52.811
The good number is what's down
below.

00:28:52.811 --> 00:28:55.092
Unfortunately,
it's downstairs.

00:28:55.092 --> 00:28:58.589
You should know,
like you know the back of your

00:28:58.589 --> 00:29:03.000
hand, which nobody knows,
one over alpha.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.981
So that's the form.
The number I'm interested in,

00:29:05.981 --> 00:29:08.652
that coefficient,
it is of the form one over

00:29:08.652 --> 00:29:10.826
alpha.
One over alpha times alpha is

00:29:10.826 --> 00:29:13.186
equal to one.

00:29:13.186 --> 00:29:15.670
And, from that,
it follows, first of all,

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:19.024
if I take absolute values,
if the absolute value of one

00:29:19.024 --> 00:29:22.689
over alpha times the absolute
value of this is equal to one,

00:29:22.689 --> 00:29:26.229
so, this is equal to one over
the absolute value of alpha.

00:29:26.229 --> 00:29:29.645
I think you all knew that.
I'm a little less certain you

00:29:29.645 --> 00:29:33.000
knew how to take care of the
angles.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.947
How about the argument?
Well, the argument of the

00:29:36.947 --> 00:29:40.976
angle, in other words,
the angle of one over alpha

00:29:40.976 --> 00:29:44.513
plus, because when you multiply,
angles add.

00:29:44.513 --> 00:29:48.213
Remember that.
Plus, the angle associated with

00:29:48.213 --> 00:29:51.914
alpha has to be the angle
associated with one.

00:29:51.914 --> 00:29:54.546
But what's that?
One is out here.

00:29:54.546 --> 00:29:58.000
What's the angle of one?
Zero.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.731
Therefore, the argument,
the absolute value of this

00:30:10.731 --> 00:30:14.232
thing is want over the absolute
value.

00:30:14.232 --> 00:30:18.112
That's easy.
And, you should know that the

00:30:18.112 --> 00:30:23.790
argument of want over alpha is
equal to minus the argument of

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:27.102
alpha.
So, when you take reciprocal,

00:30:27.102 --> 00:30:30.225
the angle turns into its
negative.

00:30:30.225 --> 00:30:35.618
Okay, I'm going to use that
now, because my aim is to turn

00:30:35.618 --> 00:30:40.255
this into polar form.
So, let's do that someplace,

00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:48.739
I guess here.
So, I want the polar form for

00:30:48.739 --> 00:31:00.218
one over one plus i times omega
over k.

00:31:00.218 --> 00:31:04.840
Okay, I will draw a picture.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.101
Here's one.
Here is omega over k.

00:31:09.101 --> 00:31:12.246
Let's call this angle phi.

00:31:12.246 --> 00:31:15.391
It's a natural thing to call
it.

00:31:15.391 --> 00:31:18.637
It's a right triangle,
of course.

00:31:18.637 --> 00:31:24.724
Okay, now, this is going to be
a complex number times e to an

00:31:24.724 --> 00:31:28.376
angle.
Now, what's the angle going to

00:31:28.376 --> 00:31:32.661
be?
Well, this is a complex number,

00:31:32.661 --> 00:31:35.409
the angle for the complex
number.

00:31:35.409 --> 00:31:40.646
So, the argument of the complex
number, one plus i times omega

00:31:40.646 --> 00:31:43.994
over k is how much?

00:31:43.994 --> 00:31:48.803
Well, there's the complex
number one plus i over one plus

00:31:48.803 --> 00:31:53.353
i times omega over k.

00:31:53.353 --> 00:31:57.131
Its angle is phi.
So, the argument of this is

00:31:57.131 --> 00:32:01.338
phi, and therefore,
the argument of its reciprocal

00:32:01.338 --> 00:32:06.755
is negative phi.
So, it's e to the minus i phi.

00:32:06.755 --> 00:32:09.509
And, what's A?

00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:14.734
A is one over the absolute
value of that complex number.

00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:20.244
Well, the absolute value of
this complex number is one plus

00:32:20.244 --> 00:32:24.045
omega over k squared.

00:32:24.045 --> 00:32:29.460
So, the A is going to be one
over that, the square root of

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.545
one plus omega over k,
the quantity squared,

00:32:33.545 --> 00:32:39.339
times e to the minus i phi.

00:32:39.339 --> 00:32:43.003
See, I did that.

00:32:43.003 --> 00:32:46.390
That's a critical step.
You must turn that coefficient.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.212
If you want to go polar,
you must turn is that

00:32:49.212 --> 00:32:52.536
coefficient, write that
coefficient in the polar form.

00:32:52.536 --> 00:32:54.982
And for that,
you need these basic facts

00:32:54.982 --> 00:32:57.867
about, draw the complex number,
draw its angle,

00:32:57.867 --> 00:33:02.900
and so on and so forth.
And now, what's there for the

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.000
solution?
Once you've done that,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.500
the work is over.
What's the complex solution?

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:16.400
The complex solution is this.
I've just found the polar form

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.400
for this.
So, I multiply it by e to the i

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.900
omega t,
which means these things add.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.900
So, it's equal to A,
this A, times e to the i omega

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:37.000
t minus i times phi.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.314
Or, in other words,
the coefficient is one over,

00:33:42.314 --> 00:33:47.968
this is a real number,
now, square root of one plus

00:33:47.968 --> 00:33:53.848
omega over k squared.

00:33:53.848 --> 00:33:58.823
And, this is e to the,
see if I get it right,

00:33:58.823 --> 00:34:00.632
now.
And finally,

00:34:00.632 --> 00:34:05.381
now, what's the answer to our
real problem?

00:34:05.381 --> 00:34:11.031
y1: the real answer.
I mean: the really real answer.

00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:13.586
What is it?
Well, this is a real number.

00:34:13.586 --> 00:34:17.256
So, I simply reproduce that as
the coefficient out front.

00:34:17.256 --> 00:34:20.663
And for the other part,
I want the real part of that.

00:34:20.663 --> 00:34:23.088
But you can write that down
instantly.

00:34:23.088 --> 00:34:25.185
So, let's recopy the
coefficient.

00:34:25.185 --> 00:34:28.002
And then, I want just the real
part of this.

00:34:28.002 --> 00:34:32.000
Well, this is e to the i times
some crazy angle.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.004
So, the real part is the cosine
of that crazy angle.

00:34:36.004 --> 00:34:40.323
So, it's the cosine of omega t
minus phi.

00:34:40.323 --> 00:34:42.600
And, if somebody says,

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.348
yeah, well, okay,
I got the omega k,

00:34:45.348 --> 00:34:49.039
I know what that is.
That came from the problem,

00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:52.808
the driving frequency,
driving angular frequency.

00:34:52.808 --> 00:34:55.163
That was omega,
and k, I guess,

00:34:55.163 --> 00:34:59.168
k was the conductivity,
the thing which told you how

00:34:59.168 --> 00:35:03.958
quickly the heat that penetrated
the walls of the little inner

00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:07.283
chamber.
So, that's okay,

00:35:07.283 --> 00:35:11.214
but what's this phi?
Well, the best way to get phi

00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:15.868
is just to draw that picture,
but if you want a formula for

00:35:15.868 --> 00:35:19.719
phi, phi will be,
well, I guess from the picture,

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:23.409
it's the arc tangent of omega,
k, divided by k,

00:35:23.409 --> 00:35:28.223
over one,
which I don't have to put

00:35:28.223 --> 00:35:30.148
in.
So, it's this number,

00:35:30.148 --> 00:35:34.000
phi, in reference to this
function.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.779
See, if the phi weren't there,
this would be cosine omega t,

00:35:39.779 --> 00:35:44.562
and we all know what that looks

00:35:44.562 --> 00:35:48.149
like.
The phi is called the phase lag

00:35:48.149 --> 00:35:51.637
or phase delay,
something like that,

00:35:51.637 --> 00:35:56.918
the phase lag of the function.
What does it represent?

00:35:56.918 --> 00:36:02.000
It represents,
let me draw you a picture.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.030
Let's draw the picture like
this.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.629
Here's cosine omega t.

00:36:08.629 --> 00:36:13.175
Now, regular cosine would look
sort of like that.

00:36:13.175 --> 00:36:18.857
But, I will indicate that the
angular frequency is not one by

00:36:18.857 --> 00:36:23.214
making my cosine squinchy up a
little too much.

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:28.518
Everybody can tell that that's
the cosine on a limp axis,

00:36:28.518 --> 00:36:31.643
something for Salvador Dali,
okay.

00:36:31.643 --> 00:36:36.000
So, there's cosine of
something.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.922
So, what was it?
Blue?

00:36:37.922 --> 00:36:41.126
I don't have blue.
Yes, I have blue.

00:36:41.126 --> 00:36:46.711
Okay, so now you will know what
I'm talking about because this

00:36:46.711 --> 00:36:52.021
looks just like the screen on
your computer when you put in

00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:56.598
the visual for this.
Frequency: your response order

00:36:56.598 --> 00:36:59.345
one.
So, this is cosine omega t.

00:36:59.345 --> 00:37:04.208
Now, how will cosine omega t

00:37:04.208 --> 00:37:07.127
minus phi look?

00:37:07.127 --> 00:37:10.678
Well, it'll be moved over.
Let's, for example,

00:37:10.678 --> 00:37:15.411
suppose phi were pi over two.
Now, where's pi over two on the

00:37:15.411 --> 00:37:18.488
picture?
Well, what I do is cosine omega

00:37:18.488 --> 00:37:22.590
t minus this.
I move it over by one,

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:26.850
so that this point becomes that
one, and it looks like,

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.321
the site will look like this.
In other words,

00:37:30.321 --> 00:37:33.872
I shove it over by,
so this is the point where

00:37:33.872 --> 00:37:39.000
omega t equals pi over two.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.093
It's not the value of t.
It's not the value of t.

00:37:43.093 --> 00:37:46.248
It's the value of omega t.

00:37:46.248 --> 00:37:50.341
And, when I do that,
then the blue curve has been

00:37:50.341 --> 00:37:55.542
shoved over one quarter of its
total cycle, and that turns it,

00:37:55.542 --> 00:38:01.000
of course, into the sine curve,
which I hope I can draw.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.680
So, this goes up to there,
and then, it's got to get back

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.605
through.
Let me stop there while I'm

00:38:08.605 --> 00:38:11.112
ahead.
So, this is sine omega t,

00:38:11.112 --> 00:38:13.953
the yellow thing,

00:38:13.953 --> 00:38:16.628
but that's also,
in another life,

00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:21.559
cosine of omega t minus pi over
two.

00:38:21.559 --> 00:38:26.489
The main thing is you don't
subtract, the pi over two is not

00:38:26.489 --> 00:38:32.268
being subtracted from the t.
It's being subtracted from the

00:38:32.268 --> 00:38:35.444
whole expression,
and this whole expression

00:38:35.444 --> 00:38:39.149
represents an angle,
which tells you where you are

00:38:39.149 --> 00:38:41.871
in the travel,
a long cosine to this.

00:38:41.871 --> 00:38:46.257
What this quantity gets to be
two pi, you're back where you

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:49.131
started.
That's not the distance on the

00:38:49.131 --> 00:38:51.777
t axis.
It's the angle through which

00:38:51.777 --> 00:38:54.046
you go through.
In other words,

00:38:54.046 --> 00:38:58.205
does number describes where you
are on the cosine cycle.

00:38:58.205 --> 00:39:01.986
It doesn't tell you,
it's not aiming at telling you

00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:04.632
exactly where you are on the t
axis.

00:39:04.632 --> 00:39:09.094
The response function looks
like one over the square root of

00:39:09.094 --> 00:39:13.555
one plus omega over k squared
times cosine omega t minus phi.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.068
And, I asked you on the problem
set, if k goes up,

00:39:24.068 --> 00:39:28.310
in other words,
if the conductivity rises,

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:34.413
if heat can get more rapidly
from the outside to the inside,

00:39:34.413 --> 00:39:38.137
for example,
how does that affect the

00:39:38.137 --> 00:39:42.750
amplitude?
This is the amplitude,

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:47.250
A, and the phase lag.
In other words,

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:51.375
how does this affect the
response?

00:39:51.375 --> 00:39:55.625
And now, you can see.
If k goes up,

00:39:55.625 --> 00:39:59.750
this fraction is becoming
smaller.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:05.500
That means the denominator is
becoming smaller,

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:12.000
and therefore,
the amplitude is going up.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.969
What's happening to the phase
lag?

00:40:14.969 --> 00:40:20.550
Well, the phase lag looks like
this: phi one omega over k.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.159
If k is going up,

00:40:23.159 --> 00:40:28.289
then the size of this side is
going down, and the angle is

00:40:28.289 --> 00:40:32.520
going down.
Now, that part is intuitive.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.391
I would have expected everybody
to get that.

00:40:36.391 --> 00:40:40.261
It's the heat gets in quickly,
more quickly,

00:40:40.261 --> 00:40:44.042
then the amplitude will match
more quickly.

00:40:44.042 --> 00:40:47.913
This will rise,
and get fairly close to one,

00:40:47.913 --> 00:40:53.133
in fact, and there should be
very little lag in the way the

00:40:53.133 --> 00:40:57.724
response follows input.
But how about the other one?

00:40:57.724 --> 00:41:01.595
Okay, I give you two minutes.
The other one,

00:41:01.595 --> 00:41:03.528
you will figure out yourself.
