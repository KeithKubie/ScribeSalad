00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.046
Mike, Alex, welcome
back to the forge.

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:07.132
You've had five days at
your home forge just to work

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:08.758
on your horseman's axes.

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:10.677
Mike, tell us about your weapon.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.679
It's a little rough
around the edges

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.014
but I think it
will perform well,

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.975
and I can't wait
to see it happen.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.143
WILL: Alex?

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.103
Everything just
fell into place

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.272
for me, even though I had to
make some last minute changes.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.690
And I'm looking forward
to seeing it tear

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.775
apart some ballistics dummies.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:26.985
All right, gentlemen.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.446
Up first, the kill test.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.531
Doug?

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.576
The horseman's ax is
actually two weapons in one.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.661
It's got an edge that
can lascerate and chop

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.914
and a spike that can
penetrate and crush bones.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:42.834
To see what kind of lethal
damage your ax will do,

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.378
I will take your horseman's
ax and deliver lethal blows

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.255
on this ballistics dummy.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.715
Mike, you're up first.
You ready?

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.008
MIKE: Yes, I am.

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.803
[music playing]

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:03.271
[whispering]

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.690
Well Mike, let's
talk about your weapon.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.109
Your edge over here is sharp.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.571
It lacerated deep into
the bowels right here.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.783
Your spike definitely caved
in all the way into the chest

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.409
and straight into the heart.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.661
The only issue we have
is that your handle is

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.371
a little bit on
the rounded side,

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.373
so there is a tendency
to slightly roll.

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:24.626
But overall, your
weapon will kill.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:25.794
Thank you.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:28.087
Alex, you're up next.
You ready?

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.130
Yes.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.923
DOUG: Let's do this.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.132
ALEX: All right.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:32.675
I'm pretty proud
of what I created.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.052
It's just a little
heavy, and that's

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.763
a bit of a concern going in.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:40.016
[music playing]

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.314
Sweet.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:55.406
Alex, your weapon here is a
little bit on the heavy side.

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:56.241
But you know what?

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.909
It is well balanced.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.704
The edge of your blade here
cut deep in the chest cavity

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:03.081
and it broke the bones.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.124
Your spike here,
right into the heart.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:08.837
And of course, on the swing, it
pretty much just disemboweled

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.588
the dummy right there.

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.049
Your weapon will kill.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:13.800
Yes.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.968
Thank you.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.636
DOUG: Next up is
the strength test.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.054
Jake?

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:19.973
Now we know ice can be
very brutal on an edge.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.641
So I'm going to take
your horseman's axes

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.852
and repeatedly strike into
these large blocks of ice

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.270
to see how well they hold up.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.813
Mike, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.398
Yes, I am.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.275
Going into the ice
block test, I'm

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:35.196
concerned there may be a fail
point in the head handle area.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:38.032
[music playing]

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:05.226
Well Mike, unfortunately
we had a serious failure

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:10.732
on your ax with this weld
point in the junction

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.401
of the belt hook.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.070
Alex, you still have
to pass this test.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.115
You ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:23.620
There's only one thing standing
between me and a $10,000 check,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.665
and it's really big,
and it's made of ice.

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:30.501
[music playing]

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:50.480
Alex, your horseman's ax
did quite a job on that ice.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.608
Everything's still tight, your
edge is still razor sharp.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:54.776
Thank you.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.196
So all in all,
very nicely done.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.615
Bladesmiths, our
weapons tests here

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.784
are designed to be
exceptionally brutal

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.578
in order to set your weapons
apart from one another.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.998
Mike, your blade did not
survive our strength test.

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:11.668
For that reason, I have to ask
you to please leave the forge.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.419
OK.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.672
I am disappointed
but when I go home,

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.091
I'm going to have
a smile on my face.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:22.011
Forged in fire has risen
me from the dead somehow.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.012
I will take this forward with
me for the rest of my life.
