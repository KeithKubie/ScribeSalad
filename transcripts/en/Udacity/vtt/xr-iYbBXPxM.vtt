00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.850
Howdy, Mark.
What you got going on there?

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt; Oh, you know,
just working Android Studio.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.510
Why are you wearing-
&gt;&gt; Android Studio?

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.110
Why you lily livered son of a droid.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.020
Real code cowboys build
from the command line.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.680
Just EMAX, ADB, and Gradle.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.840
That's all I need to
build an Android app.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.810
&gt;&gt; But there's code completion and
automatic refactoring.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.370
&gt;&gt; Who even knows what's going on
inside one of them fancy city IDEs?

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.810
Could be anything happening
in the build process.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.090
Not like good, old, honest,
hard working Gradle.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.170
&gt;&gt; Android Studio doesn't
even use an internal builder.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270
What did you say, now?

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.160
&gt;&gt; Android Studio delegates its
entire build process to Gradle.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.503
There's nothing magic happening.

00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:45.445
&gt;&gt; Whoa, that's super-cool.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.320
[COUGH] I mean.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.530
Really now?

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.170
So, you're saying that I
could use Android Studio for

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.400
all them fancy code-completion features,
and still wrangle my build process?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.160
See, look, I can pull up
my terminal Android Studio,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.078
run my Gradle build task, and see.

00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:04.950
&gt;&gt; Oh my.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.570
All them fancy features, and
it's just Gradle under the saddle.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.540
I reckon I got some thinking to do.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.490
Thanks for the tip, partner.
