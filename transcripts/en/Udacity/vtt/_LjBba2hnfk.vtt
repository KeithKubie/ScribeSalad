00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.510
&gt;&gt; Before we go any further,
just something you should know.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.441
In particle filtering,
the measurements are typically

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:11.250
written as the z's,
z sub t and not as y of t.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.648
It was just the way it was done.

00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:15.886
It has to do with whether
you're connected to vision or

00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:18.465
robotics in order it, so
that it aligns with various papers and

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:19.890
other formulations you'll see.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.617
We're going to start s,
showing z's in the slides to come.

00:00:23.617 --> 00:00:26.281
It also made it much easier to
borrow slides from other people,

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.551
because they were using the z's.

00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:28.532
All right.

00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:33.321
So the key to sort of particle
filtering is the following.

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:38.002
If we have a, a distribution and
here we have a nice little distribution,

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:42.003
which you see is, I don't know
what that distribution is, but

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.515
I know one thing, it's not Gaussian.

00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:46.897
Now somebody who's really
smart out there might say,

00:00:46.897 --> 00:00:49.088
well, it looks to me like
a mixture of Gaussians.

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:52.060
&gt;&gt; Well, it sort to looks to me
like a mixture of Gaussians.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.446
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in this particular case,
maybe it is.

00:00:54.446 --> 00:00:56.675
That's just for convenience of drawing.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:01:00.171
And in fact, there is a relationship
between mixtures of Gaussians and

00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:02.806
particle filters,
which we won't even talk about.

00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:03.809
But basically,

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.039
it is you have a bunch of things with
together represent your density.

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.546
In particle filters or
sample based methods,

00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:14.641
what you have is you have
a set of particles and

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:19.633
here the particles are drawn out
where you can see these particles.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:21.125
It says, Xt.

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:23.964
That means these happen to be
our particles at time t and

00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:27.186
there's n of them and, you know,
the bigger N is the better.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:29.547
And you'll notice it says,
weighted here in parentheses,

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:32.574
because sometimes they're weighted or
sometimes they all have the same weight.

00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:36.237
It, it, density is represented by
sort of where the particles are.

00:01:36.237 --> 00:01:39.128
So you see we have a nice high
density here, so we have lots and

00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:40.397
lots of particles there.

00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:41.157
Okay?

00:01:41.157 --> 00:01:44.669
Not so many particles here, not so
many here and lots of them there.

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:45.348
All right?

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:46.521
So that's where they are.

00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:49.399
And if they were weighted,
it would be as if you,

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.068
you can think of that as having
two particles in the same spot.

00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:57.195
If I double the weight, it'd be like
having two particles at the same spot.

00:01:57.195 --> 00:02:01.661
And now you can say that the probability
density that x is some value is

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:06.358
essentially the probability, if you
were to draw out a particle that you

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:10.987
would get a particle whose value is
really, really close to that spot.

00:02:10.987 --> 00:02:11.655
Okay?

00:02:11.655 --> 00:02:14.276
And that's what it
means to use samples or

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:16.977
particles to represent
a particular density.

00:02:16.977 --> 00:02:21.574
And if you're doing that,
then your overall goal is you want

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:26.339
sort of as n gets bigger, the idea
is that the probability of getting

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:30.936
a point from this distribution,
that's x is an element of xt

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:35.066
is a approximately what
the underlying probability was.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:39.437
And for tracking, the idea is given
everything we've observed so far.

00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:41.085
So what are our observations?

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:42.118
Remember, they're z's.

00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:47.988
So given everything that we've observed
so far, what's our belief about where x

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:53.105
is and we want to end up with a set of
particles that gives us that density.
