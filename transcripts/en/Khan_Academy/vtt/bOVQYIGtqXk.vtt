00:00:00.207 --> 00:00:02.171
- [Voiceover] In this
video I want to talk about

00:00:02.171 --> 00:00:05.088
the System of Jim Crow Segregation,

00:00:06.263 --> 00:00:08.685
which was common in the United States

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:09.935
from about 1877

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:14.057
to approximately 1954;

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:18.047
although, it goes a little
bit further than that.

00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:21.508
Now, you're probably familiar
with some of the aspects

00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:24.631
of Jim Crow Segregation from
the Civil Rights Movement.

00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:29.118
Jim Crow Segregation involved
the loss of voting rights

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:30.951
for African Americans,

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:37.119
as well as, separate
public accommodations,

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:43.453
and by public accommodations,

00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:48.493
I mean all sorts of public
spaces in American life.

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:53.287
So, this might be transportation,

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.221
separate areas in trains and buses,

00:00:58.443 --> 00:00:59.276
or hotels,

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:02.752
bathrooms,

00:01:05.538 --> 00:01:06.788
swimming pools,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.833
water fountains.

00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:14.211
So, these places in public life,

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.585
where African Americans were put

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:23.168
in the place of a
second-class citizenship.

00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:28.248
Where they could not experience the
full range of movement,

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.201
job benefits, protection of the law,

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:37.544
or really any of the aspects
of American citizenship,

00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:41.430
that are the benefits that
come with paying taxes

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.788
and abiding by the law.

00:01:42.788 --> 00:01:44.914
And during this period of Jim Crow

00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:47.831
this kind of segregation was legal,

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:51.463
this was not just in practice,

00:01:52.453 --> 00:01:54.370
but encoded in the law.

00:01:56.628 --> 00:01:59.326
So, where did this System
of Jim Crow come from?

00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:01.454
Well, let's start with the name Jim Crow.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:05.618
Jim Crow was not the name
of a specific person.

00:02:05.618 --> 00:02:09.785
Actually, Jim Crow was the
name of a stock character.

00:02:10.704 --> 00:02:15.577
A stock character is kind of
a basic well-known character,

00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:18.454
in usually a comedy, and we
still have stock characters

00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:20.376
in comedy today, in lots

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:22.423
of different forms of entertainment;

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:26.271
Think of, the absent-minded
professor, or more recently,

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.846
the manic-pixie-dream
girl, the girl who is going

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:33.777
to change your whole life
by being so off-the-wall.

00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:35.957
Well, Jim Crow was one of these characters

00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:40.124
in a form of entertainment
called the minstrel show.

00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:44.532
And the minstrel show was a very popular,

00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:49.008
kind of vaudeville-type live performance.

00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:51.797
The minstrel show was
actually very popular

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:54.915
in the north of the United States,

00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:56.924
places like New York City.

00:02:56.924 --> 00:03:01.091
And in the 1830s, 1840s, kind
of this antebellum period,

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:03.669
before the Civil War.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.397
So, this character of Jim Crow

00:03:05.397 --> 00:03:08.674
was supposed to be kind
of the stupid slave

00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:10.346
who lived on the plantation,

00:03:10.346 --> 00:03:13.509
and this character of Jim
Crow was almost always played

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.149
by a white man wearing
black makeup on his face.

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.064
So, it was not an actual
African American person,

00:03:20.064 --> 00:03:22.962
but rather a caricature of
an African American person

00:03:22.962 --> 00:03:26.090
by a white man who was
part of a minstrel troupe.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.721
And so the name, Jim Crow,
became kind of synonymous

00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:33.542
with African American's
and with enslaved people

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:36.036
in the early 19th century,

00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:39.271
the way that say Patty became synonymous

00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:41.250
with an Irish person.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.771
So, the term Jim Crow Law,
or the Jim Crow System

00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:48.303
means laws that were specifically aimed

00:03:48.303 --> 00:03:50.640
at African Americans.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.742
Alright, so that's the origin of the name,

00:03:52.742 --> 00:03:54.714
but where did they system come from?

00:03:54.714 --> 00:03:57.457
And for that we're gonna
have to do fairly deep dive

00:03:57.457 --> 00:03:59.098
into American history,

00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:01.274
and I won't be able to
go into everything here

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:05.441
but let's kind of look at this
from the thousand-foot view

00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:10.455
and get a sense of the
overall pattern of slavery,

00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:14.149
the Civil War, and race
relations after the Civil War

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:16.047
to see where Jim Crow starts.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:19.563
Now, I've been daring here
and done a vertical timeline.

00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:22.071
The first thing we have on here
is the end of the Civil War.

00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:24.896
Now, before the Civil War

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:27.625
in the southern part of the United States,

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.294
which I have outlined in red here,

00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:33.544
most of these states had legal slavery.

00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:36.582
And in these states,

00:04:38.773 --> 00:04:40.977
or the colonies that preceded them,

00:04:40.977 --> 00:04:42.644
starting about 1620,

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.857
they imported African
slaves to be unfree laborers

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:53.784
on cash-crop plantations,

00:04:53.784 --> 00:04:56.451
and these might include tobacco,

00:04:57.728 --> 00:04:58.561
or cotton.

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.606
And that system of slavery persisted

00:05:03.606 --> 00:05:07.538
until the balance of
power between the north,

00:05:07.538 --> 00:05:10.318
where slavery was largely illegal,

00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:13.435
and the South, where
slavery was the backbone

00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:15.657
of the economic and political system.

00:05:15.657 --> 00:05:18.722
Eventually it tore the country
apart into the Civil War.

00:05:18.722 --> 00:05:21.051
In 1863, Abraham Lincoln,

00:05:21.051 --> 00:05:23.586
the President of the United States issued

00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:26.086
the Emancipation Proclamation,

00:05:26.996 --> 00:05:29.663
saying that all enslaved people,

00:05:30.658 --> 00:05:32.754
and the states which were currently

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:35.004
in rebellion were now free.

00:05:35.998 --> 00:05:39.665
But it wasn't until the
end of the Civil War

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:44.093
that slavery's end was official everywhere

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:45.157
in the United States.

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:48.030
And the end of slavery
really posed a problem

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.842
for the states of the South.

00:05:49.842 --> 00:05:51.975
Now obviously this was a wonderful thing

00:05:51.975 --> 00:05:54.025
for people who had been enslaved,

00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:57.626
now they had full freedom
to move, and work,

00:05:57.626 --> 00:06:00.653
and marry whomever they
pleased, at least in theory.

00:06:00.653 --> 00:06:03.076
But it also meant that
the system of slavery,

00:06:03.076 --> 00:06:07.126
which had dominated the
politics, the economics,

00:06:07.126 --> 00:06:11.621
the social system of the
South for more than 200 years

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.772
was now over, and something
had to replace it.

00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:17.998
So, in the immediate
period after the Civil War

00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:18.831
the question is,

00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:21.664
what are race relations going
to look like in the South?

00:06:21.664 --> 00:06:24.878
How will whites and blacks
relate to each other

00:06:24.878 --> 00:06:26.652
without the system of slavery,

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.739
which has dominated the entire region

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:30.735
for more than 200 years?

00:06:30.735 --> 00:06:32.668
And we'll get into that in our next video.
