00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.670
Why water boils at 100 degrees
and methane at minus 161.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.180
Why blood is red and
grass is green.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.850
Why diamond is hard
and wax soft.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.470
Why glaciers flow and iron gets
hard when you hammer it.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.260
The answers to all these
problems have come from

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.560
structural analysis.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.750
That's how the Nobel Prize
winner Max Perutz summed up

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.830
x-ray crystallography.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.990
Never heard of it?

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.460
Don't worry.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.960
Not many people have.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.950
Yet it's arguably one of the
greatest innovations of the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.040
20th century.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.890
28 Nobel prizes have been
awarded to projects related to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.320
crystallography.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.230
And the very first of those
is where it all began.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.465
It's now 100 years since,
following early work by Max

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:52.900
Von Laue, the first structures
were determined by father and

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.180
son team, William and
Lawrence Bragg.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.280
In 1913, they fired a narrow
beam of x-rays at a humble

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.650
salt crystal and photographed
the diffraction pattern as the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.530
crystals split the beam
into many rays.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.500
Lawrence soon realised that this
pattern held the clues to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.960
the atomic structure of
the crystal itself.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.330
The equation he developed,
Bragg's law, made it possible

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.990
to work out how the spots in
the diffraction pattern are

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140
related to the specific
arrangement of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.820
atoms in the crystal.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.973
Two years on, and the Braggs
were awarded the Nobel Prize.

00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:30.190
Impressive stuff.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.430
Not only that, the Braggs
mentored a dream team of

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.270
crystallographers who went on to
work out the structures of

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.440
a huge range of molecules.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.190
From Kathleen Lonsdale, JD
Bernal, Dorothy Hodgkin, to

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.980
David Phillips, John Kendrew,
and Max Perutz.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.030
Remember him?

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.520
Plus Rosalind Franklin and
others even helped map the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.260
structure of DNA, probably the
most famous result of x-ray

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.490
crystallography.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.670
Today, the work hasn't
stopped.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.350
Crystallography remains the
foremost technique for working

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.840
out the atomic structures of
almost anything, which is very

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.535
useful for finding out why
things behave the way they do.

00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:09.330
From the metallic structure of
the blades of a jet turbine to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.660
the immune system fighting
off viruses.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.930
Turns out Max was right.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.900
Modern crystallographers are
doing exactly the same thing

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.140
as the Braggs, just at a
larger scale with more

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.340
sophisticated mathematical
methods and

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.040
more impressive machines.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.045
Crystallography is even reaching
beyond our planet.

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:32.170
The Curiosity Rover is now
performing x-ray diffraction

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.110
analysis of the soil on Mars.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.650
But there's plenty
of unfinished

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.620
business back on Earth.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.745
There are still many thousands
of complex molecules to look

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.490
at, and a lot more questions
to answer.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:03:05.067
