GUY WINCH: Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.480
I'm Guy Winch.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.520
I'm here to speak to you about
emotional first aid.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.140
And so first of all, thank
you for having me back.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.220
It's great to be back
here at Google.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.190
So let's get going.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.160
I'm going to assume that within
the past few weeks some

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.120
of you have had a
cut or a scrape.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.340
And you've used antibacterial
ointment, or

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.510
you've used a Band-Aid.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.530
And some of you might have had
a cold and rested up in bed.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.600
And some of you might have
sprained a muscle

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.200
and used an ice pack.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.940
And I say that because we get
these kinds of physical

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.090
injuries all the time in life.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.880
And when we do, we know exactly
how to treat them.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.160
We know exactly how to ease
our aches and pains.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.340
And we know exactly what steps
to take to prevent them from

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.650
getting worse.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.620
Well, we sustain psychological
injuries all the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.050
time in life as well.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.790
But when we do, we do not
know how to treat them.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.960
We do not know how to ease
our aches and pains.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.700
And we do not know what steps
we need to take to make sure

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.300
they don't get worse.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.540
And that's what we're going
to discuss today.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.870
We're going to talk about seven
common psychological

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.920
injuries that we encounter
in daily life--

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.910
failure, rejection, guilt,
loneliness, brooding and

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.800
rumination, loss and trauma, and
bouts of low self-esteem.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.730
I do hope we'll have time
to get to all of them.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.700
We will also talk about the
surprising ways in which these

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.920
things impact us.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.300
Because they do it in ways
which are unexpected.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.170
We'll also look at
the science.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.910
Because for scientists to study
these things, they have

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.670
to recreate these human
experiences, in

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.070
essence, in their lab.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.930
You can't grow rejection
in a Petri dish.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.540
And so that's a difficult
thing to do.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.310
We'll look at how they do it.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.690
And I'll give you a
hint right now.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.660
It usually involves lying
through their teeth to the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.199
poor subjects who sign up for
these experiments without a

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.720
clue about what they're getting
themselves into.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.830
And lastly, we'll look at why
and how we should apply

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.290
emotional first aid to
these kinds of common

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.310
psychological injuries.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.770
And we'll look at a few
examples of how we can

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.090
actually do it.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.160
Now I want to get back for a
moment to the comparison

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.000
between how we think in general
of physical injuries

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.470
versus how we think of
psychological injuries.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.930
Because it's so obvious to us
that we need to monitor our

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.040
physical health.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.650
We need to monitor our bodies.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.540
That's very, very clear to us.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.660
But it's not clear to us at that
we need to monitor our

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.180
psychological health.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.530
And when we are riding a bicycle
or our skateboard and

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.700
we wipe out, the first thing
we'd think to do is to check

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.660
ourselves for injury.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.050
But when we have a really bad
rejection or a really bad

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.140
failure, we don't think to check
ourselves for any kind

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.890
of injuries.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.420
We just go on.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.810
And the other thing is that we
know what kind of injuries

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.220
require treatments, when they're
physical injuries, so

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.080
they don't get worse.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.960
We know that if we don't--
we know that

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.400
a cut can get infected.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.490
We know a cold can turn
into a pneumonia.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.320
So we know we need to
attend to that.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.030
We don't know anything about
what psychological injuries

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.460
can get worse or how
they can get worse.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.590
And lastly, when it comes to the
basic physical injuries we

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.070
sustain in daily life, we
can pretty much treat

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.120
all of them at home.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.130
We have our medicine
cabinets with our

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.900
pills and our ointments.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.890
And we can pretty much do
all of that at home.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.190
And when it comes to
psychological injuries, as I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.920
say, we don't know how
to treat diddly.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.890
But that means we really
have no clue

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.060
about what we're doing.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.650
And it isn't just our physical
bodies that we're

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.640
prioritizing.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.070
It's even our teeth, if you
really think about it.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.180
Because look, we know
our teeth need

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.220
constant care, right?

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.940
We know that.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.810
We brush and we floss.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.380
And we do that every
single day.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.060
And not only that, if we have
a pain in the tooth, we

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.470
immediately take action.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.260
We go to the dentist because we
know that cavity can turn

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.430
into a root canal.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.620
So we know to do it.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.680
And we even teach our
children to brush

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.420
their teeth every day.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.339
Three-year-olds know to brush
their teeth every day.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.550
So if you really think about it,
we put more care into our

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.760
teeth than we do our
psychological health.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.970
And I'm sorry, but it
really irritates me

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.810
that that's the case.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.320
And I'm not suggesting you
neglect your teeth.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.480
That's not my point.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.720
And I'm not resentful.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.850
I don't hate the American
Dental Association.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.360
I think teeth are great.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.050
I have teeth.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.480
I'm all for teeth.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.680
What I'm saying is that
there is a strange

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.550
favoritism that we have.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.380
Whereas, our physical health
and our teeth are like the

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.810
step-sisters in the Cinderella
story that get all the love,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.360
and all the care, and
all the affection.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.790
And our poor psychological
health is as ignored and as

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.150
marginalized and as neglected
as Cinderella, left to sweep

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.890
the floor with the mice
and the birds.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.020
That's Freud, you see.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.020
Because it's very
hard to depict

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.560
psychological health in a picture.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.910
So I use-- and you can
see the cigar.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.470
That's the hint.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.820
All right, so anyway--

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.800
so my point is that that fairy
tale is not going well.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.530
But here's the good news--

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.440
happy ending.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.780
Here's your fairy godmother.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.400
And here's your Prince
Charming--

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.450
I don't mean the picture
of me in the flap.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.700
But here's your Prince
Charming.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.950
Because what you can do is
you can start to help the

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.300
psychological health catch up
a little bit and help take

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.600
care of it.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.490
So look, as I said,
psychological injuries impact

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.120
us and in more ways than we
realize, in surprising ways.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.360
So I want to show you how.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.640
And I'm going to start
with a really

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.530
common injury, failure--

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.410
something we certainly all do.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.520
And when I tell people, oh,
that's going to surprise you.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.680
They're like, no, it's not.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.440
I know what happens
to me when I fail.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.440
I fail, and my ego gets bruised
and I get demoralized.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.900
And my motivation goes.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.250
And all of that is true.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.130
But failure also impacts
us in ways in

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.820
which we are not aware.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.970
And here's an example of
a study people did.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.550
They took people to a field
with a football post.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.870
And they had them kick an
American football over the

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.290
post 10 times.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.370
And it was 10 yards away.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.700
It was an unmarked field, but
it was 10 yards away.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.830
And then they had them, when
they were done, say, right.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.740
Well, how far and how high
is that goal post?

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.290
And everyone wrote down
how far and how high

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.330
that goal post was.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.910
But then when they looked at the
results, they divided them

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.820
into people who succeeded and
people who failed at the toss.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.770
And the people who failed at
kicking the football over the

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.560
goal post estimated it to be
much further and much higher

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.180
than the people who succeeded.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.880
Now they're all standing
on the same field.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.250
It's not an eyesight issue.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.280
They're looking at
the same thing.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.110
But that's what failure
does to us.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.270
It can distort our perceptions,
our very

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.020
perceptions, of the goals we
have, so that they seem to us

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.570
to be further away and
further out of reach.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.410
And that is an unconscious
thing.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.990
That's an unconscious way
in which that happens.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.210
But failure can also impact
us in other ways.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.230
It can also change
our perceptions

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.390
of our actual abilities.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.120
I'm going to give you one
other example of an

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.830
experiment.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.850
This one was done quite
a few years ago.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.770
And they were curious about how
people respond to failure.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.020
But they did the experiment
with dogs.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.010
Some of you might have
heard of it.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.960
It's not a new one.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.240
They put dogs in a cage with
a low barrier in the cage.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.160
And one part of the cage
was wired up for

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.290
an electrical shock.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.990
And they say it's an electrical
shock, not a

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.200
painful one for the dogs,
though whether they

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.020
interviewed the dogs and asked
them if that was uncomfortable

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.680
or painful, I'm not sure.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.790
But so they put the dog in
that part of the cage.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.760
They zap it.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.990
The dog jumps over the
barrier into the

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.410
safe part of the cage.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.570
Part one done.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.940
Part two, they put the
dog back in the cage.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.350
But this time they put
a harness on the dog.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.740
They tether the dog so
the dog can't move.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.700
Zap the cage.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.010
Dog tries to jump over
the barrier--

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.430
can't, whimpers.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.560
Done with part two.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.000
Part three, remove
the harness.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.570
And then they zap
the cage again.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.990
And the dogs were free to
jump over the barrier.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.100
And an alarming number of these
dogs didn't jump over

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.500
the barrier.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.510
They just stood there
and whimpered.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.650
Because they actually thought,
we're incapable, even though

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.500
they weren't tethered.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.600
They were free.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.890
And so the scientists were like,
wow, we wonder if it

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.409
works that way with people.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:45.800
But it turns out, ethical
committees frown upon putting

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.220
people in cages and
electrocuting them.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.390
So they did it differently.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.590
What they did was they
gave people a test.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.370
And they said, oh, this test
actually measures your

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.720
intelligence.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.550
But what they did is half
the people got a

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.170
test that was passable.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.840
And half people got the test
that was impossible.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.750
They were going to fail.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.700
It couldn't pass this test.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.740
And then they gave them another
version of the test

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.770
after that.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.300
And this version, everyone
could pass.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.690
And again, an alarming number
of the people who are given

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.480
the impossible test and failed
it, failed the one they should

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.380
and could have passed.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.690
Because they believed
that their abilities

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.240
weren't up to the task.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.250
And it turns out that when you
believe your abilities are not

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.810
up to the task, you
can't use them.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.810
It's as if you don't
have them.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.940
And so what happened was that
the failure distorted their

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.440
perceptions of the basic
fundamental abilities.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.680
And that's what failure
can do to us.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.480
It can take one experience, one
small experience, and turn

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.460
it into something much bigger
that impacts our lives going

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.840
forward in ways in which
we are unaware.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.110
And that's why I consider
failures to be emotional chest

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.360
colds that become psychological
pneumonias, or

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.790
can become psychological
pneumonias.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.960
And I want you to think about
times in your life where you

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.420
were convinced you couldn't
succeed at something and maybe

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.530
you need to rethink it.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.280
Because maybe you were being
influenced in ways in which

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.610
you were not aware.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.870
Let's look at another example,
brooding and ruminating.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.010
So it's natural to reflect
on painful experiences

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.150
when we have them.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.530
It's something we all do.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.940
Experiences or worries,
we tend to do it.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.735
If our boss yells at
us in a meeting--

00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:29.510
don't think that happens much at
Google-- but let's say your

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.230
boss yells at you in a meeting
and embarrasses you in front

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.080
of your colleagues.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.680
Then you might stew about it.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.970
And you might think about it.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.940
And you might talk to this
colleague about it.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.130
And you talk to that
colleague about it.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.890
And then you go home and you
call your friends and you

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:43.860
think about it.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.160
And you think about it at night
before you go to bed.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.710
And you think about
it the next day.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.230
And you think about it
over the weekend.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.800
And then you start to involve
fantasy in the thoughts.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.450
So the fantasy--

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.950
where you have the heroic
fantasy, where you envision

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.890
the boss yelling at you.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.440
But then you stand
up to the boss.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.320
And everyone applauds, and
it's happy ending.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:05.060
And then you have this, the
victim fantasy, where boss

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:05.900
yells at you again.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.060
And you just break into tears.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.670
And the boss realizes how harsh
and unreasonable they

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.580
are, and they apologize.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:10.910
And they hug.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.470
And it's all very nice.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.630
And then you have the tragic
version, where you yell back.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.730
And you end up homeless on the
streets, whatever it is.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.060
But you replay it over and
over and over again.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.000
And you might think, so fine.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.830
I'm processing.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.250
I'm processing my feelings,
if that's how I'm feeling.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.140
I'm talking about it
to friends and

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.560
expressing my feelings.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.730
I'm processing them.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.350
Surely as a psychologist, I
should be very pleased when

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.750
people are processing
their feelings.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.850
Surely I should be thrilled.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.170
Well no, I'm not thrilled.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.510
This is not my thrilled face.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.990
And I'm not thrilled because
there are differences in

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.920
self-reflection.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.440
There is adaptive
self-reflection.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.170
And there is maladaptive
self-reflection.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.620
So let's look at the
differences.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.460
When you're self-reflecting in
a way that is adaptive, what

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.390
you're doing is you are easing
your emotional distress.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.170
The whole idea of adaptive
self-reflection is that it

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.970
lowers the potency of the event,
so that when you think

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.730
about it afterwards, it
evokes less emotion.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.200
It's less distressing.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.660
And that happens because by
thinking it through, you're

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.380
reaching new insights.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.180
You're seeing things from
a fresh perspective.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.450
You're learning something.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.800
You're remembering for example,
that huh, in that

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.390
meeting, I actually disagreed
with the boss before

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.260
he yelled at me.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.920
And no one really does disagree
with that boss.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.900
So I stepped on the
boss' toes.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.250
Then the boss stepped
on my toes.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.790
Um, I understand what I
shouldn't do in the future.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.930
Or you talk to other people and
hear, yeah, that person

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.650
has an anger management issue.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.080
You can decide maybe I want to
speak to Human Resources and

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.170
try and transfer.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.470
The idea is, it clarifies
actions that you can take to

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.890
fix your situation.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.500
So having those insights and
having the idea of what you

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.860
need to do differently, it all
adds up to a certain release

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.630
that you feel.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.010
And it helps you move on.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.180
And you can move on.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.440
And it's less troubling.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.420
But that's when the
self-reflection is adaptive.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.250
When it's maladaptive, what it
does is it just increases our

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.210
emotional distress.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.150
That's what it does.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.700
And the thing is that we used
to think that oh, if you're

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.440
just getting your anger out--

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.650
if you're just expressing
it-- it's a release.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.150
There's a stereotype
of a psychologist.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.470
They always say, punch a pillow,
when you're angry.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.100
Have you heard the
punch-the-pillow theory?

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:21.170
So there was this movie years
ago with Billy Crystal and

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.345
Robert De Niro called, "Analyze
This." Have you heard

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:24.050
of this film?

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.320
And Billy Crystal plays
a therapist.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.330
And Robert De Niro is a patient
who has anger issues.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.450
And he's in the mob.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.610
So Billy Crystal says, well, if
you're angry, why don't you

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.590
punch the pillow?

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.270
And Robert De Niro goes
ah, good idea.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.160
And he takes his gun and he
shoots the pillow three times.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.260
And Billy Crystal is alarmed.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.740
And he goes, feel better?

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.570
And Robert De Niro goes,
yeah, yeah, I do.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:44.420
But Hollywood--

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.090
because actually that's
not what happens.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.770
When we do studies with a pillow
punching, and we have

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.590
some people feel annoyed
and think of a

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.110
person and punch a pillow.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.620
And other people feel annoyed
and think of the person and

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.760
not punch a pillow, the people
who punch the pillow are

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.090
angrier afterwards.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.700
They're more aggressive
afterwards.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.670
And they're more likely to take
out their aggression on

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.120
innocent people, than the people
who just thought about

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.930
it but didn't punch
the pillow.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.520
So this catharsis theory
doesn't work.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.210
So just stewing doesn't
help us.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.180
And in fact, it makes the
urge to keep thinking

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.710
about it more potent.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.890
The idea will flash into your
head more often and more

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.880
frequently and more
powerfully.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.950
And the other thing is that
when we're doing so much

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.750
stewing and so little
doing, it actually

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.450
makes us feel passive.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.960
And it makes us start to have
problems with problem solving.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.740
And here's another slightly
shocking example.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.500
They did a study in which they
looked at women who found a

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.160
lump in their breast.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.240
How long does it take them to
call their doctor to make an

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.940
appointment?

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.800
And they looked at that.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.650
And they divided the women
into two groups--

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.790
women who tend to ruminate
and women who

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.520
don't tend to ruminate.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.450
And the women who tended to
ruminate waited on average two

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.910
months longer to make an
appointment with their doctor,

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.560
which is a critical amount of
time when you find a lump in

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.380
your breast.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.770
And that is because they were
probably so worried about it

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.730
and looking it up and discussing
it with people.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.980
And what if this and
what if that?

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.280
But they weren't acting.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.970
And so that's what can happen.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.830
So when we brood and when
we ruminate, we

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.070
get very, very passive.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.820
We see the world in
negative times.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.930
So it puts us more at
risk for depression.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.240
It puts us more at risk for
alcoholism, because we get

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.110
angry all the time.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.620
Because we're stirring
ourselves up.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.710
We have to take the edge off
at the end of the day.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.660
It puts us at risk for eating
disorders, because we want to

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.570
manage our feelings with food.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.560
And also we're releasing so many
stress hormones into our

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.670
bloodstream, it puts us
at higher risk for

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.420
cardiovascular disease.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.080
So that's all of the things
that rumination does.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.190
And so to me, ruminate and
brooding is basically like

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.270
picking at emotional scabs.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.540
You're opening the wound.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.020
You're not letting it heal.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.960
You're not doing
something good.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.240
All right, let's look at
one other example.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.970
And one of the injuries I get
asked about a lot is guilt.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.260
And not just by my mother.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.320
So we all experience
guilt quite a bit.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.400
Now how much guilt
do we experience?

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.630
Well, in short bursts
of guilt, like oh, I

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.790
have to call her.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.650
Oh, it's an hour now.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.710
I still haven't called.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.620
But short bursts like that-- we
can have 2 and 1/2 hours a

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.020
day of mild guilt, five hours
a week of moderate guilt and

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.010
three and a half hours a
month of severe guilt.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.430
So that's a lot of guilt.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.290
Except that guilt is not
necessarily a bad thing.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.490
Because it does something
really important.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.410
It alerts us.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.700
It gives us a warning as to
when we might have done or

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.460
might intend to do something
that can cause

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.310
harm to another person.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.680
And that allows us to not do the
thing or to apologize if

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.760
you've done the thing or
to atone for it in

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.630
some kind of way.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.470
So guilt is a great thing
because it really preserves

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.670
our relationships.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.660
It's a relationship protector.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.380
And so that's a good thing,
except that when your guilt is

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.450
unresolved.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.110
When it's excessive, that little
flashing signal in your

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.630
brain like, oh, call your
mother, doesn't shut off.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.089
It just keeps going and going.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.079
And that can be an extremely
distracting thing.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.700
It's a huge mental drain.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.800
It impairs their ability to
focus and to concentrate.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.160
But it also does a bunch
of things of which

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.599
we are often unaware--

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.700
sometimes aware, but
sometimes unaware.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.910
Because it turns out our
unconscious minds make

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.290
decisions about how it's going
to manage guilt without us.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.285
Like the committee met without
us and then decided oh, we're

00:17:29.285 --> 00:17:30.060
going to do this.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.580
And so what does our unconscious
mind tend to do?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.260
It prevents us from
enjoying life.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.870
And in one experiment,
college students were

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.080
made to feel guilty.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.780
And the typical scenario with
guilt is they play this game

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.030
in which they tell them, oh,
the way you played the game

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.900
you deprived your
other student--

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.570
who's fictitious and doesn't
exist-- but you deprived the

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.960
other student of lottery
tickets.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.390
Eh, two lottery tickets--

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.600
big whoop, not a big thing
to feel guilty about.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.140
But then they offer them, now
you have payment for the

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:57.880
experiment.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.800
You can choose.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.020
And for people who weren't
made to feel guilty chose

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.850
movie tickets and
DVDs and CDs.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.750
And the students who are made
to feel guilty by, again,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.830
depriving someone they didn't
know of two lottery tickets,

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.090
what did they chose?

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.380
Notebooks and pans and folders
and fun, fun stuff.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.150
And so that's guilt what does.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.870
It prevents us from
enjoying life.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.140
But it does more than that.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.310
It actually makes us adopt
self-punishment.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.120
In another version of that
experiment, they wanted to see

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.840
whether students who were made
to feel guilty, again with a

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.240
lottery ticket scenario, whether
they would be willing

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.480
to give themselves an electrical
shock, which they

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.860
claimed again was uncomfortable
not painful.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.220
And they set them up with this
box where they could put their

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.530
hand in the box and flip the
switch, if they were willing

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.370
to do that.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.390
And then they pointed to some
research assistant sitting

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.270
there and going, that's the
guy that didn't get the

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.610
lottery ticket.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.430
And zap-- everyone was
zapping themselves.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.720
Now psychologists
have a heart.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.170
So it actually wasn't rigged
to give them a zap.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.990
They just wanted to see if
they'd pressed the button.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.110
There was no benefit from
actually giving them an

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.120
electrical shock.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.420
So that was the test.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.820
But so many of them were like,
oh, yeah, I'll zap myself for

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.560
lottery tickets for
goodness sakes--

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.560
for someone they didn't know.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.860
So it can make us adopt
self-punishment.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.230
And it actually has a
name in psychology.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.260
It is called the Dobby Effect.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.930
Who know why?

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:19.623
Really?

00:19:19.623 --> 00:19:21.530
"Harry Potter", thank
you so much.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.510
The elf in "Harry Potter" that
smacks his head against the

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.030
wall because Dobby's
a bad elf.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.300
That's what it's named after,
literally the fictitious elf.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.740
And the other thing that guilt
does is that it makes us

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.490
really try and avoid the people
or the situation or any

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.520
reminders of the things
that we did.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.200
So if we did something and Aunt
Flossie is very upset

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.660
with us, we don't really want
meet with Aunt Flossie and

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.310
with Uncle Harry either
because he's related.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.930
And we stay away a little bit.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:55.430
And it happened in that
part of town.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.440
So we're going to stay away
from that part of town.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.440
And she used to live
in Philly.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.710
And we don't go to
Philly anymore.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.640
And we'll slowly really try
and withdraw and avoid.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.440
And it can really hamper
our relationships.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.330
And so what happens, guilt is so
toxic to us and so toxic to

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.830
our relationships, I consider
it the poison in our system.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.200
Now let's get to the most common
psychological injury we

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.500
all experience, and
that is rejection.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.720
Rejections are an extremely
regular part of life, if you

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.890
think about it, because
we get turned down

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.270
by potential dates.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.390
We get turned down by
potential employers.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.940
Our partners rebuff our
sexual advances.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.070
Our friends go to lunch
without us.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.930
Our colleagues don't tell us
about the birthday party.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.120
Our neighbors give us
the cold shoulder.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.320
Our parents don't approve
of our lifestyles.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.600
Our social media contacts don't
post our posts, and they

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.560
don't retweet our tweets.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.860
There are just so many ways in
which we can get rejected.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.940
But all of them have one thing
in common, and that is they

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.320
really, really hurt.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.710
And that's the thing that
fascinated scientists at the

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.640
beginning when it came
to rejection.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.040
Why do they hurt so much?

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.570
Why does it hurt so much?

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.970
So they wanted to study it.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.100
The thing is, you have to be
able to catch rejection in

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.030
action, if you want
to study it.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.620
You can't just take your
research assistant to a local

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.830
singles bar and go, oh, look,
that dude just got shot down.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.270
Quick give them the
questionnaire.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.540
That's not going to work.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.830
So you have to recreate it
in some kind of way.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.690
So how do you recreate it?

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.170
So here's what they did.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:34.390
Imagine that you signed up for
a psychological experiment--

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.250
which none of you are ever going
to do after this talk.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.210
But just imagine you signed
up an experiment.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.670
And you're sitting in
the waiting room.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.650
And there are two other people
in the waiting room.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.870
And there's a ball
on the table.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.300
And one of them takes the ball
and goes, eh, and throws it to

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.310
the other person.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.310
And the other person catches
it and goes, eh, and

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.320
throws it to you.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:51.980
And you catch it.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.490
And you don't have to go, eh.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:54.500
I don't know why I said that.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.660
And you catch it.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.040
And you throw it back to the
first person, who then goes,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.790
hmm, throws it to the second.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.200
And the second doesn't throw it
to you, throws it back to

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.520
the first person, who then also
doesn't throw it to you,

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.670
throws it to the
second person.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.670
And now they are tossing the
ball and you're excluded.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.555
And then the researcher shows
up and goes, oh, we've ready

00:22:13.555 --> 00:22:15.700
for you now, and takes you
into the other room.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.430
Now how would that
make you feel?

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.320
Now most people think, two
strangers in a waiting room

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.780
didn't toss me a ball,
big whoop.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.720
I don't care.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.120
But it turns out we
care quite a bit.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.260
Because this is a paradigm that
has been used dozens and

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.710
dozens of times.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.520
And everyone who goes through it
reports feeling significant

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.960
emotional pain.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.700
And not just emotional pain,
it hurts people's moods.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.670
It makes them angry.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.420
It hurts their self-esteem.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.760
And this is about as mild
as rejection gets.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.060
And so the experimenters were
really, really curious about--

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.990
wow, so this is a very
kind of potent thing.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.970
I mean, let's try something.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:59.840
What if--

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.760
does it depend on who
the people are?

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.010
So they said, let's run
the experiment again.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.520
And what if we told them that
the people who rejected them

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.050
were people they despise.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.630
So they run the experiment
again.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.298
And they take people into the
other room, and they go, you

00:23:11.298 --> 00:23:15.260
know, those two people in the
waiting room are here for some

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.220
kind of social science
experiment.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.590
They are members of the Ku
Klux Klan, KKK members.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.610
Now does it hurt?

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.080
And they're all like,
yeah, still hurts.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.070
And scientists were like,
wow, that's amazing.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.750
So let's try something
even more radical.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.830
So they ran it again.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.150
They took them in and they go,
OK, we're coming clean.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.480
Those are research assistants.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.140
It wasn't real.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.650
The whole thing was rigged.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.540
Now does it hurt?

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.898
And people were like, yeah,
it still hurts.

00:23:39.898 --> 00:23:41.730
[LAUGHING]

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.710
So scientists were like, what is
going on in our brain here

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.600
with this rejection thing?

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.540
Like how come it's
so unreasonable?

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.190
I mean, we're telling people
it wasn't real, and they're

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.290
still hurting.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.200
So they put people in a
functional MRI machine.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.560
They want to see literally what
happens in the brain.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.440
And what they found was
shocking to them.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.240
Because what they saw was the
same pathways in the brain

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.320
light up when we get rejected as
light up when we experience

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.790
physical pain.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.380
They were literally
overlapping.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.970
The rejection pathways were
piggybacking on physical pain

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.830
pathways in the brain.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.230
And so that was really
shocking to them.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.540
And then the scientists were
like maybe we don't have to do

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.590
many experiments.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.555
Maybe we'll just give
people Tylenol.

00:24:23.555 --> 00:24:24.850
And so they did.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.530
They ran the experiments
again.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.290
And they gave half the group
of people Tylenol.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:32.550
And the people who got Tylenol
reported less emotional pain.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.930
Because again, these are
physical pain pathways that

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.820
are getting activated.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.540
So acetaminophen, a pain
reliever, was enough to-- now,

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.170
I'm not suggesting that
you go out on our next

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.070
date packing Tylenol.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.000
Because I'm--

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.600
it's a little pessimistic,
if you ask me.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.650
And I'm not sure that's
the best thing.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.680
But they were really
curious about that.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.660
So why is that?

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.130
Why are we wired to experience
rejection so severely?

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.540
Why?

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.230
And the answer is because of
our evolutionary past.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.610
Because we grew up in tribes.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.390
We evolved in tribes.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.220
And we couldn't survive
outside them.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.480
As hunter-gatherers, we
needed our tribe.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.540
Being ostracized from your tribe
was a death sentence.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.320
So we evolved an early
warning mechanism.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.090
We evolved a way to alert us
when we were at risk of being

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.660
ostracized from our tribe.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.020
And that was rejection.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.720
So people who experience
rejection as more painful were

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.270
more likely to take corrective
action, were more likely to

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.390
stay in the tribe, were
more likely to

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:36.610
pass along their genes.

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.000
And people who didn't were
more likely to be

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.110
ousted from the tribe.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.980
And they didn't live to pass
along their genes.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.050
That's why that mechanism
evolved.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.900
But it also explains why we
feel things so harshly.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.970
And today we don't live in small
pockets of humanity.

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.200
We live in rather large
pockets of humanity.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.490
So the opportunities for
rejection are innumerable.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.890
And that's why I consider
rejection to be the cuts and

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.060
scrapes of daily life.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.860
Now I hope you're beginning to
realize that these simple

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.380
psychological injuries
are not so simple.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.010
That they really do impact us
in very significant ways.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.660
That they can damage our
emotions and our mood and

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.170
perceptions and our thinking
and our cognition and our

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.880
behavior and our mental health
and our emotional well-being

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.060
and even our physical health.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:30.290
Because I gave you the example
of brooding and ruminating.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.750
But let me give you one other
example, because there's one

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.630
more psychological injury that's
even more damaging to

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.350
our physical health
than brooding.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.550
And that one is loneliness.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.160
40% percent of adults
will experience

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.890
loneliness in their lifetime.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.120
We can experience that when we
move away to college, when we

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.760
move to a new town, a new state,
or a new country, when

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.680
we get divorced, when our
children grow up and leave the

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.080
nest, when we retire and we stop
seeing our colleagues.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.030
Loneliness is something
we can all experience.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.470
And it damages us
psychologically.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.520
But physically what it does
to us is quite alarming.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.010
Because, yes, like rumination,
it does put us at risk for

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.870
cardiovascular disease
and for depression.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.690
But it also puts it at risk
for Alzheimer's disease.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.580
And it also suppresses
our immune systems.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.520
They did one study in which
they gave college

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.130
freshman the flu shot.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.560
And they just gave them
questionnaires about

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.390
loneliness.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.120
And the students who were
lonely, who reported feeling

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.310
really lonely, had a poorer
response to a flu shot than

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.100
the students who didn't.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.340
It really impacts our
immune system.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.460
And so scientists have concluded
that the risk

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.330
factors posed by loneliness
are actually equal to the

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.130
health risk factors posed
by cigarette smoking.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.640
Because it can shave--

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.120
chronic loneliness, yes, can
shave years off our lives.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.540
Now cigarette packs come with
warnings from the Surgeon

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.180
General-- this is a dangerous,
dangerous thing.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.830
But we don't have warnings
about loneliness.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.540
We don't know if we're
inhaling two packs of

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.780
loneliness a day that it's
going to kill us at

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.350
the end of the story.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.040
And that is an important
thing.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.990
The other thing that loneliness
does is that it

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.480
really makes us isolated.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.860
It keeps us to ourselves.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.730
So our whole relationship skills
and our social skills

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.660
and our ability to relate
and to get into deep

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.460
relationships, they
atrophy over time.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.820
And they get weaker.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.410
And that's why I consider
loneliness to be some form of

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.840
relationship muscle weakness.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.810
We're not used to using
those muscles.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.900
And a lot of times when
somebody's been, let's say,

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.290
single and then they start
dating again, they come out

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.470
and either they're way too
intense or they're too

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.910
suspicious because their
muscles are not quite

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.040
regulated well.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.830
Unfortunately, they
don't conclude, I

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.050
need to work on this.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.420
They conclude, you see,
I'm unlovable.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.290
So let me just retreat again.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.500
So loneliness is very
self-reinforcing.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.680
And we really, really need
to find ways to treat it.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.720
So as I said, our physical
health is certainly very much

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.930
impacted by these

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.220
psychological injuries as well.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.020
So now I hope you can see why
I was so upset earlier about

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.900
why I'm so upset that these
things get ignored, that we

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.530
ignore the psychological
injuries.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.670
Because look at what
they do to us.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.520
They have such a huge
impact on our lives.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.050
So now let's look at what
we can do about them.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.540
And so since we were talking
about rejection,

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.590
let's start with that.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:18.935
I mean, we have time for
a couple of examples.

00:29:18.935 --> 00:29:20.510
But let's start with
rejection.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.030
Now remember I said that when
it comes to psychological

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:26.040
injuries, we sometimes don't
even realize we're injured.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.890
Eh, not the case
with rejection.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:30.280
We know that pretty much
very, very well.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.980
Because we have a strong
response to rejection.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.900
So let's look at how people

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.980
typically respond to rejection.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.540
So one of the first things that
happens is people can get

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.170
slightly angry or aggressive.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:44.930
"Fatal Attraction", anyone?

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:45.400
I don't know.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.500
You know the movie?

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.500
She boiled the bunny, and then
she came at him with a knife.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.660
So you can get slightly
aggressive

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.190
when you feel rejected.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.270
The other thing people typically
do when I ask

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.505
people, so, what do you do
when you feel rejected?

00:29:57.505 --> 00:29:58.310
Vodka!

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.580
They reach for the bottle
of tequila, whatever.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.080
They reach for the bottle.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.470
Not a good idea-- it turns out
that when you stuff your

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.900
feelings down with alcohol, they
often come back up again.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.420
So that's not going to work.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.320
And the other thing we often
do is we turn to food.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.240
We try and drown our sorrows
with food by hugging the

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.960
desert bowl, perhaps while
somebody has a sympathetic

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.780
hand on your shoulder while
you're doing it.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.100
Now needless to say these
responses don't

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.800
really work very well.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.390
They really don't do anything
for the rejection.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.450
They just numb you out or
give you a sugar high

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:31.970
or whatever it is.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.950
So what do we need to do?

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:37.050
How do we need to really
treat rejection?

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.680
There are several wounds
we need to treat.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.760
But the most urgent of them is
that we need to do something

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.000
to revive our self-worth.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.390
Because our self-esteem
just took a body blow.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.550
So we need to do something
to revive our self-worth.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:54.530
And one of the ways that is most
common in terms of how

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.230
people do that is positive
affirmations.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.550
I don't know if you're
familiar with them.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.870
Those are statements like I
am attractive and worthy.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.820
I'm going to be a
great success.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.840
You will find those statements
in books and on refrigerator

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.420
magnets and at the bottom
of annoying emails.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.990
And you'll see them
everywhere.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:13.470
And the thing about positive
affirmations--

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:14.340
you think, that's great.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.000
That's a nice thing.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.370
I'll recite that mantra
on a regular basis.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.530
But when we do studies about
them what we find is that

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.240
positive affirmations
don't work.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.030
And worse, people whose
self-esteem is feeling low

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:30.650
actually end up feeling worse
when they use positive

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.380
affirmations not better--

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.450
actually worse.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.450
Well, why is that?

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.750
Why is it when your self-esteem
is low, telling

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.840
yourself that you're going to
be successful and people are

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.510
going to love you and everything
is going to be

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.010
great, why would that
make you feel bad?

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.860
Well, we have to look at
persuasion theory.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.090
Persuasion theory tells us that
when a statement falls

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.920
within the boundaries of
our belief system,

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.060
we'll accept it.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.390
And when a statement falls
outside the boundaries of our

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.440
belief system, we'll
reject it.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.460
And so when you're feeling
really unworthy of love and

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.940
really unworthy of success, and
you're telling yourself

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.740
I'm worthy of love, I'm worthy
of success, you'll actually

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.020
reject that statement.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.180
Your unconscious mind will
reject that statement.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.430
And you'll actually endorse that
other statement of, no,

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.750
actually, I don't feel like
I'm worthy of love.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.740
I don't feel like I'm going
to have success.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.580
It's going to make
you feel worse.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.090
And I'll tell you, the

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.420
positive affirmation industry--

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.860
I mean, there are subliminal
tapes.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.040
It's an amazing thing.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.670
But the people who need it most
are the ones most likely

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:29.690
to be harmed by it.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.800
So that's unfortunate.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.880
So what should you do?

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.910
Well, there is another kind
of affirmation that

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.470
actually does work.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:37.990
And that's the one I'm
going to suggest.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.930
It's called self affirmations.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:41.960
And the thing about
self-affirmations is they are

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.010
generated by you.

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:46.410
So you'll know they fall within
the boundary of your

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.310
belief system because you're
the one that has to

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.140
come up with them.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.080
And here's one of the exercises
I suggest in the

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.310
book to revive your
self-esteem.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.390
I say--

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.910
and I'm saying it now--

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:01.130
make a list of five qualities,
attributes, that you have that

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.600
you really believe
are valuable in

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.790
whatever the domain is.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.230
So let's say it was a
romantic rejection.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.820
You could write that
I'm loyal.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.710
I'm emotionally available.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.630
I'm very supportive.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.740
I'm really open to
all kinds of fun.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.430
I'm a great cook.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.620
Whatever you make--

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.720
a list of attributes.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.320
If it's in the employment
domain, then I have a great

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.740
work ethic, high
learning curve.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.610
I'm reliable.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:25.530
I'm responsible.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:26.410
I'm motivated.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:27.930
You make your list, as
long a list as you

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.140
could possibly generate.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.540
And then you write a brief
essay, one or two paragraphs

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.580
about one of the items on your
list in which you talk about

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.470
why that's important, why you
value it, why other people

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.470
value it, how you've expressed
it in the past, how that

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.340
impacted people, how you might
express it in the future.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:50.020
You really elaborate why that's
an important thing.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.520
And that will actually remind
you of self-worth that you

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.230
actually have.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.600
It will remind you of,
huh, you know what?

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.340
I am pretty much of a bargain
for those people to hire me.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.680
Or actually I do have a lot to
offer in the dating room.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.180
That will make you feel
better, doing that.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.210
Now some people say to
me, I've tried it.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:08.290
It didn't work.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.100
And I'd like, you made the list
and you wrote the essay?

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.790
No, no, no, I just thought
about those things.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.419
And I thought about why
they were important.

00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:17.920
And I'm like, well, no, that's
like saying I was hungry.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.690
So I thought about the food
I had in my fridge.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:21.780
It turns out I'm still hungry.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.280
[LAUGHING]

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.420
No, yoiu have to write
the essay.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.320
You have to make the list.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.530
Because making the list is like
taking the food out of

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.110
the fridge and cooking it.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.300
And writing the essay
is how you eat it.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.530
It's how you absorb it.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.929
Your brain needs for you to
think about it, to process it,

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:36.570
to write it.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.260
That's how the message gets
absorbed, not on spec in some

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.040
30-second rushed thing.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.090
No, that doesn't work.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.520
So you actually have to write.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.659
The essay is an important
thing.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:50.420
Now it turns out that trying to
boost our self-esteem is a

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.929
good idea in general.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.460
And this is something I talk
about in the self-esteem

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.790
chapter of the book.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:59.670
Because when our self-esteem is
higher, not too high, but

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:03.410
higher, it can actually function
as a buffer when we

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.420
encounter things like rejection
and failure and

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.880
anxiety and stress.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.030
Now I'm saying higher not high,
because narcissists for

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.020
example, who seemingly have
very high self-esteem, it

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:15.980
doesn't act as a buffer.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.850
One small insult to a narcissist
and they're a

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.680
puddle on the floor
of outrage.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.160
So it's about higher,
but not too high.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.300
And so we know that when your
self-esteem is higher, it can

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.860
actually help you feel more
emotionally resilient.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.020
And self-esteem is like this
armor that you can wear to

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.940
life that will help
protect you.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.120
And that's why I consider-- and
when your self-esteem is

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.950
low, it's like having an
emotional immune system.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.070
And when your emotional immune
system is low, you're more

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:45.890
vulnerable.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.520
And when it's high, you're
less vulnerable.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.860
So low self-esteem is
like having a week

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.250
emotional immune system.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.740
And using self-affirmations
will boost it.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.250
But there is one other thing
that will boost it that I want

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.950
to mention as well.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.030
And this is why I think it's so
important that we're aware

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.905
of our self-esteem as a
psychological construct that

00:36:05.905 --> 00:36:07.310
we actually have to protect.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:08.790
Because it's like this armor.

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:12.240
And what happens that when our
self-esteem is low, the most

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.690
damage it sustains is by us.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.970
When our self-esteem is low,
we tend to be self-critical

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.250
and self-blaming and look at all
our faults, and focus on

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:23.610
everything we do wrong.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.670
And we are like kicking
ourselves when we're down.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.850
Now it's something we all
do very, very naturally.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:29.900
We'll call ourselves
loser and stupid.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.020
People do it all the time.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.940
They do it publicly.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.310
Like, shut up.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:35.660
That's not a good thing to do.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.860
Because if you thought of
self-esteem as a literally an

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:41.670
emotional immune system, or like
armor that you're going

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.260
to wear to the battle of life,
you would hardly see people

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.890
preparing to wear their armor
by poking holes in it and

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:47.490
making it weaker.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:48.770
That would not be something
you would do.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.150
You would think to
strengthen it.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.770
That's what our self-esteem
is.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.370
It needs to be strengthened.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.930
And so one of the ways to do
that, one other technique you

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.570
can use to do that
is the following.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.570
When your self-esteem is low,
and you feel yourself being

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:05.250
very critical, and you're
feeling bad about yourself--

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.600
and again, I should say our
self-esteem, it fluctuates day

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.080
to day, hour to hour.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.500
It's not this monolithic
thing.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.980
I have good self-esteem, or
I have bad self-esteem.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.250
It can be good one minute
and bad the next.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.270
It's like having a bad hair
day or a good hair day.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.080
You can have a good self-esteem
day or a bad

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.960
self-esteem day.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.360
So it can really fluctuate.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.280
We can all have moments
of low self-esteem.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.000
When your self-esteem is low,
when you're feeling yourself

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.720
becoming self-critical and

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.660
self-blaming, do the following.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.960
Again, it's a writing thing,
because remember, that's how

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.220
we absorb best.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.140
Write out-- if you had a dear,
dear friend who was saying to

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.540
you, this is how I feel.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.660
I feel self-critical.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.290
I feel bad about myself.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:43.460
I'm blaming myself for this.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.740
I think I have all
these faults.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.540
What would you write to them,
if you were trying

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.610
to cheer them up?

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.800
If you were trying to encourage,
if you were trying

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.440
to nurture, what would you say
if you were trying to soothe

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.080
them and remind them
of all the great

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.110
things that they are?

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:56.320
Write that out.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.770
And that is what you
need to say to

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.460
yourself in those moments.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.040
Another writing exercise--

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.520
it's called adopting
self-compassion.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.270
And self-compassion is a great
antidote to low self-esteem.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:11.840
Because it reminds you to treat
yourself kindly, to

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.590
allow your self-esteem to
recover, to allow your

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.850
emotional immune system
to get stronger again.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:21.450
And if you do, it
actually will.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:23.380
And so those two exercises--

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.325
one is for rejection, the other
for self-esteem, but you

00:38:25.325 --> 00:38:27.550
can use them both for
self-esteem--

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.040
are two things you can do.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.240
Because they happen very,
very frequently.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.480
And I assure you that if you
practice them-- if you take

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.240
the time to do the thinking
and do the writing--

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.160
you will feel better.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.130
So look, I want to talk about
the benefits then of

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.110
practicing emotional first aid,
what it can do for you.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:47.890
It can ease your
emotional pain.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.600
It can restore your cognitive
functioning.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.640
It can help you think
more clearly.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.130
It can minimize risks of
infection, like we saw with

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:59.050
failure, and damage to your
long-term mental health.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.780
It can minimize risks to
your physical health.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.120
And it can increase
your emotional

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.590
resilience over time.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.350
These self-esteem exercises,
for example, will increase

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.980
your emotional resilience,
if you do them regularly.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.870
So look, I hope I've been able
to convince you to invite

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:19.070
Cinderella to the ball, to
really think of your

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:22.420
psychological health as
something that needs as much

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.450
attention and as much care as,
yes, you give your teeth.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:27.280
And I've looked at you all.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.390
You all have good teeth.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:31.060
So do that to your psychological
health.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.690
I really hope that the next time
you experience some kind

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:38.920
of psychological injury, you
won't just hurt, but you'll

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.150
try applying emotional
first aid.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.572
Thank you very much.

00:39:42.572 --> 00:39:49.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.890
GUY WINCH: So we do have time
for some questions, if there

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.470
are any brave souls who
want to ask any.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:58.890
AUDIENCE: I'll be
a brave soul.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.480
GUY WINCH: Excellent.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.420
AUDIENCE: I wonder where you
think the practices of

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.650
Buddhism, like mindfulness--

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.150
and even though I was
thinking of the

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.270
meditation loving kindness--

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:14.710
fall in terms of a first aid for
our emotional well being?

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:15.100
GUY WINCH: OK.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.260
It's a great question.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.830
And I'm actually all for them,
because I do think they are

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:19.610
good examples.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.280
I mean, they're actually
what I'm saying.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.990
The mindfulness, and especially
the Buddhist

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:27.060
mindfulness, is a way of
thinking about your life in a

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.900
way that does practice this.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.820
It's a way of thinking about
things in a way that you're

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.490
paying attention to your
psychological state, to your

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.380
thoughts, to your feelings.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.930
And especially a lot of those
things, they really do that

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.740
trick of being kind
to yourself.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.250
Mindfulness is a
way in which--

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.450
for example, mindfulness
meditation is a way in which

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.840
you reflect on your thoughts
and your feelings, but you

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.510
don't judge them.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.310
You might note, I'm
feeling this.

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:53.330
And you move it away.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.290
And you try and keep
concentrating.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.950
And you do that over time to
kind of clear your mind and

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.060
move the thoughts away.

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.280
Just label them so you know
what they are, but no

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.870
emotional judgments to them.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.840
And they are actually
very therapeutic.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.510
And there are a couple of
exercises in the book which

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.940
are very mindfulness
in their approach.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.680
So yes, I think that is
actually a good thing.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.350
I think it falls within the
spectrum of the things I'm

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:14.992
talking about.

00:41:14.992 --> 00:41:16.242
AUDIENCE: Oh, thanks.

00:41:21.726 --> 00:41:22.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.090
So I want to think--

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:26.005
when you're planning something,
or you're going out

00:41:26.005 --> 00:41:29.520
for like a job interview, or
you're going out on a date,

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.930
one thing I'll do that I don't
think it works-- and I don't

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:34.610
know if it's true or not-- is
to try and pump myself up

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:35.330
beforehand.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.420
So like getting myself like,
oh, you can do this.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.500
You've got this, when I maybe
feel like I don't.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.630
Do you think that's something
that can make the rejection or

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.990
the damage worse?

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.870
GUY WINCH: So here's
what I'm saying.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:50.190
I'm saying that I think the
pumping up is a good idea.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.590
How I would do it is
more specifically.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:57.330
I've got this or yay for
me is too general.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:00.650
I would actually maybe do that
self-affirmation exercise.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.390
I would maybe sit and journal
a little bit about all the

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.460
things you have to offer to this
prospective date, all the

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.140
things that you have to offer to
this prospective employer.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.080
Because that will actually get
you in touch with real stuff.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.770
That will allow to be more

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.520
confident and be more yourself.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.350
Because when we're nervous,
we're too much thinking about,

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.090
what are they thinking of me?

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.713
And you're not enough thinking
about, well, what

00:42:21.713 --> 00:42:22.700
do I think of them?

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.680
And do they want me
to work here?

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.980
Well, do I want to work there?

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:26.760
And do they like me?

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.780
Well, do I like them?

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.010
So doing that, doing the
self-affirmation exercise, I

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.130
think, will put you in touch
with more real things, give

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:35.966
you true confidence, as opposed
to the general yeah,

00:42:35.966 --> 00:42:38.180
yeah, yeah, which kind
of is like--

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:38.960
it's like a balloon.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.730
It's not very substantive
inside.

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.490
So I would use the
self-affirmation exercise

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:45.460
before a date or a
job interview.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.710
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:52.710
GUY WINCH: Anyone else?

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:55.950
No?

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:56.430
All right.

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:58.870
Well, look thank you very,
very much for coming.

00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:59.810
I really appreciate it.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.020
Thank you very much for
having me again.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.040
Have a great day.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:08.328
[APPLAUSE]
