Okay, kids,
now, remember,

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.838 align:end position:100%
Chief Woody will be watching
and keeping tabs.

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.141
Everything you do well
earns your tribe

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.043
valuable points
for the tribal shield.

Malloy here
will be keeping score.

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:13.679 align:start size:22% position:78%
On it.
Points!

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:17.283
Now it's time for a tour
of our wilderness wonderland.

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.552
Here is where the two best
cooks in the county

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.789
will delight your taste buds--
our mess hall.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:27.226
- Oh, mess hall.
- Yeah, that makes more sense.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.862 align:end position:100%
Above you is our
state-of-the-art ropes course.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.564

This doesn't look anything
like the brochure.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.069
Where are the arcades
and the 100-foot water slides?

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.638 align:start size:66% position:34%
We have water slides!

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.507 align:end position:100%
Don't look
at that.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.443 size:75% position:63%
Why can't
we play outside?

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.478 align:start position:0%
Yeah, Steve,
it's a beautiful day.

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.380 align:end position:100%
It's way too dangerous
out there.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:49.182 align:start size:47% position:53%
Steve, the best
counselor ever,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.384 align:end position:100%
is going to keep
his kids safe.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:54.954 align:start position:0%
Besides, we can do fun camp
activities right here.

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:56.856 align:start size:88% position:13%
See?

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.892
Aah! No.
You could choke on that.

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:02.128
Mmm, mmm.
[spits]

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.763 align:end position:100%
Steve,
this is ridiculous.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.565 align:end position:100%
These kids can't spend
their whole week of camp

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:06.899 align:start size:66% position:34%
locked up in a cabin.

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:09.469 align:start position:0%
Connie, my kids
aren't stepping foot

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.737 align:end size:59% position:59%
out of this cabin,
and that's final.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.005
(kids)
Aww!

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.373 align:start position:0%
All right, campers.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:18.211 align:start position:0%
Time for an exciting hike
past the Brickleberry whirlpool!

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.880
I haven't had a group of kids
watch me poop

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:25.051
since I paid money to have
a group of kids watch me poop.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.453
[laughing]
