00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:50.070
1) Death 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.830
by 
Golden Shower was Once Used as a Method of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.580
Execution

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.780
Execution by golden shower was once used by
the Pathans (a.k.a. “Pashtuns”).

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.280
British soldier John Masters, who was stationed
in British India when he was 18 in 1933, described

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.620
this and other methods of execution for captured
soldiers in the region, “…if they [Pathans]

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.720
captured any soldiers… especially if the
soldiers were Sikhs or British, they would

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.220
usually castrate and behead them.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.640
Both these operations were frequently done
by the women.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.210
Sometimes they would torture prisoners with
the death of a thousand cuts, pushing grass

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.180
and thorns into each wound as it was made.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.530
Sometimes they would peg the prisoner out
and, with a stick, force his jaws so wide

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.320
open that he could not swallow, and then the
women would urinate in his open mouth (taking

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.950
turns) till he drowned.”

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.350
2) 7-Up Originally Contained Psychiatric Medication
The lemon-lime flavored soda, 7-UP, was created

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.690
by Charles Grigg of the Howdy Corporation
in 1929, originally named "Bib-Label Lithiated

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.040
Lemon-Lime Soda", and included lithium citrate
in its formula.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.020
This is a mood-stabilizing drug that was popular
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.039
and is still occasionally used today for people
with conditions like bipolar disorder.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.439
Surprisingly, lithium citrate stuck around
in 7-UP all the way until 1950, when research

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.310
showed it had potentially dangerous side effects.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.469
3) Playdoh was Originally Wallpaper Cleaner

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:26.800
In 1933, a young Cleo McVicker was at a meeting
with Kroger grocery store executives when

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.469
they asked if his company, Kutol, made wallpaper
cleaner.

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.920
With Kutol desperately needing money, Cleo
told them they did- a bold lie.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.529
Kroger subsequently ordered 15,000 cases of
the product with a $5,000 penalty if Kutol

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.239
didn’t deliver on time.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.459
Kutol then copied a commonly used wallpaper
cleaner recipe and the compound that ultimately

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.340
would become Play-Doh was born.As coal heat
began to go the way of the dodo and vinyl

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.579
wallpaper was invented, few needed wallpaper
cleaner anymore and the McVicker’s product

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.519
was virtually obsolete.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.340
That’s when Kay Zufall, the sister-in-law
of one of the executives at Kutol came up

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.450
with the idea of using the substance as a
toy modeling compound.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.700
The result was that Kutol removed the detergent
from the dough and added an almond scent and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.700
some coloring.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.480
They re-christen the compound: “Kutol’s
Rainbow Modeling Compound”, which was soon

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.480
changed to “Play-Doh” at the suggestion
of Kay.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.389
With a little help from Bob Keeshan, better
known as Captain Kangaroo, who was promised

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.140
2% of the sales generated if he promoted it
on his show, Play-Doh quickly became a national

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.140
hit.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.969
4) Bubble Wrap was Originally Wallpaper

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:41.120
Bubble Wrap was invented by two engineers
Al Fielding and Marc Chavannes in Hawthorne,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.340
N.J. in 1957.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.360
The two were not, however, trying to make
a product to be used as packaging material.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.379
Rather, they were trying to create a textured
wallpaper.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.760
When this use of the product didn’t pan
out, they decided to market it as greenhouse

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.830
insulation.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.469
This idea didn’t sell well either.Then,
on October the 5, 1959, IBM announced their

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:06.689
new 1401 variable word length computer and
a lightbulb went off- Bubble Wrap could be

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.709
used as a good packaging material to protect
the computer while it was being shipped.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.669
The pair pitched the idea to IBM, who loved
it.

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.129
And the rest, as they say, is history.

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.900
5) Einstein Got His Wife to Agree to a Divorce
Him by Promising His Nobel Prize Funds to

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.199
Her if He Ever Won One

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:31.009
In 1919, Einstein was looking to finally divorce
his wife who had thus far resisted the idea,

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.419
despite that they had long been separated.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.440
To convince her, he wrote her a letter stating,
“Dear Mileva,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.620
The endeavor finally to put my private affairs
in some state of order prompts me to suggest

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.479
the divorce to you for the second time...

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.740
I would grant you significant pecuniary advantages
through particularly generous concessions.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.669
9,000 M instead of 6,000 M, with the provision
that 2,000 of it be deposited annually for

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.000
the benefit of the children.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.629
The Nobel Prize — in the event of the divorce
and in the event that it is bestowed upon

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.139
me — would be ceded to you in full…

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.620
The widow’s pension would be promised to
you in the case of a divorce.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.610
Naturally, I would make such huge sacrifices
only in the case of a voluntary divorce.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.050
If you do not consent to the divorce, from
now on, not a cent about 6,000 M per year

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.389
will be sent to Switzerland…”

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.919
Despite that he’d not yet won a Nobel Prize
for her to collect the large cash prize, after

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.909
thinking it over for a week, she accepted.

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.159
6) There Once was a Man Who ate an Entire
Airplane

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:41.379
The eating disorder known as pica is characterized
by persistent and compulsive cravings to eat

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:42.740
nonfood items.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.080
Some people have turned their appetite for
these non-digestable foods into a career.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.759
Perhaps one of the most notable individuals
on this front is MICHEL LOTITO, aka Monsieu

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.960
Mangetout- "Mister Eats All", who specialized
in eating metal.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.320
If that doesn’t sound too impressive, perhaps
we should mention that from 1959 to 1997,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.389
Michel consumed nearly nine tons of metal,
including 18 bicycles, 15 shopping carts,

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:14.580
7 television sets, 6 chandeliers, 2 bed frames,
an entire Cessna airplane (which took him

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.629
about two years), 1 coffin, and 400m of a
steel chain.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.400
7) Sleeping Beauty is Based on a Story of
a King Who Raped a Sleeping Girl

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.000
The story is called The Sun, the Moon, and
Talia, written, or at the least collected

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.240
and composed, by the Italian poet Giambattista
Basile in 1634.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.340
The story goes that on a hunting trip, a king
stumbles on an estate in the woods where he

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.669
finds a beautiful young woman that he can’t
wake up.

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:47.229
So , to quote, “...being on fire with love,
he carried her to a couch and, having gathered

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:50.009
the fruits of love, left her lying there.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.530
Then he returned to his own kingdom and for
a long time entirely forgot the affair.”Ultimately

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:01.150
the sleeping girl, cared for by fairies, gave
birth to twins, then later woke up.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.680
It’s at this point the king remembered the
girl and decided to go back to the house to

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.120
see her again...

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.229
This time, though, he found her awake.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.499
After the king explained to her how she’d
gotten pregnant, naturally she fell in love

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.499
with him…

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:17.539
(He was, no doubt, dreamy) and he decided
he loved her too.

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.210
The only problem- he was already married.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.270
When the queen found out about the affair,
she attempts to have the babies fed to the

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.039
king unknowingly and then tries to kill Talia.

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:32.960
Instead the chef hides the kids and the King
kills his wife and marries his raped mistress,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.990
and they live happily ever after, with the
last line of the story being (translated):

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.389
“Lucky people, so ’tis said, Are blessed
by Fortune whilst in bed.”

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:48.249
8) There Once was a Girl Who Had No Vagina
but Got Stabbed and Had a Baby

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:52.940
Published in the British Journal of Obstetrics
and Gynaecology, in 1988, there is a rather

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.349
curious paper entitled: Oral conception.

00:07:56.349 --> 00:08:02.259
Impregnation via the proximal gastrointestinal
tract in a patient with an aplastic distal

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:03.259
vagina.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:04.259
Case report.

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:08.210
In it, the doctors describes a 15-year-old
girl in the small African country of Lesotho

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.419
who arrived at a local hospital with all the
signs of a woman in labor.

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:17.169
Upon examination, the doctors found no vagina,
only a shallow skin dimple.

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:21.419
After a successful C-section resulted in a
healthy baby boy, the doctors noted:

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:26.199
“While closing the abdominal wall, curiosity
could not be contained any longer and the

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:29.900
patient was interviewed with the help of a
sympathetic nursing sister…

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.170
The patient was well aware of the fact that
she had no vagina and she had started oral

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:38.040
experiments after disappointing attempts at
conventional intercourse.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.821
Just before she was stabbed in the abdomen
[some 278 days previous to giving birth] she

00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:47.530
had practiced fellatio with her new boyfriend
and was caught in the act by her former lover.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.230
The fight with knives ensued.”

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.490
The physicians later learned that while performing
surgery to repair the stab wounds, the surgeons

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.240
had found two holes that opened the girl's
stomach to her abdominal cavity.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.130
Thus, it is theorized by the later doctors
in the report that the sperm in the girl's

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:05.930
stomach gained access to her reproductive
organs through her injured gastrointestinal

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.580
tract shortly after she ingested it.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.590
Interestingly, getting pregnant as the result
of sperm originating in a woman’s abdomen

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.840
is possible enough that in the 1980s, during
the early days of fertility treatments, doctors

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.740
sometimes performed a procedure called DIPI
(direct intraperitoneal insemination) during

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.630
which they injected sperm into the lower abdomen
hoping that it would find its way to an egg,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.030
similar to what happened in the case report,
except obviously not going through the stomach.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.320
9) There Once was a Guy Who Survived Two Nuclear
Explosions

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.480
At the age of 29, Tsutomu Yamaguchi was on
his way back home from a three month long

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.370
business trip to Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:50.280
On his way to the train station, he saw a
bomber flying over the city and "two small

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:56.620
parachutes", then a rush of blinding light,
sound, wind, and heat knocked him to the ground.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.730
Mr. Yamaguchi had the misfortune of being
approximately 3 km from a nuclear blast.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.250
The immediate effects of this were his ear
drums rupturing, temporarily blindness, and

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.680
burns over much of his upper body.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.200
Three days later he found himself back at
home in Nagasaki, and even reported for work…

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.580
According to Yamaguchi, while discussing with
his boss how he got the burns, the air-raid

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.650
sirens went off and then, once again, he saw
a blinding white light…

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.720
Surprisingly, unlike so many others, the only
major permanent physical health problem’s

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.840
Yamaguchi had as the result of the bombings
and exposure to large amounts of ionizing

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.170
radiation was the loss of hearing in his left
ear.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:42.580
He lived to the ripe old age of 93, dying
of stomach cancer on January 4, 2010.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.340
10) The Founder of Fedex once Gambled the
Company’s Last Funds in Las Vegas to Save

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.340
It

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.590
The man is Frederick W. Smith who founded
FedEx in 1971.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:57.980
The company struggled in its early days and
at its low point, all they had was about $5000

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.000
left in the bank.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.290
Desperate, Smith made a final pitch for more
funding, but was refused, leaving FedEx more

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.050
or less dead on the ground when they’d not
be able to fuel their planes the following

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.610
Monday.Instead of accepting defeat, Smith
flew to Las Vegas for the weekend and played

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.020
Black Jack with the remaining company funds.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:19.280
Thanks to this, by Monday FedEx had $32,000
in its bank account, which was just enough

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.950
to cover the fuel for their planes and to
continue operating a few days more.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.700
When asked what he’d been thinking taking
a chance like that with company funds, he

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.430
stated: “What difference does it make?

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.610
Without the funds for the fuel companies,
we couldn’t have flown anyway.”It turns

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.810
out, a few days more was all he needed.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:39.120
Shortly thereafter, Smith successfully managed
to raise $11 million to keep the company afloat

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.020
and, by 1976, Federal Express made its first
profit of $3.6 million.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:51.140
Today the company employs over 300,000 people
and has annual revenues of about $47 billion.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.890
11) Daylight Saving Time Once Thwarted a Terrorist
Attack

00:11:54.890 --> 00:12:00.680
In September of 1999, the West Bank was on
daylight saving time while Israel was on standard

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.550
time; West Bank terrorists prepared bombs
set on timers and smuggled them to their associates

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.640
in Israel.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.391
As a result, the bombs exploded one hour sooner
than the terrorists in Israel thought they

00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:12.391
would.

00:12:12.391 --> 00:12:16.520
Thus, the three terrorists died instead of
the two busloads of people who were the intended

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.520
targets.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.560
12) The Can Opener wasn’t Invented for Decades
After the Can

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.950
In 1810, Nicholas Appert won a prize offered
by Napoleon Bonaparte for his method of keeping

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.500
food fresh by sterilization.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.440
Although he didn’t understand exactly why
it worked, Appert found that food stayed fresh

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.330
for long periods of time if you could seal
it tightly in a container, in his case a glass

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.010
jar, and then heat it up.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.730
Later that year an inventor, Peter Durand,
received a patent for the world’s first

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.490
can made of iron and tin.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.090
Combined with Appert’s sterilization method,
long term canned food preservation became

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.090
possible.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:56.010
Unfortunately, there was no can opener forthcoming
owing to how thick the can and lids were.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.770
The age old “smash it with a hammer and
knife” technique was the common opening

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.790
method.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.050
Ultimately a method for making thinner cans
was created, resulting in various can openers

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:11.020
being invented, the first patented in 1858,
nearly a half century after the can was invented.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.500
13) The Guy Who Invented the Fender Guitar
Never Learned to Play Guitar

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.290
Leo Fender, inventor of one of the most popular
electric guitar brands in the world, was an

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.540
accountant before losing his job in the Great
Depression.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.180
When this happened, he decided to turn his
hobby of tinkering with electronics into a

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.740
business- “Fender Radio and Record Shop”
where he ultimately invented various amplifiers

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.950
and later guitars.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.970
Despite designing the first commercially successful
solid-body electric guitar, the Telecaster,

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:45.060
and the most influential of all electric guitars,
the Stratocaster, and inventing the solid-body

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:50.400
electric bass guitar, the Precision bass,
Leo Fender never learned to play guitar.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.080
14) Piccasso’s Full Name Can’t Be Posted
on Twitter

00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:03.880
Pablo Picasso’s full name was Pablo Diego
José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:12.340
de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima
Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.470
15) High Heels Were Once the Height of Men’s
Fashion

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:21.460
The first high heel wearers are believed to
have been Persian horseback warriors sometime

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.180
around the ninth century.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.120
The extended heel is thought to have been
developed specifically for riding, to keep

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.860
the rider’s foot from slipping out of the
stirrups.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.350
After a group of Persian diplomats visited
Europe in the late 16th century, Persian-style

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.760
high heeled shoes were adopted by Western
European aristocrats.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.040
The shoes became a status symbol, with ornate
designs and ultra-high heels coming into fashion,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.570
such as the case of King Louis XIV sporting
four inch heels, often decorated with elaborate

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.130
battle scenes.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:54.460
Not to be outdone, women of the 1600s started
copying the fashion.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.930
Around the same time, lower class citizens
also started wearing high heels, resulting

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.070
in the elite making their heels increasingly
higher.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:07.510
They also began to differentiate heels into
two kinds- fat heels for men and skinny for

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.510
women.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:14.110
By the 18th century, high heels disappeared
almost completely from men’s fashion outside

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:19.010
of cowboy boots, and not long after women
mostly stopped wearing them too.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.620
However, the heel came back into fashion for
women in the mid-19th century with the advent

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.780
of photography.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.810
Why?

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:30.340
Pornographers began dressing models for risqué
post cards and other photographs in little

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.930
else but high heels.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.670
16) Green Eggs and Ham was the Product of
a Bet

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.640
Dr. Seuss, a.k.a. Theodore Geisel, wrote “Green
Eggs and Ham” on a bet that he couldn’t

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.270
write a book with 50 or fewer distinct words.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:48.110
The bet was made in 1960 with Bennett Cerf,
the co-founder of Random House, and was for

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.880
$50 (about $404 today).

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.360
Green Eggs and Ham went on to become the fourth
best-selling English children’s book in

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360
history.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.660
17) Al Capone’s Brother was a Prohibition
Officer

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.740
Al Capone’s brother, James Vincenzo Capone,
left the family at the age of 16 to join the

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:08.100
circus in 1908, traveling throughout the Midwest
going by the name “Richard Hart”, in order

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.840
to mask his Italian heritage.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.000
He ultimately settled in Homer, Nebraska,
where he became Homer’s town marshal and

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.850
later a state sheriff.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.130
It was then that he chose to seek out more
excitement by becoming a prohibition enforcement

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:25.920
officer, something he was extremely effective
at, though known to be overly brutal in handling

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.260
bootleggers.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:32.960
Around this same time, his brother Al, was
rising in fame as a gangster in Chicago, particularly

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.040
known for, of course, bootlegging.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:41.090
18) There Once was a Siberian Family Who Didn’t
Encounter Other Humans for Over 40 Years

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:46.700
Karp Lykov was a member of a long persecuted
fundamentalist Russian Orthodox sect known

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.890
as the Old Believers.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:52.990
In 1936, while working the fields with his
brother near their village, a Communist guard

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.160
came by and shot his brother right in front
of him.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.330
Karp immediately grabbed his family (which,
at the time, only consisted of his wife, Akulina

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:05.630
, his son Savin, and his 2-year old daughter
Natalia) and disappeared into the Siberian

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.630
wilderness.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:11.410
It would be another 42 years before the family
would encounter other humans again- a team

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:16.370
of geologists spotted their hut when flying
over in a helicopter.Karp and his wife (who

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.890
would die of starvation in 1961 thanks to
a cold snap that killed all their crops the

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.449
summer before), had two more children in the
wild, Dmitry and Agafia.

00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:30.660
For reference, Agafia was 35 when she first
saw humans outside of her family.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:37.020
None of the family knew anything of the outside
world from 1936 to 1978.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.110
By 1988, Agafia was the only surviving member
of the family.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.921
She remained at her remote home until January
of 2016 when she had to be airlifted to a

00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:48.420
hospital due to severe pain in her leg.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.760
After healing up, however, she returned to
the harsh Siberian wilderness.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.790
19) There is an ATM in Antarctica

00:17:54.790 --> 00:18:02.170
There is an ATM at McMurdo Station in Antarctica,
about 840 miles or 1351 km from the South

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.170
Pole.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.900
Not surprisingly, this ATM is the most southern
ATM in the world.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.640
The most northern ATM in the world is in Longyearbyen,
Svalbard, Norway, which is about half way

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.640
between mainland Norway and the North Pole.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:20.900
The world’s highest ATM is at Khanjerab
Pass 15,397 ft (4.7 km) above sea level.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:27.240
Finally, the world’s lowest ATM is in Ein
Bokek, near the Dead Sea in a grocery store

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.710
that is 1381 ft. (420 m) below sea level.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.610
20) The First Woman to Cast a Vote in Chicago
Did so with Her Feet

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.410
The woman was Kittie Smith.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.710
Smith lost her arms as a child, after having
both her arms and hands burned badly on a

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:42.800
kitchen stove.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.730
As an adult, Kittie eventually became the
first woman to vote in Chicago Illinois in

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:47.730
1913.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.730
”Hold on there!”

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:49.730
You say?

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.340
“The 19th Amendment wasn’t passed until
1920.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.290
How was she able to vote in 1913?”

00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:00.960
In Illinois, on June 26, 1913, women began
being allowed to vote on presidential and

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.530
many other elections.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:08.160
Shortly after, an estimated 250,000 women,
with Kittie Smith’s feet leading the way,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.510
voted in Chicago Illinois when the first Illinois
election took place after that bill passed.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.930
21) Charles Osborne had the Hiccups for 68
Straight Years

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:23.730
In 1922, Charles Osborne was weighing a hog
for slaughter when he had a little accident.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.580
As he stated, “I was hanging a 350 pound
hog for butchering.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.970
I picked it up and then I fell down.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:35.100
I felt nothing, but the doctor said later
that I busted a blood vessel the size of a

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.100
pin in my brain.”

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.770
Directly after the fall, Osborne began hiccupping
at a rate of around 40 times per minute on

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.140
average.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.800
Throughout his life, this gradually slowed
to about 20 hiccups per minute until his hiccups

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:52.860
finally stopped mysteriously about one year
before his death in 1991.This approximate

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:59.800
68 year stretch of hiccups from 1922 to 1990
is considered a world record for continuous

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.460
hiccups.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:10.180
22) KFC is the Traditional Christmas Dinner
in Japan

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.670
In 1974, KFC started a huge advertising campaign
in Japan called “Kurisumasu ni wa kentakkii!”

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:25.120
(Kentucky for Christmas!), with the idea being
that in a land bereft of the customary turkey

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.860
for celebratory dinner, fried chicken was
the next best thing.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.120
This campaign was ludicrously popular in part
thanks to the popularity of American culture

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.360
in Japan at the time.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.210
Today, the custom of eating KFC for Christmas
is so popular in Japan that you’ll not only

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:44.560
see lines of people snaked outside every branch
in the country, but people even reserve their

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.130
buckets of weeks, and sometimes months, in
advance just to see it on their dinner tables

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.130
on Christmas!

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.809
23) In 1899, 90% of All Taxis in New York
City were Electric Cars

00:20:54.809 --> 00:21:01.490
In 1842, two inventors, American, Thomas Davenport,
and a Scotsman, Robert Davidson, separately

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.590
created the first practical electric cars
with rechargeable batteries.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:11.570
By 1899, the technology had improved such
that 90% of all taxis in New York City were

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.790
electric cars.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:19.300
Not only that, but in 1899 and 1900, electric
cars outsold all other types of cars, such

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.220
as gas and steam powered vehicles.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.210
Ultimately Henry Ford and the rise of highways
killed the electric car industry.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:31.510
Nonetheless, Ford’s wife, Clara, preferred
the 1914 Detroit Electric car, which had a

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.250
range of 80 miles, over her husband’s cars.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.360
24) There Once was a Man who was a Dwarf and
Later a Giant

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:44.950
Adam Rainer of Graz, Austria reached a height
of just 4 feet 6.3 inches (1.38 m) by the

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:45.950
age of 18.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.750
For reference, the cutoff for someone being
classified as a dwarf is usually considered

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:54.930
to be an adult height of less than 4 feet
10 inches (1.47 m).

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.470
According to Rainier, by the time he hit 21,
while still barely classified as a dwarf in

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:05.071
height, his shoe size had shot up to a European
size 53, which would be about a size 20 in

00:22:05.071 --> 00:22:11.220
the U.S. (for reference, Shaquille O’Neal
wears a size US size 22-23).Then his body

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:16.940
followed- from his 21st birthday to his 32nd,
Rainer went from just under 4 feet 10 inches

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:22.280
tall to 7 feet 2 inches (1.47 m to 2.18 m).

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.570
As to what caused his bizarre growth spurt
as an adult, doctors F. Windholz and A. Mandl

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:33.240
discovered a tumor on his pituitary gland,
which resulted in a condition known as acromegaly,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.420
where the pituitary gland produces excessive
amounts of growth hormone during adulthood.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.690
To try to fix the problem, in 1930 doctors
removed the tumor, but he still continued

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.309
to grow, albeit at a much slower rate.

00:22:45.309 --> 00:22:52.170
He died at the age of 51 in 1950 at a height
of about 7 feet 8 inches (2.34 m), making

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:57.090
him the only known person to spend time as
an adult officially classified as a dwarf

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.600
and then as a giant.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.050
25) The Inventor of the Pringles can was Buried
in One

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:07.520
Upon his death in 2008, just 20 days shy of
his 90th birthday, the inventor of the Pringles

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.309
can, Fredric J. Baur, was cremated.

00:23:10.309 --> 00:23:14.660
In keeping with his wishes, his family filled
a Pringles can with as much of his ashes as

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.790
fit and buried it.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:21.350
As to what flavor, his son, Larry, stated,
“My siblings and I briefly debated what

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.630
flavor to use, but I said, ‘Look, we need
to use the original.’”
