00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:02.201
 - My name is Ace Venom.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:04.070
 Yes, that is my real name.

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.339 line:0%
 I had it legally changed
 in 2007.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:07.640
I'm 32 years old.

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:11.244
 Been here in Portland, Oregon,
 since 2003.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.246
 I am a Jedi Realist.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.680
 I practice the philosophies

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:18.051
 that were first introduced
 in "Star Wars."

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.353
 Right now, my fiancée and I
 are living in our truck.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:23.689
 A while back,
 our rent was raised.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:26.759
 We both have jobs,
 make decent money,

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.327
 but it's just too expensive

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.430
 to live in an apartment
 these days.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:33.299
 Jediism is not about
 the magic tricks.

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:35.401
 As part of my faith,

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:38.304
 I intentionally place myself
 in a position

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:40.106
 where I can help
 the most people

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:41.674
 at any given point in time.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:44.177
 That's my Jedi mission.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.611
- A long time ago

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:48.448
in a galaxy far, far away,

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.717
a movie happened that I couldn't
care less about.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.486
That's Ace Venom,

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.855
and the force
of crushing poverty is with him.

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.757
He loves everything I hate:

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.692
space, magic, Portland.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.394
He calls himself a Jedi Knight,

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.463
only he doesn't fight
the dark side;

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.730
he picks up garbage
on the side of the road

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.233
like a prisoner.

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.634
Here's what I know
about "Star Wars":

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.636
a teenager doesn't want
to do his chores,

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:11.838
has daddy issues,

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.240
and wants to [bleep] his sister.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:16.242
"Star Wars" is just a soap opera

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.511
with flashlight swords
and Muppets.

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:20.646
It's a fake religion,
like Scientology.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.449
The only difference is,
"Star Wars" pays taxes

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.685
and wasn't created
by a drug addict.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.855
I will say, it was kind of
a dick move of the franchise

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:32.458
to kill off Princess Leia
and her mom at the same time.

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:35.294
And why do stormtroopers
bother wearing all that armor

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:37.697
when they always die
in one shot?

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.399
Meanwhile, the real Han Solo's
been crashing his plane

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:43.569
into every golf course
in Southern California.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:45.438
But the most unrealistic part
of that movie

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:46.873
is how quickly
the black guy confessed

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.774
to being the father.

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:52.612
Still, if Ace wants to live
every day like it's Comic-Con,

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.514
I'll freeze him in carbonite

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:56.883
and fly him on the Kessel Run
to Hollywood

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.918
in less than 12 parsecs

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.753
for this week's
Ce-web-rity Profile.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:05.558
 [dramatic music]

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.727
[electrical whirring]

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.395 align:start position:0%
- Greetings.

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.297 align:start position:0%
Are you in line for the new
"Star Wars" movie?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.298 align:start size:19% position:81%
- Yes.

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.266 align:start size:75% position:25%
But I've also been known

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.535 align:end position:100%
to crash on the streets
from time to time.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:16.769 align:start position:0%
- Oh, delightful.

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:17.703 align:start position:0%
Come along, Artoo.

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:20.373 align:start position:0%
- [whirring]

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.241 align:start size:34% position:66%
- I'm DT.0.

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:25.411 align:end position:100%
This is my fiancée,
R2-DD2.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:27.480 align:end position:100%
She is the droid
I was looking for.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:30.316 align:start position:0%
- [whistling]

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.919 size:78% position:39%
- Are you still homeless?

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.754 align:end position:100%
- No. No, actually,
I'm renting a basement

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.222 align:start size:81% position:19%
from some friends of mine.

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:38.491 align:start position:0%
- When did you convert
to Jediism?

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:40.493 align:start size:69% position:31%
- In 2010, August 8th.

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.528
- Is it like Judaism?
- No, not really.

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.463 align:start position:0%
- What do you do, like,
on a day-to-day basis

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:45.865 align:start position:0%
to make the world
a better place?

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:47.466
 - Try and be friendly
 to people.

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:48.734
 - Uh-huh.
 - Be kind, you know.

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:50.469
 - You also try to clean
 the city up.

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:51.637
 - Yeah, a little bit
 here and there

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.239 align:start size:69% position:31%
when I get the chance.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.740 size:81% position:41%
- You ever think of adding
on the end of a lightsaber

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:56.475 align:start position:0%
one of those little
pickup things?

00:02:56.508 --> 00:02:57.777 align:end position:100%
- Actually, I have
one of those.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.612 align:start position:0%
- You've thought
of everything.

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.581 align:start position:0%
I don't know why I thought
I could come up with something

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:02.949 size:84% position:42%
that you hadn't thought of.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.418 align:start position:0%
That one profile piece
that I saw on you,

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.787 align:start position:0%
you were engaged
and living out of your car.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.988 size:78% position:39%
Are you guys married now?

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.290 align:start size:63% position:38%
- No, we split ways,

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:13.759
decided we were much better
friends than we were partners.

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.261 align:start position:0%
- But did you actually
get married or no?

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.696
- No.
- Oh, all right.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.264
So you dodged that bullet.
- Yeah, I sure did.

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:19.665 align:start position:0%
- Good for you.

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:20.766 size:81% position:41%
Are you single right now,
or are you dating someone?

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.301
- No, I'm dating someone.
- Okay.

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:23.803
Let's just say you're single.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:27.974 align:start position:0%
How soon into dating do you say,
"By the way, I'm a Jedi"?

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.475
- Day one.
- Okay.

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:31.410 align:start position:0%
Can you become a Jedi

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:33.746 align:start position:0%
without having any interest
in "Star Wars"?

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:34.880 align:start size:41% position:59%
- Absolutely.

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:36.816 align:start position:0%
- 'Cause I am--
I'm not into 'em.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:37.917 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Frankly, I find the plot

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.552 align:end position:100%
to most
of the "Star Wars" movies

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:40.653 align:start size:59% position:41%
to be a little dry.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.288 align:start position:0%
- If George Lucas
was here right now,

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:43.689 size:81% position:41%
what would you say to him?

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:45.758 align:end position:100%
- "Thank goodness you're not
in control anymore."

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.026 align:start position:0%
- Oh!

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.461 size:88% position:44%
What about that neck of his?

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.463 size:81% position:41%
Quite the wattle he's got.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
Is your opinion of him
universal amongst Jedis?

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.335 align:start size:16% position:84%
- No.

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:57.370 align:end position:100%
Some actually really like
the prequels.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.371 align:start size:63% position:38%
I'm not one of them.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.673
- Who's the most famous Jedi?

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:03.542 align:end position:100%
- Probably the guy I had
drinks with last night,

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:04.543 align:start size:41% position:59%
Opie Macleod.

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:05.544 align:start position:0%
- You had drinks
last night

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
with Opie Macleod
here in LA?

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:07.780 align:start size:69% position:31%
- Yeah, he lives here.

00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:08.814 align:start position:0%
- Good one, guys.

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.483 align:start position:0%
Let that one slip through
the crack.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:13.486 align:start position:0%
Opie Macleod was right under our
goddamn noses the whole time.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.321 align:start position:0%
You want to hear
my Yoda impression?

00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:16.555 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Sure.

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:17.623 align:start position:0%
- [nasally] Yoda.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.058 align:start position:0%
Y-Yoda.

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:22.395 align:start position:0%
[stammers]

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.764 align:start position:0%
What's something
I should say as Yo--

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.766 align:start size:69% position:31%
- Breathe, you should.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.634 align:start position:0%
- Yoda sounds v--

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.002 align:start position:0%
Yoda and--

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:31.837 align:start position:0%
[normal voice] Yoda sounds
a lot like Miss Piggy.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.974 align:end position:100%
- Aren't they voiced
by the same person, Frank Oz?

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:37.777 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.011 align:start position:0%
Whoo.

00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
[bleep] head exploded.

00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:42.848 align:start position:0%
Did you know that?

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.318 align:start position:0%
Goddamn, this nerd [bleep]
is cool.

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
When did you lose
your virginity?

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:48.821 align:start size:34% position:66%
- I was 13.

00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:50.056 align:start position:0%
- Oh, my God.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.324 align:start position:0%
That's way too young.

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:52.525 align:start size:53% position:47%
- Yeah, probably.

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.627 align:start position:0%
- That is so young.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.962
Such a--such a force you had.

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:58.564 align:start position:0%
I'm jealous.

00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:00.866 align:start position:0%
I was so self-conscious
about my penis.

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:02.902 size:81% position:41%
And then I also remember
this guy in seventh grade,

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:05.805 align:start position:0%
Shane [bleep], that had
arguably the biggest dick

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.340 align:start position:0%
I've ever seen.

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:09.742 align:start position:0%
And I can remember it
clear as day.

00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:11.077 size:84% position:42%
Just--he was a good friend.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.112 align:start position:0%
Just the biggest dick.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:14.814 align:start position:0%
It was so long.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:15.815 size:81% position:41%
It was just hanging there.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:16.816 size:81% position:41%
And I just remember going,

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.785 align:start position:0%
"I can never let him see
my penis."

00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
Mine was so small
compared to his.

00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:22.855 align:start size:38% position:63%
- [whistles]

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:24.557 size:88% position:44%
- Oh, I bet it's huge today.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.758 align:start size:38% position:63%
- [whistles]

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:27.526 align:start position:0%
- All right, enough
of this penis talk.

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.662 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna pretend I don't have
an itch in my eye.

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:33.999 align:start size:31% position:69%
- [laughs]

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:36.035 align:start position:0%
- I would have given you
all of my money

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:39.438 align:start position:0%
and converted right there
if that would have went away.

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:41.574 align:start position:0%
Can Jedis make love
longer than most?

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.109 align:start size:44% position:56%
- Hard to say.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.577 align:start position:0%
- I assume you're
a selfless lover,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.045 size:75% position:38%
or is that not the case?

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:47.480 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, no,
that's totally the case.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:48.748 align:start position:0%
- Do you always finish?

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.683 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Mm...

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:53.085 align:start position:0%
