00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.600
Australia’s Great Barrier Reef: 133,000 square miles! Nearly 400 different types of coral!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.040
And it’s all dead. Wait, no it’s not.
Yea, it is. Well maybe a little.

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.600
Depending on who’s posting on your Facebook
feed, the Great Barrier Reef is either doing

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.850
just fine or it’s teetering on the brink
of destruction. So should you cancel those

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.090
tickets to Australia? Is there even anything
left to see?

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.880
A coral reef is an underwater structure made
of, you guessed it corals. And while those

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.600
corals might look like a collection of snazzy-looking
rocks, they’re actually the exoskeletons

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.829
of living invertebrates. They eat, reproduce,
grow, all the stuff anything else living in

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.390
the water does. They also drop dead if the
conditions they’re living in aren’t quite

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.489
right. Conveniently, corals have a pretty
clear way of showing their health. If everything

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.780
is A-OK, the corals will all be colored earth-tones,
like 1970s living room furniture. When

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.980
they get sick, they can become fluorescent.
And when the coral turns white or becomes

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.980
“bleached,” well, then that means it’s
dying and that its recovery is in question.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.060
So, is The Great Barrier Reef dead or not?
Well, it suffered a massive bleaching event

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.060
in each of the past two years as a result
of rising ocean temperatures due to global

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.720
warming. The extreme nature of 2016’s bleaching
led to this: a slightly satirical obituary

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.110
for the reef that wound up going viral. That
caused environmental reporters to try and

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.750
stop the spread of any misinformation clarifying
that, while the reef was in poor health, it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.750
wasn’t actually dead.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.329
So, then it’s fine, right? I mean, you also
might have seen this in your Facebook feed,

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.590
a report that UNESCO, the United Nations body
that lists the Great Barrier Reef as a World

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.460
Heritage Site, did not put the reef on its
“List of World Heritage Sites in Danger”.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.509
Well, that decision was actually criticised
on social media, pointing out that the reef

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.189
is absolutely in great danger, something UNESCO
itself has even previously suggested.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.480
So who’s right? Scientists? UNESCO? Outside
Magazine? Well, the bleaching events are not

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.380
normal, before 2016 there were only two bleaching
events in the previous 17 years. And while

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.250
a reef can recover from bleaching, that can
take up to a decade, making the back to back

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.420
events that much more concerning. Fortunately,
Australia is trying to do its part, allocating

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.790
over a billion dollars over the next five
years to help repair the reef as part of its

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.459
Reef 2050 plan. And that’s no surprise,
given the tourism it attracts and its estimated

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.560
financial value. So no, the Great Barrier
Reef is not dead. But ⅔ of it is damaged

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.879
with its recovery in question. Now if someone
just shared this video instead of those other

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.900
articles, we could maybe all get on the same
page. Please share the video.
