00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone I'm Tomoko Steen

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.890
at Science Technology
and Business Division.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.410 position:56%
Today's event is as you mentioned
sponsored by the Asian Division here

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.610
and also French Society
and also Science

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.410
and Technology and
Business Division.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.040
It's a wonderful corporation
with the Asian Division

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.060
and we usually have
much more dry room.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.340
This is a very beautiful room
we can have the speaker in.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:06.700 position:56%
So today's speaker, Professor Joanna
Lewis is the associate professor

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.150
at Georgetown's Science
Technology Society.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.410
Oh no no. Science and Technology
and International Affairs

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.710
at the Georgetown University's
Foreign Service Institute.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.570
Its official name is Edmund
Walsh School of Foreign Service

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.400
and her research focus is energy,
environment, innovation in China.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.810
Some people say that green
energy in China is oxymoron,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.780
but it's not actually
[laughter] true.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.730
With Dr. Lewis advising
you know the China is going

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.350
to be leading the green energy
in the world [assumed spelling]

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.430
and also Dr. Lewis is leading
[inaudible] project and it's kind

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.580
of hard to understand
the project name.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.710
International Partnerships
and Technological Leapfrogging

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.730
in China's Clean Energy Sectors and
it's Leapfrogging so she is going

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.310
to explain to you more about this.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.610
And also her book, recent book,
Green Innovation in China received

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.110
in 2014 Harold and
Margaret Sprout Award

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.740
by the International Studies
Association for best book

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.580
for that year in environmental
studies.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.830
I think you all should read it

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.210
and also she was National
Academy's Committee

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.900
on the US China Corporation on
Electricity from Renewables.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.500 position:56%
So this National Academy has many
the committees and produce monograph

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.990 position:56%
and if you're interested you I can
actually point to you the monograph.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.980
She has advised domestic

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.360 position:56%
and international agencies including
domestic one is UNIDO and USAID.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:24.810
So she was advisory board to ACORE
also and the US-China Program.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.560
So she has Ph.D. from the Berkeley
and also M.A. from Berkeley

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.750
and I know some of you
actually Berkeley graduate

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.510
and before further do please join
me the welcoming Professor Lewis.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.320
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.620
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.090
Thank you all for coming this
afternoon and I'm very appreciative

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.780
of the invitation to
speak with you today

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.820
so thank you very much
for having me.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.000
Today the title of my
talk is China's Rule

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.050
in Global Clean Energy
Technology Development

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.010 position:56%
and so I thought I would speak a bit

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.350
about what is happening
generally both internationally

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.410
and domestically in China as
it relates to clean energy.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.700 position:56%
Particularly how this is influencing
the international discussion

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.350
on climate change and the
climate change negotiations

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.140
in the United Nations.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.270
I want to start by mentioning
the recent bilateral deal

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.800 position:56%
between China and the United States.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.790
You may remember last November
the Presidents came together

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.780
for a summit and announced
what I think many of us

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.520
in this field thought was
really a ground breaking deal

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.120
between the two countries,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.690 position:56%
in that both countries just
simultaneously announced the actions

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.860
that they were going to do to
address climate change and I think

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.470
that this is an extremely important
not just for what's happening

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.150
in both countries domestically,
which I'll talk about,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.340
but particularly for the
upcoming climate talks

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.620
that we'll be taking place in
Paris at the end of this year.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.400
Whereas you may know
countries are trying

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.480
to reach a new global agreement
on climate change following

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.930
on the Kyoto Protocol and
then negotiations since then.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.270
So the key elements
of this announcement

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.120
which were particularly notable
the United States of course agreed

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.410
to take on an economy-wide
target to reduce its emissions 26

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.700
to 28 percent from 2005
levels by 2025 and to try

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.610
to do this actually the
more aggressive end.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.950
China also for the first time
announced that it would try

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.910
to achieve the peaking of CO2
emissions around the year 2030

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.680
and to try to peak early
as well as announced a goal

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.060
to increase the share
of non-fossil fuels

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.260
in primary energy to
20 percent by 2030.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.580
This includes renewable energy
as well as nuclear power

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.920
and so this announcement was really
done with the intention of trying

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.840
to really motivate
other countries as well

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.230
in the international climate talks.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.790
So China's goals from last
November have now been enshrined

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.370
in its pledge that it has submitted
to the United Nations in advance

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.750
of Paris and so this includes
the targets I mentioned as well

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.790
as a new what we call carbon
intensity target as well.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.530
So I think these are
quite significant

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.960
because of course this
is the first time

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.900
that China has actually mentioned
its emissions would peak.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.190
If you study China energy
data, which I'm sure many

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.860 position:56%
of you are familiar with the
statistics, for many years it looked

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.220
like China's emissions
both its energy consumption

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.740 position:56%
and its greenhouse gas emissions
would essentially grow exponentially

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.300
for the coming decades.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.830
And so all the modeling
projections coming out of China

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.300
and the United States and other
places essentially just showed an

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.600
upwards slope.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.020
It's really just been in the last
few years where we've realized

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.240
that that's not actually the case
because domestic energy trends,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.540
which I'll talk a bit about today.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.920
And so I think that you
know the real question is,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.890 position:56%
which I want to focus on which these
are really the topic of my research,

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.350
how can China transition
to a lower carbon economy?

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.420
And to do that of course it does
take clean energy technology.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.810
So a lot of my work actually looks

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.250
at how China has acquired
clean energy technology.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.130 position:56%
Where is that technology coming from

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.150
and whether China is
contributing to green innovation?

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.560
I'll just talk about this briefly
today, but that was the topic

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.420 position:56%
of my last book and then finally I
want to end with a bit of discussion

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.240
about how the United States
and China are cooperating.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.180
And could continue to cooperate
on clean energy and why

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.960
that I think that's important.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.010
So I mentioned that in the target
when China announced a peak year

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.780
for the first time, when we see
this is a study that was done both

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.960
by researchers at GNY
[assumed spelling] and MIT here

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.820
which shows a very similar
peak projection for China

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.170
and I show you this to
point out that essentially

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.740
if China's total carbon
emissions are at a peak

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.060
in the year 2030 you would
essentially have to scale

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.760
up clean energy extremely
substantially.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:14.610
If you can see here on the chart
the yellow bar, the green bar,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.000
the purple bar this is
wind, solar, hydropower,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.030
natural gas all are going to
have to be scaled up dramatically

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.870
and then you see down here on
the bottom the dark blue is coal.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.950
And you see coal essentially
leveling off

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:30.970
and then declining quite rapidly
between now and the year 2050.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.530 position:56%
Again this is not something that you
know many people thought would be

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.830
possible for China.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.510
China still gets about 2/3 of
its primary energy from coal

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.860 position:56%
and about 80 percent of electricity.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.110
So you know as you
mentioned earlier clean energy

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.310
in China you know many people say,
China's not doing clean energy,

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.910
but this is you know really
about where China's is going.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.840
Right and where it will
have to go if it's going

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.560
to actually achieve
this emissions peak.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.280
This is the chart just showing
you where China's energy has come

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.510
from over the last few decades and
again as you can see coal is just

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.340
by far the largest share, but I
think what has really driven a lot

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.960
of these this changes

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.430
in diversifying China's
energy supply is the desire

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.350
to become more efficient
and how energy is consumed.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.460
China actually between 1980
and 2000 approximately was able

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.370
to quadruple its economy while
only doubling energy demand

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.730 position:56%
and this is actually extremely
impressive no other country has been

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.800
able to achieve that
rate of improvement.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.550
And so that's the declining line
you see sort of after 1980 here

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.320
on this chart, but if you look at
this little like blip in the chart

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.060
where in the early 2000's you
actually had energy use growing

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.980
faster than economic
growth for the first time

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.690
in several decades in China.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.650
This actually caught the
attention of the leadership

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.180
because this essentially means

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.380
that their overall economy
was becoming less efficient.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.630
This also had to do with a
resurgence of heavy industry

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.410
and as you know China is trying
to move away from heavy industry,

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.040
manufacturing, cement, iron,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.060
steel to more higher
value added industries

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.860
that essentially take less energy

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.740
to produce the same
unit of economic growth.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.610
This is better for them overall
from an energy security perspective

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.170
and this is better
for the environment

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.270
from an emissions perspective.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.000
And then of course there
are many other advantages

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.300
to reducing coal use.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.950
In China one of course for
those of you who spent time

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.110
in China you know well
is air pollution.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.490
Local air pollution is a current,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.200
like a very big concern
not just for human health.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.530
It's one of the leading causes of
early mortality in the country,

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.980
but also you know there
are concerns about sort

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.670
of the public becoming less
satisfied with the current quality

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.460 position:56%
of the air and this could lead to
stability issues which of course are

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.760
of top concern for the government.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.660
This is actually a paper my
student did that looked at on days

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.790
when the PM2.5, the
particulate levels are very high,

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.360
people are [inaudible] essentially
complaining and talking about it

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.570
and people are very very aware of
air pollution levels in their day

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:03.770
to day, their day to
day activities in China.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.350 position:56%
So I want to move to talk now what's
happening in clean energy there.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.790
So globally I think
it's important to point

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.250
out clean energy is actually now

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.670
about a $300 billion
dollar a year industry.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.010
We used to think of clean energy
as this sort of little niche sector

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.910
with a little bit of money
going into it here and there.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.570
There's more money on an
annual basis now going

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.290
into so-called clean energy
than there is dirty energy.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.000
Just because when we look at
new capacity that's being built,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.700
new power plants in the
United States for example,

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.480
almost all the new power plants
we're building here are either

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.030
natural gas which are fossil
plants, but cleaner than coal

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.120
and then wind power, solar power.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.650
In most years we're actually wind

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.410
and solar power growth rates are
much faster than they are in gas

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.620
and we have not built a new
coal plant here in a while.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.760
We have not built new nuclear
plant either in a while.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.210
China has played a very
big role in this investment

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.110
and in fact wind energy
in China where a lot

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.090
of my research is focused is
represents the single largest

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.140
investment in any clean energy
technology that any country

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.350
around the world has
made in the last decade.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.960
So that's really it's quite
substantial just the amount

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.260
of investment that has gone

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.970
into growing the wind
power sector in China.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.620
So while I showed you
in the early charts

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.950
that coal is still a huge
share of energy in China,

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.230
coal is not going away tomorrow
right, and I don't mean to imply

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.280 position:56%
that it is, but again if you look
at what's going in annually in terms

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.870
of new plants we see this
real shift that's taking place

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.600
in the last few years.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.770
Where if you go back you know about
ten years ago, China was putting

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:37.150
in 80 almost 100 new gigawatts
of coal plants a year.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.690
That's you know roughly
you heard the figures,

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.760
that's like two new plants a week
essentially, large coal plants,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.590
but those numbers have really
slowed down quite a bit.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.210
And so China is building
much fewer coal plants.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.670 position:56%
There's actually been a lot of media
reporting in the last few days,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.820
they may put a moratorium
on new coal plants.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.180
They already have done this in some

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.640
of the most polluted
parts of eastern China.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.660
So when you look at you
know there's still a need

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.030
for growing electricity supply
and so what's being built?

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.840
Still hydropower, but also
wind power, solar power,

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.220
nuclear power playing
increasingly important role

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.040
and I haven't updated
this yet for last year,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.570
but you would see this trend
continuing and even increasing.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.330 position:56%
So I think it was 2013 was the first
year China actually installed more

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.560
non-fossil capacity than fossil
capacity in a single year.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.960
So that's a real shift.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.200
So I mentioned wind power has been
a real success story in China.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.480
This is showing you the growth
that we've seen just in wind energy

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.450
over the last decade or so
and you can see that you know

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.170
for a while the United States and
China were sort of neck and neck.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.480
China has now installed
far more wind turbines

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.880
than the United States.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.710
Although if you actually look
at electricity production coming

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.670
from these wind turbines
there is some concern

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.850
that they're operating less
efficiently than they could be.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.620
Mostly due to constraints on the
electric grid which I'll talk

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.610
about in a moment and you also
I should mention there's many

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.300
companies globally which is what
my book looks at that in China,

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.050
which are now manufacturing state

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.340
of the art wind power technologies
selling this technology in China

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.760
and exporting it around
the world as well.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.890
Solar has also been
in more recent years,

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.280 position:56%
a really big success story in China.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.620
China installed more solar power
last year than you know the rest

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.560
of the world sort of
installed that year

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.150
and there soon will have more solar

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.190
than you know the United States
many other countries combined.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.820
It's really quite dramatic
the growth we're seeing there.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.610
Part of this is due to the
fact that China has built

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.800
up a very successful manufacturing
industry in solar technology

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.570 position:56%
and so these costs of the technology
have come down very dramatically.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.300
Cost of solar I believe it's

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.790
about a 60 percent cost
reduction in the last five years.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.390
So suddenly when solar was much
too expensive is what China many

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.590
countries believed a few years ago.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.100
It's now cost competitive with most

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.590
of the other technologies
they would be looking at.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.280
Particularly if you look

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.710
at externality cost as
well like pollution.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:02.330
So there's very aggressive targets
to expand all these technologies.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.630
I won't go through them in detail.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.140
This is showing you different
scenarios for how China might scale

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.920
up different low carbon energy
technologies in the coming years

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.270
and they're you know really
quite aggressive scenarios

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.570
that people are looking at.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.980
This is one study that
I participated

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.480
in which was done jointly with
The Energy Research Institute

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.160
of the National Development
Reform Commission in China along

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.910
with several international experts
and funded by the Energy Foundation

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.510
to look at you know what could
a very high penetration scenario

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.160
of renewable energy look
like for China in 2050?

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.760
Essentially what would
be the maximum scenario?

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.320
This is more of a visioning study.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.690
This isn't necessarily
what will happen right?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.370
This is you know if China did
the best they could do you know,

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.050
went sort of changed all models,

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.640
went beyond all projections
you know.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.040
What could they do that
could actually be realistic?

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.170
And they actually showed
that China could get

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.710
to 60 percent non-fossil sources
in total energy and 80 percent

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.110
of its electricity
generation by 2050.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.800
So remember right now that
they're at 80 percent coal

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.470
so this would be a very
dramatic transformation

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.890
and it wouldn't be easy.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.520
This is a chart just showing you
what this would actually look

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.060
like on the ground so you can see
again coal takes this very steep

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.810
decline in order to allow the
other sources to scale up.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.010
You see huge increases in solar.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.400
Both solar electricity as well
as solar for heating, geothermal

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.550 position:56%
and other types of renewable energy.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.290
And this is what you know
essentially the trajectory

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.770
for how wind and solar would have
to be scaled extremely rapidly

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.870
over the next couple of decades.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.170
I think it's important to think

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.350
about where would this
go in China right?

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.220 position:56%
So for many of you are very familiar
with the geography of the countries.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.080
So actually it's a Inner
Mongolia is where most

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.620
of the wind power is
being developed in China.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.550
If you've been there you
know there's a lot of sort

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.850
of flat grasslands,
plains, a lot of wind

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.600
and it's been an extremely
good place

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.760
for wind development
particularly the eastern part

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.340
of inner Mongolia is connected to
the same electric grid as Beijing.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.720
So this is actually is useful
for helping feed the power demand

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.340
of eastern China and
northeastern China.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.470
But you can see that if
you really wanted to get

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.580
to this really you know
high scenario of wind.

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.250
You've got to put wind
turbines everywhere

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.990
and this is a problem right
because there's not a lot

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.350
of just empty land that's not
being used for other things.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.780
You can do sort of
dual use agriculture

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.680
and wind with solar as well.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.230 position:56%
This is the possibility, but you can
see them essentially if you're going

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.080
to put wind particularly throughout
the northern part of the country

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.390
to some extent in the southern part

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.220
and you know lesser
extent in the west.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.590
You would need to essentially
move this electricity

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.820
to where the demand is.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.210
You can see the same
thing for solar.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.330
Solar's actually a bigger issue
because the best solar resources

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.170 position:56%
in China are in the far western part

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.750
of the country particularly
Xinjiang,

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.620
Tibet and you know it you can
imagine how challenging it would be

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.500
if you sort of put a lot
of solar farms out there,

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.290
then you move that electricity

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.160
to Shanghai this is a you
know very complex transmission

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.470
and very inefficient
transmission process.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.720
And this again this
is talking about solar

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.400
that would far exceed the power
demand even the you know what

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.000
already exist in those provinces.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.130
Even under a scenario without
economic development would continue

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.130
and these provinces
would grow substantially

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.430
in the next couple of decades.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.610 position:56%
So you would need to essentially put

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.240
in significant transmission
capacity.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.640
This is power lines right?

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.740
You'd have to build extensive
infrastructure you know

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.040
around the country.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.340
This is costly.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.560
This is something China
is doing, starting to do,

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.970
but it's bigger than this.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.570 position:56%
It's also thinking about how our
markets power sector reform is a big

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.030
issue right now in China.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.780
How you think about
pricing these technologies.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.590
How you incentivize the
current large power companies.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.610
Which are all still state
owned very powerful companies.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.650
The grid companies very very
powerful company in China sacred.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.980
You know they are not as excited
about this vision I should I say

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.840
of the future because it implies
a you know very different model

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.390
from what they're used
to and quite a few costs.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.810
And you know it is a very
different type of power grid

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.010
when you're integrating as we call
it, intermittent resources right?

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.620
The sun is not always shining.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.890
The wind's not always blowing
so you have to actually think

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.370
about how you keep the lights
on given this these sort

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.990
of new resources and there
are ways which we can talk

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.590
about if you're interested.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:21.090
And then finally on this scenario
you know of course if you switch

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.900 position:56%
to this you know very cleaner vision

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.910
of clean energy you get
very dramatic rejections

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.210
in air pollutants right.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.760
Sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.210
so this would be overall
beneficial for health.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.860
One other thing that's happening
which could be quite important

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.080
in China for incentivizing this
transition is the introduction

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.370
of a so-called cap and trades
system for carbon dioxide.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.510
So you know for many years
here in the United States just

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.250
about a block away there've
been very active debates

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.710
about whether the United States
should put a cap on its emissions

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.380
and then develop an
emissions trading system

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.500
where by companies
would trade by permits,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.450
trade permits the most
efficient way possible.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.400
The United States actually
helped to pioneer this model

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.030
for sulfur dioxide control.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.750
In the northeast it was
extremely successful.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.050
This is you know for people

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.400
who study environmental policy
this is believed to be one

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.880
of the most effective,
most cost effective

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.390 position:56%
and environmentally effective
environmental regulations we've ever

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.990
done here and so the ideas that
this could apply to carbon.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.290
We're not actually doing

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.550
that in this country although a
couple states are looking at this.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.950
California and a few others, but
China has announced they're going

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.100
to do a national program
starting in 2017

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.830 position:56%
and right now they have seven pilots

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.640
which are underway
essentially experimenting

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.740
with this and how it might work.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.530
There are policies and I won't
go into this for time and detail,

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.880
but you know throughout the
different government ministries

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.410
and agencies in China which support
clean energy from a variety of ways

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.330
so the Ministry of Science and
Technology is supporting research

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.500
and development in many
of the new technologies

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.900
which will be important.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.650
Other agencies like the National
Development and Reform Commission,

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.460
National Energy Commission helps
support large demonstration

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.800
projects, support subsidies
to promote these technologies

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.790
and these are you know spread
throughout the economy.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.280
When you look at innovation
coming out of China,

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.020
this is just showing you US patent
applications in clean energy.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.810 position:56%
So this is an imperfect measure I
would say off the bat of innovation,

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.910
particularly in China because this
is the US view not the China view.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.740
You can look at these data
for the US for China as well

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.950
from the State Intellectual
Property Office, but this is coming

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.250
out of the US Patent Office.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.770
You see that even in the United
States Chinese innovation,

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.940
Chinese patenting activities are
already starting to show up here

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.310
in terms of you know very
active inventors filing

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.780
in the United States for inventions
in clean energy particularly

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.100
in areas like clean coal,
carbon capture technologies.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.370
These are all areas where China

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.570
if they're not leading now they
may be leading in five, ten years.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:03.120
So I want to end with just a bit
of a discussion about cooperation.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.900
I think there's a lot of reasons
why it makes sense for countries

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.720
around the world to cooperate
with China on clean energy.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.080
Essentially if you know we
have a lot of things going

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.890
on politically related
to clean energy.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.190
There's trade tensions.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.490
There's disputes right now

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.240
in the World Trade Organizations
surround Chinese solar panels

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.540
as you may know.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.860
I think if you have a more
cooperative perspective

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.290
that can help to ease these broader
political and trade tensions,

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.260
but from a more technical side
if you're actually collaborating

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.010
on R&amp;D there's actually things
that the US does do better.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.310
There's things China does better.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.380
There's things Germany does better
in terms of having expertise.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.630
Having ability to bring things to
scale quickly and so if you're sort

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.720
of bringing together the best of
the scientific and technical bodies

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.350
of these different countries
you can actually speed the rate

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.650
of innovation.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.340
Bring down the cost more quickly
if you can deal with this sort

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.720
of the framework for
how you do this and one

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.540
of those sticking points does tend
to be intellectual property rights.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.920
So if I invent something you
know collaboratively with you

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.280 position:56%
and we're both from different
countries how do we share the output

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.660
of those innovations.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.140
Sounds simple often it's not right

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.370
and you know governments
get involved in this.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.170
Governments you know are
a part of the R&amp;D process.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:20.070 position:56%
Private companies are increasingly
important in the clean energy space,

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.410
but governments can play an
important role in helping

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.920
to facilitate these partnerships
making sure everyone feels

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.410
comfortable with the playing field

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.670
and then scientists
can do their job right.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.580
So I want to mention
one model of this

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.560
that I think is working
extremely well.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.520
This is something called the US
China Clean Energy Research Center

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.820
the CRC.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.950 position:56%
This is something that was
established back in November of 2009

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:48.330
when President Obama first entered
office and back when Secretary Chu

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.370
of the then Secretary of
Energy was then the Secretary

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.080 position:56%
of Energy this is you know a
project that he felt strongly about.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.650 position:56%
It was the first initiative to set
up collaborative R&amp;D in clean energy

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:02.700
between the US and China
on a scale of this nature.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.000
This is a huge endeavor.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.470
There are up into the first phase
of the project had about you know

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.150
over 80 projects happening
simultaneously in the US and China.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.930
This brings together researchers
from multiple universities,

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.920
multiple national laboratories,
private companies all working side

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:24.020 position:56%
by side on a variety of clean energy
technologies focusing on coal,

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.190
efficient buildings and
efficient vehicle technology.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:33.080
And what's also quite novel about
this is that anyone who decided

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.480
to join this agreement, so all the
labs and governments and companies

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.200
that are part of this signed and
intellectual property agreement

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.970
that said you know
anything that comes

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.010
out of this will be shared equally
among all the researchers whether

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:46.300
they're from the United
States or China.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.920
So this has been a really
interesting model and one

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.760
that I'm watching closely.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.910
The bilateral relationship
has really I think picked

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.540
up steam in the last few months.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.750
Last month in mid-September there
was a Climate Leaders' Summit,

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.340
a US-China Climate Leaders' Summit

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.800
in Los Angeles you
may have heard about.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.590
This was actually the first time
where a lot of mayors and governors

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.300
and cities from both
countries got involved and took

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.620
on specific pledges
related to climate change.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.480
And again the idea here is that
it's great to have the presidents

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.210
from sign off on these high level
plans and goals, but at the end

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.140
of the day it's one
thing for Beijing to take

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.500
on a huge target it's another
thing for you know the mayor

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.940
of Guangzhou [assumed spelling]
to say that we're going

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.960
to do this you know
here in our city.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.260
We're going to implement this

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.880
and this is what it's
going to look like right.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.040
So this is the type of thing that
was being discussed at this meeting

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.740
and then of course we have the
state visit just a few weeks ago

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.670
where President Shi
was here in Washington.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.170
And you saw some important
things come out of this.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:48.240
This was sort of the last time the
presidents were meeting officially

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.380
before the Climate
Negotiations in Paris.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.820
Although they'll be
meeting informally

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.830
in the G-20 and a few other place.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.130
A few things came out of this.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.910
First of all was this
public announcement

00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.210
about the trading system

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.260
which I mentioned earlier this was
the first time you actually had the

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.150
president of China say that this is
where China was going to do and so

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.170
that was a pretty big deal.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:13.300
China also announced in the context
of its broader power Sector Reforms

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.090
that they're going to do something
called green power dispatch.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.740
This essentially gives priority
when you're operating the grid,

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.540
as I mentioned earlier,
where if you know instead

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.570
of dispatching a cold plant
first, if it's available,

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.050
if you have wind power or solar
power also ready to be fed

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.550
into the grid and power the city

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.000
that you actually you
do those first.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.870
So you sort of use all
the clean energy first

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.380
and only use the dirtier
energy as a backup source.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.990
So again this is something
they're been experimenting with

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.920
and will be interesting to see if
they can do this on a large scale.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.310
A bunch of other things announced.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.590
Heavy duty vehicle emissions
is if you again if you've been

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:54.380
in China this is trucks, this
very polluting source of emissions

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.120
and so something they're
going to start regulating.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.210
On the international side you
know, sticking points for Paris

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.940
where essentially if China
and United States can come

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.920
to some agreement, I think we
have hope for broader agreement

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.920
because these are really quite
quite difficult political issues.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.140
One is just around what we call
transparency, transparency in data

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.710
and measurement is actually
a very complicated issue

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.520
and one that's very
important if you're going

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.360
to start making these
pledges people want

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.210
to know how do we know
you're meeting them?

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:28.800
How do we know what your
emissions actually look like?

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.620
Financing is extremely important

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.360
so we have created something
internationally called the Green

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.660
Climate Fund.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.280
This is based in Korea.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.520
It includes pledges made
by countries from all

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.470
over the world primarily
industrialized countries.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.860
Although China has made a
somewhat surprising announcement

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.410
to many people that it would fund
essentially the same dollar amount

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:49.710
as the United States.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.890 position:56%
It essentially met the United
States on a dollar for dollar basis,

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.290
but it put that money into
the China South South Climate

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.590
Cooperation Fund.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.440
So this is a fund that
China has helped establish

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.100
to help support other developing
countries in transitioning

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.460 position:56%
to low carbon technology, but
that's quite significant this is the

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.610
largest you know dollar amount
that China has announced

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.920
that it would put in to
this type of support.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.950
And then finally there's also
a really interesting discussion

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:20.340
happening in the International
Export Financing Community

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.960
about ending financing for
coal plants around the world.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.620
So this is something that OPEC here

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.860
in the United States
has stopped doing.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.950
This is something that you know
particularly is China is becoming

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:36.020
increasingly active in the NAIB
the New Asian Infrastructure Bank.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.500
Many are wondering is this going

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.450
to help build coal
plants around the road.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:40.860
I support Chinese Coal Technology

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.740
or will it help export Chinese Wind
Technology Solar Technology right.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.610
So this will be I think
very interesting to watch.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:52.240
So what does this all
mean for Paris next month?

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.150
So for those of you who'll
be watching this meeting

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.620
that starts November 30th.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.740
You'll be you know this
will be quite interesting.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.560
They'll be many heads
of state there.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.960
I was at a meeting last
week with Secretary Kerry

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.920
where he said he planned to be on
the ground for the entire two weeks

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.730
of the meeting if necessary
to make sure it goes well.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.100
Which is not normal.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.610
So I think that shows the
significance that the US government

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:16.690
and other governments
are placing on this.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:20.820
I think it's really helpful
that we've seen this evolution

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.640
in bilateral in the bilateral
relationship between China

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.110
and the United States on
climate change, on clean energy

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.230
because that wasn't the case
just a few years ago and I think

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.720
that this you know we're much
more aligned politically in terms

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.390
of where both countries are going
in seeing this a priority issue

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:41.100
for for domestic implementation
not just

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.250
for the international community.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.580
We've had all these
new agreements signed

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.660 position:56%
and I should say you know the United
States has been signing agreements

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.120
with all kinds of countries
around the world.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.800
They've signed new agreements with
India, with Mexico, with Brazil.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.770
China has signed many agreements
with other important countries

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.780
in the negotiations so I think both
countries are playing an important

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.920
role in trying to bring
others along.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.860
In this agreement and you
know you see things showing

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.130
up in these bilateral agreements

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.850
that for a long time were
just really difficult issues

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.830
in the negotiations.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:16.330
Things like intellectual
property as I mentioned

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.390
and you know we've seen the
bilateral announcements lead

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.710
to what countries are
pledging directly in the UN.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.930 position:56%
So you know this is I think a really
important Segway from bilateral

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:28.710
to multilateral and you know all

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.200 position:56%
in all I think this just sets a much
better working environment heading

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.710
into the climate negotiations
in Paris.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.310
And makes us really
much better poised

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.760 position:56%
for some sort of successful outcome.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.850
We can talk about what that would
look like if you're interested,

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.590
but I you know I think for those
of you who remember Copenhagen

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.790
and the outcome of that meeting.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.020
We're in a very different
place now both

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.330
in the international
negotiations, but particularly

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.650
in the US-China relationship which
I do think is quite determine

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:58.770
of the potential success
of the meeting.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.510
So I will stop there
and I'd be happy

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.510
to take any questions thank you.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:08.900
[ Applause ]

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.950
&gt;&gt; Question, please
repeat your question.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.250
&gt;&gt; Okay, sure yes.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.550
As since yes sir.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:18.570
&gt;&gt; Could you give me a
little deeper assessment

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.440
of the the US-China
cooperation when it comes

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:26.360
to clean coal technology program?

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.330
What did you do see
anything commercial coming

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.810
out of the agreement?

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.410
So the question was
could you speak a bit

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.020
about clean coal technology
cooperation

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.450 position:56%
between China and the United States.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.660
This has been a big
topic of cooperation

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.100
because you know both
countries still rely on coal

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.750
for the majority of their energy.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.620
However you know if you
think about climate change

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.020
and how you can continue
to burn coal and deal

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.800
with climate change the main
technological solution we've come

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.160
up with is something called
carbon capture and sequestration.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.160
So the idea here for those
of you who aren't familiar is

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.270
that you essentially capture the
carbon either before you burn the

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.220
coal, after you burn
the coal, you take it,

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.200
you sequester it probably
underground in geologic formations.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.790
We technically know how to do this,
but it's very expensive and also

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.570
if you're running a coal plant

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.630
and you're also running the carbon
capture equipment you potentially

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:23.420
have a 1/3 essentially you know
a 30 plus percent energy penalty

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.560 position:56%
so you're actually burn more coal to
get the same amount of electricity

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.970 position:56%
if you're also capturing the carbon.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.190
I hope I explained that clearly.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.440
Anyway that's been a
big focus of cooperation

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.740
between the two countries,

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.830
but I think it has been much
slower than many people hoped.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.800
Mostly because of the
cost and the sort

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.670
of technical challenges
which I mentioned.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.780
You know there's a lot of
technical interest in this,

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.870
but not a lot of political
interest and it's very expensive

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:52.030
to build the first few
demonstration demonstration plants.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:54.790
We have a plant here
in the United States

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:59.140
that where this technology's
being demonstrated in conjunction

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.810
with enhanced oil recovery.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.470
So if you can actually use
the carbon carbon dioxide

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.930
to help enhance the way that
which you're extracting oil

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.640
from the ground it makes
it more cost effective.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.660
So this is something
China's doing too.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.580
Quan-Hong [assumed spelling] has
a plant called Green Jen [assumed

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:17.270
spelling] which is in
is one of the places

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.160
where this is being
demonstrated in China as well.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.380
Although again this is
a gasification plant

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.760
that hasn't moved along as quickly

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.800
on the carbon capture
side as many had hoped.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.390
So I think this is still an area
that's going to be it's going

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.110
to you know be a focus,
a cooperation.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.220
The last presidential summit had
some new announcements of projects

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.070
that they're going
to do in this area,

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:40.690
but I actually think it's been sort
of the biggest challenge in terms

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:42.710
of technical cooperation.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.110
In the back yes.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:52.300
&gt;&gt; Have lower crude oil prices
incentivized or [inaudible] more

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.800
in a sense getting clean energy?

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.210
&gt;&gt; Great question.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.200
So the question was have
lower crude oil prices,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.850
how's that affected
clean energy development?

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:07.120
You know it's I would say
there's a lot of concern

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.890
that low oil prices would
essentially mean why should we

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:13.140
invest in clean energy right

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:15.880
because if oil prices are
high we look for alternatives.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.530
If oil prices are low we just
sort of stick with status quo.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.190
Couple problems I think though with
that assumption you know one is

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.820
that in the United
States particularly most

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.420
of our oil is going to
transportation right.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.040
It's going to gasoline petroleum.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.230
Most of our wind/solar et
cetera for electricity right

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.510
and we don't have a lot of electric
cars yet in the United States

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:40.240 position:56%
so these don't tend to actually be
overlapping sort of substitutes yet.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.930 position:56%
In China it's a little bit blurrier,

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:44.820
but because they are
actually starting

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.890
to do electric vehicles
more quickly.

00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:50.240
But again you know I think
this is less of an issue

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.740
for clean energy in
the power sector.

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:57.420
It could change and I think the
biggest thing that's had an impact

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.450
is not so much oil prices,
although it's linked,

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.580
is non-conventional gas
expiration oil and gas.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.150
So particularly the shale gas
right we to hear about here

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:09.870
in the United States which has
really revolutionized the US Energy

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:14.840
System and you know the fact that
we have cheap abundant natural gas

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.180
in a way we did not five years ago.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:21.970
I think that is what is potentially
affecting investment in renewables.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.340
I think because you have
a lot states in the US

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.960
that have pretty aggressive
renewable portfolio standards

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.380
that mandate you actually do
a certain share of renewables.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.770
We've still seen pretty
aggressive growth

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:35.400
in wind and solar for example.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.070
And China has not had
the same success

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:42.090
in domestic shale gas
exploration as the United States,

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.180
although on paper their reserves
are potentially much larger

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.730
than those of the United States.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.670
So down the line if
those get developed

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:54.290
that could I think you know
be a really interesting,

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.880
but China right now
uses a tiny amount

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.780
of natural gas in their
energy system.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:03.110 position:56%
They need more and so for China this
wouldn't necessarily be what we call

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.760
like a bridge fuel in the US,

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.740 position:56%
but this could be a really important
really important source of energy

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.980
for the industrial sector for
power for a variety of uses

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.590
that would substitute coal.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.890
Thank you.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.190
Ah yes.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:20.980
&gt;&gt; Thank you for [inaudible].

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:31.320
I have a question [inaudible]
in the age of ambition,

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:40.390
he commented China does
everything in the fever fashion.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:46.600
So in your expert opinion how long
those new policies [inaudible]

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.330
in research and development
in energy

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.330
and clean energy [inaudible]
sustainable.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.130
Can they be reversed
after another [inaudible]?

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.980
I'm just curious.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah great question.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:04.350 position:56%
So the question was you know are the
policies we're seeing are these sort

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:08.950
of short term policies if I have
it right, fevers you know trends

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:14.610 position:56%
and will they go away in a few years
with the next the next big thing?

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.480 position:56%
You know I think that we've actually
seen that this point about 10

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:24.270
to 15 years of sustained focus on
clean energy investment in China

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:30.930
from the research and development
side and from the deployment side.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:40.210 position:56%
China started really encouraging
when power development in 2002-2003.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:44.880
So it's been more than
10 years since they put

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.440
in place the first
aggressive policies

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.220
and those haven't changed
substantially

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.480 position:56%
if anything they've gotten stronger.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.230
And I think that you know there
of course will be shifts you know

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:59.720
as things evolve, but you know I
think the air pollution problem is

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.020
worse now than it was then.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.400
The I think they've
they understand now

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.320
that they can play extremely
important role globally

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:19.900
in manufacturing these technologies
and be a real competitor

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:28.150
that this is a source of
local economic development.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.670
It's not just an environmental
policy.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.080
It's an economic policy.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.830
So I think there's just a lot

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:48.020 position:56%
of reasons why continued clean
energy support is actually it's sort

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.350
of aligns with the broader
priorities of the government

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:58.280
which are much bigger than sort of
just an you know passing interest

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:05.380
in environmental protection or
in clean energy specifically.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:11.790
So I don't think it's
going anywhere and you know

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:15.110
if anything they'll be new
technologies, they'll be new focus,

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:21.250
but I see that staying quite
central and maybe getting larger.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.550
Yeah.

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.850
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] clean air effort

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.700
and development how long do
you think the [inaudible]

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:31.850
of people can view and see
actually clean air in the cities?

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:36.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah so the question is so
how long till the air is clean?

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.370
When will we see results?

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.760
Well you know it's interesting
you know air pollution is quite

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.140
complicated right.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:47.780
If you reduce one pollutant you're
not you may increase something else

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.460
because there's very interesting
atmospheric chemistry happening

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.640
right and we're actually seeing
right now that if you look

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:58.190
at the data from 2015 to date
everything is lower than last year

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:01.820
and the year before so
pollution is down this year.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.200
If you've been in China this
year you may have felt this.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.880
I was in China in June and I
actually had ten blue sky days

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.470
in a row which was quite amazing,
but that's not a trend right.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.770
Just because I see
blue sky days that's

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:09.070
that doesn't say oh all
the policies are working.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.370
This is a trend because again
these things go up and down.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:11.670
They go up and down because
of the way this depends

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:12.970 position:56%
on broader weather conditions right.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:14.270
There's a lot of factors here.

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.570
So we won't know I think for a few
more years how well these policies

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:16.870
are working, but you know if if
China really does get serious

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.170
about restricting the
building of new coal plants.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:19.470
Of affecting vehicle emissions
in cities the issues tends

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:20.770
to be vehicle related pollution
because at this point a lot

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.370
of the factories and power plants
have been moved outside the city.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:23.670
So depends where you
are with the causes,

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.040
but you know they're controlling
it in sort of all the right places

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.390
and then the question is
just how long will it take

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.690
for the implementation
to lead to results.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:28.990
No. Ah yeah.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.290
&gt;&gt; I have [inaudible] new question
because of putting so much money

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:31.590
in research, how have
space solar research,

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.890
I was very interested
[inaudible] space program

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.190 position:56%
which doesn't have any programs
that leading down to the [inaudible]

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.490 position:56%
and also Korea and Japan [inaudible]

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:36.790
and also [inaudible] clean
energy [inaudible] to the hydro

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:38.090
for the environmental
issue [inaudible].

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:39.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah so the question is about
sort of you know other models

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:42.010
of clean energy space solar
and the environmental impacts

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.820
of wind power and things like this?

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.030
Yes so these are all I
think issues which are sort

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:49.570 position:56%
of just well actually I can't
really speak to the space solar one.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.400
I'd be interested to learn
from you more about that.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.330
I don't follow that as closely, but
in terms of the sighting of wind

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:56.630
and sort of concerns

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.940
about environmental impact I
think you know this is something

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.710
that there needs to
be much more focus on.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:05.860
At the moment the wind the wind
development tends to be far

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.550 position:56%
from populations but that won't last

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.890
if you do the you know the
visions I showed you right

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.970
of the very aggressive
wind development.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.650
You know in this country
the real challenge

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.120
to wind development has
been offshore development

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.150
so you know there's a
lot of potential here in.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:22.790
As I mentioned earlier if you want

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:26.580
to build wind power you ideally
put it near near the load,

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.360
near the people right
where the demand is.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.480
In the US that's essentially
the eastern coastline.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.410
We don't really have empty
space to put huge wind farms

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.970
so you don't see very many
around here, but you know off

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.020
of Massachusetts, off of
New Jersey they're looking

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.920
at doing these offshore projects,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.380
but as you may know not a
single one has been built

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.120
yet in the United States
because they've been tied

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.230
up in you know political
approval procedures,

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:55.790
public you know public
opposition to the projects.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:58.680
People don't want to look at
them essentially and you want

00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.980
to make sure it's not going

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:03.380
to affect the ocean environment,
affect marine shipping.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.680
Things like that.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.980
China actually has
very aggressive targets

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.840
for offshore wind you know partly

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.200 position:56%
because they have some coastline
that's not being used recreationally

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.000
as much, is more industrial.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.080
But it it is still challenging.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.620
It's more expensive to do it
that way and so I think that's

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:20.850
where you've actually seen the
biggest opposition and sort

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:24.000 position:56%
of the slowest the slowest progress.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.300
Yeah in the back.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.890
&gt;&gt; You talk about these long term
emissions production agreements

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.190
between nations.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:36.450
What is your understanding with
the monitoring mechanisms will be

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:42.300 position:56%
and what do you foresee that being
one of the main topics in discussion

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.930
in Paris and kind of what?

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.380
Well I'll leave it at that.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah great questions

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.840
so the question is what will
the monitoring mechanisms be

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.300
for the emissions targets

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.640
that countries are are putting
forward in advance of Paris.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.490
This is actually going to be
yeah a large topic of discussion.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:04.950 position:56%
It has been already for a few years,
but the model we're in now leading

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:08.700
up to Paris is that
countries are coming forward

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.000
with what we call INDC's.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.420
These are their Intended
Nationally Determined Contributions

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.720
so what does that mean?

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.980 position:56%
It basically means every countries
sort of makes up what they are going

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.680
to do and they pledge
that to the UN,

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.250
but that they can do
it in any metrics.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:27.970
Any you know they can say we're
going to do renewable energy target

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:33.580
or we're going to reduce carbon
emissions on an intensity basis

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:39.390
or we're going to reduce our growth
rate in emissions off of a baseline

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:42.680
which we've determined is a future
counterfactual of what you know

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.970
and so I don't want to get too
technical right, but essentially

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:50.110
if someone agrees to reduce their
emissions 40 percent from business

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:55.340 position:56%
as usual by 2030, what was
business as usual and how do we know

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.230
if they achieve that or not
and how do we calculate this

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.270
if their metrics are different
from another countries?

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:03.130
So you know long story
short I think the issue

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:05.480
of measurement is extremely
important issue,

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.380
but it's a very political issue
because countries are sensitive

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.040
to essentially having everyone
else inspect their emissions data.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:17.420
You know if you remember back
in 2007 it was it was reported

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.920
by an international organization

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.730
that China's emissions had
surpassed those of the US,

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.440
the next largest emitter and we're
now the largest in the world.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.230
This was back in 2007.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.120 position:56%
That happened many years before even
the US Department of Energy sort

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.780
of expected that would happen.

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.350
But the first response from the
Chinese government was no that's

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:34.650
not accurate.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.990
Like that that didn't happen
right and because honestly

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:38.420
like everyone was still
trying to figure

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.960
out what what was the right number.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.200
Like that you know what are the
measurements and it's very hard

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.580
to get very accurate data on this.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:50.500
I think one of the most
important things that could come

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.570
out of China's National Cap and
Trade Program, I referred to,

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:58.140
would be a robust national
measurement system for carbon data

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.410
for greenhouse gasses,
because if you're going

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:04.300
to start allocating permits
in trading in allowances

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.850
of carbon you need to
have a really good idea

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.410
of what's the total
amount of allowances?

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:10.710
Who's emitting what?

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.010
Are you hitting your target?

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.310
Are you below your target?

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.470
How many permits do you have to
buy to meet your target right?

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.970
So this has to be verified
very carefully.

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:22.360 position:56%
So that they're going to have to put
that system in place for that policy

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.190
to work and that would have
great spillover effects

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.720
for the climate negotiations,
but it's not just China.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.900
This is an issue in all countries.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.380
You know particularly countries

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.900
that are still developing a robust
statistical and measuring system.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.200
Ah yeah.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm curious to hear your thoughts
a little more of your thoughts

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.460
on how aggressive China's
target center.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.210
Specifically their areas that
you think you're surprised

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.670
in how aggressive [inaudible]
or were there other areas

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:52.630
where you didn't think they
were aggressive enough?

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.360
&gt;&gt; So the question
is to can I comment

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.200
on how aggressive China's
targets are

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.470
and which ones are maybe
more aggressive than others?

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:00.410
And where I was surprised?

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.480
That's a great question.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.720
You know I think that I do think
China's targets are aggressive

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:11.090 position:56%
and I I think that so there is sort
of three big energy related targets.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:14.250
Which are in the the
current pledge for Paris.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.550
One is the peak year.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:19.620
One is the non-fossil target and
one is the carbon intensity target.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.420
You know in discussing ambition all
you can do is sort of look at these

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.350
as Ike [assumed spelling]
said business as usual trends

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.770
and projections and say is what
they're agreeing to maybe more

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.880
or less robust than what would
have happened in the absence

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:37.330
of a target right and so that's the
only way you can really assess how

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:38.630
how ambitious it is.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:42.460
So if you look at the peak
year I mean as I said it

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.780
for a long time no one actually
believed a peak year was

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.910
in the cards anytime
soon and so the fact

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.990
that the government publically
said no we are going to peak

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:54.750
by 2030 maybe earlier,
that's a big deal.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.640
One issue though at that
target is they haven't said

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.250
where they're going to peak.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:02.200
So if you imagine a
peak you can peak here,

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.290
you can peak here [laughter] and in
terms of the global climate system

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:08.670
and total sort of atmospheric
emissions it really matters right

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.060
where China peaks.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.780
So that is sort of yet
to be determined and

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.270
and will be very important.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:17.940
A low peak would obviously
be be preferable

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.240
from a climate perspective.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.190
The non-fossil energy target
is is I think quite aggressive.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.540
You know there are I
showed you a scenario

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.480
of a much more aggressive
vision of of the future,

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.080
but that's a very very
very ambitious

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.800
and maybe not politically
realistic or economic realistic,

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.690
or technically you will be
technically challenging I'll put it

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.990
that way.

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.790
So you could get there, but it
is a really different vision

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:43.970
of the power system going forward.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:47.260
So I think you know the target
China report is within the range

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.040
of of a sort of more more
politically realistic studies

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.790
and then the carbon intensity
target again if you look.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:57.060
I did a calculation just
looking what the US Department

00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.360
of Energy had projected for
China's carbon intensity

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.940 position:56%
and their target is more
aggressive than that for example so.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.240
I'll leave it at that.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.540
Yep.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.320
&gt;&gt; Is anybody doing anything
search in the [inaudible]

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:16.070
so they say money you
know like for heating

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:21.280
or air conditioning
and things like that?

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah so the question was is
there any research being done

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:29.910
on how you can save energy in the
design of buildings and homes?

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:34.350
Yes this is a huge issue in China
as you know China's building a lot

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:38.290
of new buildings, commercial
and residential and so

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:42.540
when I mention the US-China Clean
Energy Research Center buildings is

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.550
one of the three pillars of that.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.980
And there's been a lot of
really interesting inventions

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.490
and policy sort of
models coming out of that.

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:54.440 position:56%
So China is now putting in place
pretty aggressive building standards

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.270
for new buildings and you know
there's different ways you can do

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.260
you know more efficient materials.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.970
One of the projects that came
out of the CRC it was sort

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.980
of a simple technology, but
really quite innovative.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.560
It's a white roof technology.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.960 position:56%
So it's essentially a roof coating
that makes your roof more reflective

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.060
and makes the entire
building cooler.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.340
And that's an example of something
that Dao [phonetic] and some

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.500
of the other companies
involved had and some

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.220
of the researchers
involved had come up with

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:23.300
and they're demonstrating I
believe that technology and a bunch

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.450
of other technologies in China.

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:28.350
China's been doing you
know a lot of these sort

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:30.160
of demonstration buildings
to show state

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.900
of the art energy efficiency
technologies as well

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.880
as then implementing them more
broadly on more general buildings.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.730
So again I think it's it's really a
question of enforcement making sure

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:42.910
for all the new buildings
going in that they are sort

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:46.400
of the greenest most energy
saving technology possible

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.950
because there's really no reason
for them not to at this point.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:52.460
It's really you save money
for the the builders.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.760
It's an incentive issue.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.280
You know if you're living
in an apartment building

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.300
that you didn't build you
don't care if it's efficient

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.480
if you're not paying the heating
and you know, but it's so it

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:05.510 position:56%
with buildings it tends to be you
need incentivize the actual builders

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:08.870
to actually put the standards in
place so then that gets passed

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:14.730
on to the end users of the
building down the line.

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:17.430
&gt;&gt; Please join me to
thank Dr. Lewis.

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:18.730
It was wonderful talk.

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.030
&gt;&gt; [applause] Thank you.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.600
Thank you.

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.460
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
