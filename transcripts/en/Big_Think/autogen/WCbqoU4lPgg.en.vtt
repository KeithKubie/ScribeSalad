what we call gamma waves which is a
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.640
what we call gamma waves which is a
particular frequency of wave not only

particular frequency of wave not only
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500

that but even their resting baseline

even when they're not meditating their
wave their brainwaves are more like

don't have any experience meditating so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
don't have any experience meditating so
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.299
don't have any experience meditating so
it really changes both the baseline

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
it really changes both the baseline
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.459
it really changes both the baseline
level of physiological activity as well

categories of studies that have been
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.450
categories of studies that have been
done on meditation one on these lifelong

the other category of studies on people
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170
the other category of studies on people
like you and me that that started out

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
like you and me that that started out
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.760
like you and me that that started out
with no meditation experience and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
with no meditation experience and
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.010
with no meditation experience and
started to meditate and those perhaps

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
started to meditate and those perhaps
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140
started to meditate and those perhaps
are more relevant studies for for most

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
are more relevant studies for for most
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.440
are more relevant studies for for most
people and those studies have shown

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450
people and those studies have shown
 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.510
people and those studies have shown
significant improvements in attention

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
significant improvements in attention
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.429
significant improvements in attention
functions with with increased exercise

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
functions with with increased exercise
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.700
functions with with increased exercise
and also actual anatomical changes in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
and also actual anatomical changes in
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.969
and also actual anatomical changes in
the brain with perhaps a little bit more

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
the brain with perhaps a little bit more
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890
the brain with perhaps a little bit more
experience with meditation maybe five

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
experience with meditation maybe five
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.859
experience with meditation maybe five
years of meditation experience increase

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
years of meditation experience increase
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.499
years of meditation experience increase
the size of white matter bundles in the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
the size of white matter bundles in the
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.429
the size of white matter bundles in the
prefrontal cortex so there are you know

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439
prefrontal cortex so there are you know
 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.319
prefrontal cortex so there are you know
substantial physiological anatomical

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
substantial physiological anatomical
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.350
substantial physiological anatomical
changes that have been shown with with

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
changes that have been shown with with
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.440
changes that have been shown with with
meditation and there's also effects on

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
meditation and there's also effects on
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.050
meditation and there's also effects on
depressive symptoms so decreases of

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
depressive symptoms so decreases of
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.539
depressive symptoms so decreases of
depressive symptoms decreases in stress

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
depressive symptoms decreases in stress
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.749
depressive symptoms decreases in stress
symptoms so meditation is doing lots of

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
symptoms so meditation is doing lots of
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.780
symptoms so meditation is doing lots of
positive things in some very very

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
positive things in some very very
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.270
positive things in some very very
similar to exercise and some slightly

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
similar to exercise and some slightly
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.590
similar to exercise and some slightly
different so I think there's there's

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
different so I think there's there's
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.120
different so I think there's there's
definitely going to be a difference but

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
definitely going to be a difference but
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.670
definitely going to be a difference but
there's overlapping positive functions

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
there's overlapping positive functions
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.249
there's overlapping positive functions
that exercise and meditation have on on

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
that exercise and meditation have on on
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.390
that exercise and meditation have on on
your general brain health

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400
your general brain health
 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.449
your general brain health
how do you get to be a regular meditator

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459
how do you get to be a regular meditator
 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.530
how do you get to be a regular meditator
and the answer is I think start very

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540
and the answer is I think start very
 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.039
and the answer is I think start very
very small I know for myself I have a

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049
very small I know for myself I have a
 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.690
very small I know for myself I have a
sub chapter in my book called

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700
sub chapter in my book called
 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.030
sub chapter in my book called
confessions of a yo-yo meditator because

confessions of a yo-yo meditator because
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.430
confessions of a yo-yo meditator because
I think I have tried all different kinds

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440
I think I have tried all different kinds
 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.580
I think I have tried all different kinds
of meditation and my big mistake early

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590
of meditation and my big mistake early
 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.970
of meditation and my big mistake early
on was to try and meditate for too long

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980
on was to try and meditate for too long
 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.699
on was to try and meditate for too long
a Teta at a city so I would try and

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709
a Teta at a city so I would try and
 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.610
a Teta at a city so I would try and
meditate for 20-25 minutes with no

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620
meditate for 20-25 minutes with no
 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.920
meditate for 20-25 minutes with no
meditation experience and it was a

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
meditation experience and it was a
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.800
meditation experience and it was a
disaster I I forced myself to do it for

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810
disaster I I forced myself to do it for
 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.630
disaster I I forced myself to do it for
thirty days thinking that that would be

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640
thirty days thinking that that would be
 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.880
thirty days thinking that that would be
it and I would form my habit and day 31

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890
it and I would form my habit and day 31
 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.500
it and I would form my habit and day 31
I took a little break and they never

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
I took a little break and they never
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.030
I took a little break and they never
came back but then when I came back

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040
came back but then when I came back
 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.729
came back but then when I came back
again starting very very small with

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739
again starting very very small with
 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.009
again starting very very small with
things that that you know I can just do

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019
things that that you know I can just do
 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.930
things that that you know I can just do
on my own just breathing meditation

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
on my own just breathing meditation
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.330
on my own just breathing meditation
focusing on the breath something that we

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340
focusing on the breath something that we
 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.030
focusing on the breath something that we
all do at the end of yoga classes that's

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040
all do at the end of yoga classes that's
 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.039
all do at the end of yoga classes that's
what really kind of helped me build my

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049
what really kind of helped me build my
 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.539
what really kind of helped me build my
muscle and I just have to stick with

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549
muscle and I just have to stick with
 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.509
muscle and I just have to stick with
that very short meditation and build it

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519
that very short meditation and build it
 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.160
that very short meditation and build it
up that way and I think people too often

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170
up that way and I think people too often
 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.800
up that way and I think people too often
either start too long or don't stick

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810
either start too long or don't stick
 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.140
either start too long or don't stick
with it enough but again shorter is

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150
with it enough but again shorter is
 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.979
with it enough but again shorter is
better and I think that that is a that's

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989
better and I think that that is a that's
 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.690
better and I think that that is a that's
a key for for people that want to start

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700
a key for for people that want to start
 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.299
a key for for people that want to start
to meditate
