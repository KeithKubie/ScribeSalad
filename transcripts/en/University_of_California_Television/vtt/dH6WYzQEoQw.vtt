bipedal, naked large-brained. Lone the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.650
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:48.630
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

- [Maria] I was very ambitious when I
decided this title. And it's not going to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.830
be covered all of it in 20 minutes for
sure. But I'll try to cover as much as

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.440
possible and give you an idea of what we
know about the genetic history of the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.670
Americas, mostly informed by ancient DNA
studies. So the last continent to be...the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.100
Americas was the last continent to be
settled by humans and many questions have

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.770
been debated as to where did the first
people to enter the Americas came from,

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.950
when did they come to the Americas,
through what route, and if there was one

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.200
major or two major or three major
migrations into the Americas. So there has

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.620
been a lot of debate and attempts to
answer these questions. And many fields

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.760
have contributed to the discussion and
genetics has been very important, but it

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.410
has received contributions as well from
linguistics, archeology,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.140
paleo-anthropology, paleo-climate and
other disciplines. And it is now kind of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.520
agreed that the first people to enter the
continent did so from Siberia, Northeast

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.770
Asia, through Beringia around 15,000 years
ago. And we set that date because the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.630
oldest human occupation site in the
Americas is Monte Verde which is here in

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:22.340
Chile. And this human occupation site is
dated to 14,000 to 14,500 years old. So

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.000
the people who first entered the continent
had to do so before then and like allowing

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.080
of time for people to get here. So ancient
DNA has contributed a lot to understanding

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.290
exactly how this happened, how people
moved through the continent and where did

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.490
they come from. And we don't have
thousands or hundreds of ancient genomes,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.050
we have only a handful from the Americas.
So I will try to give you some of the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.450
insights that we've gained from studying
ancient Native American genomes. So the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.300
first one is this genome from the Anzick
boy, which where some remains found here

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.230
in Montana and where they dated to around
12,600 years old. And they were found in

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.520
association with these fluted stone spear
points which were part of the Clovis

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.490
culture. And as far as I know, these are
the only remains that have been found in

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.580
association to these tools. So this
allowed the opportunity to investigate,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.390
like, the genetic affinities of a Clovis
culture by studying the genome. When the

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.750
genome was sequenced and compared to human
populations around the globe, like

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.700
contemporary populations around the globe,
this heat map, flash map was generated

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.420
which basically shows in warmer colors the
population, each circle is a population.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.760
So in warmer colors, you have the
populations that have the highest genetic

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.560
history sharing. So, the first thing that
was observed by sequencing this 12,000

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.120
year old individual was that most Native
Americans, basically all Native Americans

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.720
are more similar to this individual than
any other population in the world. And

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.690
most interestingly, it was found that even
though it was found like in the northern

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.900
part of the Americas, it was more closely
related or have more genetic affinity to

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.470
Central and South American contemporary
individuals, Native Americans actually.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.380
And this already gave us an idea about
kind of the structure that was occurring

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.960
in the Americas back then. And together
with these observations and other

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.180
statistical analyses, the authors of these
study which I should mention Morten

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.260
Rasmussen who did this between Copenhagen
and Stanford. Well, they came up with this

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.160
model in which there was a divergence
predating the 12,000 years old of this

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.720
ancient genome. A divergence between the
Northern Native Americans and the Southern

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.890
Native Americans. And that Anzick would be
sitting here.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:08.980
So, this genome was very insightful in
that it gave us an idea of some early

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.840
population structure in the Americas
predating the age of this genome. And it

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:23.200
also gave us the idea that most Native
Americans today are descendant of a

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:30.820
population related to this
Clovis-associated genome. A second genome

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.230
that was sequenced just recently and
published recently and the source of a lot

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:42.160
of debate was that of the Kennewick Man.
The remains of this individual were found

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.200
in the Kennewick area in Washington state.
And they were dated to 8,500 years. And

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:55.350
there was... Again, this is a study by
Morten Rasmussen. This was a source of a

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.230
lot of controversy because the first
analysis on the skeletal remains and

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.180
particularly on the morphology of the
skull. So the scientists who did this

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.970
first analysis they said that the
morphology of the skull was more similar

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:17.680
to contemporary individuals of Southeast
Asia and Polynesians. So, what that led to

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.780
was the owners of the land, which was
actually the US Army, not giving the

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.560
remains to the Native American tribes who
were claiming these remains for reburial.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.300
And that was just based on the scientist
who drew these conclusions on the

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.500
morphology of the skull alone. So of
course, there was a lot of scientific

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:42.160
debate. And because the first attempts to
extract DNA were unsuccessful, there was a

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.520
lot of controversy and litigation for many
years, at least nine years. But finally

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.140
this group in Copenhagen, they're very
good at this, were given the opportunity

00:07:54.140 --> 00:08:00.000
to try again to do some genetic analysis.
And they were able to sequence an entire

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.300
genome of the Kennewick Man. So the very
first observation is that it actually

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.540
falls within Native American variation,
just like that. And so this is a BCA plot

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:16.230
similar to what Johannes just showed. And
these are contemporary Native Americans,

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.010
these are populations from the rest of the
world, this is Europe. So, that was the

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:25.380
first result, this individual is Native
American. And when looking at the genetic

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.720
affinities within America, it was shown
something similar to what was shown for

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:38.330
the Anzick individual. It shares more
genetic history with Central, North and

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.370
South Americans than with other Native
Americans from the North, even though it

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.270
was found here. But it was also
interesting to find that tribes for the

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:55.070
same area where the Kennewick Man was
found, also shared a high level of genetic

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:01.840
ancestry with the Kennewick Man. So this
was like another piece of evidence about

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.550
the past genetic structure in the
Americas. So again, with this observation

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.780
and more sophisticated statistical
methods, what this study proposed was

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.600
that, so this was the original branching
between Northern Native Americans and

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:22.490
Southern Native Americans. The Anzick sits
here as an ancestor to modern South and

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:28.380
Central Native Americans. But there was
another branching here, and Kennewick is

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:36.550
here, that gave rise to Pacific Northwest
Native Americans. But there was a follow

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:41.400
by some gene flow from East Asia that
probably obscures a little bit the genetic

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.450
affinity of the Kennewick to the Pacific
Northwest Native Americans. So this was a

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.210
very important contribution and not only
gave us insights about the past genetic

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:57.360
structure of the Americas, but it also
helped resolve this controversy about

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.080
whether Kennewick Man was Native American
or not.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.780
And now, just an additional report
supporting this was published three days

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:10.780
ago, probably. So we could hopefully put
an end to this litigation and these

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.750
remains...well, we don't know because many
tribes are claiming the remains so maybe

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.060
there will be yet another debate. But
anyway, this is what we learned from the

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:26.480
scientific standpoint. And the third
genome I will tell you about is this from

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.160
the Saqqaq Paleo-Eskimo, which is very
interesting because it was sequenced from

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.800
a tuft of hair and this hair was preserved
for around 4,000 years in the present

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.890
permafrost in Southwest Greenland. And
this is an artistic reconstruction of the

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:46.760
individual based on genotype, like
phenotypic information that was taken from

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:52.510
the genome that was sequenced. So this was
actually the first ancient human genome to

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:57.370
be sequenced and again, this was done in
Copenhagen by Morten Rasmussen and

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:02.100
colleagues. So what we learned about this
genome was also very interesting. So the

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.880
Saqqaq individual was found here but the
genetic affinity surprisingly, or not to

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.890
some, are not to modern contemporary
Greenlanders. So this individual is

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.970
genetically more similar to individuals
from Siberia like Chukchi and Koryaks

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:24.230
here. So what this indicated is that there
was probably a past migration like

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.160
predating 4,000 years ago, probably 5,000
to 6,000 years, a migration from Northeast

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:36.350
Asia to the Americas that was later
replaced by a population that gave rise to

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:42.170
modern day Inuits. So these are, like,
three single genome studies, but thanks to

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.030
the development in next generation
sequencing we have been able to generate

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:52.250
now multi- or... Well, yes, complete or
semi-complete genomes from different

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:57.980
individuals more than just one at a time.
So we generated some genomic data from

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.390
multiple individuals to test one
particular hypothesis.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.720
This was part of a larger study but my
contribution was testing this

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.970
Paleo-American relics hypothesis. So,
again, based on this morphology of the

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:16.340
skull, it was suggested that the very
first people to enter the Americas and for

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.790
which we have remains like for example,
Lucia from Lagoa Santa and the Penan woman

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.260
which are really, really old, that the
morphology of this skull is more similar

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:31.710
to present day people from Melanesia. Some
scientists suggest that there was a first

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.370
migration of people with this
Paleo-American skull that was later

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:42.220
replaced completely by Siberia, like the
first migration I mentioned. And that

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.810
there was a complete wipeout and
replacement. But that there were some

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:52.010
relic populations because based on the
morphology of the skull of some

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.430
individuals who are in isolated parts of
the continent like the Pericos in the tip

00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:00.560
of Baja, California and the
Fuego-Patagonians here, these had a

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.750
particular skull morphology that resembles
also Austra-Melanesians. So this was a

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:10.820
theory and we wanted to test it. So we
sequenced partial genomes from 17

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:16.200
individuals from these supposedly relict
populations. And what we found, we were

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.460
actually expecting this already, was that
they all fall within Native American

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.190
variations, so there was no evidence of
any connection to Austra-Melanesia

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:30.820
whatsoever. But more interestingly is that
we observe a genetic continuity with

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.560
modern populations in the same geographic
area. For example, the people from

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:45.190
Fuego-Patagonia in PCA space, they fall in
proximity to present day Fuego-Patagonians

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.790
from Chile, so the [inaudible 00:13:46]
from Chile. And similar in Mexico. The

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:57.020
Pericos from Mexico not only fell within
the native variation in Mexico, but they

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.480
did so with Northern population from
Mexico. So we were able to pin down that

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.890
they were very closely similar to
Tarahumara and Purépecha which are

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:12.860
Northern Native groups in Mexico. Well,
first we just disprove this idea of relict

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.190
Paleo-Americans. And secondly we
demonstrated that there is this genetic

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.430
continuity. And actually we observed this
in many samples now, in many genomes that

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.370
have been sequenced. And we observed so,
as I showed a little bit with the

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.630
Kennewick Man that had genetic affinity to
populations from the same geographic area.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:37.200
But we've observed through almost 8,000
years so we have different genomes from

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.630
different ages here. And what we've
observed continuously is that there seems

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.650
to be this genetic continuity in the
Americas, and that is in contrast with

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:53.700
what Johannes just showed ofthese massive
demographic shifts. So the Americas, at

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.160
least Central and South America, the
Northern part seems to be a bit more

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.990
complex, but at least Central and South
have been kind of very stable for many

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.750
thousands of years, so that's interesting.
A question that hasn't been resolved quite

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:13.000
yet is if there were three or two
migration waves into the Americas.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.750
Different groups with different data sets
from modern populations support one or the

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:24.220
other. So there is one model that...there
was one major migration that gave rise to

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:30.310
most Native Americans followed by a second
and a third that were mostly just Northern

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:35.770
Native Americans. And there is another
model that instead of suggesting a second

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:40.680
migration, suggests that there was
divergence within America of a Northern

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.120
and a Southern branch and that this
occurred within America approximately

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.210
13,000 years ago. And something that has
been a bit puzzling for us who study

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:54.220
genetic diversity in the Americas is the
observation by two independent studies of

00:15:54.220 --> 00:16:00.610
something that looks like gene flow from
Austra-Melanesians or Papua, New

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:05.200
Guinians, or population related to
contemporary Papua, New Guinians and

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.330
Melanesians, into populations in the
Amazonian, like the Xavante, Suruí and

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:17.040
Karitiana. And two independent studies
have identified this signal, although yet

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.920
we don't have a good explanation of how or
when this happened. So it's very puzzling

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:28.580
actually. And just for the last part, I
want to make the point that so far I just

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.030
talked about the peopling of the Americas,
but there's actually much more genetic

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:39.390
history in the recent 15,000 years of
course. So I think we can use ancient DNA

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.820
to investigate, or a combination of
ancient and modern DNA, to investigate

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:48.830
other regional aspects of the history of
the Americas. An example here, for example

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.120
is the peopling of the Caribbean. By it's
location you can argue it could have been

00:16:53.120 --> 00:17:00.110
people from Florida, from the Yucatan
peninsula or from South America. And now

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.980
combining data from modern population,
modern Caribbean population and studying

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:09.240
the Native American fraction of this
population and comparing to a reference

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:14.290
panel of Native Americans, it has been
suggested that it was people, actually, by

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:20.470
South America here, facilitated by the
Orinoco River. And we have been able to

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:27.470
kind of prove this with ancient genomes
from Taino genomes. And I'm just showing

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:33.110
here an example of one sample from Cuba,
from Chorro de Maita, Cuba which also

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.810
falls in the genetic variation of Arawakan
speakers, like Wahiro, Piapoco and Ticuna.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.450
So this is another way we're complimenting
information from modern and ancient

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:49.070
population to resolve a question about the
particular event in history. And I'm also

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.690
doing something on the same lines. I don't
have the time to tell you more about it,

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:57.570
but we're doing something similar in the
peopling of the Patagonia, like the very

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.300
last part that was peopled in the
Americas.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.570
And lastly, I want to make the point that
we can also use ancient DNA even in

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:10.330
historical times, but for events in
history where the historical record is

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:16.320
sparse. So, I'll just show you an example
where we used ancient DNA to learn about

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.720
the past history of people brought to the
Americas as a result of the Trans-Atlantic

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.880
Slave Trade. You can argue that there is
historical records about this, but this

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.800
exact origins of people in Africa that
were brought to the Americas that was

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.790
basically not recorded, it's kind of
absent in the historical record. So we can

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:40.740
also use ancient DNA to reconstruct some
of this history. So in this, very quickly,

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.790
it was a pilot study where we had three
individuals from the Caribbean and we

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.930
wanted to know where in Africa were they
from. They were found in the same burial

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:54.860
site. And by comparing to a reference
panel in Africa, we sequenced fractions of

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.170
their genomes, we were able to find that
one of them was more closely related to

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:04.530
Bantu-speaking populations. And two of
them were more closely related to

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.850
non-Bantu-speaking populations and we had
evidence to argue that this three people

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:13.210
were put in the same embarkation and
brought to the Americas together. But we

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:18.500
are really missing information about how
culturally diverse were the people who

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.880
were brought from Africa to the Americas.
So, just to summarize, most Native

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.030
Americans...because I went through
something very general like the peopling

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.470
of the Americas to something super
specific about an episode in history. But

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.930
I want you to take this messages home. So
most Native Americans trace their ancestry

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:42.680
to a single migration from East Asia to
Beringia between 15,000 and 20,000 years

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.220
ago. If there was one, two or three
subsequent migration is still under

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.330
debate. There is evidence of ancient gene
flow from population related to

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.510
Austra-Melanesians in some Amazonian
populations, although we don't know

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:00.550
exactly how that happened. The sequencing
of ancient genomes from the Americas has

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.800
complimented the knowledge generated from
studying genome-wide data from modern

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:10.300
populations. But we still have very few
compared to Europe, for example. And this

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.000
last point, it's also something very
important for me, ancient DNA research can

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.890
also be useful for investigating other
aspects apart from the initial peopling of

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.390
the continent. I think we put too much
attention into that that we've forgotten

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:30.790
about the more recent history or
pre-history, like the source populations

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.720
in Africa of the people who were brought
during the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. And

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.938
with that I'll complete, and thank you.
