00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.260
In this lesson we continue to study

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.360
control hazards. We already know about branch

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.810
vectors, but we also know that some

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.590
branches are really difficult to predict, even

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.860
when we have a sophisticated branch predictor. So, in this lesson, we will see

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.350
how the compiler can help us completely

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.120
avoid some of the hard to predict branches
