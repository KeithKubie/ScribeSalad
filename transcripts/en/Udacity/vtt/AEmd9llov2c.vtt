00:00:00.605 --> 00:00:05.720
I'm going to pause here and let you think about, what are the problems with

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.870
this naive implementation of this spinlock. Do you

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.060
think there is going to be too much contention?

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.070
Or do you think that it, it's not good enough because it does not exploit

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.280
caches? Or do you think that it is

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.230
going to disrupt useful work? Think about that.
