00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.320
When 
I burned up the wires on my first Metal Melter,
I decided to turn the transformer core into

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.949
a stick welder. But one transformer wasn't
enough to actually make it weld anything.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.919
In this project we'll be modifying 2 microwave
transformers, because more transformers means

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:24.819
more power.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.150
For this project I scavenged parts from a
couple more microwaves. I found these for

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.170
free on my local classifieds. Not only are
we using twice as many transformers here,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.290
but twice as much power. Seriously dangerous
amounts of power. These transformers are roughly

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.030
the same size and look nearly identical except
for the placement of the bases. Using an angle

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.850
grinder, we can cut down the seam of one of
the shallow welds holding this base plate

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.840
to the transformer. The other seam is a little
trickier to get to, but once it's cut you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.590
can see that the base plate can now be removed
fairly easily. Now these next few steps are

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.020
gonna look a lot like the modification
we did in the Metal Melter project. After

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.299
grinding the welds and opening the seam with
a chisel, the "I" section of the transformer

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.429
can be pulled back to reveal the precious
primary and secondary coils. I've found that

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.149
the primary coil can be removed by gently
prying up with a chisel. It's important to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.259
work it out of the transformer gently because
the goal is to keep this in perfect condition.

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.109
You might remember there are 2 magnetic shunts
that get knocked out next, and the low voltage

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:49.329
winding gets removed because that won't serve
any purpose here. Now to extract the secondary

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.029
coil, my method of choice is to rest it loosely
on the jaws of a bench vice, then use a rubber

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:59.060
hammer to knock down on the transformer until
the coil is free. This one finished up without

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.859
any damage at all. If you don't have a bench
vice, you can improvise with a couple of blocks

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.579
of wood. In either case, your secondary coils
can be salvaged in near perfect condition.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.790
After a quick cleanup of the paper and resin,
our primary coil can be replaced on the transformer

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.330
with the terminals facing down. We're gonna be re-winding a new secondary, so it's

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.160
important that we have the flat side facing
up. When it comes to winding coils, life will

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.170
be a lot simpler if we build a little jig.
I cut this piece of scrap wood so that it's

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.970
as wide as the center piece, and just a little
shorter than the top. The length is cut so

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.920
that it overhangs the edges by about 1/2 inch
on either side. We can complete the form by

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.810
adding a top and bottom panel, then forming a piece of paper to fit the sides. At this point, I think

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.710
we're about ready to add some cable. I found
this 50' length of wire on clearance at the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.540
hardware store. This is 8 gauge stranded copper
wire, and cost me about $17. I'm gonna

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.320
use my vice to hold the form in place, and
begin winding the cable around the center

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.950
of the form as tightly as possible. We need
to build this coil 6 turns high, which isn't

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.710
too difficult the first layer, but gets progressively
more challenging on the second layer, and

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.430
might seem like it's near impossible on the
third. When it's packed together 6 turns high

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.590
and 3 layers deep, the paper flaps can be
folded over and taped together. Now this is

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.090
the tricky part. We need to unscrew the top
and bottom panels to access our coil and separate

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.180
it out of the from the form while keeping it in one piece.
I used some electrical tape to ensure the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.460
coil wouldn't unravel. Okay, it's time to transplant
our new secondary into the transformer. I

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.570
have the best success by using a clamp to
pinch the sides in while I push the coil down

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.930
into place. Let's just double check the coil
sits flush at the top, and mix up some 2 part

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.710
epoxy glue to finish up. Just like the transformer
in our Metal Melter project, the entire top

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.630
area gets a liberal coating of epoxy just
before sealing it back together. In order

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.530
for this to form a strong bond, the connection will
need a lot of pressure holding it together

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.400
while it sets. This is where a set of clamps
or a bench vice can be invaluable. While our

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.260
first transformer is setting, we can prepare
the second one in the exact same way. Our

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.040
second coil is 18 turns of 8 gauge wire exactly
like the first, and transplanted just like

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.560
before. Don't worry too much about which way
the coil goes in. It doesn't really matter

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.860
yet. Finally, we can glue, and clamp that
together and leave it to set for around 24

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.630
hours. The final result should look something
like this. The connection is strong, and the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.710
coils are extremely snug, so any vibrations
will be kept to a minimum. Well there you

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.910
have it. The basic makings of an AC stick
welding system, and these two electrodes will

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.139
eventually become our clamp and stinger. From
this point, it really doesn't take much more

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.940
to finish the system up and turn it into a
useful little hobby welder. Look for how to

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.900
do that in Part 2. Well that's it for now.
If you liked this project, perhaps you'll

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.540
