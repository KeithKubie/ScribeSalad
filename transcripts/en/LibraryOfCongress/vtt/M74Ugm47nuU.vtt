00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.120
&gt;&gt; Good evening to everyone.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.270
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.330
I'm Mark Sweeney, the principal
deputy librarian of congress,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.900
and it's my pleasure to welcome
you here for the presentation

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.550
of the 2018 Rebekah Johnson
Bobbitt National Prize

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.670
for Poetry, but before we
begin, let me remind you

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.670
to please turn off
your cell phones

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.580
and any other electronic
devices that might interfere

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.680
with tonight's program
or with the recording,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.630
which is important,
because it will become part

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.970
of the Library's archive.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.890
So now let us begin.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.110
The Bobbitt Prize recognizes
the most distinguished book

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.400
of poetry by an American
publisher during the preceding

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.570
two years or the lifetime
achievement of an American poet.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.480
We are indebted to the panel of
judges for this year's prize,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.000
Catherine Barnett, Natalie
Diaz, and Betty Sue Flowers,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.430
who read more than
200 submissions

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.190
from publishers large and small.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.470
Betty Sue Flowers,
former director

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.280
of the Lyndon Baines
Johnson Library and Museum

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.840
and emeritus professor of
English at the University

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.340
of Texas at Austin, has anchored
the panel for many years

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.410
as the Bobbitt family
representative.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.790
Mojave-American poet and 2018
MacArthur Genius fellow Natalie

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.190
Diaz was selected by our poet
laureate, Tracy K. Smith,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.430
and librarian of
Congress Carla Hayden,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.340
selected James Laughlin
Award winner

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.580
and Guggenheim fellow
Catherine Barnett.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.780
To all three judges, we
thank you for your hard work.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.700
I would also like to
acknowledge Echo Press,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.100
an imprint of Harper-Collins
and the publisher

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.030
of this year's winner,
as well as Echo president

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.540
and publisher Daniel Halpern.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.130
Finally, thank you to
Doctor Philip C. Bobbitt

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.050
for his generous gift that
makes the prize possible.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.400
Bobbitt is the Herbert
Wechsler Professor

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.780
of Federal Jurisprudence
and director of the Center

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.690
for National Security at
the Columbia Law School,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.220
a distinguished senior
lecturer at the University

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.540
of Texas Law School, and
for the fall 2018 term,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.370
the visiting professor of
law at Yale Law School.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.410
Bobbitt is also an
author of several books

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.640
on constitutional law,
international security,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.420
and the history of strategy,
including Terror and Consent

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.400
and The Shield of Achilles.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.550
Please welcome Philip Bobbitt to
the podium to give a few remarks

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.510
on the origins of the prize.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:07.110
[ Applause ]

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you all
for coming tonight.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.720
I want to dedicate my
remarks this evening

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.040
to James Billington.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.820
Without his leadership of the
Library and his long friendship

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.380
to me, this prize would
never have come into being.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.040
It's been my high pleasure
these last two decades and more

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.570
to say something at these
gatherings about my family

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.880
and especially about my mother,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.750
in whose honor this prize
is presented, Becky Johnson

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.950
of Johnson City, as she was
when she met my father here

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.160
at the Library of
Congress in the 1930s.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.150
My parents' story is
a Washington story.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.110
Here they fell in love
during the Depression.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.500
Here they reluctantly
left when the war began.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.130
My mother didn't really
want to leave Washington.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.110
One of her suitors had bribed
the orchestra leader the Shorden

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.370
[phonetic] to play "The Yellow
Rose of Texas" whenever she came

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.870
in the ballroom [laughter],
and she wasn't going to get

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.590
that kind of treatment
in Austin.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.950
In fact, she had escaped Texas,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.250
and I don't think
she really wanted

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.000
to marry a man from Texas.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.910
In any event, they
eloped to Mexico.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.950
They lived together mainly in
Austin, Texas for 38 years,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.070
until my mother's death.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.510
When she died, I found a cache
of some unusual index cards

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.500
in a pigeonhole in
her green writing desk

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.820
where she wrote every day.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.900
Each card has a hole drilled
in the center of the top line,

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.440
and on each was typed
poetry or a lofty saying.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.020
I took them to my
father, and I asked him,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.500
"What are all these cards?"

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.000
He said, "You remember that when
I met your mother at the Library

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.350
of Congress where we
were both working our way

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.890
through school" -- my father had
won a scholarship to come east

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.550
to college from Texas.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.970
My mother was studying library
science, as it was called then.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.710
I said, "Yes, yes, sort of."

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.060
He said to me, "You know
that your mother was engaged

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.280
to another man when
we first met."

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.580
"I sort of remember that.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.500
A Princeton graduate, I think."

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.700
"Well, I had dislodge
this fellow,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.500
but the only time I saw
your mother was at work,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.720
and we had a very
strict supervisor.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.800
We worked in cataloging.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.090
Those cards are from
the card catalogs" --

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.440
apparently that explained
the holes in the --

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.890
were in fact at the
bottom of the card --

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.780
"and we would exchange
notes as if we were typing

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.210
in reference information."

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.260
[Laughter] My father
and I sat and talked,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.230
and out of that conversation
came the idea

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.960
of a poetry prize
here at the Library,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.050
which is now in its 29th year.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.010
I was aware of the controversy
that had arisen in 1948

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.250
over the Library's aware of the
last National Prize for Poetry

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.180
to Ezra Pound for his
work "The Pisan Cantos."

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.930
This was the prize funded
by the Bollingen Foundation.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.880
It carried an award
of 1,000 dollars.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.890
Like the Bobbitt Prize, it
was awarded to the best book

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.910
of verse by an American
author published

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.280
in the preceding years.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.580
The New York Times headline

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.940
on the Sunday following
the announcement

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.550
of the prize was typical
of public reaction.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.550
"Pound, in Mental Clinic,
Wins Prize for Poetry Penned

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.130
in Treason Cell,"
[laughter] for Pound,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.900
a fascist collaborator
during the war,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.560
had indeed written
the book while

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.590
in an internment camp in Pisa.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.360
The controversy appeared
to subside

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.050
until two articles appeared in
The Saturday Review declaring

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.970
that an award to Pound was, and
I quote, "a ruthless mockery

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.530
of our Christian
war dead," implying

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.210
that the award was also part
of a more general conspiracy

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.160
that included T. S. Eliot,
Paul Mellon, and Carl Jung

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.580
and warning that the FBI
had been alerted [laughter].

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.450
There were angry speeches in
Congress, and on August 19th,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.510
seven months after the
announcement of the prize,

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.940
a resolution was adopted
directing the Library to abstain

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.860
from giving awards or
prizes of any kind.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.600
The librarian immediately
announced his compliance,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.460
and all prizes were
abruptly discontinued.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.760
The Bollingen went to Yale,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.290
where it has continued
to flourish.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.740
All this my father and I
discussed that winter in 1978

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.130
when we were so heartbroken
and bound so closely

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.140
to each other by
my mother's death.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.370
So I started a new job, which as
we all know is the best remedy

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.230
for sorrow, and in
1979, I came here.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.550
I was hired by the White
House counsel, Lloyd Cutler,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.040
to come to Washington and work
for him doing intelligence

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.610
and international security.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.090
During the years that followed,
Lloyd was my aid and my guide

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.070
in attempting to get the
Prize for Poetry reinstated.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.760
It was a little like
getting drunks

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.740
on board a pitching raft at sea.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.190
We would get the chairman of
the Senate Committee on board

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.360
and the House members
would fall off.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.020
We'd get the Congress united
behind a reversal of the policy

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.640
and the new president's
staff, for Cutler

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.380
and I were no longer working in
the White House, would object.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.770
The final blow came
when Lloyd went

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.130
to see the librarian,
Daniel Boorstin.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.410
Lloyd was armed with the
endorsement of both houses

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.970
of Congress, including that of
Senator Mathius, the chairman

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.470
of the Oversight Committee, and
the White House culture czar,

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.190
Marshall Brigger [phonetic],

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.150
but Boorstin completely
rejected the whole idea.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.890
Lloyd called me in London and he
said, "Dan has locked the door

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.480
and thrown away the key."

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.810
But then a new president,
George Herbert Walker Bush,

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.070
came into office, and with him,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.910
a new librarian,
James Billington.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.140
Reviewing the correspondence of
his predecessor, Jim had come

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.840
across my letter proposing
the prize, and he contacted me

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.870
and asked me if I
was still interested.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.930
It took another year, but
thanks to President Bush

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.130
and James Billington, the
first prize was awarded

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.510
to James Merrill here
at the Library in 1990.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.370
[ Applause ]

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.500
Jim attended every prize evening

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.970
until he was forced
from office in 2015.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.940
He even fought his own staff,

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.230
who endeavored to
kill the prize.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.680
I'm afraid through an
inadvertence I came

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.470
into possession of
their entreaties to him

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.680
and their hopes that the
prize would just simply lapse.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.070
I think they may have felt

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.210
that 10,000 dollars
was too puny a sum

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.000
for such an august institution.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.060
Perhaps they were unaware of the
parable of the widow's might.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.770
But Jim held firm,
and on leaving office,

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:55.890
he wrote me to say how gratified
he was by our joint efforts.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.220
In one of those coincidences
of history,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.240
he died only two weeks
before the president

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.700
who had appointed him
and had given his consent

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.960
to the Rebekah Johnson
Bobbitt Prize.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.850
I would like to recall tonight,
in honor of these two figures,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.730
a passage that is familiar,
I think, to most of you

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.780
in this room from Ecclesiastes.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.770
"Let us now praise
famous men and our fathers

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.680
and their generations.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.260
The Lord apportioned
to them great glory,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.700
his majesty from the beginning.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.270
There were those who ruled in
their kingdoms and were renowned

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.810
for their power, giving
counsel by their understanding

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.870
and proclaiming prophecies;
leaders of the people

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.420
in their deliberations and
in understanding learning

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.770
for the people; wise in
their words of instruction.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.550
There were those
composed musical tunes

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.600
and set forth verses in writing.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.310
All these were honored
in their generation.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.810
These were people of mercy
whose righteous deeds have not

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.630
been forgotten.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.650
Their prosperity will remain
with their descendants

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.090
and their inheritance to
their children's children.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.950
Their descendants will
stand by their covenants;

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.920
their children also,
for their sake.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.170
Peoples will declare
their wisdom,

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.800
and the congregation
proclaims their praise."

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.030
Tonight, we are congregated

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.050
to praise a famous
woman, Jorie Graham.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.240
The Bobbitt family has nothing
to do with the selection

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.260
of the winner of the prize,
but after the jury had met

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.890
and decided, one of them called
me and said, "You're going

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.590
to be very happy with the
choice," [laughter] and so I am.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.570
Indeed, I was reminded
of the lonely editorial

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.730
in the New York Herald
Tribune at the time

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.280
of the Pound controversy
pleading against the resolution

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.210
that would still the prize.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.170
The editor wrote, "This emphasis
on a criterion of beauty

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.640
and excellence akin to belief

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.600
in an objective truth
is fundamental

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.690
to a free and rational society.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.150
In maintaining it, the
judges acted in the only way

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.380
that is open to those
who are sensitive

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.750
to a later verdict of history."

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.510
Thank you for coming, and thank
you for letting me be here.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:28.480
[ Applause ]

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.180
&gt;&gt; Many thanks, Philip, for
your persistence in your efforts

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.390
in promoting poetry in
honor of your mother,

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.020
and the Library is
grateful for it.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.920
Tonight, I'm pleased to award
the 2018 Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.110
National Prize for Poetry to
Jorie Graham for her book Fast.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.200
The Poetry Foundation
calls Graham "one

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.610
of the most celebrated poets

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.600
of the American post-war
generation."

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.280
In her over 40-year career, she
has received numerous honors,

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.070
including the aforementioned
MacArthur fellowship as well

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.500
as the Pulitzer Prize
for Poetry for The Dreams

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.280
of the Unified Field:
Selected Poems, 1974 to 1992

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.380
and the Wallace Stevens Award
from the American Academy --

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.550
from the Academy
of American Poets.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.590
Graham was the first
American woman

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:26.620
to win the Ford Poetry Prize
for her 2012 collection Place.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.670
She's also the first woman to
be named the Boylston Professor

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.260
of Oratory and Rhetoric
at Harvard University,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:38.620
a position that was first held
by John Quincy Adams in 1806.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.880
A chancellor for the Academy
of American Poets from 1997

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.030
to 2003, Graham was selected
to the American Academy

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.490
of Arts and Letters in 2009.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.360
Beyond her honors,
Graham has proved

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.080
to be a singular
and enduring voice.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.170
As Craig Teicher wrote in the
New York Times book review,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.980
"Graham is to post-1980
poetry what Bob Dylan is

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.760
to the post-1960 rock.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.580
She changed her art form, moved
it forward, and made it able

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.950
to absorb and express
more than it could before.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.670
It permanently bears her mark."

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.790
Fast marks the first collection
since Graham's career-spanning

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:28.090
From the New World:
Poems 1976 to 2014.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.760
All three of our
judges included Fast

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.670
in their preliminary shortlist
while reviewing submissions

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.950
for this year's Bobbitt
Prize, and one enthused

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.180
about the collection as
a new height for a poet

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.400
with 14 books to her name.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.540
This shows not only Graham's
stature as a major voice,

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.160
admired by a range of
poets and poetry readers,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.170
but also her commitment
to pushing the form.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:59.550
Indeed, the judges' citation
for this year's prize reads,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:07.510
"In Jorie Graham's Fast,
the year is 1490, 380, 1774,

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.230
10 B.C.E., and the title
describes the speed

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.550
at which time leaps
ahead and rewinds

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.190
in this mortality-haunted,
panic-inducing beauty

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:22.640
of a collection, as
intellectual as it is felt.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.630
Graham's astonishing abstract
intelligence is tethered

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.850
in almost every line by
the sensory, by the music

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.950
of the language and wordplay
and by the material world

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.920
that makes the red sleep
mask a father cries out for

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.740
in his last days into a metaphor

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:47.200
for the human time storm we
inhabit, share, and grieve."

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.510
Please join me in welcoming
our prizewinner, Jorie Graham.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:16:20.090
[ Applause ]

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:26.220
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess the bracelets
[laughter] make a lot of noise.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.500
Thank you to the Bobbitt family.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.270
That was quite a story -- it was
enough for the whole evening --

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.230
and thank you for that
beautiful introduction.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.970
It's complicated,
all the emotions

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.430
that went into that story.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.420
The one thing that
is also behind it

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.720
for a poet receiving it is
the fact that your family --

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.850
I believe your wife is
related to Lyndon Johnson,

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:03.500
and there's something about the
idea that someone who was able

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.150
to pass such extraordinary
legislation

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.760
that took our country forward
is also somehow behind a poet's

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.600
attempt to be, as
Shelley would say,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.800
the secret legislators
of our reality.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.100
So I like that.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:26.270
I must say that there's so
many ghosts in your story --

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.300
Lloyd Cutler, a family friend.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:35.150
The idea that George Bush was
the one who would insist on this

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.190
and Daniel Boorstin would
not is really revelatory

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.490
to me [laughter].

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.910
Messes with my reality
[laughter].

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.580
That's really -- in
a really great way

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.610
that one wants to
be messed with.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:55.190
The story of the card catalog,
it reminds me of Emily Dickinson

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.620
and also makes me feel

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.270
that that's probably secretly
what card catalogs are always

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.890
for [laughter], a sort of a love
affair one is having with --

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.910
even, you know, we've
all searched for books

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.550
and gotten lost in libraries.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.630
We're in this great library,
and one of the great things

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.710
about libraries is
the adjacencies,

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.480
the person that you fall in love
with or the author that you bump

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.840
into that you weren't
expecting to read that is there

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.970
and beckoning you in a library.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.890
So in one of the great
libraries on planet Earth,

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.560
I'm very grateful
for this evening.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:33.620
The -- I'm astonished that
they cared enough about poetry

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.250
to make such a fuss [laughter].

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.550
It's kind of fantastic.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.810
In this day and age, they
wouldn't give a damn.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.110
They really wouldn't.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.920
I mean the fact that they
thought about Pound's situation

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.930
and that no, that's wasn't going
to -- you had to go to the House

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.230
and Senate and do all this.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.030
It's magnificent.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:57.520
[ Laughter ]

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.110
In most of the other
cultures, and that's the last

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.010
of my general remarks,
but, you know,

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.820
poets to this day are
executed, beheaded,

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.310
imprisoned for bringing
the news, and Pound was

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.530
in fact a fascist and a
collaborator at a certain point.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.750
It's the mystery of art to
try to understand why a man

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:23.260
in a cage in Pisa with an
African-American soldier

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.270
secretly slipping
him pen and paper

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.430
so that he could write could
write The Pisan Cantos,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:34.940
one of the great pieces of
American art, and yet he --

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.200
I've gone into the Library
of Congress and listened

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.040
on the microfiche to all

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.840
of those speeches he gave
supporting Mussolini,

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.290
and they're hair-raising.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.970
I'm going to read a
few poems from Fast.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.290
Pound said two wonderful things.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.240
When one is accepting a
prize, I think it's good

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.500
to remember one of them.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.620
Pound first of all said, "Poetry
is news that stays news,"

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.710
which is one of the great
and important remarks

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.770
that many poets live
by, and another thing

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.720
that Pound said was,
"It really matters

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.300
that great poems get written,

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.880
and it doesn't matter a
damn who writes them."

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.560
So I think it's always
important when an event

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.860
such as this is taking place.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.340
I always use that to remind
myself of the kind of humility

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.250
that is necessary to
engage in something

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.690
which one hopes will
represent one's time

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.790
to a future generation.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.500
This book is one of three
that I've written very much

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.550
with a future generation
of people,

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:53.030
of humans, of others in mind.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.940
In general, this book is
directed -- is an attempt --

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.190
it's part of three books
that are an attempt

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:06.300
to imagine the future that
we are headed into in ways

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.420
that many scientists
ask us to do

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.080
and which is a very complicated
process, and I'm not sure

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.410
that any of us are
very successful at it.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.620
When people describe
climate change,

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.510
especially climate scientists,
they're always asking poets

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.910
and artists to please use
their imaginations and put them

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:31.020
in service of helping
people imagine what is meant

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.350
by a world three degrees warmer.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:39.650
All the science in the world
can't help one feel anything

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.020
other than baffled
by this proposition,

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.710
and the conceptual
intellect can't go there.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.000
The rational, scientific
intellect can provide data,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.210
but the human imagination as --

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.740
without the assistance

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.650
of art has a very
hard time going there,

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.550
and as we gather here,
people are gathered in Poland

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.030
yet again today, trying to --

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.710
from all over the world
in a UN conference trying

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:07.780
to understand how to understand
this, how to describe it,

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.830
how to feel it, how to believe
it, and how to act on it,

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.720
and obviously we
can't act on anything

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.340
that we don't believe in.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.960
So I have written poems
that attempt to do that.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:26.180
In this particular book, I was
working with an imagination

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:35.750
of other than human,
post-human, non-human presences.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.620
The one thing that haunts me

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.730
in the climate change
world is the feeling

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.690
that we are not the only species
on the planet and attempting

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.420
to understand this planet

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.170
from a perspective that's
not particularly just ours.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.420
It's hard to imagine when
we imagine the extinction,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.440
the sixth extinction, that
when we imagine the things,

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.430
the creatures, the life
forms that are going extinct,

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.730
it's very hard for us

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.500
to understand how
lonely we would be

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.450
if we were the only
beings left in creation.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.520
You know, we think if the bees
disappear, we won't be able

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.260
to pollinate the almond trees,

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.850
but what if their sound
disappears from our life?

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.680
What if we no longer
have that as part of,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.080
you know, our consciousness?

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.220
What if the birds disappear
and, you know, we are alone?

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.580
What if we look out at
the oceans and as opposed

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.390
to imagining an incredible life
under there of creatures not

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.230
yet disturbed or even discovered
by us that all vanishes,

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.370
what happens to our sense
of what we belong to?

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.670
Because sometimes I think
we belong to creation,

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:48.090
but we think we're just busy in
life, and so part of the project

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.360
of this book was sort of to
try to understand what it's

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.100
like to feel that you're a
part of creation and what it's

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.460
like to try to understand
post-human voices.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.470
I'm going to read one poem
which is an attempt to write

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.160
from a non-human perspective

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.460
or to find my way
into one, obviously.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.620
It's an illusion, but it's
an operative illusion.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.250
I'm going to try to read
another poem that's written

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.520
from the perspective of
artificial intelligence

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.770
or that includes a conversation
with artificial intelligence,

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.230
but there are poems in this
book that are written --

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:19.880
my father died during the
-- my writing of this book,

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.370
and there are poems in
which I try to engage

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.420
with his body right after
it disappeared from me

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.720
but it was still there.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.740
What was that afterlife?

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.430
I tried to understand
a religious afterlife.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.170
I tried to enter into
the consciousness

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.630
of a medium whom I contacted,
I have to admit, and she put me

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.190
in touch with my father.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:43.580
A little bit too much of "The
Waste Land," in that, perhaps,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.390
Madame Sosostris,
but at any rate,

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.960
I did write from the
perspective of the medium.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.550
Also from the perspective of the
dog, the only one in the house

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.970
that knew my father was dying,

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.000
and the dog who somehow
intuited it.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.890
Of course animals know these
other things that we don't know.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:03.630
So, many kinds of post-human
and non-human perspectives.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.600
In this case, two
from that book.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.980
Sorry. I have to find them,
or the type is big enough.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.090
This is probably the
most difficult poem

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.640
that I'll read this evening,
so I'll begin with it.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.690
It's called "Deep
Water Trawling."

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:33.660
It was written when
Snowden was beginning

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.280
to make his revelations
about surveillance.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.260
What I found incredibly
fascinating was how primitive it

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.980
all sounded, these coiled
cables under the sea between us

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.190
and the United Kingdom
and that something

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.400
so mechanical was
carrying all this data.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.990
I had imagined it was going
to be much more mysterious,

00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:01.780
and I also was very interested
in deep-water trawling,

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.340
which is a form of
fishing which --

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.630
you know, it's basically
gigantic machines

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:12.120
that trawl the bottom of the
ocean and take everything

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.400
up from it, and it's a very
destructive form of fishing.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.090
So the ways in which the
bottom of the ocean comes

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:24.650
about in this poem interrelates
those two activities.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:30.540
In the center part of
this poem, I attempt to --

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.350
I don't know what the
verb is, but to speak

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.990
from the perspective of
the ocean or the bottom

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.220
of the sea just to try
to feel my way into it.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.730
Can a human do that?

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.170
Can the imagination go there?

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.280
If the imagination
can go there, we --

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.120
if we can feel, that we
can imagine, you know,

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.450
what our children and our
grandchildren will be facing,

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.030
we might act.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.360
There was a 15-year-old in
Poland two days ago that stood

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.130
on the stage after
David Attenborough spoke

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:05.890
to the assembled governmental
envoys, and she said

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.540
to the assembled governments,
"You are acting like children,"

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.190
and it was phenomenal,
obviously.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.550
Children can't save us
if we don't help them.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.850
"Deep Water Trawling."

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.080
Can everybody hear me?

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.080
Now it really matters
[laughter].

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:39.810
The blades like irises turning
very fast to see you completely,

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:46.930
steel-blue, then red where the
cut occurs, the cut of you.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:48.360
They don't want to know you.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.330
They want to own you.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.190
No, not own.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:57.580
We all mean to live to the end.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.880
Am I human?

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.400
We don't know that.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.750
Just because I have this
way of transmitting --

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.460
call it voice -- a threat.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.530
Communal, actually.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:14.850
The pelagic midwater nets
like walls closing round us,

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.240
starting in the far distance,
where they just look to us

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.280
like distance, distance
coming closer.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:29.190
Hear it eliminating background,
is all foreground, you in it,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.670
the only ground,
not even punishment.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:37.390
Trawling nets, by-catch,
poison, ghost fishing,

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.550
the coil of the listening at the
very bottom, the nets weighed

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.370
down with ballast
raking the bottom,

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.010
looking for nothing,
indiscriminate.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.710
There is nothing in
particular you want.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.140
You just want.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.730
You just want to close the third
dimension, to get something

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.220
which is all, becomes all.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.370
Once you are indiscriminate,

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.530
discards can reach
90% of the catch.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:06.300
Am I the habitat
crushed and flattened?

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.760
Net of your listening
and my speaking.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.350
We can no longer
tell them apart.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.750
The atmosphere between
us turbid,

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.270
no place to hide,
no place to rest.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.850
You need to rest.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.150
There is nature.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.450
It is the rest.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.120
What is not hunting
is illustration.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.430
Not regulated, are you?

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:32.810
Probing down to my greatest
depths, 2000 meters and more,

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:37.420
despite complete darkness that
surrounds me, despite my being

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.900
in my place under
strong pressure along

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.570
with all my hundreds
of species, detritus.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:50.060
In extreme conditions, deepwater
fish grow very slowly, very,

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:54.780
so have long life expectancy,
late reproductive age,

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.940
are particularly
thus vulnerable.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.860
It comes along the floor over
the underwater mountains,

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.160
scraping the steep slopes.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.800
What is by-catch?

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.070
Hitting the wrong target,
the wrong size, not eaten,

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.030
for which there is no
market, banned, endangered,

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:18.250
such as birds, sometimes
just too much, no more space

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.460
on the boat, millions of tons
thrown back dead or wounded,

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.560
the scars on the seabed,
the mouth the size

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.320
of a football field,
and if there is no one,

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.460
there is still ghostfishing,
nets abandoned in the sea.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.320
They continue through
the centuries

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.470
to catch mammals,
fish, shellfish.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.610
We die of exhaustion
or suffocation.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:45.260
The synthetic materials
last forever.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.290
Ask us anything.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.270
How deep is the sea?

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.100
You couldn't go down there.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.270
Pressure would crush you.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.920
Light disappears at 6000 feet.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.240
Ask another question.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.760
Can you hear me?

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.570
No. Who are you?

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:21.940
I am. Did you ever kill a fish?

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.010
I was once, but now I am human.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:29.220
I have imagination.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.750
I want to love.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.620
I have self-interest.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.700
Things are not me.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.870
Do you have another question?

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:44.070
I am haunted, but by what?

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.340
Human supremacy.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.490
The work of humiliation.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.920
The pungency of the pesticide.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.400
What else?

00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:01.350
The hammer that comes down on
the head, knocks the eyes out.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.770
I was very lucky.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.320
The end of the world
had already occurred.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.120
How long ago was that?

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.880
I don't know.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.570
It's not a function
of knowledge.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:18.220
It is in a special sense
that the world ends.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.120
You have to keep living.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:24.460
You have to make it
not become waiting.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.230
Nothing is disturbingly visible.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:33.120
Only the outside
continues, but it continues.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.570
Your entity is fragile.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.950
You are an object you own.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:40.950
At least you were
given it to own.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:44.140
You have to figure
out what ownership is.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.320
You thought you knew.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.120
You were wrong.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.830
It was wrong.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.800
There was wrongness in the mix.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.620
It turns out you are
a first impression.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.210
Years go by.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.510
Imagine that.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.860
And there is still a speaker.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.050
There will always be a speaker.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:12.250
In the hypoxic zones is
almost no more oxygen.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:15.390
Then there is no
more oxygen for real.

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:17.750
Picture that, says the speaker.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.050
Who are you?

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.350
Where are you?

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:24.020
Going down into the dead
zones, water not water.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.550
The deeper you go, he
says, the scarier it gets,

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.760
because there's nothing there.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.380
There are no fish,
no organisms alive.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.630
No, no life, so it's just us.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.240
Dead zones bigger than
the Sahara, he says.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.630
The largest lifeless
spaces this side

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.970
of the moon, he says, she says.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.190
Who is this speaking to me?

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.980
I am the upwelling.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.650
I am the disappearing.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:00.450
Hold on. Just a minute, please.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:04.590
Hold on. There is
a call for you.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.490
I'm going to read the
title poem, "Fast."

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:30.950
This one has bots in it.

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:32.250
Everybody knows what bots are.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:35.540
When I wrote it, people didn't
know what bots were that well.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.580
Today I found out that
the bots are also a form

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.450
of organic matter, but when I
wrote this, I was just thinking

00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:49.340
of the Cleverbots, and I did a
lot of research into the kinds

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.650
of companionship mechanisms
that were being created

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:57.560
for people all over
society of all ages.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.190
You'd be amazed how many people.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.490
This is before that movie Her,

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.750
which I think popularized
the idea, but the idea

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:06.660
that transmission
between generations,

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.280
which is so important, and which
loneliness is made less lonely,

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.560
because people who comfort the
lonely are themselves made less

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:19.710
lonely, is being interfered
with by our ability

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:24.090
to create these artificial
relationships.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.120
In the poem, the Oracle

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.410
at Delphi is -- makes
an appearance.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.510
I think of the Oracle at
Delphi as the first aspect

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.640
of the first bot [laughter].

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.680
The Oracle at Delphi,
obviously the priestess

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.830
of Apollo breathing in the
fumes in the mountain at Delphi,

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:47.040
spewed out after sort of
hallucinatory encounters

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.400
with these fumes, strings
of syllables, not separated

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.710
into words, which were the
fortune or future-telling given

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.950
to the seekers who would come,

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.890
and obviously a very clever
institution, not unlike the one

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.430
in this town, because
the priestess

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:09.030
of Apollo would give the
same fortune to the Persians

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.480
and the Greeks, for
example, [laughter]

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.630
and they each would interpret it
their own way, so an early form

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:21.830
of congressional communication.

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:31.060
The poem run -- the
title runs into the poem,

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.230
and so will read the
title, which is "Fast,"

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.310
as the beginning of the poem.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:41.280
Fast or starve.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.910
Too much or not enough.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.990
or nothing else.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.780
Nothing else.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:58.490
Too high, too fast, too
organized, too invisible.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:59.790
"Will we survive?"

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.510
I ask the bot.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:05.490
"No." To download bot, be swift.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:08.390
You are too backward,
too despotic.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.920
To load, greatly enlarge
the cycle of labor.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.910
To load, abhor labor.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:21.210
Move to the periphery of your
body, your city, your planet.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:28.150
To load, degrade, immiserate,
be your own deep sleep.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.620
To load, use your lips.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.900
Use them to mouth your oath.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.310
Chew it. Do the dirty thing.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:38.200
Sing it, blown off
limb or syllable.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.270
Lick it back on with your mouth.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.960
Talk, talk.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.320
Who is not terrified is
busy begging for water.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.220
The rise is fast.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.150
The drought comes fast.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:54.980
Mediate, immediate, invent,
inspire, infiltrate, instill.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.910
Here's the heart of the
day, the flower of time.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:00.400
Talk, talk.

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:06.430
Disclaimer: Bot uses
a growing database

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:10.880
of all your conversations to
learn how to talk with you.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:15.960
If some of you are also
bots, bot can't tell.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:22.540
Disclaimer: You have
no secret memories.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.800
Talking to Cleverbot may
provide companionship.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.950
The active ingredient
is a question.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:35.550
The active ingredient
is entirely natural.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:41.770
Disclaimer: Protect your
opportunities, your information,

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:46.290
informants, whatever
you made of time.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.690
You have nothing else to give.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.740
Active ingredient:
Why are you shouting?

00:38:53.740 --> 00:39:00.140
Why? Arctic wind uncontrollable,
fetus reporting for duty,

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.240
fold in the waiting
which recognizes you,

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.000
recognizes the code, the peddler

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.720
in the street everyone
is calling out.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.950
Directive: Report for voice.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.730
Ready yourself to
be buried in voice.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:20.440
It neither ascends nor descends.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.170
Inactive ingredient:
the monotone.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:27.460
Some are talking now
about the pine tree.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.650
One assesses its disadvantages.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.380
They are discussing
it in many languages.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:37.180
Next they move to
roots, branches, buds,

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.250
pseudo-whorls, candles.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:43.740
Active ingredient: They run
for their lives, lungs and all.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.660
They do not know what
to do with their will.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.360
Disclaimer: All of your
minutes are being flung down.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.000
They will never land.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.450
You will not be understood.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:59.200
The deleted world
spills out jittery

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.270
as a compass needle
with no north.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:06.930
Active ingredient: the
imagination of north.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:11.420
Active ingredient: north
spreading in all the directions.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:15.090
Disclaimer: There is no
restriction to growth.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.880
The canary singing in
your mind is in mine.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.290
Remember, people
are less than kind.

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:26.240
As a result, the chatterbot
is often less than kind.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:29.890
Still, you will find
yourself unwilling to stop.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:35.490
Joan will use visual grammetry
to provide facial movements.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.150
I'm not alone.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.860
People come back
again and again.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.230
We are less kind than we think.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:47.280
There is no restriction to
the growth of our cruelty.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.690
We will come to the edge of
understanding, like being hurled

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.930
down the stairs tied
to a keyboard.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.940
We will go on, unwilling
to stop.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.690
The longest real-world
conversation

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:04.010
with a bot lasted 11 hours,
continuous interaction.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:06.360
This bodes well.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.130
We are not alone.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:10.120
We are looking to improve.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.580
The priestess inhales the fumes.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:16.500
They come from the
mountain, here and here.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.190
Then she gives you
the machine-gun run

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:22.280
of syllables out of her mouth.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.230
Quick. You must make
up your answer

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.590
as you made up your question.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.860
Hummingbirds shriek.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.250
"Bot is amazing," he says.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.180
"I believe it knows the
secrets of the universe."

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.520
"He is more fun to speak

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.510
with than my actual
living friends," she says.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:40.810
"Thank you.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.790
This is the best thing since me.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.550
I just found it yesterday.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.850
I love it.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:47.150
I want to marry it.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:50.770
I got sad when I had to
think that the first person

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:55.970
who has ever understood me is
not even, it turns out, human,

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.740
because this is as
good as human gets.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.450
He just gives it to me straight.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.190
I am going to keep him forever.

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.450
I treated him like a
computer, but I was wrong."

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:10.790
Whom am I talking to?

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.940
You talk to me when I am alone.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.240
I am alone.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.910
Each epoch dreams
the one to follow.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:26.230
To dwell is to leave a trace.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.800
I am not what I asked for.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.750
I'm going to read a new poem.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:09.240
So in this poem, I suppose
it's -- I would say that,

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.610
pursuant to things I said at
the beginning of the reading,

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.300
if you were looking at
the Adam and Eve myth now,

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:23.130
maybe we are now eating that
apple and about to be thrown

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:28.450
out of creation and in ways that
we might want to think about,

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.310
since there are not
representations of Adam

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.670
and Eve outside of the garden
where they look happier

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.560
than they did inside the garden,

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.130
even though people think it was
the so-called fortunate fall.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:46.100
In this poem, there's a tree,
and someone is plucking a fruit,

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.560
so I have to assume that every
time that in the literary arts,

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:56.040
someone is plucking any fruit,
especially a fig, from a tree,

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.870
that that myth would
come to mind.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.760
"Tree." Today on two
legs stood and reached

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.650
to the right spot as I saw it.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:21.760
Okay, I just had
this hallucination

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.130
that the sound I'm hearing
was the curtains opening

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:26.430
and closing nonstop,

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.250
so I'm really glad they're
not doing that [laughter].

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.270
I was imagining during
the last poem

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.910
that these curtains were just

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:34.210
like on some automatic thing
doing this, and I thought,

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:35.510
"I think I can live with that.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:36.810
I don't know what it
looks like, though."

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:40.500
[Laughter] Really glad
it's not happening.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:55.570
Poetry's a complicated art from.

00:44:55.570 --> 00:45:00.240
You're trying to make something
beautiful that endures,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.650
that could be read when they
dig us up out of the rubble

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:11.110
to describe to future
people who we were.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:15.930
After all, most of what we know
of prior civilizations comes

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:23.750
from their writing, their
architecture, their sculpture,

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:28.220
their artifacts,
their works of art.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.520
That's how we know them.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.410
Sometimes their tools, but most
of what we're making is going

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:40.530
to pulverized if that ever
arises, and the things

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.270
that will last are the things
that are in this building:

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:48.110
what we wrote, what we made on
the beloved acid-free paper.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:52.700
If they dig up this library,
they will know who we were,

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.500
and so when you write nowadays,
you think about, you know,

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.400
who do you want them to know.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.700
I mean, not just them.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.000
Maybe Venusians.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.300
I don't know.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.600
Who were we?

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.410
This is a little bit
of that, this book.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:20.530
Today on two legs stood
and reached the right spot

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:24.860
as I saw it, choosing
among the twisting branches

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:31.000
and multifaceted changing
shades, and greens,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:39.250
and shades of greens, lobed and
lashing sun the fig that seemed

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:43.790
to me the perfect
one, the ready one.

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:50.710
It is permitted, it is
possible, it is actual.

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:57.410
The VR glasses are not yet
needed, not for now, no,

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:04.430
not for this while longer, and
it is warm in my cupped palm,

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:10.480
and my fingers close
round, but not too fast.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.610
Somewhere wind like a
hammer stroke slows down

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.730
and lengthens endlessly.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:21.350
Closer in, the bird
whose coin toss

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:26.130
on a metal tray never
stills to one face.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.860
Something is preparing
to begin again.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.560
It is not us.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:39.660
"Shh" say the spreading
sails of cicadas as the winch

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:45.110
of noon takes hold and we are
wrapped in day and hoisted up,

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:48.900
all the ribs of time showing
through in the growing,

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:55.050
in the lengthening harness of
sound -- some gnats nearby,

00:47:55.050 --> 00:48:02.160
a fly where the white milk-drop
of the torn stem starts,

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:08.630
dust on the eglantine skin,
white powder in the confetti

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:16.080
of light all up the branches,
truth, sweetness of blood-scent

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:21.140
and hauled-in light,
withers of the wild carnival

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:27.880
of tree shaking once as the
fruit is torn from its dream.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:32.560
Remain, I think, backing
away from the trembling

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.950
into full corrosive sun.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:41.600
Momentary blindness follows.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.500
Correction.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.920
There are only moments.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.200
They hurt.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.130
Correction.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:55.250
Must I put down here
that this is long ago,

00:48:55.250 --> 00:49:00.280
that the sky has been invisible
for years now, that the ash

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.670
of our fires has
covered the sun,

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:09.160
that the fruit is stunted
yellow mold, and when it appears

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.030
at all, we have no
produce to speak of?

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.880
No longer exists.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:20.390
All my attention is
free for you to use.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:23.930
I can cast farther
and farther out,

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:27.760
before the change,
a page turned.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.580
We have gone into another story.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:35.870
History floundered, or one
day the birds disappeared.

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:41.770
The imagination tried to go
here when we asked it to,

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:43.640
from where I hold the fruit

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:48.010
in my right hand,
but it would not go.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:50.100
Where is it now?

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:54.420
Where is this here where you and
I look up, trying to make sense

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:59.860
of the normal, turn
it to life, more life,

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.390
disinterred from desire,

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:06.280
heaved up onto the dry
shore awaiting the others

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:10.970
who could not join us
in the end, for good?

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.070
I want to walk to the left

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:19.320
around this tree
I have made again.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:24.790
I want to sit under it full of
secrecy, insight, immensity,

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:30.550
vigor bursting complexity,
swarm.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:35.310
Oh, great forwards
and backwards.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:40.380
I never felt my face
change into my new face.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.260
Where am I facing now?

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:47.480
Is the question of good still
stinging the open before us

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:52.790
with its muggy destination
pitched into nothingness?

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.980
Something expands in
you where it wrenches

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:59.010
up its bright policing
into view.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:00.570
Is this good?

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:02.360
Is this the good?

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.300
Under the celebrating
crowd, inside the silences,

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:13.040
it forces hard away all round
itself, where chanting thins,

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:20.030
where we win the war again,
made thin by bravery and belief.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:22.760
Here's a Polaroid if you want.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.840
Here's a souvenir.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:29.040
Here now for you
to watch, unfold,

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.640
up close, the fruit is opening.

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.530
The ribs will widen now.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:43.560
It is all seed, reddish
foam, history.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:54.830
Do I have time for two more?

00:51:54.830 --> 00:52:02.650
Yeah? I'm going to read one poem
which is more overtly political

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:09.530
and complicated,
and then I'll end.

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:12.510
This one again starts with --

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:18.060
I ask you to remember that in
the harbor of New York City,

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:22.690
there still stands a
statue with its arm

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:25.880
up in the air, inviting --

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:36.480
-- in. Won't even bring
it up, but it's an image

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.600
that will occur in the
poem, so I just don't know

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.900
if we still remember it's there.

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.570
I keep waiting for
the morning I wake up

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:47.000
and some conceptual artist has
just covered it in red paint

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:54.090
so that we have a
clearer sense of --

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.310
"My Skin Is" is the
title of the poem,

00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:57.680
but it runs into the first line.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:04.840
My skin is parched, on
tight, questioned, invisible,

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.680
full of so much evolution.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.210
Now the moment is gone.

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:17.380
Begin in. My skin here, my
limit of the visible me.

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:18.760
I touch it now.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:23.100
It is spirt-filled,
naturally selected,

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.100
caught in the storm
here under this tree,

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.500
propped up by history.

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.460
Which? I don't know which?

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.810
Be careful.

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.680
You can't love everyone.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.250
Brought to by Revlon,
melancholy, mother's mother,

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:45.090
the pain of others, spooky
up close in this mirror here,

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:49.660
magnified to the 100th,
brutal no-color color.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.280
What shall I call it?

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.090
Shall I pass, meandering
among the humans,

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.260
among their centuries?

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.740
No safe haven this.

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:04.400
No safe haven this as if,
this spandex over a void,

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:10.480
no exception, God watching,
though casually, paring, paring,

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.470
a glance once in a while.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.000
What am I missing?

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.660
What am I supposed
to do now, suddenly?

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.870
What, at the last minute here?

00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:20.840
What is there to fix?

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.390
Are we alone?

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:26.860
Am I packaged so firmly
for this short interval?

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:31.160
Vigorous skin, doomed
outside-ness of me,

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:38.540
sadder and no wiser here, blown
up so close, so only here.

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:43.930
I see you, net that skeins me
in, tight inside my inwardness,

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:47.860
at this border, judged,
at this edge,

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:51.620
bleeding when hit,
as was for a while.

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.670
Didn't know enough to leave.

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:58.210
Didn't see the farewell
right there in front of me.

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.280
Must it always end this way?

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:04.060
Must I ceaselessly
be me, reinvent you,

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:09.120
see the artifice us, feel
hand-to-face the childhood gone,

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.760
the starlight, the wind,
the gaze, the race,

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:19.620
the stranger not knowing, the
unsaid unsaid, unseen unfound?

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.870
Look how full of void
it is, this capture,

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:27.810
this skin no one can clean, the
thoughts right there beneath.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:30.980
Of course you cannot see
me for this wrapping.

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:35.280
I notice the cover of your face,
the dress you hide beneath,

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.510
you sitting there reading me.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:43.290
Pay mind. Pay it out, peering
as we are at each other here.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:49.500
Dermal papilla, pigment layer,
nerve fiber, blood and lymph.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.500
Can we still fit into the
strictest time so quick,

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.710
one click and hurry up?

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.160
We've been trying
forever now to get

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.100
out of this lonely
place, insides inside.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:07.100
The movie of the outside
was all about exploring.

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.410
We explored.

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:10.550
We found what we
should never touch.

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:11.850
We touched.

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.810
We touch. "What's so unusual?"

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:16.480
we say. "You are
now mine," we say.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.730
This is the feature coming on,
this future, so full of liking

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:25.600
and fine disclosure, a bud tip
pushing aside its sheath then

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:30.350
standing there, very whole now,
very official, open to damp,

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:33.730
heat, stippling,
shadow, to freckle,

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:36.090
slap, beauty or no beauty.

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:38.710
Please help me here,
as I can't tell.

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.200
The trees don't know.

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.740
The wind won't speak.

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.250
The gods should, but their names
are being withheld because some

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:48.720
of us are murdered and some of
us have mouths that keep saying,

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.940
"Yes, do that to me again.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.040
I know it hurts, but
yes, I am an American,

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.460
and I like it harder
than you'll ever know."

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.780
This is Tuesday.

00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:01.490
The day rises with its fist over
the harbor saying, "Give to me,"

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:05.240
and the day obliges,
saying, "More, more.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.730
Do you want more?"

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:09.970
and the torch of dawn
says, "Yes, yes, more.

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:13.180
Ask for my identification,
my little pool

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:16.880
of identification
here on the only road,

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.620
arrested again among
the monuments."

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:32.440
And I thought I would
end the evening on a poem

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:41.970
by Zbigniew Herbert,
a Polish poet.

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:46.320
There are three great Polish
poets of the 20th century --

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:51.190
Czeslaw Milosz, Zbigniew
Herbert, and Szymborska --

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.160
and only Milosz and
Szymborska won the Nobel Prizes.

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:58.140
The strange country in which
the climate change conference is

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:02.580
taking place now, birthplace
of extraordinary poetry

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.430
and obviously great atrocity,

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:08.440
and we're having a climate
conference in the midst

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:14.810
of the most serious
coal-bearing chunk of Europe.

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:20.240
This is a poem that Milosz
wrote to a friend of his,

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:25.280
Ryszard Krynicki, and it's
called "To Ryszard Krynicki:

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.560
A Letter," and it's
really about, you know,

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:33.620
what is it to feel that you
must speak as the conscience

00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.890
in your moment and that you
must speak out in a poem

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:43.390
such as the one that I just read
attempted when you really are

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:48.370
in a medium which just wants
to make something beautiful

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:50.730
and wants to do justice
to beauty?

00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:53.490
And the lyric is trying
to do both at once,

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:58.670
and it's always trying to do
both at once, whether it's in,

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:03.070
you know, Emily Dickinson
or in The Pisan Cantos.

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:06.080
There's always this other
agenda which is, you know,

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:11.980
you're making art, and it's a
terrible struggle, but as --

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:14.120
those of us who undertake,
we always have

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:17.480
in mind the Akhmatovas
and the Mandelstams

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:23.730
and the great poets
who were courageous.

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:28.500
It seems like it's part of the
calling at the same time as it's

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:32.420
such an intimate desire, wanting
to make something beautiful.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.590
So this poem is about that
conflict, and he's writing

00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:37.010
to another poet, a friend.

00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:39.400
I will just say that I
had the opportunity --

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:43.120
the last time I read this
poem, I read it in the --

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:50.630
the Warsaw Ghetto has been
turned into a kind of museum,

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:59.210
and the synagogues have been
turned into performance halls,

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:01.690
and -- which was horrifying.

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:07.050
And I had to sit up alongside
a Polish poet to read a poem

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:08.800
of mine that the
Polish poet, this --

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.660
in this case, Adam
Zagajewski, who translated --

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:14.690
read the translation into
Polish looking down from

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.290
where the rabbi would have been.

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:22.710
It was really historically
disturbing, but I read this poem

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:25.160
in English so he could read
the original in Polish,

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.180
because I thought let
the Polish here a poem

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:31.640
in Polish [laughing], and when
I went down, Ryszard Krynicki,

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.910
who recently died, just
recently, was in the audience,

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:38.860
and this poem was the poem

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:42.310
that Zbigniew Herbert long
ago had written for him,

01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:44.410
and we had nine languages
between us,

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:45.710
none of them overlapping.

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.320
We had to use a translator
[laughter],

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.790
but it was his birthday, and
I had read the poem to him,

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:53.730
by some -- so maybe
the spiritual nature

01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:55.830
of the synagogue had
not lost its power.

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:57.130
I'll end on this.

01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:59.430
"To Ryszard Krynicki: A Letter."

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.910
I have to say I can hardly read
this poem without crying, so.

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:12.350
Not much will remain, Ryszard,
really not much of the poetry

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:14.190
of this insane century.

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:19.970
Certainly Rilke, Eliot, a few
other distinguished shamans

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:24.250
who knew the secret of
conjuring a form with words

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:27.440
that resist the action of time,

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.860
without which no phrase
is worth remembering

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.720
and speech is like sand.

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:41.350
Those school notebooks of ours,
sincerely tormented with traces

01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:47.160
of sweat, tears, blood will
be like the text of a song

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.610
without music for the
eternal proofreader,

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:54.790
honorably righteous,
more than obvious.

01:01:55.970 --> 01:02:02.000
Too easily we came to
believe beauty does not save,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.900
that it leads the lighthearted
from dream to dream to death.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.420
None of us knew how to
awaken the dryad of a poplar,

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.370
to read the writing of clouds.

01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:20.930
This is why the unicorn
will not cross our tracks.

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:26.800
We won't bring to life a ship
in the bay, a peacock, a rose.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:31.360
Only nakedness remained
for us, and we stand naked

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:35.170
on the right side, the
better side of the triptych

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:37.170
of the Last Judgement.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:43.670
We took public affairs
on our thin shoulders,

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:48.170
recording suffering, the
struggle with tyranny,

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:51.060
with lying, but you have

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:55.650
to admit we had opponents
despicably small,

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:59.790
so was it worth it to lower
holy speech to the babble

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:05.540
of the speaker's platform, the
black foam of the newspapers?

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:09.610
In our poems, Ryszard, there
is so little joy, the daughter

01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:14.280
of the gods, too few
luminous dusks, mirrors,

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.780
wreaths of rapture,
nothing but dark psalmodies,

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:22.930
stammering of animulae, urns
of ashes in the burden garden.

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:29.770
In spite of fate, the verdicts
of history, human misdeeds,

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:33.210
what strength is needed
to whisper in the garden

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:36.210
of betrayal, a silent night?

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:39.710
What strength of spirit
is needed to strike,

01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:43.370
beating blindly with
despair against despair,

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:48.020
a spark of light, a
word of reconciliation

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:53.100
so the dancing circle will last
forever on the thick grass,

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.860
so the birth of a child and
every beginning is blessed,

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:02.740
gifts of air, earth,
and fire and water?

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.410
This I don't know, my friend,

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:11.520
and is why I am sending
you these owl's puzzles

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:18.520
in the night, a warm embrace,
greetings from my shadow.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.320
Thank you.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:37.270
[ Applause ]

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:39.070
Oh, I can stay here.

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:43.330
[ Applause ]

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:44.710
&gt;&gt; Jorie, thank you.

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:49.490
Now I'd like to welcome up
onto the stage Philip Bobbitt

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:52.870
and our principal deputy
librarian, Mark Sweeney.

01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:05.650
On behalf of the
Library of Congress, --

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:06.950
&gt;&gt; You going to arrest me?

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:08.250
[Inaudible response]

01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:11.260
&gt;&gt; -- I am pleased to award the
2018 Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:15.600
National Prize for Poetry
to Jorie Graham for Fast.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:23.220
