BOB MEESE: Thank you for coming
to the Games panel today.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.400
The overall topic is
around bringing your games

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.600
internationally.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.310
And so we have five
fine gentlemen here

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.354
who will tell you some stories.

00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:14.520
I want to make this as
interactive as possible, too,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.155
so if there are anything that
you guys want to hear about,

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:20.280
we have a mic that we'll
bring around as well, too.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.090
So we can take
questions at any point.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.940
This time is for
all of you today.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.789
And we had a nice, lively email
exchange leading up to this.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.830
So we definitely have some
opinions on the panel.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.800
But a great group of guys.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.140
So if you guys have any other
questions or topics to suggest,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.420
please do that.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.830
But just first want to start off
by having these guys just spend

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.650
30 seconds just
introducing themselves,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.120
their company, and then
any specific experience

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.860
around bringing your games
to international markets,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.120
just to kind of introduce
everybody at the start here.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:56.580
SAAD CHOUDRI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.680
I'm Saad Choudri from Miniclip.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.610
We're probably best known in the
app stores for "8 Ball Pool."

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.970
So if you haven't played
that, check it out.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.919
We also publish James
Vaughan's "Plague Inc"--

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:12.960
I'll give him a shout,
because he's right there--

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.390
on the Android platform.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.750
And because we started
as a Flash games website

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.280
14 years ago and transitioned
over to mobile about four years

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.740
ago, we've always been
global and bringing

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.190
content to the
world the moment we

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.360
deployed it, because
we started on browser.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.550
We never had any of
those issues from trying

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.050
to work in the console days and
bring them to different-- NTSC

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.710
to PAL, for instance.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.930
And the way we would
do that is by trying

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.260
to keep the language very--
as few strings as possible

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.809
and keep it very graphical.

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:53.850
And we've continued to do
that in mobile as well.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.724
And we can discuss as we
talk how we've done that.

00:01:56.724 --> 00:01:57.390
BOB MEESE: Good.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.751
Thanks a lot.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:00.000
JOE RAEBURN: Hello, everybody.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.040
My name is Joe Raeburn.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.140
I'm a producer at
Space Ape Games.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.970
We make "Samurai Siege," which
is a relatively popular combat

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.120
strategy game.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.470
We are live globally.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.950
We're about to go live
in Korea specifically.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.130
We had a unique
challenge in that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.519
we were a team of
just 10 people.

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.060
We got together to
make a game, where

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.500
we wanted to take on Supercell
and the rest of the world.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.040
And one of the things
that we had about our game

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.750
is it's actually a
Japanese-themed combat strategy

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.340
game.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.870
We had some naysayers
saying there's

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.245
no way that a
bunch of Westerners

00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:30.512
can take a Japanese-themed
combat strategy game

00:02:30.512 --> 00:02:31.470
and launch it in Japan.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.550
You must be crazy.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.930
And so for a while we let
these guys psych ourselves out.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.304
We'd done all of
the basic stuff,

00:02:36.304 --> 00:02:40.310
like in terms of basic hygiene
for localization, what Hyunse

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.940
says in his presentation is
perfect-- just take that, get

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.460
the notes, follow it, but
don't psych yourselves out.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.720
Don't listen to people who
say your game won't work.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.745
Human beings are
fundamentally wired the same.

00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:53.480
Our brains are identical all
the way around the world.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.980
There are layers of culture
that you need to pierce through,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.040
but as long as you get through
them and you have a good game,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.290
your game will succeed.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.660
So this game that people
said, they'll never

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.600
like this Western Japanese game
in Japan, in fact has over 50%

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.240
day one retention in Japan.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.970
Monetization is twice what
it is in the United States,

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.470
and the game's performing
incredibly well.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.090
So don't listen
to the naysayers.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.550
Get the basic facts right.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.310
Launch your game.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.810
Success!

00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:22.565
EYAL RABINOVICH: OK.

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:25.040
Is it working?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.010
BOB MEESE: Not yet.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.940
EYAL RABINOVICH: So my name is
Eyal, and I'm from Playscape.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.232
We publish games since 2008.

00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:35.690
And I'm managing the Marketing
and the Business Development

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.740
activities.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.850
We have about 50
games in the market.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.490
70 million downloads.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.930
And when it comes to
launching the games,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.300
we always do it globally.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.670
So localization is a big issue.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.440
Our approach is just
try to stay as much

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.600
data-driven as possible.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.510
And I'm sure we can talk
about it in this panel.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.575
And that's it.

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:57.325
BOB MEESE: Thanks.

00:03:57.325 --> 00:03:59.283
ANATOLY ROPOTOV: Let me
see if this is working.

00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:01.940
OK, my name is Anatoly, and
I'm CEO of Game Insight.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.590
Game Insight is a global game
developer, cross-platform one.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.660
We have over 30 games,
250 million players.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.140
And the biggest challenge for
us once we enter the new market

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.810
is to ensure that we
could smoothly roll out

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.089
at least six to seven and
even more games in operation.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.835
Our biggest genre is SIM/Tycoon
and Hidden Object, so a lot

00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:22.250
of story-driven, a
lot of localization,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.740
a lot of tailoring the
content for local markets.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.850
And our approach is typically to
tie in the launch of the games

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.070
with some local
festive activity,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.630
so it'll be either holidays,
or some kind of events.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.360
Let's say, if it's
Brazil, it would

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.920
be either Carnival or a
football championship,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.270
to really say that we
thinking about local players

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.790
and thinking about the market
and committing ourselves

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.435
to deliver the best community
management and a lot

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:52.060
of different practices
for that market.

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:55.580
ANTONIN LHUILLIER: Hello.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.740
I'm Antonin.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.700
I work for Gameloft
on the business side.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.320
I manage, among others,
business offices in Moscow,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.150
in London, Berlin, Copenhagen,
so what we call North Europe.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.950
And I'm in charge also of
the partnership with Google

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.710
at [? TMA ?] level.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.890
So we launch all
our games globally.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.420
We localize in 16 languages.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.840
We have lately started
localizing our games

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.480
in Arabic language, Indonesian,
Thai, traditional Chinese.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.160
So when we have a
lot of local teams,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.950
we make sure that the launch
of our localized games

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.170
succeed in each territory.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.960
So, in particular, we are
very-- as Anatoly said,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.030
we do a lot of in-game events
tailored to local players.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.940
We also make sure that we
address the local media.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.470
We know the local
media landscape,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.670
including in some cases the
specific social networks that

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.610
are strong in a given country.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.410
Like in Korea, for
instance, you need

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.520
to work with Kakao
or in some cases

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.550
to integrate Kakao inside
your games to succeed.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.210
Or you need also to
address your players

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.374
through VKontakte in Russia.

00:06:24.374 --> 00:06:25.040
BOB MEESE: Cool.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.830
Thanks, everybody.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.910
So one of the baselines that
we've started to talk about

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.394
is around localization.

00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:32.810
I've talked with
some of you guys,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.520
too, in terms of there's many
different languages that you're

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.166
localizing into.

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:38.915
If you're not a native
speaker, though, it

00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:41.620
can be hard to understand
is this any good?

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.520
I'm curious if you guys
have thoughts or just

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.880
any suggestions
in terms of how do

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.070
you know when your
localization is good enough?

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.150
Do you need a native speaker
for all of those languages?

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.950
Or how do you guys
make that determination

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.240
in terms of when your
localization for a given

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.662
language is good enough
to put it out there?

00:06:58.662 --> 00:07:00.120
JOE RAEBURN: I'm
going to take that

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.270
from a small studio perspective.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.860
So what we do is, we make sure
that we have excellent customer

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.880
support in place when we launch.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.335
So customer support is key.

00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:10.980
It's kind of just
like Hyunse said,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.312
good App Store descriptions,
really, really good

00:07:13.312 --> 00:07:15.770
localizations, and making sure
that you have local customer

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.180
support on the ground.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.765
Get local customer support on
the ground relatively early so

00:07:20.765 --> 00:07:23.200
that they can start gearing
up and understanding the game.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.140
And those same guys,
if they're on board

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.515
and they're part
of your company,

00:07:26.515 --> 00:07:28.990
and they're playing your
game trying to understand it,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.310
what we did is we used them
as a final layer of QA.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.610
So what we're actually
doing for our new project

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.580
is we're doing something
like an AB test.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.117
So we're taking one
small sliver of the game

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:40.700
that we know and we
understand, and we

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.500
know that will stay the same.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.708
We're putting that out to
four different localization

00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:45.430
providers.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.695
And we're assigning the
customer support agent

00:07:47.695 --> 00:07:49.570
that role of playing
through it in those four

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.903
different languages or those
four different translations

00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:53.760
and saying, this
one's the best, but it

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.480
needs this little
bit of feedback.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.995
So because we knew that
customer support agent anyhow

00:07:57.995 --> 00:08:00.670
and because they need to
understand the game anyhow,

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.950
we're essentially
getting this final level

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.830
of localization choice for free.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.070
SAAD CHOUDRI: Joe, do you
guys hire people specifically

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.600
in each country?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.504
Or do you outsource
that customer support?

00:08:14.504 --> 00:08:15.920
JOE RAEBURN: So
we've got a system

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.010
where we give each
language the level of love

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.009
that we want to give it.

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:22.020
So Japanese and
Korean, for example,

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.870
they are huge, huge markets.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.492
So we want to hire one person
specifically for each of those.

00:08:27.492 --> 00:08:30.520
Some of the European
languages, like, for example,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.490
we are not doing
so great in Spain,

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.070
and we have a few people.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.510
And Brazilian Portuguese
is quite good for us.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.000
But we might find someone in
Europe, someone from a player

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.594
base who really wants
to come on board that

00:08:41.594 --> 00:08:42.990
can speak two or
three languages.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.310
And we're like,
great; we'll have you.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.310
So we try to double
up on the languages

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.200
where the revenue isn't so high
but have dedicated customer

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.269
support for languages where
the revenue is very high.

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:54.060
SAAD CHOUDRI: Cool.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.095
I only say that
because there's going

00:08:56.095 --> 00:08:59.740
to be studios in here who have
varying amounts of ability

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.232
to actually hire people on the
ground in these territories,

00:09:03.232 --> 00:09:04.440
which are clearly high value.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.000
We saw the presentation of
where revenue's coming from.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.395
But to answer the
question, it's reviews.

00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:12.030
It's user feedback.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.040
If you can start seeing your
rating go down all of a sudden

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.437
once you've pushed out a
language localization build

00:09:17.437 --> 00:09:19.520
and you've not changed
anything else for the game,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.850
and it was doing well
before, you probably

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.530
messed up translation somewhere.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.320
So that's probably
the best indicator.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.530
BOB MEESE: That's
the negative signal.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.830
SAAD CHOUDRI: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.110
But if it's good, then
you get good feedback.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.346
You get your account managers
in each country saying, yeah,

00:09:34.346 --> 00:09:35.970
that's really good,
and it's well done.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.630
And to be honest, we leverage
our platform contacts, who

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.440
will say, yep,
you're doing well.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.080
That makes sense.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.630
The example I used
in our email, Fred,

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:51.030
was, for instance, pool
means nothing in Turkey.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.100
It just doesn't mean anything.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.130
But that's what our game
is called out there.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.670
So we were told by a fan that
no, it's American billiards.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.690
That's what you actually
need to call it.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.960
And it's still English.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.360
You don't even have to change
into the Turkish language

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:06.860
string.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.990
It's just you have
to name it what

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.832
people know that game to be.

00:10:10.832 --> 00:10:12.540
And I think, Joe, you
mentioned something

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.990
about the negative
connotation of samurai.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.720
JOE RAEBURN: Yeah, because
of the Sino-Japanese War,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.600
samurai isn't always perceived
with the most positive

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.665
connotations.

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.040
What we heard from
our research--

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.320
and I'm probably going to
be corrected by someone

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.740
who knows it better--
was that about one

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.780
out of four people
in Korea would

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.790
have a vaguely negative
reaction to the word "samurai."

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.940
So what we actually
did is, in Japan

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.275
it's called "Samurai Big War."

00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:41.275
We came up with a slightly
different translation

00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:43.530
in English, changed
that into Korean,

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.281
bounced it off our
translation company

00:10:45.281 --> 00:10:47.530
and bounced it off our Korean
customer support people.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.030
And they said, that
name is awesome.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.020
so we went with that.

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:55.440
EYAL RABINOVICH: So I
think the biggest operation

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.860
we had when it came to
translating the games

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.070
and localizing them
was when we had

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.900
a deal with NTT DoCoMo in Japan.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.820
And they basically asked
us to take 100 games

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.460
and to localize them,
which we thought,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.590
yes, OK, we can do that.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.960
But it wasn't that easy.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.330
It's so much more than
just translating the text,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.080
even if all you want to do
is just translate the text.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.730
So using QA is always advisable.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.750
We had a local partner in Japan.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.899
So if you can have that,
I think that's amazing

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:26.190
because they can play the game.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.606
They can give you
direct feedback.

00:11:27.606 --> 00:11:30.180
You have someone
to talk to, which

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.920
is-- I think it might be more
advisable than just releasing

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.620
the game to the
market, then starting

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.330
to see your rating go down.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.440
Each point's so painful.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.220
So that's what we did in Japan.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.840
And when it comes to working
with translation companies,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.730
you can always ask
them to also add

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.600
QA, which means
they'll play the game

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.020
and see that everything
was added properly.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.260
So just do that.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.994
I think that's a
good investment.

00:11:56.994 --> 00:11:57.660
BOB MEESE: Cool.

00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:01.450
ANATOLY ROPOTOV:
At Game Insight,

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.780
it's a big challenge for
us to run a lot of events

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.940
and localize a lot of
content on a bi-weekly basis.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.610
So we employ combined approach
of having in-house localization

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:12.750
teams across Europe.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.080
We have some people in Germany.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.450
We have in-house French
community management.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.120
Our HQ's in Lithuania and
Riga, in Baltic states,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.870
where it's easy for us to
handle operations in Russia.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.090
So we combine all that
approach out there,

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.040
but definitely it's a
big challenge for us

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.410
with a lot of Eastern
European teams

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.420
to localize that in
different languages.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.530
So first of all, those
teams would typically think,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:39.660
let's say, in Russian.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:45.310
So we have a lot of US people
in house who take that content

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.940
and make it appropriate
for global markets.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.190
And then this content would
be delivered to other markets.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.620
So for us, it's a challenge
to let those teams know

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.410
how they should
perceive the world.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.430
Train them in global
events across the world.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.920
Explain to them
socially acceptable

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.440
practices across the world,
anything from perception

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.820
of vulgarity to
things like that.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.920
And surprisingly, it's sometimes
a challenge to explain that.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.795
But yeah, that's our approach.

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:16.670
BOB MEESE: Could you
speak a little bit, too,

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.045
for some of the
bigger companies,

00:13:18.045 --> 00:13:21.150
just the amount of investment
in terms of the number of people

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.859
that are working on
some of these things?

00:13:22.859 --> 00:13:25.274
ANATOLY ROPOTOV: Yeah, so for
localization and translation

00:13:25.274 --> 00:13:27.490
teams and in-house proofreading
and things like that,

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.670
it's in tens of people in house.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.240
For markets like Asia, we
typically partner with someone

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.330
to work with us.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.920
As a cross-platform
developer, we

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.220
have a big advantage
of, let's say,

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.170
going into social network in
Japan, working with a partner,

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.660
and then reusing all
that localization

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.660
and great content
that is typically

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.910
super hard to produce without
having those people in house

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.690
and to plan into our mobile
games in cross-platform manner,

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.090
and we see great
results with that.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.820
But we would like to expand
that and build a better

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.817
team to serve the
Asian market as well.

00:14:03.817 --> 00:14:05.150
We're working in that direction.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.900
BOB MEESE: Thanks.

00:14:07.794 --> 00:14:09.460
ANTONIN LHUILLIER:
Yeah, so at Gameloft,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.420
we have resources
in-house for localization.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:20.160
And we also have localization
QA teams, especially

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.730
for, let's say, more
difficult languages,

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.420
like Japanese, Korean,
and also Russian.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.700
Russian is quite
demanding, because you

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.420
need as much text as
English, if not more.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.050
And the characters weigh a
bit more in terms of bytes.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.970
So in some cases, we need
to stretch the translation

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.630
very much, because our games
are initially made English.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:53.230
So we need to add
Russian text to stick

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:57.390
to the limits which
are I'm in the games.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.670
There are specific parts of the
games, like buttons and so on,

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:05.210
where you need sometimes to
go for a translation which

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.840
is not as good as another one.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.974
But it fits the limits.

00:15:11.974 --> 00:15:12.640
BOB MEESE: Cool.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.515
One other thing, too.

00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:17.850
We talked about localization
versus culturalization, right?

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.400
So making more significant
changes to the game

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.560
beyond just translating.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.210
And so it seems like there's
a couple different opinions

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.540
across this group, too.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.910
So anybody with a
particularly strong opinion

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.669
in terms of either
culturalization is appropriate,

00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:34.460
or it doesn't work?

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.410
And it can certainly differ
by type of game, as well, too.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.750
But just on this topic
of culturalization,

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.250
anybody who wants to
talk about whether you're

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.990
for it or against it for
your particular games.

00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:50.720
SAAD CHOUDRI: I
don't want it to seem

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.750
like it's just binary
going down the thing.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:52.880
BOB MEESE: Yep.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.940
SAAD CHOUDRI: Then
also, if people--

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.950
it's the last session of the
day, when most of us know--

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:56.460
BOB MEESE: Grab a drink, yeah.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.585
SAAD CHOUDRI: Just jump in.

00:15:57.585 --> 00:15:59.420
BOB MEESE: Yeah.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.185
SAAD CHOUDRI: For us,
culturalization isn't just

00:16:03.185 --> 00:16:06.160
the art style, isn't
just the pricing.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.000
It's actually the
live operations.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.110
It's the events.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.510
It's when you do the
push notifications.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:16.140
It's like people were saying,
in Korea, it's after meal times,

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.400
or it's when
they're on the Tube.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.140
I've often said that actually,
the best time for gaming

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:26.040
in the UK would be during
the commuting hours as well,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.830
but we don't have good
Wi-Fi in the Tube.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.060
So that could all change.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.775
So for us, culturalization
is crucial.

00:16:31.775 --> 00:16:34.630
But as a company that needs
to, obviously, make profit,

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.130
it's very difficult for us
to invest in these countries,

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.880
because you have to
ramp up new offices.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.650
You have to find
trustworthy partners.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.500
So we do go and look
for the best people

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.810
to work with in each territory.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.949
And then it's still a lot of
resources on your company.

00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:53.240
You still have to support that.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.392
You still have a
producer looking at that.

00:16:55.392 --> 00:16:57.350
And it's quite difficult,
because that producer

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.690
isn't the expert in
that market, which

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.240
is why you're using those guys.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.030
It's just a lot of trust.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.163
And you then don't know
if it's going to do well.

00:17:07.163 --> 00:17:08.079
There's track records.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.800
And most of us will be trying
to look at the APAC region,

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.540
because it's probably the
most difficult for us all

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.998
to penetrate-- apart from Joe,
who seems to have smashed it

00:17:14.998 --> 00:17:17.390
out of the park with
his "Samurai Siege."

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:23.099
But we have to
culturalize it and not

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:24.670
look like just localization.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.160
Because if you want to
really extract value

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.260
from these regions,
players demand it,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.080
because there's so
much content out there.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.510
And if you won't do it, then
a domestic player will do it.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.270
So, yeah I think
you have to look

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.870
at what works best for you.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.710
If you can do it
in-house, great.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.060
But the easiest method
is a local partner.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.402
And there's different ways
to cut that up and figure out

00:17:46.402 --> 00:17:47.860
a deal that works
for your company.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.970
JOE RAEBURN: So I'm going
to talk about a funny story,

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:52.610
not from us.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.310
But it's from when we
tried to get a better

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.289
Japanese localization,
because our first one, someone

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:00.080
looked at it and said,
that's just rubbish.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.450
That will never fly.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.640
They then told us a
story about this game.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.720
It was to do with, I
think, some farm animals.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.916
They'd got a really, really
bad localization partner.

00:18:10.916 --> 00:18:12.540
It was translated
into Japanese, but it

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.820
was like broken Japanese.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:17.700
It made absolutely no sense.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.340
But then they just
shipped it anyway.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.420
And they shipped it, and it
was all about these little farm

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.260
animals.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.802
And the game did
really, really well,

00:18:24.802 --> 00:18:26.426
because players
laughed at it and said,

00:18:26.426 --> 00:18:28.060
this Western art
style is so funny.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.060
They all talk in
such a funny way.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.620
They're such funny,
funny characters.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.880
And they're so cute.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.300
So I guess the moral of
that that you can take away

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.530
is ultimately what really
matters are your stats.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.230
If you're not looking at your
day one retention, if you're

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.210
not looking at your
day seven retention,

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.660
if you're not looking
at your monetization,

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.489
if you're not looking
at your reviews,

00:18:46.489 --> 00:18:48.280
then you're not looking
at the right stuff.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.150
And there might
be one, like, I'd

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.690
love to say, yes,
fully culturalize

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.180
your game for every single
territory out there.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.000
With unlimited manpower,
with a 6,000-person company,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.250
I highly recommend
that's what you do.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.360
If you've got a team
of 15 people trying

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.930
to make a difference,
then you really

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.210
have to pick your battles.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.210
And what we saw when we
translated into Japanese

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.890
is it was just one
thing that really

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.300
wasn't cutting the mustard.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.634
If you've ever logged into a
game like "Rage of Bahamut"

00:19:12.634 --> 00:19:14.341
or any similar games,
you know that there

00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:15.850
are lots and lots
of live events.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:16.840
When you log in,
you see something

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.965
that looks like a web page--
because effectively it

00:19:18.965 --> 00:19:21.860
is a web page-- and it will say
something like, 17th of August!

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.837
19th of August!

00:19:22.837 --> 00:19:23.420
Special event!

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.240
Exclamation point,
exclamation point.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.860
That's actually a very,
very distinct coded language

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.931
in the way that they talk
about events in Japan.

00:19:32.931 --> 00:19:35.430
And we run a lot of live events
in our game "Samurai Siege."

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.080
We looked at Asian
games for inspiration.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.100
And we wanted to be able
to do that in the West,

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.420
and they just weren't getting
communicated correctly.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.580
And again, our Japanese
customer support

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.280
person said, let me just
take what you've got

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.110
and mock it up in Photoshop.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.510
And although event
screens are normally

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.690
kind of like-- not HTML, but
a template-driven environment

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.050
where you put translated
text over the top,

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.640
and it renders it
in-game in Arial

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.750
or whatever font
we're using, we just

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.850
decided to do single
images for Japan

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.740
that she made in Photoshop, and
she copy-pasted it in there.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.482
And then the response to
those event pages went way up.

00:20:08.482 --> 00:20:10.940
And then we tried it on Japanese
players, and they're like,

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.523
you know what?

00:20:11.523 --> 00:20:13.739
There's not really anything
that's wrong with what

00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:14.280
you're doing.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.130
And so we went, OK,
let's launch it.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.890
On the thing around
notifications,

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:23.160
I think there's been a lot of
underlying theme of designing

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.260
for people's lives.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.782
And essentially, that's
designing for humans.

00:20:26.782 --> 00:20:28.490
If you think about
when is the right time

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.570
to push someone, yes, if
you're going to send out

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.880
a bulk push to your
entire customer base,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.220
then doing it at 2:00 AM is
a really, really bad move.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.980
You're not going to
get too many responses.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.770
But if you start thinking about,
how does my notification system

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:42.090
work?

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.465
And how does it
take into account

00:20:43.465 --> 00:20:45.630
what time-- the players
playing patterns?

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.940
Like if they always
log in at 7:00 AM,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.294
then maybe the notification
should come at 6:59 AM

00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:53.960
to match up with what
their schedule is.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.040
You don't need to have 200
producers, or 20 producers,

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.580
or 10 producers looking at
what the right times are

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.580
in each country.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.120
You have analytics and
data and player patterns.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.070
And you can just create nice
human-centric scheduling

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.262
things that work for humans.

00:21:11.262 --> 00:21:12.720
And you'll find
that generally they

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.730
will work for humans
all the world around.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.757
And find what the exceptions
are and fix the exceptions,

00:21:17.757 --> 00:21:19.590
and you'll end up
culturalizing a few things

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.870
rather than
culturalizing everything.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.740
EYAL RABINOVICH:
So I think there

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.640
are two main approaches when
it comes to localization.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.745
You can, first of all,
decide which countries

00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:32.730
you want to localize your
game to, select the top 10,

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.380
and localize before
you launch the game.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.950
And you can also start launching
the game in one language,

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.775
and see which one catches up,
and just translate and localize

00:21:42.775 --> 00:21:44.230
as you go.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.810
This is the way even GooglePlay
recommends you to do that.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.795
They give you
suggestions whenever

00:21:48.795 --> 00:21:50.420
they see that you
have a user base that

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.310
grows in a specific country.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.462
And the second approach is a
little bit more data-driven.

00:21:55.462 --> 00:21:56.920
But it also means
that you're going

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.930
to launch a game
that is not fully

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.510
baked for a specific language.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.530
So there are pros and cons
for each one of those.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.610
The second thing I would
like you to think about

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.360
is the fact that you're going
to localize the game for top 10

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.500
languages, but you're not
going to be able to localize it

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.970
to all the languages
you have in your game.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.420
Just too costly, and
the operational costs

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.330
are also something
to be considered.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:25.050
So you're going to have
a big category of players

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.519
that are considered to be in the
"other" category that are going

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:29.810
to play a version of your game.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.670
And you have to think
about how that version is

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.250
going to look like.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:39.560
I don't think that necessarily
going for an English version

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.300
would be the right choice.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.680
So what we have been
doing is we started

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.520
to think about how
we can globalize

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.747
a version of the game.

00:22:46.747 --> 00:22:48.830
It will be played by people
that don't necessarily

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:54.150
speak English, but we are
not likely to localize

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.440
the game for.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.350
And actually, it shows
us really good results,

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.330
both in retention
and in monetization.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.030
And so I think you have
to be kind of flexible

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.490
and mix different
approaches if you

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.730
want to be able to scale up.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.860
It's not something that--
there's no paradigm.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.810
And sometimes you
localize the game,

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.497
and it doesn't show any results.

00:23:14.497 --> 00:23:16.080
BOB MEESE: Could you
repeat that, too?

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.020
Because you shared a really
good visual earlier, too,

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.524
in terms of what that solution
was for the other group.

00:23:22.524 --> 00:23:24.190
Could you talk about
that a little more?

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.481
EYAL RABINOVICH: Yeah, so
basically it's really simple.

00:23:26.481 --> 00:23:28.630
And what's nice about
it is that globalization

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.577
doesn't take a lot of
resources because you

00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:31.910
don't have to have translations.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.100
What you have to do
is to think about what

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.480
are the strings in
your game that you

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.830
can replace with
intuitive icons.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.300
And by the way, even if the
icons are not very intuitive,

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.620
it's sometimes just good
to put them out there.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.050
If they're not taking a
prominent part of the game,

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.957
people will just click on it
later on and see what it does.

00:23:50.957 --> 00:23:53.040
So we took the main menu
of "Ninja Chicken," which

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.240
is one of our more
successful franchises,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.110
and we just replaced
a few of the buttons

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.770
with icons that we
thought that made sense.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.735
And after doing
so, we actually saw

00:24:02.735 --> 00:24:05.490
that some of the
English-speaking segments,

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.734
actually, even react better
to these modifications.

00:24:08.734 --> 00:24:10.150
So it's kind of
interesting to see

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.525
how people react
to casual games.

00:24:11.525 --> 00:24:14.077
I think it's
specifically-- I mean,

00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:15.410
you can do it with casual games.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.850
I don't think that mid-core
games and hard-core games

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.670
would be suitable
for this approach.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.510
But if you have a game that
is not very text-intensive,

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.260
I think you should
be able to think

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.593
about how you do it that way.

00:24:29.242 --> 00:24:31.450
ANATOLY ROPOTOV: We employ
some data-driven practices

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:37.195
to figure out if certain
countries performing less,

00:24:37.195 --> 00:24:38.810
is performing worse than others.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.800
So just looking at things
like the total completion

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.150
rates, retention rates
for that country,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.610
is kind of a signal
to figure out

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.620
if something is wrong with
localization or content

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.470
approach, and things like that.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.960
And then I would
definitely benchmark

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.650
against English
and Russian, which

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.280
would be always perfect for
us, and we would figure out

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.070
if something is
wrong here and there.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.650
And the coolest thing in the
Google Developer Console,

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:06.840
that a lot of times it
gives signals, and talks

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.260
about this region
is starting to grow,

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.682
but you actually don't
have localization for that.

00:25:12.682 --> 00:25:14.530
For some of the
games, we would launch

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.560
with few languages in beta.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.070
For some others, we would
definitely go all in

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.720
and say seven, eight, at least,
languages, up to even 10.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.260
But then it all
really comes down

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.210
to whether these
countries could monetize

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.840
with this type of games.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.730
If, let's say, female
players in a certain country

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.459
have those payment methods.

00:25:34.459 --> 00:25:36.500
They have debit cards,
and the couldn't use them.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.320
So you have to be really
careful about that.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.420
You have to go region
by region and figure out

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.230
if certain localization is
appropriate for that region.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:50.180
But it's sometimes a challenging
to localize some of our games,

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.460
like hidden-object
games, because

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.710
for hidden-object games,
it's a huge challenge

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.840
to create the glossary with
visual things out there.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.040
So people would definitely
identify a single word

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.820
with a shape, with
an image out there.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.730
And if a localization
team doesn't

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.754
have a great visual glossary,
let's say, this is a glass,

00:26:09.754 --> 00:26:11.420
or this is a mirror,
and they would just

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.360
localize a word without
actually looking at the object

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.450
and perceiving the context
of the subject in the game,

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.997
we would definitely see a
game performing really bad.

00:26:19.997 --> 00:26:22.163
And we would have to throw
out the full localization

00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:26.400
and go from scratch and explain
to the localization team

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.560
how to approach that.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.910
So definitely, different
games and genres

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.540
have different approach for us.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.260
And in a lot of countries,
it's a challenge

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:42.840
to have social context and
to achieve as good results

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.620
as in other countries.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.860
ANTONIN LHUILLIER: So I
said that the first step

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:53.490
for culturalization is
also your portfolio,

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.350
because you need some games.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.300
I mean, they won't
work in some places.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.800
So we see that when we launched,
for instance, "Spiderman

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:08.820
Unlimited," it works greatly
in the UK and the US.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.540
And players from
other territories

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.600
won't necessarily maybe
not even know Spiderman.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.082
I don't know, but
it's an IP which--

00:27:21.082 --> 00:27:22.540
SAAD CHOUDRI: How
is that possible?

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.830
Everybody knows Spiderman.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.820
ANTONIN LHUILLIER:
So far, and in some

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.580
territories, we
basically feel that you

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:36.220
need to go really to localize
the business model also,

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.250
as Rahim said before.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:45.230
So, for instance, in Japan--
and also the session on Korea

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.020
was interesting from
this point of view--

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:53.730
is there is [INAUDIBLE], so we
have tweaked some of our games

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.190
to make them fit
the monetization

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.520
habits of some customers.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.920
So let's say that's the
very first step that we take

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.600
at Gameloft to be
a global player is

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.890
to have a very wide
portfolio of titles

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:17.080
and to try to please
to any customer,

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.774
to have something for everyone.

00:28:19.774 --> 00:28:20.440
BOB MEESE: Cool.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.090
Any other questions
from the audience?

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.369
We can keep going but-- sure.

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:26.744
AUDIENCE: What do you think
about community translations?

00:28:26.744 --> 00:28:29.882
Is it too risky, or it's a good
way to engage with the users?

00:28:29.882 --> 00:28:31.840
BOB MEESE: So the question
is just what do they

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.020
think about community
translations?

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.420
Is it a good way to engage
with users or too risky?

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.670
SAAD CHOUDRI: We get probably
in the general emails

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:49.010
where people say, hey,
I'm from random country

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.410
X. I love your game.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.410
I want to translate it.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:56.110
I think there will be a
really big market for it.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.340
It's one of those things
that comes down to trust.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.430
He could be a language
professor at a university.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.920
We have had that.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.660
But we've still not gone through
the process, because sometimes,

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.930
the truth is, it's
just that market for us

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.750
hasn't really got
the traction that we

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.254
need to justify doing it.

00:29:15.254 --> 00:29:16.670
So somebody in the
community could

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.330
do the language localization
and get it out there,

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.110
but again, it's time, effort,
and resources, really,

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.300
that comes down to it.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.760
But why not?

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.750
It could be good.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:28.590
Try it.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:29.329
Check it out.

00:29:29.329 --> 00:29:31.120
BOB MEESE: We don't
need to test everybody.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.290
Anybody have a
different point of view?

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.115
Anybody in favor of
community translation?

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.660
ANATOLY ROPOTOV:
Well, as our games

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.710
are being updated
every few weeks here

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.810
and there, it's kind
of hard to stick

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:48.440
to a single
outsourced person who

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.760
likes the game enough
to localize it,

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.170
perhaps for a month or two.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:57.750
But I think this applies more
to in the casual single-player

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.030
games, it could
be localized once,

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.430
and then the developer
would definitely see benefit

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.060
from sales from this region.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.910
He could approach blogs in that
region, and things like that.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.876
But so far, we
haven't done that.

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:12.832
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.970
BOB MEESE: Could you get a mic?

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:20.856
Can you pass a mic?

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.420
All right.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.000
AUDIENCE: So we use
Crowdin to handle

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.660
some crowd-sourced
localizations,

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.000
and it's actually
been very helpful.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.500
It's a good way to just hit the
languages which you wouldn't

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.750
really bother doing otherwise.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.180
So a lot of the
Nordic countries,

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.100
English works fine for us.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.070
But then we've got
about 5,000 people

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.770
who have been working
on translating

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.860
the game into multiple
different languages.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.150
There's no cost to it, except
for it costs $20 a month

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.700
or something to
set up the system.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.550
And as long as you
have an automated way

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:58.350
to handle the strings, you
can have as many languages

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.600
as your community wants to do.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.630
And then you can see
if it's worth, then,

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.730
investing in having a proper
translation done down the line.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:10.385
So if you've got the community,
I think it's worth doing.

00:31:10.385 --> 00:31:13.042
BOB MEESE: Any other
questions out there?

00:31:13.042 --> 00:31:16.217
AUDIENCE: We're taking about
translation and localization.

00:31:16.217 --> 00:31:17.550
BOB MEESE: Want to pass it over?

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.950
AUDIENCE: We're talking about
localization and translation.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.510
And I wanted to ask if you
do just the text localization

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:33.510
where you keep the voiceover
and the original in English,

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.430
for instance?

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:38.170
Or do you do both, or
like a complete package?

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.820
And if it's actually
worth doing just the text

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.170
and then having the voiceover
in English, whether it's

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.130
having actually a worse
impact than just leaving it

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.170
in English?

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.840
ANATOLY ROPOTOV:
So at Game Insight,

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.170
we have a title called
"Tank Domination," which

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:54.830
came out earlier this year.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.700
We launched it at GDC.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.880
And it features Michael Ironside
from "Starship Troopers,"

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.500
a famous US actor out there.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.135
And he voiceovered that for US.

00:32:05.135 --> 00:32:06.990
For Russia, we used
a different person

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:11.740
who does VO for a lot of movies,
and he's kind of a famous star.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.470
And then we would have
a similar approach

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.820
for a lot of our trailers
and a lot of our content.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.560
If you have that,
you definitely have

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.330
to think from a
marketing perspective

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:24.660
how you could leverage the power
of famous voices, famous actors

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.700
on a region-by-region
basis, whether it

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.190
could make a significant
impact and how

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:34.690
you could make that a part
of your marketing strategy.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.760
And we found out that
it's really worth

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.090
that, because endorsements
of celebrities, as you know

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.045
from a lot of recent
launches by other companies,

00:32:43.045 --> 00:32:47.361
are very powerful, so you
definitely have to do that,

00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:47.861
yeah.

00:32:50.541 --> 00:32:52.540
EYAL RABINOVICH: We have
a game in the pipeline.

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.330
Not out yet, but hopefully
you hear about it.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.210
And it's very voice-intensive.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.410
You have a lot of text
and a lot of voice.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.420
And it creates some kind
of a unique experience.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.160
But I think that we
are then definitely

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.500
going to have to go for
the full localization.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.530
Even some modification in the
storyline might have to happen.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.380
So, like everything,
I think it kind of

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.530
depends on the
content in a game.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:23.604
And you have to consider
everything case by case.

00:33:23.604 --> 00:33:24.145
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:24.145 --> 00:33:25.558
Thank you.

00:33:25.558 --> 00:33:26.204
Can I just--

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:27.120
EYAL RABINOVICH: Jeez.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.310
OK.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.150
It would be probably
for Antonin,

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.070
because we are producing
a shooter as well.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.530
And so basically,
the question, OK,

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:37.300
is should we just translate?

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.410
We're a team of 21 people.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.470
So we don't have the resources.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:46.430
So does it make sense to
just translate the text

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.710
and leave the rest in
English, the voiceover?

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:51.750
ANTONIN LHUILLIER: Yeah,
I think it makes sense.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.220
I think it makes sense.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.250
There are some
games from Gameloft

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.490
where you have
very sophisticated

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:01.060
English voiceovers with
the voices from the actors,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.130
of all the ponies from the
ponies in "My Little Pony,"

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.860
for instance, and
we don't localize.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.780
There are subtitles.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.810
So I think for a shooter,
the main pleasure

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.065
that players will take from the
shooter is to actually shoot

00:34:17.065 --> 00:34:18.770
in the action scene.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:23.739
So if you make some good
sound effects, it's fine.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:27.448
Then they don't need
to be localized.

00:34:27.448 --> 00:34:28.763
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:28.763 --> 00:34:30.304
BOB MEESE: Can you
pass the mic over?

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.570
AUDIENCE: So China, done.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:36.881
Korea, done.

00:34:36.881 --> 00:34:38.130
Where are we going next, then?

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.210
Where's the next
market to go into?

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.280
Forget all this
localization stuff.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.670
Where should I be
checking my game next?

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.620
Go on, let's have
a comment from you.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.229
Chuck it.

00:34:51.229 --> 00:34:52.434
SAAD CHOUDRI: Chuck it.

00:34:52.434 --> 00:34:53.358
All right.

00:34:53.358 --> 00:34:56.500
That's the question I was going
to ask of the panel anyway.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.270
What's next?

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.960
For us we see a
lot in Indonesia.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.418
People have talked
about Indonesia.

00:35:01.418 --> 00:35:03.550
We see a lot in Turkey.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.170
Brazil is quite
well-known as well.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.090
The Middle East.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:15.030
I think Saudi Arabia,
UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain,

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.910
those countries,
traditionally a lot of you

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.360
probably will have very
high-spending users there.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.560
But we've never really
culturalized in those regions.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.440
We've never really created games
that cater to that audience

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.731
and really support
those audiences.

00:35:29.731 --> 00:35:31.980
One of the things, people
talk about seasonal updates,

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.612
like Valentine's Day not
meaning anything in Korea.

00:35:34.612 --> 00:35:36.070
One of the things
that we did is we

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.254
supported Pakistan
Independence Day.

00:35:38.254 --> 00:35:40.670
And I'm not saying that because
my heritage is from there,

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:43.950
but we did that because we
have a big audience there.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.960
And it really engaged
the community.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.786
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:47.786 --> 00:35:48.660
SAAD CHOUDRI: No, no.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.210
Community support We
had people out there,

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.450
and not just the flag.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.471
We did other things.

00:35:53.471 --> 00:35:53.970
Did--

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:54.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.863
SAAD CHOUDRI: Well,
of course, you're

00:35:54.863 --> 00:35:56.440
going to do that as well, right?

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.119
But it's an easy win.

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:01.160
But that's what we have
to do in emerging markets

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.420
where you're not really going
to see a financial return.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.220
But you know that actually
it's going to be a burgeoning

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.850
community, and they stay there.

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.590
And they push the game for
you, and they help you,

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.620
and you get power
users from there.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.880
So everybody's probably going
to roll out a beta program soon.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.540
People in these communities
or in other locations

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.280
provide very valuable feedback.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.920
And there's a great
talent pool to see.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.720
So I think Middle
East, Africa-- we're

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.560
seeing quite a bit in Nigeria--
and then Vietnam, as well,

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.247
is coming up for us as well.

00:36:30.247 --> 00:36:32.080
JOE RAEBURN: So just
one really quick thing.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.380
If you want to avoid
pain, avoid flags.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.959
Flags are a symbol of
political division.

00:36:37.959 --> 00:36:39.000
We put flags in our game.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.640
We put a few of them.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.680
We didn't put every
single country in there.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.721
People get really angry
when their country is not

00:36:43.721 --> 00:36:44.330
represented.

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.940
When we put Hong Kong in
there, we had quite a few

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.790
high-spending ethnically
Chinese-living-in-America

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.030
gamers coming
together to say, look,

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.890
these are the alliances
that we represent.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.980
And we're all going to quit
the game until and unless you

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.650
remove the Hong Kong flag.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.340
There's just grief all the time.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.500
So unless you want to
maintain every single flag

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.380
for every single nation and
have selective hiding of flags--

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.005
like you should
probably hide the Tibet

00:37:08.005 --> 00:37:11.924
one for Chinese audiences
as well-- just avoid

00:37:11.924 --> 00:37:12.590
a world of pain.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:13.726
You think they're
such a nice thing that

00:37:13.726 --> 00:37:14.809
will make everybody happy.

00:37:14.809 --> 00:37:15.430
They won't.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.660
Indonesia as well is
becoming quite hard-core.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.330
We have quite a few
Indonesian alliances

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:21.200
in our game, one
of the top three.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.910
Once we offered a special deal
to quite a few of our players,

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.430
and the Indonesian
alliance didn't get it

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.763
because they didn't quite
have the spend level required.

00:37:27.763 --> 00:37:30.310
They called the Indonesian
chef that lives at London.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.635
He dropped by our
office, knocked,

00:37:32.635 --> 00:37:34.760
and he said he wouldn't
leave until we offered them

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.420
a special deal.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.897
So they're pretty hard-core.

00:37:36.897 --> 00:37:38.480
They're really great
gamers, and we're

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.854
going to be localizing our
next game into Indonesia, too.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.880
EYAL RABINOVICH: Same question?

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.330
BOB MEESE: Or something else?

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:50.645
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:50.645 --> 00:37:52.497
EYAL RABINOVICH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:52.497 --> 00:37:55.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.090
BOB MEESE: Little
bit more time, too.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.811
We have about five
more minutes overall.

00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:01.727
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:12.974 --> 00:38:14.346
What can we do in India?

00:38:14.346 --> 00:38:15.970
ANTONIN LHUILLIER:
I was about actually

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:20.050
to say India about what's next,
because there's only one where

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:24.290
we probably see a higher
penetration of the PlayStore

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.800
in India.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.950
So then, of course,
I think it's about 5%

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:30.580
of the population
that speaks English.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.070
And then you have a lot
of different languages.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:37.290
So I guess we will
follow that closely.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:44.150
And we will see how this market
goes, and how you go there,

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.070
and what billing options
you add, and so on.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:51.292
So it's probably
the next territory.

00:38:51.292 --> 00:38:53.500
ANATOLY ROPOTOV: Yeah, I
think the next big challenge

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.100
is figure out how to monetize
players in those regions, where

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.030
they just couldn't pay with
cards and things like that.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.530
So definitely more
alternative payment methods,

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.750
rolling out prepaid cards with
general availability out there,

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.060
figuring out things
like price scaling.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.260
Not every country has
should have $19.99 option

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.750
to pay for your
game, because you

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.730
have to go into smaller
increments and steps out there

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.580
and figure out
how to incentivize

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.960
those players to use
new payment methods,

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.110
try them, using wire, SMS,
direct billing, and things

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:27.610
like that.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.570
So it's the next big
challenge for those countries,

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.790
for game developers to
really pay attention

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.500
to just figure out how
to actually get revenues

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.000
from there.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.910
Because nowadays, a
lot of those countries

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:41.680
could be only monetized
decently by ads,

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.040
because you couldn't
just collect money there.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.310
So as soon as more
payment options,

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.870
as soon as a culture of
payment would roll out,

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.322
we'll see a lot of things.

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:53.280
Actually, look, I've
tried a lot of experiments

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.071
in those countries.

00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:58.220
So sometimes we would say even
like 10,000 crystals for price

00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.630
point of $0.10.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.667
And we would just see
that people don't even

00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:03.250
react to that offer
because they don't

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:04.810
know the ways of payments.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.990
They just don't have cards
and things like that.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:12.370
It flags-- like we will have
to figure out how to get there

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:16.240
and how to fix those
problems along what

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.514
was from the platform side
and the developer side,

00:40:18.514 --> 00:40:20.930
or from price scaling, and
explaining those payment plans.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:22.160
BOB MEESE: You want to
finish this off here, Saad?

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.410
SAAD CHOUDRI: I'm going
to finish this off, yeah.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:25.960
Binary size, it's important.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.286
Data, Android One, supporting
those low-memory devices,

00:40:30.286 --> 00:40:32.160
that's going to be
crucial for these regions.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.140
I think the payment
processes will come.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.056
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:37.272 --> 00:40:38.230
SAAD CHOUDRI: There is.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.830
There is, actually.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:39.663
I was going to say--

00:40:39.663 --> 00:40:42.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.968
It's just not there at all.

00:40:43.968 --> 00:40:45.342
How are you going
to accept money

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:47.592
from those guys [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:47.592 --> 00:40:48.300
BOB MEESE: Right.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.570
So it's certainly coming.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.740
So we are increasingly
prioritizing

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.220
by strategic market.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.970
Obviously, credit card
has been available,

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.553
but we've added
direct-carrier billing

00:40:56.553 --> 00:41:00.640
in 26 countries, gift cards
in 22, PayPal now in 12.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.200
Other forms of payment are
being looked into as well.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.240
In India, it's very
much a cash economy.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.570
We can't quite directly
accept cash through the phone,

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.120
but we would if we could.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.030
But we're looking at
a variety of options.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.160
Because, yeah, to
the extent that you

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.570
have really compelling markets
that are just held back

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:18.050
by that one issue,
it's something

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.580
that's very actively
being explored.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.440
SAAD CHOUDRI: And are you guys
being aggressive on the revenue

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.040
shares with the carriers?

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.970
BOB MEESE: Can't talk
about those things.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:25.890
SAAD CHOUDRI: So we won't know.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:26.700
BOB MEESE: Yeah.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.370
Cool.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:28.780
But we should probably wrap.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.760
But just thank you, guys, for
all the great insights here.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.590
A lot of us are sticking
around, so either find us here,

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.040
find us in the back
with the drinks,

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.790
but just thank you all
for sticking around

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:41.490
through the day.
