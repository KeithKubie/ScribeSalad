00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.390
- OK.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.550
So now we're on
to life, sort of.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.470
You'll see that this
actually goes beyond what

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.000
you would think of as life.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.270
And then we'll go even farther
beyond that this afternoon.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.590
But instead of me now
chairing this festivity,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.590
you get my colleague,
Immaculata De Vivo,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.820
who will be the discussant
for this section with two

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.537
speakers, Wally Fulweiler
and Joel Dudley,

00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:31.120
who she'll tell you
about in a second.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.203
But let me just tell you
that I've had a fantastic

00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:34.470
time this year with Mack.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.840
The other co-director
of the science program

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.570
is Janet Rich Edwards,
who's here somewhere, who's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.250
a Radcliffe Fellow this year.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.570
So we have a special co-director
of the science program.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.760
My colleague and friend,
Immaculata De Vivo.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.340
And when she's not
doing her Radcliffe role

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.610
she's actually a professor of
medicine at the medical school

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.000
and a professor of epidemiology
at the Chan School.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.560
And she works on
molecular biology,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.490
genetics epidemiology,
biostatistics,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.680
and she's interested
in figuring out

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.350
how those things can be
predictive of people's cancer

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.086
risk.

00:01:08.086 --> 00:01:09.960
But the reason you may
have heard of her work

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.510
and seen her on TV is
she's one of those people

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.490
who talks about the
Mediterranean diet

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.350
all the time.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.560
So over lunch,
which is hopefully

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.530
compliant with the
Mediterranean diet--

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.390
I don't think we asked her.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.050
You can ask her about that.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.380
But right now I'd like
to turn it over to her,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.480
and Mack's going to tell you
what's going to happen next.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.610
- Thank you.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.806
Thank you, Alyssa.

00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:36.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.450
Thank you.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.540
It is my pleasure to serve
as the interim co-director

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.300
for the Life Sciences
here at Radcliffe.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.790
And life is broadly defined
as things which are alive.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.750
And having looked at both
speakers this morning

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.650
and last night, and I
said, well, gee, there

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.700
is alive stuff in
both of these talks,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.910
especially when Wally,
who as Alyssa showed,

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.500
will actually cross
both earth and life.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.169
But I don't want to
take up the time going

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.690
through the definition
of what life is.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.100
I want to introduce these
two fabulous speakers, Wally

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.860
Fulweiler and Joel Dudley.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.460
And as you know, the
bios are in your pamphlet

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.450
so I'm going to do a
very brief introduction.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.360
Wally is, for the most part,
an oceanographer from BU.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.010
She's a professor there.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.950
And her talk will focus on
why the ocean needs you.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.550
And Joel then follow
with his talk.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.200
He's a professor
at the Icahn school

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.180
at Mount Sinai in New York.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.640
He will tell us that in his
journey to this presentation

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.130
or to this paper
that he published,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.800
he was looking for drugs but
found stupid viruses, quote,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.500
unquote, from The
New York Times.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.250
So it gives me great
pleasure to introduce Wally,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.290
and then Joel will
follow, and we will have

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.546
some questions at the very end.

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:14.607
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:14.607 --> 00:03:16.440
- Well, first I want
to thank the organizers

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.500
of this amazing event for the
invitation to speak here today.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.490
For Stuart, for really getting
us off to a fantastic start

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.410
and for that beautiful poem.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.520
And for you all, for
the next few minutes,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.780
I'm going to torture you with
my deep love of the ocean,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.240
and I hope that I inspire
you along the way.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.145
So it turns out that I've
been at Boston University an

00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:41.970
a PI of my own lab for 10 years.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.790
I know, you can
hardly believe that.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.310
I can hardly believe it myself.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.320
In preparing for
this talk, I began

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.370
to think hard about these last
10 years, where we're going,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.490
and where we should be, and what
are the major questions that we

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.230
should be addressing.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.910
My lab addresses how coastal
systems are impacted by humans.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.790
To do that, we use ecology
and biogeochemistry.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.750
A terrible word, I know,
but it links and tries

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.540
to understand how
biology changes and feeds

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.750
on the chemistry and
geology of the environment.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.579
Our goal is to understand
how humans have

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.079
changed these coastal systems.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.550
So we work across the
land-ocean continuum,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.470
from forests and rivers to salt
marshes to your favorite bays

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.780
and estuaries to the
continental shelf and now

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.550
into the deep sea.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.320
If you look at this
slide here, this

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.870
is one of the most I
think beautiful slides

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.350
of the earth at night.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.850
And you can see
where all the lights

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.570
are tends to be
near coastal areas

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.820
because 40% of the
human population

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.400
lives within 100
kilometers of the coast.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.020
16 out of the 23 mega cities
in the globe are coastal,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.650
so we need people to get
energized and excited and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.050
interested in protecting
these coastal environments

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.210
because our humanity
depends upon them.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.500
Over the next few
minutes, I'm going

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.950
to walk you through some
different vignettes and ideas

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.430
and little bits of I
hope some sort of wisdom

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.680
to inspire the next generation.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.720
And to talk to you
about how I see science

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.030
happening in the ocean worlds.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.940
But know that I think
these lessons equally apply

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.640
to whatever science you do.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.230
So first, behind me you'll
see a submersible named Alvin.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.450
If you don't know the
submersible go Google it.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.370
Not right now but later.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.850
It is a wonderful vessel that
allows scientists to go down

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.160
to the bottom of the
sea, thousands of meters

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.190
below the surface, to
get a first view of what

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.150
is down there.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.130
And it is not just
mud, although you'll

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.760
see I'm a deep lover of mud so
it's awesome if it would be.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.450
But there is also wonderful
findings that we will see.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.880
You may have heard
before that we've only

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.790
explored 5% of the ocean.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.020
That's insane.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.710
15% of the ocean floor has
been mapped by modern methods,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.860
so the majority of our
ocean is an unknown world

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.240
and we need to get on with that.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.510
We need to solve that and
figure out what's down there.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.690
In terms of discoveries,
they're happening left and right

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.340
and they are major
discoveries in the ocean.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.790
So for example, just
a few months ago,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.280
brand new deep coral
reefs were found off

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.900
the coast of South Carolina.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.940
Reefs we didn't know about.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.750
There are new fish.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.340
This is a hoodwinker sunfish.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.600
It's huge.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.730
It's a brand new species
that was discovered

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.940
just a few years ago.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.930
How did we miss that?

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.000
Some of the genetic
techniques that we're using

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.360
allow us to pull apart
species that would be harder.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.570
For example, genus dogfish
looks a lot like other small dog

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.430
fish, but it turns
out genetically

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.490
it's vastly different
and a brand new species.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.650
These kinds of discoveries
are the discoveries

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.000
that get people's attention.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.110
They're sexy, they're
charismatic megafauna.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.690
Well, maybe not
this deep sea fish

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.620
that looks like chewed bubble
gum, but the idea is there.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.730
It's a deep sea fish.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.780
It's exciting.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.930
But these are not the only
parts of science that matter.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.100
Additionally, as
we move forward,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.600
the technologies that
we have are growing,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.300
and these technologies
are allowing

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.690
us to see and discover things
that we have not found before.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.390
And the pace of this
discovery is only increasing.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.740
This is a brand new
sequencer called a minion.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.380
If you want to send me a
couple that'd be great.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.560
And this allows you to
sequence genomes in situ.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.050
You can take your sample on
board your research vessel

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.190
and sequence it there.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.410
You could do that in the
salt marsh from your car

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.960
if you wanted to and
had a big enough car.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.830
So it works.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.150
These are Argo floats.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.330
These are floats that are-- all
of them, almost 4,000 of them,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.090
a global effort to
understand the surface

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.350
currents of the ocean.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.290
Each of these floats is
beaming back information

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.120
about how fast
currents are flowing,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.490
their salinity, the
temperature of the ocean.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.770
Many of you likely
have a smartwatch.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.860
It's telling you your heartbeat
and your sleeping rhythms.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.540
Well, let's do
this for the ocean.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.810
We're there, we can do this,
and the rhythms in the ocean

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.500
are profound.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.830
They don't have a heartbeat,
but we have tidal,

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.750
we have ebb and
flow of the tide.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.390
We have huge animal
vertical migrations

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.140
moving from the depths during
the day, upwards at night

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.070
to feed.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.170
We don't know a lot
about this, and we

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.620
need to understand the amount
of organic matter and organisms

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.070
that are doing this and the
impact that has on our ocean.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.810
Here I'm showing
you what I think

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.540
is a pretty neat diagram that my
PhD student, Emily Chao, made.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.289
And you can see here
that it's showing you

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.419
how we can make a smart ocean.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.429
We can outfit human divers.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.940
We can have different
systems on pump profilers.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.909
We can have submersibles
like the Alvin I showed you,

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.380
different cable observatory.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.930
These things are happening,
they're coming online,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.090
and we need good minds to
be working on these data.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.960
So whether you're interested in
the science or the engineering

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.710
or the computational side
of it, the ocean needs you.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.750
One of my favorite stories
that I'll just quickly

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.720
touch on here is this
piece of instrumentation

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.960
here is a flow cytometer.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.210
Traditionally it was
used in the medical field

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.610
until Penny Chisholm
and her group at MIT

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.060
used it to measure phytoplankton
cells in the ocean.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.280
They went to areas of
the ocean that they

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.300
thought didn't have a
lot of productivity.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.390
And this was about
30 years ago or so.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.600
They applied flow cytometry
in a brand new way

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.220
and they started to measure all
these different phytoplankton.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.116
And then there was this pesky
noise that kept popping up

00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:31.740
and they ignored it
and they ignored it

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.781
because that noise signal
that was coming through

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:35.490
was way too tiny to be anything.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.280
Until they slowly realized
that noise signal seemed

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.100
to be changing with things
like salinity and temperature

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.270
and perhaps it
wasn't noise at all.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.490
And in fact, it wasn't.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.620
It was this beautiful, little,
tiny green photosynthetic cell.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.550
The tiniest photosynthetic
cell we know

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.940
of named prochlorococcus
for little greenberry.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.000
And Penny Chisholm and her group
transformed our understanding

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.910
of how the ocean works by taking
new technology and applying it.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.900
And in fact, this is
the harbinger of--

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.360
came from, I should
say, the cyanobacteria

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.970
that gave us the oxygen
that we enjoy breathing.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.900
And so this tiny, tiny cell,
using a brand new method they

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.040
found it and changed how
we understand the ocean.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.940
Lest you believe that you must
have giant discoveries to make

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.670
a contribution to science I want
to make a very important point,

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.180
and that is that all
discoveries count.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.550
Small discoveries are important.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.730
It is the small discoveries
that allow us to add drop

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.850
by drop by drop until we
fill this pool of knowledge

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.830
and ignorance, as
Stuart would say,

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.590
that allow us to increase our
understanding of the ocean

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.730
environment.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.790
It is not every day that
you discover a new species

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.660
or find out about a brand new
tiny photosynthetic cell we

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.540
didn't know about or get to
dive to the bottom of the ocean

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.160
and find deep sea coral reefs.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.200
Those are wonderful,
magical moments

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.290
that get lots of attention
on TV and social media,

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.730
but they are not the everyday
work and discipline of science.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.550
So it's important to know
that all discoveries count.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.720
I want to tell you a brief story
about when I was a PhD student

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.600
and how I learned and
continue to remind myself

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.060
how important it is to be
skeptical and challenging

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.740
of the work that you
do and others do,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.190
but also to have faith
in the work that you do.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.020
That if you're a
good scientist, you

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.090
need to have faith in the work.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.090
So one of the things
that I am deeply in love

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.044
with when it comes to
the ocean are sediments.

00:11:33.044 --> 00:11:35.210
There really aren't that
many good pictures of them,

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.780
so I've made you this
beautiful slide to show you.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.480
Here's our water
column and sediment.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.230
It's oxygenated up
here, and then it's not.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.620
There's no more oxygen when
you get to certain depths

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.760
in the sediment.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.680
One of the things
that the sediments do

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.560
is they process organic
matter and carbon.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.090
They recycle nutrients for us.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.060
Sometimes they produce
greenhouse gases,

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.310
sometimes they
consume them, and they

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.350
have one in particular
thing that I'm

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.090
interested in is
they have an ability

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.930
to remove nitrogen. Now
nitrogen is fundamental to life.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.970
Without it there would
be no you, no me,

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.950
no cod, no blue whales.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.390
But like anything, too much
nitrogen leads to problems.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.480
Excess phytoplankton blooms,
harmful algal blooms,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.110
low oxygen conditions.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.330
And where there are humans--

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.520
and maybe you remember from
my earlier slide there's

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.080
lots of humans in the coast--

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.420
then there's more nitrogen,
and that nitrogen then

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.620
can degrade ecosystems.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.010
But there's a natural filtering
process called denitrification

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.490
that microbes do.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.810
And in coastal ecosystems
and in marine systems,

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.300
most of those microbes
live in the sediments.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.960
And what they do is they take
a biologically usable form

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.930
of nitrogen, say nitrate
up here, and convert it

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.200
to gas, which then can go
up into the water column

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.700
and into the atmosphere.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.250
Our atmosphere is
about 70% N2 gas.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.050
It's an inert form.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.180
So the key to
remember is that I was

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.620
really interested
in this process

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.500
because I wanted to see
how the natural filtering

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.060
process and sediments
was removing nitrogen.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.090
And what I expected
to see was that I

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.660
would measure N2 gas being
pumped out of the sediments.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.450
Think of the sediments
as exhaling this N2 gas

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.244
and I was going to measure this.

00:13:14.244 --> 00:13:15.660
And I did it in
the coastal system

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.589
in Rhode Island known
as Narragansett Bay.

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:20.880
And I did it there because
the system had been changing

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.250
due to changing climate,
and there were some idea

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.220
that maybe the nitrogen
removal capacity of this system

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.890
was changing and I
wanted to quantify that.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.540
I had this wonderful
historic data

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.090
set to build on because
the first measurements

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.920
of denitrification in a
marine system were done here.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.070
So I could say,
OK, well, this is

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.040
what the denitrification or
the end filtering process

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.200
looks like in 1979.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.970
Lots of N removal.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.880
Oh, 1986, we still
have lots of N removal.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.431
And then I came along in 2005
and we still had N removal.

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:51.930
Great.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.679
It was a little less
but it was happening.

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:55.840
This is good.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.990
At this point, I was doing
all of my work measuring

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.749
the actual fluxes in a
well-known lab and [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:04.540
marine biological lab
and Anne Giblin's lab

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.190
with Jane Tucker training me.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.080
And so I feel confident
in this because I

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.050
was working with the best.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.810
And then I helped my
advisor get funding

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.260
for this instrument, the
Cadillac of mass specs in case

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.706
you want to know.

00:14:18.706 --> 00:14:20.080
If you're interested
in measuring

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.950
dissolved gases in sea water
this is the model you want.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.390
Happy to talk to you about it.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.469
So we wrote a
grants and we got--

00:14:27.469 --> 00:14:29.260
he wrote the grant and
I wrote part of it--

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.930
this part and we
got this mass spec.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.010
And boy, was I excited.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.830
We set up the mass spec, I
go get my sediment cores.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.347
I'm getting out there to
measure the next year.

00:14:38.347 --> 00:14:40.180
And I'm like, oh, I'm
going to measure this.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.920
N removal, all this
N gas coming out,

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.030
and yes, it's going
to happen, and bam.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.470
This is what I found.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.120
The exact opposite.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.290
Not what I expected.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.970
I thought maybe it
would be the same.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:52.470
No.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.040
Brought it to my
graduate advisor.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.970
He said, did you
wire it backwards?

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.980
Did you run the
samples backwards?

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.050
And we methodically went
through all the things.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.060
And I won't tell
you those details,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.500
but just to know that we
didn't wire it backwards.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.420
I didn't run the
samples backwards.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.440
And now what we have seen
is that this system actually

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.050
flips back and forth between
removing and turning it

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.330
into a gas and actually
making nitrogen.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.730
The bacteria is sucking
nitrogen in from the water

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.890
and turning into a biologically
usable form, which has

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.690
higher trophic level impacts.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.720
So this I learned--

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.190
one other thing
I want to note is

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.270
that when I started to
go around to conferences

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.630
and give this talk, many
people came up to me and said,

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.400
I had these results and I sat
on them because it didn't fit--

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.160
and I'm going to use air quotes
and I apologize-- the working

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.690
paradigm.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.240
I want to ban working
paradigm from science

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.570
because I think it's
squelches ideas and progress.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.690
And so now it turns out that
many ecosystems have seen this

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.410
because we begin to slowly
pull this away and realize

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.870
that just because it goes
against the working paradigm

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.950
doesn't mean it's wrong.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.960
I want to mention
how important it is.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.420
This is the library for the
students in here who don't go.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:10.110
It's now a criterion
to graduate from my lab

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.420
you must go to the library
and send me a picture

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.869
of you reading a book in there.

00:16:14.869 --> 00:16:16.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.260
I deeply worry that we're going
to be losing information that's

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.070
not digitized because people
don't go to the library,

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.250
but you should go.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.930
It is wonderful.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.140
And you should take time
to read and to write,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.680
which really means rewrite over
and over again because there

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.940
is a vast knowledge.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.060
And unless you prepare your
brain for that discovery that

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.280
might happen you may miss it.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.140
The prepared brain
is the one that

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.940
will be open for
those opportunities,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.890
and there's only
one way to do that.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.950
And that is to sit in a
chair and do the work.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.060
The drudgery a little bit.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.910
The less sexy part of science.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.670
It's also deeply fulfilling.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.470
I want to mention that
persistence is key.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.800
It is vitally important
to know that when

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.920
you fail you must
keep going, and that

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.140
all of those small discoveries
they build to bigger things

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.839
because you are persistent.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.180
So be like the
waves on the shore.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.980
They constantly come.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.950
Sometimes you will work
in a fury of a hurricane

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.760
and that is a wonderful feeling.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:22.349
And sometimes you will
work slowly, ponderously,

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:23.440
and that is fine.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.880
The other big waves will
come, so just be persistent.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.150
We speak often of eureka
moments in science,

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.660
and I must tell you I know
of only one in ocean science.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.990
And I have had the fortune of
actually making sure in person

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.720
that it was real.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.830
I got to talk to Dr. Colleen
Cavanaugh about this.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.200
The eureka moment
story goes like this.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.090
These are riftia.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.090
They are giant tube worms,
sometimes 6 feet tall,

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.060
found at the bottom of the
ocean at hydrothermal vents.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.270
They have no mouth,
no gut, no anus.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.380
When they were discovered nobody
understood how they worked.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.390
There was lots of work
kind of pulling them

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.830
apart and looking inside of them
and trying to figure this out.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.510
Dr. Cavanaugh was a first year
graduate student at Harvard.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.840
She sat through numerous
seminars on this.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.340
And sitting in one
of those seminars

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.730
that I understand was quite
laboris and long and somewhat

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.310
boring, she realized
during that seminar

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.590
that the way these
animals work, since they

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.820
have no insights to do so, must
be a symbiotic relationship

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.067
with bacteria.

00:18:27.067 --> 00:18:29.150
The story goes that she
actually shouted this out.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.858
I know what this.

00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:31.820
It's symbiotes, symbiotes.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.930
It's sulfide oxidation.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.730
These bacteria can do this.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.752
This is one of the
few eureka moments.

00:18:36.752 --> 00:18:38.960
But if you think about it
and you talk with her about

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.126
it-- and I hope that you do.

00:18:40.126 --> 00:18:41.870
She'll tell the story
better than I do.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.510
You'll learn that she had
done a lot of previous work.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.442
She was broadly
trained in ecology.

00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:48.400
She had been working on
microscopic techniques.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.500
She had been thinking about
bacteria and symbiosis,

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.170
so the stage was set for
her to make this discovery.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.780
And that goes back a
little bit to this idea

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.790
that sitting in the chair
and reading or doing

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.310
the work in the lab, they
all build on each other.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.380
Persistence is key.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.640
I want to speak to about
what motivates you.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.205
You need to find it and pursue
it with love and passion

00:19:12.205 --> 00:19:12.705
and energy.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.700
These motivate me.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.630
It takes all kinds.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:24.630
So these are small plastic
bottles full of ocean water.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.570
These particular set is
from Narragansett Bay.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.190
It's where I grew up.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.200
I grew up on this bay
and I thought I knew it.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.340
I thought I knew all of it.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.200
I can tell you when
the southerly comes in

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.130
at lunchtime.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.641
I can tell you where to swim.

00:19:36.641 --> 00:19:38.640
I can tell you the ebb
and the flow of the tide.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.556
I can tell you how to
skirt along Dutch Island

00:19:40.556 --> 00:19:41.490
and not hit the rocks.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.170
I can tell you the
creepy spot if you

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.628
want to go swimming
that I'm pretty

00:19:44.628 --> 00:19:48.480
sure there's a big scary animal
down there in this one area.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.320
I went to graduate school
thinking I knew this bay.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.520
And then I started sampling,
and we collected these bottles

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.510
to study the nutrients.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.520
So things like nitrogen,
phosphorus, silica.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.410
The fertilizer
for phytoplankton,

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.730
for the grass of the sea.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.760
The elements that don't get much
love and yet without them we

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.530
would cease to function.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.410
We collected these samples, we
brought them back to the lab,

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.900
and all of a sudden
these data came out.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.170
Concentrations of nitrogen,
concentrations of silica,

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.270
and with these data
I could tell a story

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.600
and see a snapshot of the bay
that no one had seen before.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.180
I could tell you about
life and death of animals.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.090
I could tell you how a warming
climate was changing the bay.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.600
It is these plastic bottles,
this little, tiny plastic

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.302
bottle, that transformed
and changed my life.

00:20:33.302 --> 00:20:35.010
And at 3:00 in the
morning when I wake up

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.884
to think about what's
happening in the ocean,

00:20:36.884 --> 00:20:40.110
I often think about the data
or the data that are coming out

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.130
of these bottles.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.530
It's super nerdy,
I know, but embrace

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.548
that nerd because we need you.

00:20:45.548 --> 00:20:47.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.960
Finally I want to
say two more things.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.610
I want to say that
you can't do it alone

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.070
and you shouldn't do it alone.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.540
And if you get to
a position where

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.310
you have found the
thing that inspires you

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.810
and you get to work with that
for the rest of your life,

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.620
then build a team around
you, the team that you want,

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.180
and bring others with you.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.910
Here I am showing you some
of my graduate students.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.060
I want you to note that
they-- and postdocs--

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.410
I want you to know
that they are smiling.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.032
They are covered in mud.

00:21:15.032 --> 00:21:16.490
They are working
in gross chambers.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.070
This is hours of
filtering, hours.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.910
And that's just the filtering.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.960
That's not the lab analysis
or the data analysis.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.040
They are covered in mud.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.140
They are working on almost
intractable problems.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.514
Not because they
will solve them.

00:21:29.514 --> 00:21:31.850
Here's Emily working
on underwater spec

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.820
so we can measure the breathing
of the ocean sea floor.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.650
These are happy
students, because they

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.700
have found what motivates them.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.510
So find that, get others
to come along with you.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.410
Finally, I want to have a shout
out to people that support us.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.820
And importantly, I want to
tell you one brief thing.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.842
Growing up I have
two older brothers

00:21:54.842 --> 00:21:56.300
and I have super
supportive family.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.200
I'm very fortunate for that.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.200
And one thing my mother
would always say to us

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.890
is, you could study this
tidal pool your whole life

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.730
and never know
everything about it.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.890
And it kind of
became a family joke

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.220
where we would say, hey,
mom, so that puddle?

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.560
Can I study that my whole life?

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.150
Well, it turns out that
she's absolutely right.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.840
That this tidal pool represents
this amazing ecosystem.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.820
There are animals here
dealing with giant waves,

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.190
managing to live through waves
hitting them, desiccation

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:27.680
from the noonday sun.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.370
There are neat bacteria
in here, different crabs,

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.910
seaweed, mackerel--

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:33.500
so many things.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.800
My point is to tell you, you
need to find your tidal pool.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.750
Go after it because we need you.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:40.730
The ocean needs you.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.618
Thank you.

00:22:41.618 --> 00:22:43.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.104
- Fabulous.

00:22:45.104 --> 00:22:46.598
That's great.

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:51.090
Just one second, [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:51.972
Thank you.

00:22:51.972 --> 00:22:52.680
Thank you, Wally.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.740
That was great.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.980
And I think this was the
second time that a mom was

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.450
invoked to being right.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.538
Let's hear it for
the moms out there.

00:22:59.538 --> 00:23:00.038
Yeah.

00:23:00.038 --> 00:23:02.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.374
That was great.

00:23:04.374 --> 00:23:05.790
Lots of questions,
but we're going

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.970
to have Joel tell us
about those pesky viruses,

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:13.180
and then we're going to
open it up to questions.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.449
- All right.

00:23:15.449 --> 00:23:16.990
All right, thanks
for having me here.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.180
It's great to be
here from New York.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.096
I was getting a little
nervous before my talk,

00:23:20.096 --> 00:23:21.990
but I heard during
Wally's talk someone

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.470
honking and
screaming at somebody

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.570
and it made me feel at home.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.340
So I feel much calmer
now, so it's good.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.670
So I'm going to talk to you
about unmasking thieves.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.770
Thieves of our health
hiding in the shadows

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.170
of biological understanding.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.980
Two simple questions really
motivate a lot of my research.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.970
What is health?

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.420
What is disease?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.200
I'm going to argue we have
very, very satisfactory answers

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.460
to both of these questions.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.960
But first, before
I get into talking

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.310
to you about the
research that I do,

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.768
I need to sort of orient you
on how I think about the world

00:23:54.768 --> 00:23:56.599
and how I approach
biological research.

00:23:56.599 --> 00:23:58.640
And that's first by
appreciating there are rarely

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.960
smoking guns in human health.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.800
What do I mean by that?

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.630
There's rarely the magic
gene, the magic protein,

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.046
the magic drug
target that's going

00:24:04.046 --> 00:24:05.840
to be the solution
to your problem

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.110
if you're studying disease.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.050
What we're dealing with for the
most part is smoking gunships,

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.070
and I'll give you a
great example of that.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.460
I have Crohn's disease,
inflammatory bowel disease.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.080
Genetic association
studies have found

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.990
over 200 genomic loci
associated with Crohn's disease.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.540
You could loosely think of that
as 200 genes being associated

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.130
with inflammatory bowel disease.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.720
By the way, those
200 genes don't yet

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.957
explain 50% of the genetics
of that disease at this point,

00:24:26.957 --> 00:24:28.790
so who knows, when
things all said and done,

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.980
we'll have 400 or 500, 600
genes for that disease.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.040
And where's the drug
target in all of that?

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.400
And it really
shouldn't be surprising

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.690
that things are so complex when
it comes to disease biology

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.630
because humans are layers
of complex networks

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.672
all the way down.

00:24:45.672 --> 00:24:47.630
Let's just think of a
single cell for a second.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.380
A single cell in the body has
three billion base pairs of DNA

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.500
that are wrapped in this
sort of spool and thread

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.720
around these chromatin states.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.719
Three billion base pairs
of DNA express some RNAs.

00:24:59.719 --> 00:25:01.760
And you might have learned
in high school biology

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.130
DNA and RNA are protein, but
that's like the Rutherford

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.600
model of the atom, actually.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.480
It's actually DNA to
probably tens of hundreds

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.890
of different types of RNAs.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.352
ERNAs, [INAUDIBLE] link RNAs,
the list goes on and on.

00:25:12.352 --> 00:25:14.310
We're still discovering
different types of RNA.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.764
Those RNAs go back and bind
to the DNA, regulate DNA.

00:25:17.764 --> 00:25:19.430
Then some of those
RNAs create proteins.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.875
Proteins form complexes.

00:25:20.875 --> 00:25:23.000
They go back and bind to
the DNA, regulate the DNA.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.249
So just inside one cell we
have these different layers

00:25:25.249 --> 00:25:28.010
of networks interacting
with themselves

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.640
and across these
different layers.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.826
For example, protein to DNA.

00:25:30.826 --> 00:25:32.450
We haven't even left
a single cell yet.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.880
We have a whole constellation
of interactions in a cell.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.330
Cells form tissues.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.030
There's cell to
cell communication.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.990
Tissues from organs.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.410
There's organ-organ
communication.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:41.990
And if everything
we had in that box

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.115
was all we had to worry
about life would be simple,

00:25:44.115 --> 00:25:47.300
but the environment
interacts with this system.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.550
So humans are complex
adaptive systems,

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.410
which is sort of a well
understood type of system,

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.560
at least in how we think
about it in, say, physics

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.730
or mathematics.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.010
Complex adaptive systems
have key characteristics

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.154
as they evolve over time.

00:25:59.154 --> 00:26:01.070
There's interactions
like I just talked about.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.960
The whole's greater than
the sum of the parts,

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.770
and here's the key thing.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.290
You can't understand the
system by looking at its parts.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.748
But what do we continually try
to do in biological research

00:26:08.748 --> 00:26:09.410
team today?

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.743
Is try to understand the
system by looking at its parts,

00:26:11.743 --> 00:26:14.687
but we know we can really
do this in a complex system.

00:26:14.687 --> 00:26:15.770
Who said this, by the way?

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.350
This is an investment banker
in Harvard Business Review.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.520
So for as much grief
as we give the bankers

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.061
they have a pretty
good understanding

00:26:22.061 --> 00:26:23.685
of complex adaptive systems.

00:26:23.685 --> 00:26:25.310
So being a patient
myself has helped me

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.230
think of new questions
about disease.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.120
This is a recent trip
to Greenwich Hospital.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.919
Now, I did not put this picture
up here to get sympathy.

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:33.710
Don't feel bad for me
because I'm so loaded

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.960
with morphine in this picture.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.120
I feel 100 times better
there than I do on this stage

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.324
right now, so this is not
to get sympathy, trust me.

00:26:41.324 --> 00:26:43.740
You just can't tell on my face
because I'm somewhere else.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.460
So one thing that happens when
you get inflammatory bowel

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.410
disease is there are
cutaneous-- which

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.300
is an autoimmune
disease of the colon.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.570
You get cutaneous manifestations
of disease, erythema nodosum,

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:54.872
and so a lot of skin rashes.

00:26:54.872 --> 00:26:56.330
So this happens to
me all the time.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.380
Whenever my disease
becomes active my skin--

00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.790
I get a rash on my chest.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.460
So I go to the GI
doctor and I say,

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.390
isn't this interesting that
my skin reacts when my bowel

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.460
disease is about to act up.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.451
And he said, oh,
we know about this.

00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:09.950
Of course.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.640
And I said, well, what
do you do about that?

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.700
He goes, well, we send
you to the dermatologist.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.910
And I said, well, there's
a connection there.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.362
So I go to the
dermatologist and I say,

00:27:19.362 --> 00:27:20.570
well, isn't this interesting.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.890
My skin is connected to my gut.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.348
It's kind of gross but your
gut is kind of your inside skin

00:27:24.348 --> 00:27:25.580
if you think about it.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.788
What do we think about the
biological connection here

00:27:27.788 --> 00:27:30.080
and what it means to
understand these diseases?

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.910
And the dermatologist
says, I specifically

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.610
became a dermatologist to never
ever think about the colon.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:39.020
Please take these steroids
and get out of my office.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.180
So being a patient
made me realize

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.040
I was stuck between
these two systems.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.664
So one of the
things we did early

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:48.080
on I did as a result of this
is I took all of the emerging

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.540
genomic data that was being
generated-- this was actually

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.450
when I was a graduate
student at Stanford--

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.821
and we asked the question,
does the molecular taxonomy

00:27:54.821 --> 00:27:56.570
of disease look anything
like the symptoms

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.910
and anatomy-based
taxonomy of a disease

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.980
that we still organize
our health systems are

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.020
and our research
institutes around today?

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.840
You find, when you look at
the genomic patterns in terms

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.707
of diseases and--

00:28:06.707 --> 00:28:08.540
I'm sorry, genetics
that are being disrupted

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.369
between diseases at
a genome wide scale,

00:28:10.369 --> 00:28:12.410
you find, for example,
that at a molecular level,

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.740
Alzheimer's disease looks very
similar to actinic keratosis,

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.000
which is a skin disease.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.620
Which seems kind of
bizarre until you remember

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.286
that the brain and
the skin are together

00:28:20.286 --> 00:28:22.880
at one point in a structure
called the neural ectoderm

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.020
in development.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.850
So using data to redefine
the landscape of disease,

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.400
we can actually
take this concept up

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.880
to the patient level.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.240
One of the first things
I did at Mount Sinai

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.790
was in getting access to a huge
amount of electronic health

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.780
record data, as well as some
records where we have DNA.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.200
I wanted to put into place this
idea of a learning health care

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.610
system, which is kind
of a buzzword today.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.584
So what frustrates
me still is when

00:28:46.584 --> 00:28:48.500
I go to a health system
they'll say, OK, Joel,

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.930
you're a 40 to 45-year-old
Caucasian male, family

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.162
history of this,
complaining about this.

00:28:53.162 --> 00:28:54.620
Let's treat you
based on guidelines

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.385
we know about the situation.

00:28:57.385 --> 00:28:58.760
And as a data
person I see, well,

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.020
you see millions and millions
of people literally every year,

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.890
which patients look like me
and what happened to them.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.389
So when you go to Amazon all
the products that are served up

00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:08.030
to you are based on data of
people like you, for example.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.170
So what you're
looking at here is not

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.310
a network of diseases now.

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.600
You're looking at a
network of patients.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.120
And what I did is I took
all of the quantitative data

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.467
we had on every patient--

00:29:15.467 --> 00:29:17.300
electronic health
records, heights, weights,

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.820
metabolic panels,
CBCs, et cetera--

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.467
and I represented
patients by all

00:29:21.467 --> 00:29:23.300
the quantitative
information we had on them.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.850
Turns out to be 200 or so.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.600
But I ignored whatever
the diagnosis codes

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.766
are given by the physicians.

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.781
I considered those
to be subjective.

00:29:29.781 --> 00:29:31.280
And then I said,
which patient looks

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.690
like that patient looks
like that patient looks

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:33.439
like that patient?

00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:37.630
I mapped out this sort
of map of patients.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.340
I know from last night there
was an algebraic topologist

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.510
in the audience.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.380
I use algebraic topology
to map this out.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.370
So I don't get to
meet one all the time.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.860
But the idea here is this.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.960
So if I'm a new
patient at Mount Sinai,

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.476
is my little Waze or Google
Maps dot blinking here,

00:29:53.476 --> 00:29:55.100
is it blinking here,
and does it really

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.689
matter if I'm here or there?

00:29:58.689 --> 00:30:00.980
So what we showed in the
paper, which I don't have time

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.956
to go into too many
details, is you definitely

00:30:02.956 --> 00:30:03.830
want to be over here.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:05.040
You don't want to be over here.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.500
I call this
cardiometabolic island.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.230
It's about the nicest name
I could come up with for it.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.150
But the color here is important.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.460
And then after the
patients were organized

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.940
by the quantitative
data we said,

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.232
where are the patients
with type 2 diabetes

00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:18.440
because we have lots of them.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.360
And here in the United
States we are statistically

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.950
powered to look at them,
and these red zones

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.050
are sort of hotspots of
type 2 diabetic patients.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.697
They're not all in one spot.

00:30:25.697 --> 00:30:28.280
Now type 2 diabetes is obviously
this disease we sort of think

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.597
as a single disease.

00:30:29.597 --> 00:30:32.180
It turns out if you just focus
on the type 2 diabetes patients

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.450
alone you get these three
very distinct clusters

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.980
of type 2 diabetes patients.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.580
And the provocative idea here
is that we have type 2, type 3,

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.770
and type 4 diabetes sitting
under our nose the whole time

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.311
but we didn't know it because
we never looked at our patients

00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:46.370
in this data driven way.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.070
So you can cluster data all
day long and get cool figures

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.100
but who cares if it doesn't
mean anything clinically.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.551
So we had many years of
electronic health record data

00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:55.300
on these patients.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.630
And briefly, I can
tell you we showed

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.150
that patients in this group--
type 2 diabetes patients--

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.320
had increased risk of
heart attack and stroke.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.960
So if you're a diabetic
you have increased risk

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.130
of heart attack and stroke.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.629
If you're in this
group you had risk

00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:07.456
above and beyond other
type 2 diabetics.

00:31:07.456 --> 00:31:09.830
If you're in this group you
had increased risk of cancer.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.420
All diabetics have
increased risk of cancer.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.919
If you're in this
group you had risk

00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:15.724
above and beyond the
other type 2 diabetics.

00:31:15.724 --> 00:31:17.390
We also have genetics
on these patients.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:19.550
The genetics was not used
to inform the clustering,

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:23.540
and why this paper was published
in a pretty decent journal was

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.810
we did genetic associations
on these subtypes.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.900
And remember, since the genetics
didn't inform the clustering,

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:30.766
it was independent.

00:31:30.766 --> 00:31:33.140
And we found genetic markers
that matched the differences

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.400
in disease risk that we found.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.450
So that's harder
to explain away.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.824
The fact that the
genetics, which

00:31:36.824 --> 00:31:38.720
was independent-- for
example, in this group,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.928
there are genetic markers
that were found in vascular

00:31:40.928 --> 00:31:43.100
endothelial signaling pathways.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.040
So again, suggesting that there
are these subtypes and even

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.010
markers which we could
start to bin patients into.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:51.260
So the thing I love about
data driven approaches is it

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.810
saves us from what's called
the street light effect.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.700
This kind of cartoon
is a cop is asking,

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.259
why are you looking for your
keys under the street light?

00:31:58.259 --> 00:32:00.800
And they're saying, that's where
the light is brightest here.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.530
So we didn't coordinate on
this, but I have Donald Rumsfeld

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.407
in my slide too.

00:32:08.407 --> 00:32:10.490
She goes, I think you said
it a little bit better.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.520
So if there are any
journalists here,

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.340
here's the headline I
want to see tomorrow.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.240
Scientists gather at
Radcliffe Institute

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.952
to celebrate scientific
legacy of Donald Rumsfeld.

00:32:19.952 --> 00:32:21.158
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:21.158 --> 00:32:22.480
Because it's coming up.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.584
So please, let's see that
in the paper tomorrow

00:32:25.584 --> 00:32:27.250
because clearly that's
what's happening.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.820
I think a more recent
example of where

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.404
we applied this
data driven approach

00:32:33.404 --> 00:32:35.570
and came to this very
unexpected and shocking result

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:39.430
was in Alzheimer's in which
Immaculata alluded to.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.147
I got one of my favorite quotes
ever in The New York Times.

00:32:42.147 --> 00:32:43.730
"I went looking for
drugs, and I found

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.230
were these stupid viruses."

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.840
So I'm going to go
through how we got

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.490
to this unexpected discovery.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.240
So if you're not aware,
Alzheimer's is actually

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.180
a very complex disease and
we don't know everything

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.420
about the
pathophysiology, etiology.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.130
But for the most
part, we're focused

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.630
on-- especially for
drug discovery--

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.460
the formation of
these amyloid plaques

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:09.100
and also these tau tangles that
can form inside the neurons.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.540
And for the most part,
drugs have focused

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.806
on clearing beta amyloid.

00:33:12.806 --> 00:33:14.180
You can actually
do amyloid scans

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.950
and you can sort of
see the aggregation

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.570
of this amyloid protein in
Alzheimer's disease patients.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.030
So again, the drugs, for
the most part, focused on,

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.140
can we get rid of this amyloid?

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.160
Since it's a characteristic
pathological finding

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.480
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.970
Turns out that hasn't
worked very well.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.629
There's effectively a 99.5%
failure rate or something

00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:33.920
like that of Alzheimer's drugs.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.503
I mean, we failed
over and over again.

00:33:35.503 --> 00:33:39.500
This is the number of compounds
that have failed since 2012

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.201
and the number of
trials that had failed.

00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:44.450
It would be great to say,
well, since 2012 things have

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.033
gotten better.

00:33:45.033 --> 00:33:46.745
It stayed exactly the same.

00:33:46.745 --> 00:33:48.870
And it's really gotten to
this point of desperation

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.560
now where you have
these articles.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.060
Are we wrong about the
theory of Alzheimer's, and is

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.250
the leading theory wrong?

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.470
In fact, our study,
when it was published,

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.340
there's a software tool
that our media folks

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.740
use that suggest 800
million people read

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.200
about our story in one way or
another through their media.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.260
Which means we're sort
of at the end of our rope

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.090
and we're hungry
for something new

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:12.449
in Alzheimer's because
we're kind of out of ideas.

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:15.120
So we leverage the resource
that the National Institutes

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.969
of Health had generated.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:19.130
It's actually a very
forward looking resource.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.420
It's called the Accelerating
Medicines Partnership

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.889
for Alzheimer's Disease.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:25.620
And really, what it is, is
the biggest multiomic study

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:29.500
on Alzheimer's patients ever
really conceived and executed

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.000
on.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.449
So you're taking
many, many layers

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:36.540
of complex data collected
from patients, obviously

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.750
post-mortem, with controls
and Alzheimer's disease.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.580
Genetics, genomics,
metabolomics--

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.139
every ohm you can
think of they're

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:44.940
measuring in this study.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.960
And even [INAUDIBLE] in
clinical data, et cetera.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.080
And we were actually invited
in by a very forward looking

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.451
program officer who realized
that most people are going

00:34:54.451 --> 00:34:56.909
to be looking at these slices
independently because they're

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.110
experts in this
area, and they wanted

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.485
to bring in people
that are going

00:34:59.485 --> 00:35:00.880
to look across all of these.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.240
There's just not too
many people that do that.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.070
So how do we look
at this type of data

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.710
and this holistic modeling
approach is we use something

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.450
called graphical modeling.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.380
So if I can get--

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.770
so imagine that this
is a genetic marker.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:14.800
This is a protein.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.274
This is a metabolite.

00:35:16.274 --> 00:35:18.690
The other thing might be a
pixel and a brain imaging scan.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.520
And we sort of look at
all these data together

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.520
and we see, well, every
time this genetic marker

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.410
is varying in the population
this metabolite is going up,

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.680
so we'll draw a graphical
connection between these things

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:33.660
and map all these layers of
data in this multi scale network

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.334
model.

00:35:34.334 --> 00:35:36.000
And then we actually
have tricks to turn

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.500
these from pure
correlation networks

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.520
into sort of directed networks
using Mandelian randomisation

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.020
and things like that, so can
even understand how information

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:47.265
flows from parts of these
multi scale networks

00:35:47.265 --> 00:35:49.540
to the other part
of the network.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.540
So the question we were
really trying to ask

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.780
was, well, let's not just
focus on beta amyloid, which

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.240
is really the predominant theory
in terms of drug targeting.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.060
Let's look at these
very complex networks

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.790
that we can construct from all
this multi scale data and look

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.500
at the healthy brain network.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.064
Again, genetics, genomics,
proteonomics, et cetera,

00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:08.230
and the Alzheimer's network.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.140
And let's just see
how they're rewired.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.120
Let's figure out how
their rewired from healthy

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.420
to the disease, and that might
reveal some novel drug targets.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.930
We could target other aspects
of the physiology that's

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:22.230
transforming the healthy brains
into the Alzheimer's brains.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.290
So this is actually a
highly simplistic version

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.870
of this software and
the computational steps

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:29.100
that go into doing that.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.870
I'm not going to go through
this, but needless to say it's

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.870
actually something that
runs on a supercomputer.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.550
It takes you know
a couple of days

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.210
to a week to get the answer.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.750
So we're crunching on the data,
we're crunching on the data.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.980
And really, what came out
was, as we started analyzing

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.480
the genes and the networks and
things that were getting most

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.730
rewired-- you can think of
it this way between healthy

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:48.710
and Alzheimer's.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:52.140
A screaming signal
for viral biology.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.309
And we said, oh, crap
because that is not

00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:56.350
what we were looking for.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.420
I was looking for
drug targets, I

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.836
was looking for
things like GPCRs,

00:36:58.836 --> 00:37:01.326
ion channels, and things that
are known to be druggable.

00:37:01.326 --> 00:37:02.700
But what we found
is a screaming,

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.670
screaming signal
for viral biology.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.529
So we said, well, now we have
to go back and look at this.

00:37:08.529 --> 00:37:10.320
And it turns out that
the standard software

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.550
for analyzing genomic data,
which actually is created here,

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.160
actually throws out viral
sequences by default

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.880
because it's often
contamination.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.416
So we had to go back and sort
of rewrite our own software.

00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:23.540
So even another person
looking at the same data set

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.230
wouldn't have found the viruses.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:26.934
So what we were able
to do in the end

00:37:26.934 --> 00:37:29.600
is pull out these networks where
we can actually see viral gene.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.750
So one of the top viruses we
found directly interacting

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.820
in the core networks
that were driving

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.680
from healthy to Alzheimer's
pathology were HHV-6, HHV-7.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.640
These actually are a
type of herpes virus

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.260
called roseolovirus.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.740
And HSV-1 also had been
implicated in the past

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.250
by some folks here
as well at Harvard.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.140
But what's different this time,
instead of find correlations

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.910
we can map specific
biological networks

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:56.520
in which these viral
genes were directly

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.520
interacting with the host
human genes, such as PSEN1,

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.350
which is a very well-known
Alzheimer's gene.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:06.780
So we get very specific,
testable networks or biological

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.600
pathways that can be tested
about how viruses are

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.980
contributing to Alzheimer's.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:15.090
We even discovered a novel
gene, such as this MIR155, which

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:16.980
actually is a viral
response gene,

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.480
which we showed in
this animal model

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.020
increases beta amyloid
plaques deposition.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.490
So what did we discover?

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:26.315
So we discovered that these
common viral species that

00:38:26.315 --> 00:38:27.690
are frequently
found in the brain

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.300
can in fact activate
and drive we

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.520
believe Alzheimer's pathology.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.000
In particular HHV-6, HHV-7.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.800
And what's really
notable about this

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.800
is we actually replicated
this in different cohorts.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.680
So this Amp AD partnership
is they bring in brain banks

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.181
from several different
institutions.

00:38:45.181 --> 00:38:47.096
We were able to replicate
these viral findings

00:38:47.096 --> 00:38:48.390
across independent framings.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.200
If it was just
contamination it probably

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.600
would have only been
found in one brain bank.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.590
And we actually identified
specific, testable biological

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.146
pathways in which we can
sort of follow on this.

00:38:59.146 --> 00:39:01.270
But I actually want to
point out a couple of things

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.603
that aren't on here that I'm
really proud about in terms

00:39:03.603 --> 00:39:06.310
of what this sort of
unexpected discovery led to,

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.334
which is actually related
to the prior talk.

00:39:08.334 --> 00:39:10.000
So one thing that
happened was I started

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.560
giving talks at
National Institutes

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.990
of Health and other places
about this viral finding.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.840
There was a bunch of
intellectually closeted

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.840
researchers coming up to
me saying, oh, my God.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.520
I've been sitting
on data for years

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.979
that totally supports
this but I've

00:39:22.979 --> 00:39:24.228
been too afraid to publish it.

00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:24.850
Why?

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:28.860
Because their whole career
is in the Alzheimer's field.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.120
I have ADHD.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.260
I do a bunch of other things.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.314
I could care if they
hated me or not.

00:39:35.314 --> 00:39:36.730
So this happened
over-- every time

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.920
I gave a talk another researcher
came up and said, oh, my God.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.921
Thank you for paving the
way for me to finally

00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:43.420
be able to publish this data
I've been sitting on for years.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.420
Again, it's a huge problem
that I didn't realize

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.600
happened in other areas.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.710
Another great thing that
came out of this, of course,

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.830
was the fact that there
was a quote from the NIH--

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.530
I think [INAUDIBLE] either the
NPR article or The New York

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:57.547
Times article--

00:39:57.547 --> 00:39:59.880
where they sort of said-- and
I'm editorializing-- well,

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.530
darn it.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:01.540
I guess we're going to
have to start funding

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.880
research in this area
because there's such

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.280
an overwhelming amount of data.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.847
In fact, when The New
York Times person said,

00:40:08.847 --> 00:40:10.930
they're trying to find
someone to speak negatively

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.370
against our article
because that's

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.080
what they always try to do.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.200
And they said they found someone
that truly hated everything

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.360
about our paper and spent
the entire weekend trying

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.920
to find something
terrible to say about it.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.720
But the best compliment
we got was they

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.830
said, they dropped the
mic on the data analysis,

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.924
and I have nothing
to say on the paper.

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:28.840
And of course, we put
all of this in notables.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.150
We put all of the data
and all of our software.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:34.460
All of our code is in the public
domain for anyone to reproduce.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.300
So when we give talks about
these scientific findings,

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.340
a lot of people think,
well, how does it

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.650
relate to me, for
example, as someone

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:42.752
sitting in the audience?

00:40:42.752 --> 00:40:44.710
So if you're interested
in Alzheimer's, there's

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.126
all kinds of cool
stuff that we're

00:40:46.126 --> 00:40:48.460
following up on such
as using anti-virals

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.040
to treat Alzheimer's
disease and a bunch

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.310
of new potential druggable
pathways we've identified.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.320
But I want to point
out something else

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.930
we're doing to really take the
spirit of what we did in terms

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:00.370
of analyzing the
Alzheimer's data,

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.890
and taking this data driven
approach to illuminate what we

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:05.440
don't know about
health and disease,

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.110
down to the individual
patient level and the way

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.090
that you could
personally experience.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.360
So we have this project at
Mount Sinai called Lab 100.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.400
So the practice of medicine--

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.914
I mean, talk about not
embracing the undiscovered.

00:41:17.914 --> 00:41:19.330
Practice of medicine
I would argue

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.844
is among the worst at
this, either by trying

00:41:21.844 --> 00:41:24.010
to mitigate the undiscovered
or pretend that it just

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.070
doesn't exist.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.910
Particularly by
evidence-based medicine.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.076
So they like to focus on
evidence-based medicine.

00:41:30.076 --> 00:41:31.450
Of course, a lot
of this evidence

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.700
is based on small studies
of a couple of hundred

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.220
if not 1,000 people.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.580
And we really try to mitigate
discovering incidental findings

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.530
and things that
are totally unknown

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.640
and trying to find
ways to deal with it.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.780
So what we're building
is this new type

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.750
of clinic at Mount
Sinai, that's actually

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.910
going to open the door
soon, to really embrace

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:55.510
the undiscovered and as part
of routine medical care.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:57.970
And we're asking the
question, what if you actually

00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:59.110
had a health record?

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.630
We always talk about
electronic health records

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:03.050
but we don't have
health records.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.344
We have records of your
diseases and your treatments.

00:42:05.344 --> 00:42:07.510
Health is currently defined
as absence of everything

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:09.370
we agree is a disease.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:11.260
You think about that
for a long time that's

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.124
pretty embarrassing.

00:42:12.124 --> 00:42:13.790
I mean, that's our
definition of health.

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.940
So if we had an
electronic health record,

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.901
what would we measure?

00:42:17.901 --> 00:42:20.150
We measure all these different
aspects of your health.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.649
I'll give you a sneak peek at
what this actually looks like.

00:42:22.649 --> 00:42:25.570
This is when you actually
start in the clinic

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.180
and you have your initial
consult with your doctor.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.970
And we do everything you're not
supposed to do in medical care.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.472
We measure thousands and
millions of things about you

00:42:34.472 --> 00:42:36.430
and every aspect of your
health when you're not

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.080
complaining about a disease.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.680
I mean, that's enough
to give a physician who

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.494
went through the standard
training a heart attack.

00:42:44.494 --> 00:42:45.910
And there's good
reasons for that,

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:48.159
but data can deal with
incidental findings.

00:42:48.159 --> 00:42:49.450
And this is what it looks like.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:51.090
And I'm not going to show you
the in between because then I

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.180
ran out of time, but
this is what it looks

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.650
like at the end of your visit.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:56.860
We do a whole 360, highly
data driven, millions of data

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.314
point view of your
overall health.

00:42:58.314 --> 00:42:59.980
We have a conversation
with you about it

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:04.510
and we give you access to
this and you own this data.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.870
So we're actually
building clinics

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.510
that embrace the unexpected
about each one of you

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:14.012
because there's so much we
don't know about health,

00:43:14.012 --> 00:43:15.970
about wellness, about
vitality, and resilience.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:17.350
And that's waiting
to be discovered

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:18.560
in each and every one of you.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.434
So thank you.

00:43:19.434 --> 00:43:20.422
- Thank you.

00:43:20.422 --> 00:43:23.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:26.448 --> 00:43:29.820
Yeah, I'm going to
talk [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.850
Well, that was great.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.520
Thank you, Joel, and of
course thank you, Wally.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.404
So I'm going to
just, if you will,

00:43:37.404 --> 00:43:39.070
start the questioning
because I actually

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.430
have a lot of questions
related to both talks.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.180
And then we'll open
it up to the audience.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.200
I'm going to start with Wiley.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.910
So I'm going to go with
the glass is half full.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:55.300
So we don't know much
about oceans, right?

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.880
And can we say that's
partly driven by the fact

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:02.590
that we didn't have the
technology, the instrumentation

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:05.290
to actually go looking for this?

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:10.030
And I was provoked
to ask that question,

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:14.050
given that beautiful green
little thing that you showed

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.380
by your MIT colleagues
so that we wouldn't

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.160
have been able to find that.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.380
So it's sort of like one
of these questions where--

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.330
and it also applies
to Joel somewhat

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:27.570
is that sure, we don't know
what we're not looking for,

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.900
but a lot of it is driven by
what we can actually look for.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.800
And there is a Rumsfeld
quote that I want to use,

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.250
given that Rumsfeld is playing
such a prominent role today,

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.350
which is you cannot go to
war with what you want.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:43.830
You go with what you have.

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.720
And I know I mangled
it completely

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.240
but sort of the spirit
is there, and it sort of

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.950
relates to these questions
that both for you and for Joel.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.930
But Wally, you can go first.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:55.620
- Sure, sure.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.661
So I would say to Rumsfeld
you probably shouldn't

00:44:57.661 --> 00:45:00.035
go to war then, but sorry.

00:45:00.035 --> 00:45:00.660
- Just a quote.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.610
- Just a quote.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:02.210
- No politics.

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:03.240
- Sorry, no politics.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.310
- Just couldn't
resist that quote.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:08.860
- So I think that for sure
our technology is increasing

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.100
at this really rapid rate.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.630
I mean, Alvin's been
around for a while now,

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.480
but it just got a major
retrofit to go to deeper depths.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.720
Please don't ask me which depth
because I currently forget.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.910
But I do think our
technology is really

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:23.889
increasing at a
fantastic rate, and I

00:45:23.889 --> 00:45:26.430
think this is a wonderful time
to get into science in general

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:27.600
and into ocean science.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.190
And I think it's
really important too

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.860
because, for example, the
finding of those coral

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.070
reefs off the Amazon
or off the Carolinas.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.770
We have ideas about trying to
do things like deep sea mining

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:41.040
or drilling for
oil, and we may be

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.320
making decisions or fishing--

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.419
we might be making decisions
without fully understanding

00:45:46.419 --> 00:45:48.210
the environment that
we're going to impact.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:52.980
And since we so rely on these
environments for the well-being

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.740
of humanity, I think it's not
only important that we're using

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:59.070
this technology to explore
but it's actually--

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.970
it's not life and death but
it's vital to humanity to do so.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:06.750
- I'd like to capitalize on
that because in the short term

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.980
it doesn't look
like life and death,

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:13.680
but oceans are critical for
climate and just sustainability

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.860
in general.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.150
So I think that
maybe there should

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.160
be some sense of
urgency with respect

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.010
to also ocean discovery.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.090
- There is absolutely
a huge sense

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.810
of urgency, and if you don't
feel that you should because--

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:28.950
yes, absolutely.

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:30.750
- Because the oceans
look so pretty

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:37.260
and they sort of have this
sense of, well, it's beautiful.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.130
What could be lying underneath?

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:43.390
And we know also from the
[INAUDIBLE] visits and other

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.390
oceanographers that have
come through Radcliffe,

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:47.130
there's a lot that would--

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.780
to say that there's
a lot we don't know

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.610
is completely underestimating
what we really don't know.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:53.430
- That's true.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.610
- So Joel, I had
a question for you

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:59.250
with respect to the big data
aspects of all the discoveries

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.250
because I myself dabble
a little bit in big data

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:04.080
from a cancer perspective.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.940
And even when we look at data
that was generated by TCGA,

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.630
which is the Tumor Genome Atlas.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.330
Where in my own
disease that I studied

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.710
it was treated as this
composite disease.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:17.790
And, oh, my goodness.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:21.630
People were shocked that when
we looked at the molecular--

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.880
we looked under the
hood, so to speak.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.830
The molecular subtyping
said, oh, my goodness.

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.000
This is at least four
different diseases.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.790
Now I wasn't shocked
by that because

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:35.800
at the time, you go with what
you have, which is histology.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.700
So increasingly, we're finding
out more and more with respect

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.560
to every type of disease.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.280
The four types of diabetes.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.257
There's at least four or five
types of endometrial cancer.

00:47:45.257 --> 00:47:46.590
There are five types of ovarian.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:49.720
And I'm sure, as you start
binning these diseases,

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.830
not just by their genetics
and their genomic profiles,

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:56.509
and you start adding in
lifestyle an environment, which

00:47:56.509 --> 00:47:58.050
we're going to get
increasingly-- not

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.450
just from the medical records
but we already have in hand

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:02.550
from many of these studies.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:06.930
My point is, we're
going to be so ahead

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:10.560
of these brilliant physicians
whose job is really,

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:14.580
to be fair to the physicians,
is to blunt the bleeding.

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.780
It's really to just take
care of the problem at hand.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.970
So I'm not surprised
that your dermatologist

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.860
and your G.I.
Doctors were working

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:26.010
in silos because they're so
trained to that's their job.

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:29.220
You have a G.I problem
you work on the G.I.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:33.680
You don't think about the
inflammatory immune response.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.860
So it's not just a statement.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.490
The question is, we have
all-- because this also

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:39.330
plagues what I do.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:41.730
We have all this
data, and you showed

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:43.620
some brilliant networking.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.350
How do we translate
that to the clinic,

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:49.440
especially in light of the
fact that Mount Sinai also

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:54.450
has this 360 lab.

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:57.360
What do you tell the
patient or this person who

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.964
comes in and says, well,
we found x, y, and z

00:48:59.964 --> 00:49:01.380
but there's really
not much we can

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:05.040
do because therapeutics
or the treatment

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.250
hasn't gotten there yet.

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.732
I'm sorry that was so long.

00:49:08.732 --> 00:49:09.690
- I'll try to be brief.

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:10.814
That's a big, big question.

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:14.140
I think one is to try to--

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.500
the health system
itself is not set up

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.786
to support this type of thing.

00:49:17.786 --> 00:49:19.410
So what we're trying
to do with Lab 100

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:21.490
is to rebuild the
whole system so it

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:23.140
can support this type of thing.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:27.880
And one to bring the science
of precision medicine

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.222
to precision health and
wellness because pre disease.

00:49:31.222 --> 00:49:33.430
It's a lot easier to prevent
a lot of these diseases.

00:49:35.779 --> 00:49:38.320
I think the physicians will be
open as long as you equip them

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.600
with the tools to act
on the information

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.000
and act on the information
at the right time

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.209
because they're busy.

00:49:44.209 --> 00:49:45.250
I'll give you an example.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.590
We've known that there are
certain genetic markers,

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:50.470
pharmacogenomics, that
should influence prescribing

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:52.810
of medications.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.000
And we actually have
50,000 of our patients

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.180
that are sequenced, and the
existing electronic health

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.660
record software can't even
connect a genetic marker

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.070
of the patient to the time
when the drug is prescribed

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.057
and alert the physician.

00:50:06.057 --> 00:50:08.140
We actually had to spend
$4 million at Mount Sinai

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.350
to build our own
software to do that.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:13.600
There's a last mile
problem of connecting

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.600
what's known to the
clinician but in a way that

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.940
is at the right time and
context of giving patient care,

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.100
and that's a big challenge.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:21.600
- Right.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.250
And I think that's
the infrastructure.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:27.300
It's sort of like we need to
build this infrastructure.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.675
- And I'll just
add very briefly.

00:50:28.675 --> 00:50:30.466
There's going to be
some things we're never

00:50:30.466 --> 00:50:32.230
going to get that
require evidence on,

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.646
so I think we also
need to empower

00:50:33.646 --> 00:50:36.644
patients more to collect
evidence on their own.

00:50:36.644 --> 00:50:37.810
So I'll give you an example.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:40.330
With my Crohn's disease I asked
my physician, what should I

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:41.560
or shouldn't I eat?

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.967
And he'll tell you, you
eat wherever you want.

00:50:44.967 --> 00:50:45.550
That's insane.

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:47.080
Well, there's never been a
randomized controlled trial

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.610
on all these foods to
tell me what you should

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:49.818
and shouldn't eat in Crohn's.

00:50:49.818 --> 00:50:52.432
And so you're saying, I
can drink beer and donuts

00:50:52.432 --> 00:50:54.640
or have a salad, and from
the perspective of medicine

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.500
it's the same thing
for my disease?

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:57.010
It's insane.

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:58.468
So one of the things
we're doing is

00:50:58.468 --> 00:51:01.180
building a N-of-One
clinical trial software

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.430
so patients can start running
rigorous clinical trials

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:04.846
on themselves and
collect evidence

00:51:04.846 --> 00:51:06.227
on these lifestyle things.

00:51:06.227 --> 00:51:09.346
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:09.346 --> 00:51:10.720
- So I'm going to
be a little bit

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.130
of devil's advocate on that.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.170
So that would assume
that the patient actually

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.790
knows the implications
of their findings?

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:18.290
- Oh, yeah.

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:20.290
So the hardest part about
building that software

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:22.705
was not the statistical
engine that calculates it.

00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:23.830
It was the user experience.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:24.329
- Right

00:51:24.329 --> 00:51:27.120
- Getting someone to understand
a p-value and an effect size.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.430
We probably spent a year
on that part of it alone.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.970
- Easily.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:31.497
- Easily.

00:51:31.497 --> 00:51:32.330
That was super hard.

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:34.121
And I'm not claiming
that we figured it out

00:51:34.121 --> 00:51:35.230
but that's super hard.

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:37.960
- Yeah, I think that's a
general concern that I have is

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.500
that when we construct
these algorithms

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.860
and predictive scores,
we are assuming

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:48.040
that the general population
understands what risk is.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.010
And that's not to
undermine the intelligence

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:53.200
of the general population,
but I have colleagues

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.750
that don't understand what a
p-value of 0.05 and they're

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:56.770
brilliant.

00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:00.490
So I guess it's
sort of a process.

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:07.415
We're in a situation where we
have to educate low, high and--

00:52:07.415 --> 00:52:10.660
The gradient as well as, as
I like to say, we need not

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.800
only the--

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.990
maybe we don't need the
depth but we certainly

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:19.776
need the breadth to understand
a lot of this big data output.

00:52:19.776 --> 00:52:21.010
- Absolutely.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:21.510
- OK.

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:23.550
So I think at this point
we should open it up

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:25.800
to the audience because
I can stay here all day

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.230
and talk to these
wonderful people.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:30.300
There's a microphone
that's coming.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.020
I would ask that when
you ask your question

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.788
please pose it in a question.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.610
And please state your name.

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.700
Big group.

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:54.360
- Hi, I'm Jo [INAUDIBLE],,
and I'm a sleep researcher.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.180
So this question is for Joel.

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:02.160
We know both diabetes and
Alzheimer's have relationships

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.280
to disordered or
insufficient sleep.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:10.950
I wondered if your islands
included sleep anywhere

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.380
in this evaluation.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.800
We know the brain has
no lymphocytes system,

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.520
but during sleep
the toxins do drain.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.760
We don't sleep the
toxins don't drain.

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.429
So what do you think?

00:53:22.429 --> 00:53:24.720
- So we don't currently have
that data on the patients.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.320
We're actually conducting a
study using wearable sensors

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.240
and things like that to measure
sleep and incorporate this.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.617
And yes, the circadian
effects we know are huge.

00:53:34.617 --> 00:53:36.450
Not only in influencing
the metabolic system

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.370
and the immune
system, and we simply

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:41.700
don't have that data yet on
a large scale population.

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.090
But we need it badly.

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:43.970
- Yeah, big piece.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:44.942
Thank you.

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.100
- Hi, Sally
[? Seaver. ?] Another

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.410
sort of general
question, and that is,

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:58.570
those of us who got the early
polio vaccine before about 1973

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:01.030
also got SV40.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:05.470
And I heard a really
fantastic seminar,

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:08.680
probably in the late
70s, from Germany

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.220
where they track all cancers.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.720
And they could start
to see if there

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:18.700
was any difference
between people before who

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.000
got the early polio vaccine
versus the other one

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.400
on various cancers.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.640
And one of the things
they were hinting at

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:30.340
is there might have been
some stuff on some brain type

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.390
cancers.

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:36.720
Have you heard any updates
or looked at your data

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.200
with those of us who
have gotten SV40?

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.354
- I do believe SV40 showed
up, and I can't recall off

00:54:43.354 --> 00:54:44.770
the top of my head,
but of course,

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:47.370
the evidence of the relationship
between viruses and cancers

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:49.800
is growing day by day.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.870
I'll note that
one of the genomic

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:54.270
features we found that
related to the viral activity

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:58.291
in Alzheimer's are these things
called G4, quadruplex domains.

00:54:58.291 --> 00:54:59.790
But the only important
thing to note

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:02.342
is that those are actually being
targeted by cancer therapies

00:55:02.342 --> 00:55:04.050
right now because
there is virally driven

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:05.280
cancers that target those.

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.920
And we're actually looking at
reusing those in Alzheimer's as

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.211
well.

00:55:09.211 --> 00:55:09.710
- Thank you.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.680
- Christine [? Borgman. ?] We
study data sharing and reuse

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.440
in the sciences, and we
have found in oceanography,

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.490
biomedicine, astronomy, and
elsewhere that one person's

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:25.040
signal is somebody else's
noise and they often

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.930
don't agree on what are the
data in the first place.

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:30.770
So many of the effects
you're talking about

00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:32.720
disappeared at
those early stages

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.100
when they threw
away the outliers

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.500
and did the data compression?

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.200
How do we think about
this better as far as

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.150
how much are
methodological issues we

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:42.470
should be trained for?

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.510
How much are statistical?

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:47.000
How much are just the
equipment, like you said,

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.230
that you pick the data up?

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:51.920
Or even the software that threw
away those signals because they

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.630
thought they were noise?

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:56.450
- That's a huge question.

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.646
So I think for sure there's
some standardization

00:55:58.646 --> 00:56:00.020
of oceanographic
methods, and I'm

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.460
sure this applies
to other fields

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.200
too that we could
get board with.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.610
And people are beginning to do
that, and that is wonderful.

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:09.440
So I totally support
those efforts.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.540
And then, I think we
need to get better

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.340
at having people
embrace that noise

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.820
and not get rid of
outliers, like you said.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.290
We're super trained
to be risk adverse

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:20.900
and yet we know, just from
sitting here this morning,

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.380
that that's a bad idea.

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.740
Those outliers have a
lot of power to them.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.250
And we also need to start
embracing negative results

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:29.850
because if we're
not publishing those

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:33.180
then we just repeat those same
experiment over and over again.

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.522
So it's a big issue I
think we need to deal with.

00:56:36.522 --> 00:56:37.730
- I'll just add very briefly.

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.470
One of the things that
the accelerating medicines

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:42.020
partnership for Alzheimer's
did is the program officer

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:44.150
required that the
rawest form of all data

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:47.060
was put into the public
data sharing repository.

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.060
Because the genomic
data, the imaging data,

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.190
they go through several
steps of transformation.

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:54.860
So that was a very
prescient move on her part.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:56.360
Not being a data
scientist, she knew

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.818
it would be super important to
get the rawest form possible

00:56:58.818 --> 00:57:01.020
because of this.

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.610
- Thank you.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:07.070
- Hi, [? Ned Bacon. ?]
Joel, I want to ask you.

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:11.779
Have you any thoughts
about the increases--

00:57:11.779 --> 00:57:13.070
maybe there isn't any increase.

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:18.362
The susceptibility to these
viral effects with aging?

00:57:18.362 --> 00:57:20.620
- Yeah, definitely.

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.110
I think the ultimate
story of the viruses

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:24.440
and Alzheimer's are two things.

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:28.060
One is that innate immune
activation is bad in the brain

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.367
and around inflammation,
which we've kind of known.

00:57:30.367 --> 00:57:32.200
And in fact, the genetic
association studies

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.870
for Alzheimer's over
the past couple of years

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:37.842
have pulled up a lot of
immune markers focusing

00:57:37.842 --> 00:57:40.300
on this immune cell in the
brain called the microglia where

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.440
the neurologists
are kind of like,

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.270
why are all of these
immune signals coming up

00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.850
in the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:44.350
This is weird.

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:45.350
What do we do with this?

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.650
But the other side of that
is then immune senescence,

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:52.030
which could be explaining why--

00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:53.780
[INAUDIBLE] aging of
the immune system,

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:57.250
why are these viruses
becoming active in the brain

00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:59.650
at a certain stage of life?

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.650
There's potentially a
role for immune senescence

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:03.441
in the activation of
these viruses as well,

00:58:03.441 --> 00:58:05.540
but it's still pretty early.

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:07.588
Early days.

00:58:07.588 --> 00:58:09.230
- Hi, great talks.

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:11.480
Janet [? Rich ?] [? Edwards. ?]
I'm an epidemiologist,

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.570
and one of the things my team
has been studying is trying

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:17.480
to bust open the silos of
the way we think about bodily

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.470
systems.

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:21.350
So we correlate the
reproductive system

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:24.410
with the cardiovascular system
and find some new connections

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:25.640
there.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:31.705
You mentioned the way the NIH
is organized by bodily system.

00:58:31.705 --> 00:58:33.830
I suspect we're going to
look back on this and say,

00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:37.660
this is such an archaic, quaint
way of thinking about the body.

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.770
That there really
aren't such systems.

00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:44.280
I was intrigued that you
mentioned at least one instance

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:47.610
of them encouraging you
to go across the omics

00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:50.460
and wonder if you have
any comments about how

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:56.220
that silo busting perspective
can be encouraged perhaps

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.500
revolutionarily
across all of NIH.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.510
And I don't know if
NSF has similar issues.

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:04.340
- NIH is a big, complex place.

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.002
Obviously, I think,
again, the folks

00:59:06.002 --> 00:59:07.460
in the National
Institutes of Aging

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.720
are very forward thinking.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:11.510
In fact, what they often do is
they put me on study sections

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:12.980
and they say, go cause trouble.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.980
[INAUDIBLE] actually the
program officer quietly

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:17.350
says to go cause trouble.

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:19.350
And the evidence is just
mounting more and more.

00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:20.600
So we actually have
a paper under review

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.724
right now where we do this
sort of network analysis

00:59:22.724 --> 00:59:25.340
across all tissues in
the body in looking

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.174
at diabetes and autoimmune
disease and Alzheimer's and all

00:59:28.174 --> 00:59:29.840
these diseases that
have co-morbidities.

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.645
And you can actually find
this one master connector

00:59:34.645 --> 00:59:36.105
in monocytes that
actually connects

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.230
all these different things.

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:41.031
So I think it's just
a matter of time.

00:59:41.031 --> 00:59:41.530
- Hi.

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:42.377
Wonderful talks.

00:59:42.377 --> 00:59:44.710
My name is Robin [? Barns. ?]
I'm a retired primary care

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:45.600
physician.

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.080
And we don't just
staunch the bleeding.

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.170
Actually--

00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:51.280
- I knew I was going
to offend many people,

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.980
but I'm on limited time here.

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:57.890
- That brings me to a big
speculative question that

00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.440
may or may not be answerable.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.170
So part of what's
important about medicine

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:07.800
or about primary care,
which is longitudinal

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.740
and you have chronic
relationships

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.650
with patients whose diseases
come and go and so forth.

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:21.620
How does what you're
doing interact with that?

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.990
And the bigger question
is, how is this

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:28.340
going to change the health
care system as a whole, which

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.410
is not just medical?

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:33.492
Just a couple of thoughts.

01:00:33.492 --> 01:00:35.013
- That's a big question.

01:00:35.013 --> 01:00:37.027
- Well, that's what--

01:00:37.027 --> 01:00:37.610
- What's that?

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:40.330
- That was basically the
big question that I asked.

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:41.350
It's just huge.

01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:42.120
- Yeah, it's huge.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.810
I think the way to
do it, unfortunately,

01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:48.860
is to sort of restructure the
health system fundamentally,

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.000
and that's actually--

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.589
so I'm at Mount Sinai,
but I don't want

01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:53.880
to spend too much time on this.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.650
But that clinic you saw, by the
way, the way we designed it?

01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:59.450
It can be built in a
week and a half actually.

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.210
And actually, we have a smaller
version of it that's a kiosk.

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:06.560
So our mission is to create a
parallel pulley decentralized

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.935
health system that can be
deployed closer to where people

01:01:08.935 --> 01:01:11.310
live that then puts major
pressure on the existing health

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:12.190
system to change.

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:13.320
So that's my goal.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.881
I tell Mount Sinai my job is
to shut their primary care down

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:16.630
with my new model.

01:01:20.047 --> 01:01:20.880
- Colleen Cavanaugh.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.830
I follow these questions in
terms of how revolutionary

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:27.500
your approach has been that it
could be applied to the earth

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:31.580
more broadly and from
nations to the whole earth.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.580
And I wanted to
ask how you think

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:37.820
you can do this and do it fast?

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.000
And I have one answer from our
microbial sciences initiative

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.687
symposium with Jim Collins.

01:01:42.687 --> 01:01:44.020
- I think this is your question.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:44.510
- No, no.

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:45.020
It's both.

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.020
- How to heal the ocean.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.273
How do we head the ocean?

01:01:47.273 --> 01:01:50.870
- This is an NSF
proposal and NIH.

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:53.902
- Well, I'm actually
quite excited to see

01:01:53.902 --> 01:01:55.610
what you're doing and
wonder if we can do

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:56.990
a similar thing for the oceans.

01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:59.450
Because we often talk about
ecosystem health and we

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.740
have no definition for that.

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.509
And we have no [INAUDIBLE]
we just go look for problems

01:02:04.509 --> 01:02:06.050
and that's what we
get excited about.

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:07.700
But trying to understand
that difference

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.283
between health and
disease, basically,

01:02:09.283 --> 01:02:10.790
of an ocean basin or an estuary.

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:13.640
I think we have
data to start to do

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.640
that but we need these
computational tools

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.536
and to apply those.

01:02:19.536 --> 01:02:20.910
- Yeah, my brain
goes immediately

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:24.210
to microbiome research, which
maps very well in the gut

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.700
microbiome because
it is an ecosystem.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:30.240
And there's this
dream that people

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.980
have that if I can just
find the healthy microbes

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.010
and then give people the
healthy microbe it'll

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:37.650
make them healthy, but it turns
out that it's a big ecosystem.

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:40.867
It's a big garden you've got
to kind of prune and seed

01:02:40.867 --> 01:02:41.700
and stuff like that.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.380
And I think that's going to be--

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.130
what my talk said.

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:46.213
There's not going to be a
magic bullet [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:46.213 --> 01:02:47.440
it's ecosystem approach.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.330
- But what I'm looking for is
the bullet for the funding.

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:50.538
- The bullet for the funding.

01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:51.420
- --do it fast.

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:55.360
And I can tell you, Jim
Collins, who figures out

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.170
some medical problem, solves it
in the lab, and in two months

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:01.170
it's translated.

01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:03.390
His answer was he starts
a lot of companies,

01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:06.000
makes a lot of money,
and that money does it.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.650
There is another big
funding groups like the name

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:11.300
Gates [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:19.490
This has to happen, and
quickly, for me in particular.

01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:23.210
- So what we are seeing is that
people make a lot of my in tech

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:25.447
and they are deploying
resources because they

01:03:25.447 --> 01:03:27.780
understand what we're trying
to do and they are funding.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:30.220
- But who wouldn't
understand it?

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.242
- You'd be surprised.

01:03:31.242 --> 01:03:32.492
- I'm not going to name names.

01:03:32.492 --> 01:03:34.180
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.480
- Don't name any names.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.730
Smart.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.910
Yes?

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:41.460
- Dr. Fulweiler-- oh, sorry.

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.710
My name is Joshua [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:46.020
I'm a textbook editor and
I have celiac disease,

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.500
so I'm very interested in
the micro biome doctor.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.980
Dr. Fulweiler spoke to us about
finding passion and building

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:54.480
teams.

01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:00.780
I'm an amateur astronomer, so I
think about amateur scientists

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.280
and amateur number
crunchers and people who

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.340
do it for the love who
may not have had it happen

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.950
in their life to be able
to do it for a living

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:14.160
or to have a more conventional
institutional involvement

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.180
in science.

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.620
So the question I wanted
to ask each of our speakers

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:24.990
in the present session is, are
there opportunities for citizen

01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:28.470
science, for amateur
participation for joining

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:32.280
a community of people who do
anything from spit in a vial

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:36.840
or take a cup of seawater
for you to actually help you

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.310
with the sense making.

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.910
- So there are absolutely
groups for citizen science,

01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:43.680
and I think you've hit
on something that's

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.390
really fundamentally important.

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:48.640
And that is that scientists
only see sometimes

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.890
the things that they're going.

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:51.500
And they're maybe just
going for research queues

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.875
for a few weeks, or I'm going
down there to study one bay

01:04:53.875 --> 01:04:55.000
and I'm there infrequently.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.791
There are groups that
are out in the water,

01:04:56.791 --> 01:04:58.530
like fishermen, all
the time, and there

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:00.750
are groups now that are
working specifically

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:03.690
with people that are on
the water, for example,

01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:07.110
or are surfing or kayaking
or whatever it is.

01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:09.174
There's lots of groups
to join for that,

01:05:09.174 --> 01:05:10.590
and I'm happy to
give you examples

01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:13.170
offline if you would like
but there's watershed groups.

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:15.090
And for sure, I think
that citizen science

01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:19.090
can provide a whole new
set of eyes and knowledge

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:21.340
that we're missing, as well
as I think you're probably

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.423
going to allude to in a
second, this idea of being

01:05:23.423 --> 01:05:26.250
able to capture data and provide
it to scientists to sort of do

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:28.110
the analysis on.

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:30.531
- So the trend we
have here, of course,

01:05:30.531 --> 01:05:33.030
is that powerful measurement
technologies [INAUDIBLE] become

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.370
rapidly commoditized
and distributed out

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:37.550
into the consumer realm.

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:40.244
Genomic sequencing is
falling precipitously.

01:05:40.244 --> 01:05:41.910
It's easy for anyone
with a credit card,

01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:43.710
basically, to start
sequencing something

01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:46.740
or bring your minion
onto the boat.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.950
And wearable sensors are
increasing in fidelity.

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:52.470
And you may not be
aware, of course, that--

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.390
You ever heard of
Apple Research Kit?

01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:56.910
Apple has a software
built into iOS

01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:59.619
to conduct distributed
clinical trials, which

01:05:59.619 --> 01:06:01.410
isn't quite citizen
science yet because you

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:03.930
need an academic
institution to partner with.

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:04.680
So it's happening.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.471
And I want to point
out, there's someone

01:06:06.471 --> 01:06:08.220
at Mount Sinai named
Jason [INAUDIBLE] who

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:12.030
has this Resilience Project,
which is a citizen science

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:15.660
project to get people to submit
biological data to find out

01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:18.300
if they're resilient to
diseases, for example.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.750
Could we find someone who
has ApoE4 at the age of 80

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:21.960
and is cognitively intact?

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:27.940
- My name is [? Ricardo ?]
[? Cortez, a ?] retired

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.145
chemical engineer.

01:06:29.145 --> 01:06:30.020
I have two questions.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:34.960
One is on the slide that you
show nitrogen removal that

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.032
changes through time.

01:06:37.032 --> 01:06:43.120
Was that because the data that
was in the early ages of data

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.080
collection was wrong or
because of climate crisis

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:51.340
has changed the
chemistry of the ocean

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.990
and basically reversed the path?

01:06:54.990 --> 01:07:01.690
And the second question is,
if the idea of a viral species

01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:05.740
is the causation of
Alzheimer's disease,

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.770
and virus multiplies
so fast, why

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:13.020
is the Alzheimer's disease
so slow to develop?

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.852
- So those early data for
the N were not incorrect,

01:07:16.852 --> 01:07:18.810
and I'm happy again to
talk about this offline.

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:20.226
It's a little bit
of a long story.

01:07:20.226 --> 01:07:22.890
But basically, the
climate warming

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.420
that we've seen
in coastal systems

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:27.400
is changing them in ways that
we would not have expected,

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.624
and that is what's been driving
the switch that I showed you.

01:07:32.624 --> 01:07:33.790
- I'd say on the viral side.

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:36.720
Again, there is no cause of
Alzheimer's, just causes.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.400
[INAUDIBLE] Alzheimer's that
will come together [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.730
really complex way.

01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:42.730
So what I didn't know
about these viruses, which

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.310
is important to note, is
that there are retroviruses,

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:49.300
meaning that they can
integrate into the host DNA.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.850
So what we think
is likely happening

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:53.537
is that these in
fact-- so the exposure

01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:55.870
can become very early in life
and that these viruses are

01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:59.215
lying in wait in the genome
of the neuron, basically,

01:07:59.215 --> 01:08:01.090
and they're becoming
activated later in life.

01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:03.280
Why they're becoming activated
we're not totally clear,

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:03.779
actually.

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:07.640
- I'm [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.430
I'm just a science enthusiast.

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:11.750
But my question
is kind of related

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:14.610
to his on the global
warming in the coastlines,

01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:17.854
but mostly about
the coast heights.

01:08:17.854 --> 01:08:20.020
And I'm sure you're busy
enough trying to figure out

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.020
what's going on at this moment,
but are there studies like

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.950
if new sediments-- like if
suddenly there's a new tidal

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:28.569
flats, new sediment, does that--

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:31.729
how that differs than the
older sediment [INAUDIBLE]??

01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:35.290
In history, it's hard
to tell coastline

01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:36.580
is buried under water.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.204
But anyway, that's
what my question is.

01:08:39.204 --> 01:08:41.620
- So I think what you're getting
at is this idea of trying

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:44.319
to understand, potentially,
how nitrogen removal capacity

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:47.290
changes in sediments over time?

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:50.470
And there's some really neat
ecological theory on this,

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:53.460
but basically what you tend to
see is really early sediments.

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.820
You see nitrogen fixation.

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.319
So that arrow going
down, basically.

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:58.305
The sediment's making nitrogen.
The bacteria in the sediment

01:08:58.305 --> 01:09:00.910
is making nitrogen. And then,
as you build up organic matter

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:02.920
or food for the bacteria
that will switch

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.820
and you'll start to
remove the nitrogen.

01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.569
And there, of course,
are caveats to that,

01:09:07.569 --> 01:09:08.777
but that's the general trend.

01:09:12.929 --> 01:09:14.470
- I think that was
our last question,

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:15.720
and there were many questions.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.420
A testament to how great
both lectures were.

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:23.980
And I'd like everyone to please
applaud both Wally and Joel.

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:27.410
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:38.260
- Well, I would like to
thank Mack and Wally and Joel

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:42.609
for just carrying us to
what is almost lunch in such

01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:44.000
a beautiful way.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.260
And so let me just say one more
thing before we let you go.

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.100
Actually, a few more things.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.830
The first one that I
forgot to say before

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:52.700
is there is a Twitter
stream for this.

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.515
It's hashtag the undiscovered.

01:09:54.515 --> 01:09:56.140
And there's a lot
going on there so you

01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.160
can recap what you already heard
and you can go contribute there

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.090
also.

01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:02.340
Now there is lunch.

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.500
And I mentioned earlier that
there is a poster session.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:08.350
And this poster
session is dedicated

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:11.020
to ideas about how
we can incorporate

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:14.380
the kind of thinking that
you see today in the talks

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:18.610
into K-12 education and
education at other levels.

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:21.250
And I just wanted to
show you because Stewart

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:25.030
showed a draft version of
something just like this.

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:26.560
One of the posters,
which I admit

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.510
to having something
to do with, is

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:33.220
about how Isaac Newton got
the information and the ideas

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.430
that he needed going all the
way back to ancient Mesopotamia.

01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:39.440
And if I just let this
scroll across the screen,

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.060
you'll see that is
not the neat arc.

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:45.200
And that is the
cleaned up version.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.990
And if I just show
you that again, I

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:49.300
want to point out at
the left those three

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.320
circles you can't read?

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.910
One says a step toward
Newton if it's green.

01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:55.900
The one at the bottom says
wrong or unhelpful ideas.

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.090
Failures I suppose
we should call them.

01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:00.070
And the one in the middle
is the most important

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:02.850
that says partial credit.

01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:05.770
So Stewart pointed out early
on that nothing is ever

01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:08.320
totally right, and all of the
brilliant work that you heard

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.210
here is not totally right.

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:12.980
It's mostly right
and it's helpful.

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:16.300
And so the idea is, how do we
communicate this complexity

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.850
without giving people
the idea that scientists

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:20.890
don't know what they're doing?

01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:22.060
So that's the point.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.110
Thank you very much.

01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:24.010
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:27.360
[MUSIC PLAYING]
