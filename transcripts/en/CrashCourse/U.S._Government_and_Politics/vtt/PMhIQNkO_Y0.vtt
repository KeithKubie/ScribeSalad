00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.900
Hello. I’m Craig and this is Crash Course
Government and Politics and congratulations

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.150
you have made it to the final Crash Course
Government and Politics video! Whoo!

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.840
Today we’re going to look at the mystifying
paradox of both the least and most important

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.160
aspect of government: foreign policy.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.189
Foreign policy is the most important because
it has the potential to affect the largest

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.660
number of people, especially if you include
environmental policy, which we should. Also,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.869
foreign policy includes a lot of elements
of economic policy, so that’s important.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.890
But it’s also the least important, first
because it tends to have a minimal impact

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.810
on how Americans think about their government, unless the U.S. is at war and even then not always so much.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.360
Second, because it is the least democratic
government policy. Which might be a good thing.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.300
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.260
Foreign policy is the collection of policies that determine America’s relations with other nations &amp; foreign entities.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.300
It includes: - diplomacy
- military and security policy

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.740
- international human rights policies
- economic policies such as trade and international energy policy, and

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.280
- environmental policy.
My environmental policy is [punches eagle] ...that.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.840
In some ways, foreign policy is the quintessential
public good. Everybody benefits from a policy

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.920
that makes citizens, and the world, safer,
and no individual, except for maybe a Bond-style

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.990
supervillain could pull it off by themselves.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.670
Like all government policy, foreign policy
has goals. Of course, foreign policy is about

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.229
providing security, but American foreign policy
also seeks to create prosperity, and works

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.669
toward a somewhat idealistic goal of making
the world a better place.

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:35.909
Security has many facets, and like most things,
it has grown more complex over time. It used

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.109
to simply mean being able to repel invaders.

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.289
[Mongoltage]

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.460
No, not like the Mongols, more like the British.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.560
Now however, in addition to physical security,
foreign policy encompasses transportation,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.020
energy, cyber-security, and food security.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.340
So we can see how foreign policy and
economic policy are closely related.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.380
And of course, we can’t forget terrorism.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.420
I can’t resist a little history here, especially
since this is the last episode of the series.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.299
From the beginning, starting with George Washington,
in terms of physical security, the U.S. has

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.119
been pretty isolationist, although Canadians
and Mexicans would probably disagree.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.920
George Washington urged the U.S. to avoid
“foreign entanglements” and we basically

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.910
did, right up until World Wars I and II, when
threats to the international order were seen

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.260
as detrimental to American security, even though there wasn’t much danger of the Germans invading the U.S.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.340
After World War II, the advent of long range bombers and then ICBMs meant that there was a threat to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.700
Americans in America and security policy developed into one of deterrence, which meant building up

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.500
enough military strength to discourage potential enemies, pronounced Soviet Union, from attacking us.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.680
Deterrence was expensive, and required a large
arsenal of dangerous weapons and a willingness

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.290
to fight, which the U.S. did in Korea and
Vietnam. We still maintain an enormous nuclear

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.910
arsenal, but nowadays, different security
threats mean deterrence is less important.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.349
It’s not clear that a gigantic nuclear threat
has much effect on terrorists, and since 2001,

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.489
America has pursued a global war on terror,
that, as we saw in Iraq, includes the doctrine

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.209
of preemptive war to forestall potential threats.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.819
Although military force may be the most visible
form of U.S. foreign policy, it might not

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.120
be the most useful. For one thing, it’s
generally seen as a last resort, which I’d

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.360
say is a good thing. It also has significant downsides, including costs, both in terms of lives and money.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.260
It’s also politically dangerous because,
while Americans are usually on board with

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.420
short, decisive and victorious military action, the longer a war drags on, the less support it tends to have.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.239
The main economic goals of foreign policy
are to expand opportunities for the U.S.,

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.129
promote foreign investment, maintain access
to foreign energy supplies, and promote trade

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.239
policies that will keep prices low at American
big box stores.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.069
What this means in practice is that the U.S.
maintains an active role in international

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.879
organizations, like the World Trade Organization,
that make and uphold free trade rules.

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.129
We grant “most favorable nation” status
to trading partners that agree to low tariffs,

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.379
and most notably we engage in regional trade
agreements like NAFTA.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.690
The third goal of foreign policy is to make
the world a better place. One way that the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.400
U.S. does this is through international human
rights initiatives.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.519
The U.S. is a party to many human rights treaties,
but we have a somewhat complicated relationship

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.400
with the UN and international lawmaking bodies,
so we don’t sign on to all of them.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.519
For example, the U.S. hasn’t signed on to
the international criminal court, probably

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.030
because we’re afraid that submitting to
its jurisdiction would be a loss of our sovereignty.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.980
But in reality international law isn’t a
huge part of American foreign policy.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.980
The U.S. also engages in international peace-keeping
missions, and international peace certainly

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.440
makes the world a better place.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.000
America doesn’t usually commit its soldiers
to UN peacekeeping missions, preferring to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.660
make its own coalitions or work through NATO,
which by the way is an example of an international

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.090
security agreement too. See there’s a lot
of overlap here.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.030
Another way the U.S. makes the world a better
place is through international environmental policy.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.350
Again, (punches eagle) that’s my environmental
policy. Keep eagles away from me.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.980
Environmental policy has a domestic component, as when we set fuel standards or rules for power plant

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.320
emissions or dumping toxic chemicals. But since we’re all on one planet with one environment, it’s also part of

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.460
foreign policy. Talk to me when you live on Mars. Then maybe you don’t have to worry about this stuff.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.310
On the other hand, the U.S. lags behind other
nations in terms of participation in many

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.650
global environmental initiatives, which is
a bit of a problem considering we’re one

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.580
of the world’s biggest polluters and producers
of greenhouse gasses.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.900
I can’t imagine these statements are going
to lead to any bad comments. At all.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.650
When it comes to the conflict between environmental
protection and economic growth, Americans

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.120
tend to choose economic growth.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.680
So, overall, in terms of foreign policy goals,
security comes first, economics second and

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.660
making the world a better place definitely
third, at least in terms of formal foreign policy.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.700
This brings us to the question of how foreign
policy is made, and why foreign policy is

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.479
the least democratic type of policy the government
makes.

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.679
Let’s go to the final Thought Bubble for
Crash Course Government and Politics. Whoo!

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.660
At the top of the foreign policy picture is
the President, who the constitution suggests

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.009
is the nation’s chief diplomat, having the
power to receive foreign ambassadors and negotiate

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.910
treaties. The president gets all the face
to face meetings with foreign leaders and

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.530
has authority to hammer out agreements; remember
that when the Constitution was written most

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.320
other countries were still ruled by kings,
emperors, and sultans, so we needed a single

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.780
person to do the negotiating. He also has
the advantage of being “the decider” on

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.039
crucial issues, which may be good or bad depending
on whether or not you like his decisions.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.150
But the president, like John Green, is only
one man, so most of the day-to-day work of

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.250
foreign policy is relegated to bureaucrats.
Like most of the day-to-day work of Crash

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.080
Course is relegated to bureaucrats like me,
and Stan, and Zulaiha, and Raoul, and Brandon,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.370
and Thought Cafe, oh this isn’t the credits
let’s move on.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.530
Diplomatic work is handled mainly by the State
Department, but they get a lot of help from

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.900
the defense department and the intelligence
gathering agencies like the CIA, NSA, and

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.840
DHS. After all, you want to have as much information
as you can before you sit down at the table

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.800
to negotiate. Unless you are negotiating the
size and shape of the table. Which has happened.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.600
Congress has a role in foreign policy but it's a
limited one, and that’s probably a good thing.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.850
The Senate has the constitutional power to
ratify treaties, but since a 2/3 vote is required,

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.250
the president will often try to create foreign
policy with executive agreements that only

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.690
require a majority vote in both houses, which
is usually easier to secure, especially recently.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.580
One way Congress has a big role to play in
foreign policy through its power of the purse.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.979
It takes money to pursue a policy, and it
takes a purse to hold money. And especially

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.819
in the area of defense Congress appropriates
a lot of it. Money not purses. Contrary to

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.069
popular belief, though, Congress hasn’t
budgeted a lot of money for other types of

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:52.270
foreign policy, especially aid to foreign
nations.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.020
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
[cries] I’m going to miss you.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.620
Congressional committees, like those on foreign
relations can provide some expertise, but

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.590
not as much as bureaucracies, because Congressmen
still have to spend a lot of time running

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.310
for re-election and usually those elections
don’t hinge on their knowledge of foreign affairs.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.960
They can also try to limit the executive branch’s
authority through hearings like the one that

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.590
targeted the State Department’s handling
of the Benghazi incident, but these don’t

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.690
usually effect business as usual at the bureaucracy,
although they may force a few resignations.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.729
Congress at times does try to assert a foreign policy power like it recently did with Iran’s nuclear deal.

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:28.590
But it takes a hot-button issue like Iranian
nuclear weapons to garner enough public attention

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.090
for Congress to wade into foreign policy like
this, and I think there’s a good argument

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.670
that they should stay out and leave it to
experts.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.590
Like me. I’m real good at Iranian nuclear
weapons dealing.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.800
For the state department and the president
to work directly with other countries, those

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.570
countries need to be confident that the deals
they hammer out won’t be undercut by congress.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.639
Fewer actors in this arena helps build predictability,
which is something you want, especially when

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.659
nuclear weapons are on the table… no matter
the table’s size or shape.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.319
Interest groups can play a role in foreign
policy in terms of shaping the agenda, but

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:01.159
they don’t do much of the work of crafting the
policies themselves. As with domestic policy, interest

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.200
groups are most effective when they are focused on a single issue, especially if that issue is narrow.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.729
Industry interests can lobby, sometimes vigorously,
for trade deals, and labor groups often lobby

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:13.940
against them. Since foreign policy often involves
foreign nations, you tend to find ethnically

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.700
based interest groups that can often lobby very vocally, as some Irish-Americans did during the 1980s.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.919
Interest groups that coalesce around issues
have been growing in importance, especially

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:25.559
as communication technologies enable them
to get their message to a wider audience and

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.320
to organize grassroots lobbying efforts.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.160
In general environmental groups are more effective
at organizing demonstrations and human rights

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.469
groups are more effective at lobbying, but
especially in the environmental arena it’s

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:37.360
difficult to see where their efforts have
caused major policy shifts.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.560
Because there aren’t that many foreign policy
bureaucrats it should be easy for lobbyists

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.310
to influence them, but the President, who
is often the last word on foreign policy is

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.930
kind of difficult to lobby. He’s a busy
guy.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.390
There is a lot more I could say about foreign
policy, but this is a good place to stop,

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.680
because I’ve mentioned the structural aspects
of foreign policy – the branches of government

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.750
and how they make it – and some of the political
elements that can influence it.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.390
And we’ll talk about more of it in a later
episode.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.420
No we won’t! This is the last episode!

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.610
Foreign policy affects all Americans in ways
that other policies don’t. And at least

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.540
as far as security policy goes, keeping Americans
safe from external threats is one thing that

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.860
almost all Americans, from both ends of the
spectrum, agree on.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.060
I hope this series on American government
and politics provided you with a little bit

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.980
of understanding about the way the U.S. works
and that it encourages everyone to participate

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.600
in the political process, wherever you live.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:28.220
Except for you, you stupid eagle!
