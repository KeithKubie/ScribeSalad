00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.566
When I was in grade school,

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.142
I looked up to my father and my grandfather

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:12.873
who were both lawyers,

00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:14.339
and so when I was really young,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.002
I think I sort of just thought

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:20.149
that I would somehow move and follow in their path

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.546
and become a lawyer.

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:23.256
But as I got older,

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:26.502
I started to get a lot more interested in technology,

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:29.230
so when I was in my teenage years

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.713
and in high school,

00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:33.430
I realized that there was huge opportunity

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.099
and that's where the world was going,

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:39.088
that computers were soon going to be everywhere,

00:00:39.088 --> 00:00:41.703
and we needed the software

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:43.593
and the technology to evolve.

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:48.004
That led me into the world of software and technology

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.112
and building tools and the Internet.
