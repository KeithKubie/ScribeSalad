00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.500
&gt;&gt; Angel Vu: All right.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.800
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.420
Thank you so much for
coming and joining us here

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.750
at the Library on this
beautiful day.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.640
My name is Angel Vu and I'm
one of the reference librarians

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.090
in the Business Section
of the Science, Technology

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.300
and Business Division at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.360
Along with my colleague,
Sean Bryant,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.770
one of the reference librarians
for the Science Section,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
we're pleased to welcome you
to today's program titled,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.410
"Feeding Wild Birds in
America, a Surprising History."

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.470
For those who cannot join us today,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.200
the Library is recording today's
presentation and it will be posted

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.790
on the Library's website
in a couple of months.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.650
Meantime we'd like to
invite you to visit Science

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.430
and Business Reference Services
web pages, as well as our blog,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.080
"Inside Atoms," to keep abreast of
upcoming lectures and other works.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.290
And should you wish to
receive announcements from us,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.380
please visit loc.gov and click on

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.730
So today's speakers are Paul
Baicich and Margaret Barker.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.080
They are going to discuss
their book, "Feeding Wild Birds

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.710
in America: Culture,
Commerce, and Conservation."

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.140
This book is the product of years
of research along with co-author,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.210
Carrol L. Henderson, which is
a Minnesota wildlife biologist.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.680
This book is going to explore
how the simple practice

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.070
of bird feeding is linked to the
early bird preservation movement

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.920 position:56%
of the late 1800's and early 1900's,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.920
and how in recent decades
it has become a multibillion

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.980
dollar business.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.070
Thanks to a eureka movement,
and an odd little book

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.430
on hand taming wild birds,

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.860
and the Cold War agriculture
espionage today's standard bird

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.780
feeding tools such as
tube feeders, Nyjer seeds,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.040
and black oil sunflower seed
are on the market today.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.530
So the authors are going to
reveal how this popular hobby

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.260
over the decades have helped change
Americans' attitudes towards the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.550
natural world.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.150
Paul Baicich's teenage birding
days in New York City led

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.190
to a bird oriented career.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.980
Currently he is a bird and
conservation writer and editor,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.420
as well as an avid
tourism consultant.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.260
Most recently he has led
birding trips to Cuba.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.940
Formerly with the American Birding
Association, he is co-author of,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:12.160
"A Guide to the Nests, Eggs, and
Nestlings of North American Birds."

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.790
He co-edits the popular monthly
"Birding Community E-Bulletin."

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.430
Margaret Barker is
a Tennessee native.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.480 position:56%
She is a writer, speaker, and
educator in the Chesapeake Bay area.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.140
She interned in the Washington,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.640
D.C. office of the National Audubon
Society before joining the Cornell

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.990
Lab of Ornithology.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:43.840
There she coordinated the
Cornell Lab's Project Feeder Watch

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.250
and later worked with Cornell
University's agriculture outreach

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.530
gardening program.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.320
She is co-author of "The Feeder
Watcher's Guide to Bird Feeding,"

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.660
and the "Audubon Bird House Book."

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.290
So without further ado I'd like to
introduce you our speakers today,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.510
Paul Baicich and Margaret Barker.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.230
[ Applause ]

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.020
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Well,
thank you very much, Angel.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.420
And we are so glad to be here at
the Library of Congress and here

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.860
in the Mary Pickford Theater, wow.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.820
And, again, thanks very much
to Angel Vu and Sean Bryant

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.180
in the Science, Technology,
and Business Division.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.250
It has been so great to work with
you guys the past couple of months.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.050
You've taken care of everything
and thank you very much.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.430
And thanks also, and I don't
know if she's here right now,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.740
but to Rosemary Haynes in
the Motion Picture Division.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.560
She helped us with
our research here.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.000
And we'll have more on
that in just a little bit.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.580
And thanks to all of you for
joining us for a lunchtime talk.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.680
We appreciate it.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.280
Well, in the middle of this slide
here you can see our co-author,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.390
Carrol Henderson, surrounded
by many,

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.020
many types of bird
feeders he makes himself.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.880
Carrol is the head of
the non-game division

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.950
for the Minnesota Department
of Natural Resources.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.150
And some of you might know his
books, his conservation work,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.830
his media interviews
on NPR, and elsewhere.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.080
And Paul and I are very
proud to be his co-authors.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.660
So our talk is about the
surprising history of bird feeding

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.100
because when we began our
research for a Wild Bird Centers

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.230
of America pamphlet we were
surprised by what we found.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.600
It turns out that the story of bird
feeding is a conservation story and

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.900
yet it is also one of big business.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.460
Bird feeding is a lot more that
giving wild birds yummy treats

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.970
like peanut butter pine
cones you see here.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.840
Bird feeding today is
important economically

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.320
but it also helps people
connect to the natural world.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.420
It caught on in the late 1800's
and has grown more popular

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.590
over the years, even
becoming a family tradition

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.710
over generations as
in my own family.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.140
The reasons to feed
wild birds and the ways

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.540
to feed them have changed
considerably.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.640
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: We're at a
point today where the popularity

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.870
of feeding birds is pervasive.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.490
Well, how many people are
actually feeding birds

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.970 position:56%
or watching birds in their backyard?

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.760
According to the 2011 National
Survey on Fishing, Hunting,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.930
and Wildlife Associated Recreation
from the Fish and Wildlife Service,

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.820
there are about 41.3 million
people who engage in some level

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.920
of watching birds in their
backyard and feeding them.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.850
It's a huge, it is impressive,
and it continues to grow.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.550
How has it grown?

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.090
Let's compare the figures, if you
would, between the 2006 survey

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.720
on Fishing, Hunting, and
Wildlife Associated Recreation

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.650
and the 2011 survey.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.950
Well, we see here, in terms of the
amount of bird food sold in 2006,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.770
it was about 3.35 billion, with a
B, in the United States and even

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:42.590
after the Great Recession in 2011
it had increased to $4.6 billion.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.320
Using your seventh grade
math you can figure out that

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.060
that was an increase
of 21.4 percent.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.690
Similarly, parallel side in
terms of feeders, bird boxes,

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:02.820
and bird baths we went from
$790 million worth of commerce

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:08.450
in 2006 to 970 million in 2011.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:13.030
A concomitant parallel
increase of about 22.8 percent.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.710
Social scientists, of course,
find this very comforting

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.570 position:56%
when the figures seem to correspond.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.970
Yes, there are 41.3 million
backyard bird watchers.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.390
And it's significant.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.440
What does the backyard
bird yard look like?

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.800
Well, the birds favor a bird
friendly environment including

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.210
native plants particularly in the
yard, a broad selection of feeders,

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:43.140
nest boxes to supplant missing
cavities in dead branches.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.040
Of course if there's a dead
branch hanging over your home,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.460
you don't want it there
so you take it down.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.010
That's decreasing habitat
for birds, by the way.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.640
So you can supplement that
by putting up a bird box

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.650
so those woodpeckers, chickadees,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.530
and nuthatches can
find places to nest.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.140
They nest in cavities.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.590
There's a tendency toward
less lawn, less pesticides,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.590
and more ground cover when
you're dealing with this kind

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.000
of bird friendly backyard.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.640
It is important to appreciate

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.340
that bird feeding is not
necessary for the birds.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.350
Bird feeding is not for the birds.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.650
It's for us.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.050
They can do well without
our feeding.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.660
It is enjoyment for us human beings

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.910
to bring them closer
to us in the backyard.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.150
It is supplemental to what they
get in the native situation,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.420
in the natural situation.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.810
There are only two exceptions:
If there is a severe drought

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.140
in a dry area, or if there's
an increasingly hostile

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.410
and heavy snow cover and ice where
the birds can't get to the ground.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:51.220
Then you indeed may have some
impact on the local population.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.220
But by and large it's for
us more than it is for them.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:02.820
So our book, and indeed
our talk, will cover decade

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.170
by decade coverage, mostly
the twentieth century,

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.400
basically from the 1890's
into our twenty-first century.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.870
We cover the start of bird
feeding in the late 1800's,

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:18.380 position:56%
the bird preservation movement which
followed that; the discoveries of

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.400
and innovations of the
nineteen teens and the 1920's;

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.460
experimentation during hard times
in the Depression and World War II;

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.950
growth of postwar America
prosperity: The backyard,

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.630
the barbeque, the garden,
the bird feeding scene;

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.240
trial and error period of the
60's; growth in the 70's and 80's;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.580
as well of the development of
a multi-million-dollar industry

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.060
into the twenty-first century.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.680
So we'll start with the late
1800's and early 1900's.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.010
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Well, today we
have laws protecting wild birds,

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:01.490
importantly the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act signed in 1918.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:06.200
But in the late 1800's
U.S. birds were in trouble.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.870
Backyard birds like cardinals could
be caged and sold as song birds.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.750
Birds were killed for their
feathers for women's hats and more.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.810
And species of all
kinds were on the menu.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.960
And they were over hunted.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.160
Scientists studied birds'
economic value and usefulness.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.790
Bird feeding helped teach people
about their bird neighbors.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.460
And the case was made that
if you feed good birds,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.810
they'll return the favor and
stay around your home and farm

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.290
and eat weed seeds
and harmful insects.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.540
Professor Beal, in
the U.S. Department

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:49.800 position:56%
of Agriculture's Biological Survey
Division, documented what birds ate.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:55.010
His "Farmer's Bulletin Number
54" was in print for many years.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.790
His colleague, Waldo McAtee,
summed up Beal's importance

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.600
to birds this way: "He did
more than any other man

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.930
to reveal the basic facts that were
needed to convince the so-called

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.230
"practical" men of the
value of bird protection."

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.780
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: As
Margaret just indicated,

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.220
this economic ornithology,
as it was called,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.130
was connected to agriculture.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.680
There were good birds
and there were bad birds.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.410
There were birds that
were advantageous

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.560
to the farmer and disadvantageous.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.780
And it's important to appreciate

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.030
that primitive attitude
towards science and the economy

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.140
in comparison to what we do today.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.510
And part of the change occurred
during the bird preservation

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:43.740
movement, that birds, in and
of themselves, had value.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.090
The movement to ban the trade
of birds, and to save them,

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:54.600
and to make sure that they were
persistent into the future rotated

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:00.550
around the effort to ban the
feather trade in particular.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.470
Florence Merriam Bailey is a good
characteristic and representative

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.780 position:56%
of that woman's movement by and
large and representative of the era.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:13.670
In 1886, as a student at Smith
College in Massachusetts,

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:19.600
she recruited hundreds of
her colleagues, young women,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.350
to form an Audubon Society
to stop the feather trade.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.010
By thirteen years later she
had matured to such a level

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.450
that when she moved to Washington,
D.C., with her brother, here,

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.440
Washington, D.C., her brother
by the way was C. Hart Merriam,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.730
who headed the U.S. Biological
Survey, the predecessor

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.530
to Fish and Wildlife Service.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.500
She was able in 1898 to lead
classes here in Washington,

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.930
D.C. about the value of
birds and the appreciation.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:51.350
And that very same year she
had published "Birds of Village

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:57.120
and Field," which introduced
many, many people to the interest

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.040
and curiosity of bird life and
the possibility of feeding them.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.220
The same time her female
colleagues such as [Inaudible],

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.190
Mabel Osgood Wright, and Oliver
Thorne Miller were doing similar

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.400
and parallel activities.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.300
The bird preservation
movement stopped the slaughter

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.310
with the 1900 Lacey Act.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.180 position:56%
They were successful and, by the
way, this was a woman's led movement

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.260
when the women didn't even
have the right to vote.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.990
In this effort to adorn female garb

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.540
with feathers the entire bird
was killed, in this case, egrets,

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.860
for one plume of the hat.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.970
The destruction of
colonies, because these kinds

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.660
of feathers only appeared when
birds were in breeding plumage,

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.720
the entire destruction
of colonies and the death

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.630
of young were a byproduct of that.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:56.600
But it stopped with the passage
of the Lacey Act of 1900.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.470
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: So the study
of living birds got a lot easier

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.500
with the development of
opera and field glasses,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.690
cameras, and handy field guides.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.330
A 1907 book published by
Massachusetts ornithologist,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.780
Edward Howe Forbush,
was widely distributed.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.720
"Useful Birds and their Protection"
included his family's bird feeding

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.760
practices and reasons
to protect the birds.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.150
And also importantly in 1900,

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:29.320
the Christmas Bird Count
began and it continues today.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.490
Instead of killing as many birds
as possible on Christmas Day,

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.550
which was a tradition,
people counted them instead.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:42.430
Feeder birds are a
part of these counts.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:49.450
And during our research we kept
coming across the name, Berlepsch.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:54.030
There were Berlepsch food
sticks, Berlepsch food houses

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.120
and feeders of all kinds.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.820
So who was this guy?

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.800
He was Hans Friar Von Berlepsch.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.820
He lived until 1933.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.840
He was a German aristocrat
known as "the bird man."

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.710
And he managed his family's
centuries-old estate

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.800
of Sebock [phonetic]
near Essen, Germany.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.030
And he experimented
with wild bird feeding.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.230
U.S. Audubon Chapters printed
a book on his practices

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:27.190
and in this way spread the bird
feeding word among members.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.640
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: You can
see here, by the way,

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.960
an image of one his colleagues
pouring melted suet onto evergreen

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.590
or blocks, how to make suet blocks.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.280
And these are molds in this case.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.700
Or this interesting kind of
gravity feeder that he had.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:53.820
In any case, Berlepsch's ideas
were picked up, as Margaret said,

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.180
by Americans, translated,
distributed.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:03.310
And one of the people who picked it
up was Waldo Lee McAtee who worked

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.090
for the Department of Agriculture.

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:11.060 position:56%
In this, probably the first bulletin
done by the United States government

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.580
on attracting and feeding birds.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:18.630
It's Department of Agriculture
Bulletin, number 621, entitled,

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.920
"How to Attract Birds in
Northeastern United States."

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.050
And you see the figure, the image

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.180
of a chickadee coming
to somebody's hand.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.330
It was done in 1914.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:34.810 position:56%
And he pointed to certain advantages
to putting, say, an edge or a trim

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:41.150
around the tray feeder at your
window, or filling up cans,

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.730
opened at both ends, with
stuffed suet and just birdseed,

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:51.590
a combination of that, or, in
this case, in the middle here,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.760
a hollowed out coconut opened
at both ends where suet

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.650
and birdseed would be stuffed.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.320
McAtee said that the size of
the hole was very important

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.970
and it would, in his words,

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:12.610
"The size of the hole regulates
the character of the guests."

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:16.560
He worked on even more
elaborate designs: Food hoppers,

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.950
not unlike those used to feed
domestic birds such as chickens.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.000
More on coconuts later.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.050
McAtee also, in the discussion
of this standard feeding tray,

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:34.040 position:56%
which we came across multiple times
from the early 1900's into the 20's,

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.100
would be a flat tray,
they all looked the same,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.350
a flat tray with a trim,
and a hopper feeder here

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.900
that was developed out of the
design for feeding chickens.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.710
And sometimes it would have a brace

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.940
which you could lower during the
summertime, non-feeding time.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.820
And they would all have de
riguer branch of evergreen

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.770
which somehow would attract
the birds and keep them happy.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:06.230
He would also design,
suggest designs,

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:11.090
for fences to keep cats away,
as you see in the center here.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.020
And those things which we
know commonly now for feeders

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.310
and for bird boxes, predator guards

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.450
to keep squirrels and
other predators out.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:26.800
By the nineteen teens, late teens,
early 20's, we have the magazine

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.630
of the era, of the bird watching
era, "Bird Lore," as it was called,

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.640
the predecessor to Audubon.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.690
In 1913 we have here some of
the first advertising coming up.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.910
This is Joseph Dodson's bird feeder

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:44.190 position:56%
and his very useful banish the
sparrow, banish the English sparrow,

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.950
the house sparrow trap to get rid
of them, these invading immigrants

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.430
that had come over to the United
States and had been released.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.220
You'll notice here

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.280
in this particular image
the weather vane feeder

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.560
with these paddles that stick out.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.470
They would help rotate the feeder
with the wind, like a weather vane,

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.410
to keep the seed from blowing out.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.160
It was a characteristic
design that appeared

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.200
at least through the 1940's.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.860
You'll also see here, speaking of
house sparrows or English sparrows,

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.420
Saunders' 1917 anti-house
sparrow feeder.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.810
It was attracted to some birds

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.260
but it would discourage house
sparrows, English sparrows.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:32.050
It would be an upside down
situation with kind of a design

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.430
that would look like a squared
off wooden frying pan held upside

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:40.740
down with the seed in this
little bay area and attractive,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.310
the birds that could be
attracted would be more desirable

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.270
than the house sparrows
that couldn't get in there.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.460
Next we have at the same
period a poster, Margaret.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.890
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Well, we had
seen this 1917 poster mentioned

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.770
in "Bird Lore Magazine," and
finally found it, finally,

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.860
in the National Archives.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.300
It was printed, no surprise,
by the U.S. Department

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.000
of Agriculture Bureau
of Biological Survey.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.360
You can see here there's that
weather vane feeder again

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.070
and you see that so
often during this period.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.350
There's some wonderful
quotes on here, too.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:22.390
"If you feed the birds, they will
repay you by destroying thousands

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.500
of insects that harm
gardens, trees, and crops."

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.860
And, this is the one I really like,
"Begin to feed the birds today.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.550
The singing laborer is
worthy of his hire."

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.800
So of the times.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.680
This is an image from the 1917
Edison Studios silent film we found

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.480
here at the Library of
Congress and wherever you are,

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.070
thank you again, Rosemary Haynes.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.750
The film shows Boy Scouts
helping birds in winter

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:58.070
and here is a Boy Scout with a
homemade coconut feeder once again.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.860
And we're excited to
show this rare short film

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.810
at the end of our talk today.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.470
People in hard times, people
had to feed their families

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:14.130
but many still could find
the means to feed the birds.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.550
This poster is from a Feed
the Birds campaign launched

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.260
by the Federal Cartridge
Corporation.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:26.980 position:56%
And here's is a 1935 "Bird Lore" ad.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.650
You can see Berlepsch
inspired feeders as well

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.160
as some simple suet feeders.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.230
But note the little
trolley, or pulley feeder,

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.920
that would fit onto a clothesline.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.180
And a special note, anyone

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:49.520 position:56%
who bought these items might be
interacting with Roger Tory Peterson

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.800
who ran this Audubon Department
when he was 27 years old

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.350
and had recently written
his now classic field guide.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.860
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Then we
move to another popular crop

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.340
of the early 1900's which was hemp.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.410
Hemp was a common bird seed.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.440
That is cannabis, mentioned even in
that 1917 poster that we just saw,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.070
and it was commonly available
at agricultural feed stores.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:21.810
It was used, hemp was used,
to make cloth, paper, rope,

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:27.070
today even in some places luggage,
and auto parts, believe it or not.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:32.330
This is not to be confused with
the variety of psychoactive hemp

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:37.670
but it was very low in THC

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.110
and it was extremely desirable
for birds, the seed was.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:46.520
Of course the very effort of
the 1937 congressional action

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.230
against hemp made this
more difficult to get

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.840
but it had a revival in World War
II when, if you're interested,

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.700
the Department of Agriculture
in the war effort,

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.880
pushed the increased
production of hemp,

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.200
particularly for our
United States Navy

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.610
for making their rope and cordage.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:09.400
It got so great that farmers
in particularly Kentucky

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:15.650
and Wisconsin started with about
14,000 acres of hemp being grown

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:23.710
in 1942 to 146,000 acres in 1943.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:28.720
The vast increase to
help the war effort.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.910
You can Google "Hemp for
Victory," by the way, under YouTube

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.770
and see the 14 minute film yourself

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.440
which I reviewed this
morning before my talk.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.310
Also during the war there was
very much activity in the terms

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.800
of rationing and this had
an impact on bird feeding.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.480
People were giving their
extra suet, their beef fat,

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.870
over to the war industry.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.020
For what? For munitions.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.780
So you were less than patriotic if
you were feeding suet to the birds

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.430
but more patriotic is
you were handing it

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.070
over to the community
collections to help the war effort.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.440
Similarly, sugar with hummingbird
feeders was hard to come

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.270
by because sugar was rationed.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.870
So there was some controversy
and some dismay over using sugar

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.810
for your coffee, what little
you had, for yourself or sharing

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.020
with the birds in your
hummingbird feeder.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.210
Rationing in World War II
however, in the positive side

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.570
if you could look at it in terms
of the birds view, was peanuts

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.430
and peanut butter wasn't rationed.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.640
So peanuts and peanut butter
became extremely popular,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.930
both in the backyard and in the
lunchbox on the home front, and,

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:45.690
by the way, among C-rations with
our boys overseas at the time.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.730 position:56%
It was not rationed and it so became
extremely popular so by the end

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.470
of the war it was an
established staple,

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.850
that is to say peanut butter
was an established staple.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.150
And those of us who grew

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.650
up as post-war baby boomers
suffered the consequences.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.160
Next.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Arm and Hammer
baking soda bird cards promoted bird

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.510
feeding and bird study.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:13.000
They were printed from the
late 1800's until 1938.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.350
In 1976 the company printed
a special birds of prey set

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.950
and I invite you to go and
see Paul's poster over here

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.460
where he's got the entire
collection in one poster.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.450
And it's quite something to see.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:32.200
The cards are very
collectible now, by the way.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.670
And what we're showing here is a
male downy woodpecker on a piece

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:40.180
of suet that is simply
tied to a tree

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:46.040
which is the way suet was
offered quite often in those days.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:52.860
Well, Duncraft has made bird
feeding products since the 1950's.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:58.590
And Gildon's [phonetic] wartime
aviation experience, you can see,

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.980
inspired this flight
deck window feeder.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:07.250
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: By the
1960's we're dealing

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:13.280
with seeds now being sold away
from the agricultural scene,

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.620
away from those warehouses
and onto grocery stores.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.550
A and P, Safeway, Food
Fair, Kroger's,

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:26.570
and others started actually having
packaged birdseed, mixed seed,

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.080
not necessarily the best
quality but certainly available

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.760
to the general public to correspond
with the growth of suburbia.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.170
This is an ad from
the November-December

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:45.150
"Audubon Magazine" here, Hyde
feeders and it was sponsored

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.730
by the Hyde Feeder
Company of Waltham,

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.910
Massachusetts, run by Don Hyde.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:55.070 position:56%
You'll notice also in the upper
left-hand corner the characteristic,

00:27:55.070 --> 00:28:02.360
Flint Stone-esque image here of a
cartoon character watching birds.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.580
I also have put in
here the house finch,

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.480
a bird that was accidentally
released in the New York City area,

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.740
Long Island in the 1940's and
spread throughout the east.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.290
And I put this in because
its spread in the 1960's

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.540
and 70's was chronicled
by feeder watchers,

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.870
people who started noticing these
strange birds at their feeder

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.900
that they hadn't expected before.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.120
We also have here the rise in
the 70's and 80's of the first

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.390
of the franchise companies
of birdseed specialty stores,

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.770 position:56%
namely Wild Birds Unlimited, founded
in 1981, and Wild Bird Centers

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.530
of America, founded in 1985.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.660
The first Wild Birds
Unlimited run by Jim Carpenter,

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.820
the second by George Petrides whom
Margaret mentioned at the beginning

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.690
of the talk who originally helped
us get our project started.

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.420
And there are many, many,
many independent stores

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.750
around the country today
selling lots of seed and products

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.260
for the backyard bird scene.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.050
At the same time we have the
bird seed preference period

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.350
of the 70's and 80's.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.050
This is a photo of Dr. Alred Guise

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.180
at the Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:24.880
He published a bird food
preferred study, a study in 1980.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.650
He tested about 15-16
different kinds of seeds

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:34.000
and it was the first serious
study of bird preference,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.790
whether they liked
oats, wheat, rice,

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.930
sunflower, milo, millet, whatever.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:45.540
In the words of George Petrides,
who found the Wild Bird Centers

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.270
of America, "Before Al Guise picked

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:52.740
up his pen no one knew what
wild birds really liked to eat."

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.250
He did a great job doing that.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.130
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Since
the 1980's, the late 1980's,

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.770
Project Feeder Watch has been
a joint citizens-science effort

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.980
of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.130
and Canada's Long Point
Bird Observatory.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.930
A National Science Foundation grant

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:16.260
in the early 1990's expanded the
project and developed this poster

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.960
for quick feeder bird
ID and tens of thousands

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.190
of these have been printed.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:30.440
We found in our research that
sunflower, and Nyjer seeds,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.780
and hummingbird, and tube feeders
are relatively new arrivals,

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.560
each with intriguing back stories.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.670
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: First
story is on sunflower seeds.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.900
We're going to go through
each of these four stories.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.430
This is a picture on the
right of Dick Baldwin,

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:53.130
who worked in the Minnesota area
for Cargill Corporation, looking up

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.690
and researching seeds
and certain plants.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:01.580 position:56%
He was smart enough to ask for
permission to visit the Soviet Union

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:07.890
in the 1960's to examine what
Vasillii Stepanovich Pustovoit,

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.810
shown here, was doing

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.010
at his remarkably successful
breeding program

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:17.100 position:56%
of an industrial scale at Krasnodar.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.350
What he was doing there was
modifying, and developing,

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:25.150
and genetically pushing along the
sunflower seeds, sunflower seeds

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.040
that were highly rich in oil,

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.640
much richer than any seeds
available in the United States.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.430
In the United States we
had about, oil at the time

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.750
of the gray stripe
traditional seeds,

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:41.180
of about 28 percent oil before
Dick went to visit Pustovoit

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:47.740 position:56%
in the Soviet Union he heard that it
might be 38 or 40 percent richness.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.880
And indeed Pustovoit himself
had been recognized but by two

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.270
of the Soviet Union's highest
award, the Order of Lenin

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.800
and the Red Banner of Labor.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.160
And Pustovoit was a
national hero of national

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.390
and international significance.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:07.570
What he had developed, and Dick was
looking at, was this darker oil.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:12.480
When Dick was taken
through the industrial farms

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.520
at Krasnodar he was shocked to see

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:21.790
that these small black seeds
had about 44 percent oil.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:26.830
And as the tour went on he and
his Soviet colleagues were --

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.960
actually Soviet colleagues
and the translator --

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.820
were basically chewing and eating
this oil rich seed and spitting

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.640
out the shells and he was horrified

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.610
to see this rich stuff
being used so freely.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.930
He asked of course if he could
take a sample to the United States

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:47.010 position:56%
and was told that it was essentially
a state secret, he could not do so.

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:48.880
He was horrified even more.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.410
When he went back to his limousine
[inaudible] with his translator

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:57.380
to go back to the railroad
station to take him back

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.600
to Moscow his translator wrapped up
her package of seeds in her napkin

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.000
and slipped it over to Dick.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.880 position:56%
Dick went to the embassy in Moscow
and shipped it in a diplomatic pouch

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.330
to Fargo, North Dakota,
and the rest is history.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.690
So much for sunflower seeds.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.190
I bet you didn't know about that.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:20.990
It's all in the book.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.290
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Nyjer seed.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:26.140
Nyjer seed is not thistle seed.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.720
Branding it thistle is marketing.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.860
Maybe because gold
finches look really good

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.420
on purple flowers, I don't know.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:39.080
The spelling was changed
to N-y-j-e-r

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.230
to avoid pronunciation
of a racial epithet.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:48.160
Alfred Martin's 1963 book, "Hand
Taming Wild Birds at the Feeder,"

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.720
described feeding Nyjer,
a caged bird seed

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.780
at the time, to his
backyard finches.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:01.880
And he said, and he said in print
that, "They absolutely loved it."

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.110
So Nyjer was first imported
for wild birds a few years

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.320
after Martin's book.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.380
It comes mostly from Ethiopia
and India where it is grown

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.720
for cooking oil, and the
cage, and wild bird markets.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.940
It is heat treated for not just
weeds when it enters the U.S., and,

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:27.210
in fact, up in Baltimore there
is a small sterilization plant.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.230
Maryland ornithologist -- some
of you might have known him,

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:34.120
John Dennis, promoted bird feeding.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.500
And he promoted feeding
Nyjer in his 1975 book,

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.660
"A Complete Guide to Bird Feeding."

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:47.960
And he clearly states there
that Nyjer is not thistle.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.340
Recently many of us have
put up hummingbird feeders

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.340
because the hummers are back.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.880
It has taken decades to
develop hummingbird feeders

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.770
and sugar water recipes
we use today.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:10.780
Early feeding accounts include
one about John James Audubon

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.460
at a Louisiana plantation in
1821 watching hummingbirds

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.680
at flowers filled with
sweetened wine.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:23.350
An 1899 "Bird Lore" article
describes Clark University

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.140
professor, Clifton Hodge,
entertaining his students

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.990
by attracting a hummer to flowers
he had sprinkled with honey

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.130
and hidden in his jacket pocket.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.910
In the late 1920's, retired banker,
Ben Tucker, and wife, Dorothy Mae,

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.240
started feeding hummers on
their twelve acre property

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.580
in Orange County, California.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:50.990
Here's Mr. Tucker in his
shop, building a bird house.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:55.280
But he built hummer feeders, too.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.400
The first ones were prohibition
era happy hour glasses with holes

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.950
in tin lids just right
for hummingbirds.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:10.190
Local birders visited the Tucker's
famous outside hummingbird bar

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:15.830
to sip cocktails and watch as many
as 200 hummingbirds at a time.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:21.090
An improved Tucker design was a
globe shaped chicken water fountain

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.830
with a wire rail added
for hummer perching.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.110
This was a popular design
for a while created in 1928

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.450
by the husband of Edith Webster.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.880
He used a glass mixing
tube from his lab

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:40.380
at MIT an attached
open spouts on the end.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:45.530
Edith tasted all the flowers in
her New Hampshire yard to come

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:50.460
up with a one part sugar
to two parts water recipe.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:54.800
Today's standard mix is one
part sugar to four parts water

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.740
which is more like nectar flower.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.110
And today there are many new

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:05.370
and different hummingbird
feeder designs.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:10.670 position:56%
Here's Droll Yankees' classic Little
Flyer or Flying Saucer on the left

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:15.500
and Perky Pets' unique pinched
waist design on the right.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.880
Speaking of Droll Yankees.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.180
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Yes.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.480
We go next to tube feeders.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.700
This is a picture from the late
1980's of a fellow by the name

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.270
of Peter Kilham who founded
the company, Droll Yankees.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:32.420 position:56%
Peter was an inventor, an industrial
designer, and nature enthusiast.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:37.050
He had innovations
which later became the,

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:42.000
this feeder, the A6F feeder.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.510
But he had also worked on teaching
art work, engaging custom design,

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:53.600
creating furniture,
high end furniture.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.620
He had a number of
industrial machines

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.980
and received multiple patents.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.790
He was a kind of do-it-all fellow.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:05.580
His little company, launched
in 1960, Droll Yankees,

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:12.630
was based at his wharf
situated workshop.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.930
And it basically had sold records.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:21.000
Some of you may remember
those round objects, records.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.740
They were novelty records.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.810
It included Yankee
storytelling and the recordings

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:31.920
of birds, frogs, and tugboats.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:37.080
One afternoon after working
with a colleague of his

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.350
at the Rhode Island
School of Design,

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:45.760
he was helping his colleague do
some elaborate modern art display

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.350
of structure.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.420
I think it was in a lobby at RISD.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:57.040
There was leftover plastic tubing.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.140
Of course he was told by his
colleague who was in charge

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.150
of the project, "Peter,
just go dispose of these.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:05.450
Get rid of them.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:06.750
It's extra."

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.760 position:56%
Having grown up in the Depression he
wasn't going to throw anything away

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.340
so he brought it back to his shop.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.880
He looked at it for about 20
minutes, scratched his head,

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.780
figured, "If I put a cap on the
top, a cap on the bottom of a foot

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.290 position:56%
and a half length, drill some holes,
put in some dowels, hand it up,

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.630
I can probably stuff
some bird seed in it

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.230
and it would become a bird feeder."

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:28.700
Indeed, voila, 1968-69
we have the A6F.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:36.140
Here's the patent, 1969 patent for
the feeder that we see everywhere.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.180
It's probably the most
common feeder.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:43.100
And it is relatively new in
terms of long term history.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.280
We'll go to, very quickly, the
collective wisdom and experience

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.340 position:56%
of 120 years, the five major lessons

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:53.070
that have been necessarily
accumulated.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:59.110
The story of bird feeding
reduced down to a bouillon cube,

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.330
or at least five bouillon cubes.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:05.190
Bird feeding in four seasons;
providing water in four seasons;

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:08.870 position:56%
offering a variety of food;
providing protection from predators;

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.760
and clean feeders and
ground areas regularly.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.010 position:56%
We show old fashioned stuff on the
left and the new stuff on the right.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:22.440
First, in terms of five ways of
feeding success, all four seasons.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.480
When we began this narrative it was
mainly feeding in the wintertime

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.060
and it still is mainly
feeding in the wintertime.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.340
But, you know, in Florida, in
Texas, and southern California,

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.360
and southeast Arizona wintertime
isn't as tough as it is up here

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.820
for some reason and they can feed
all year and they do feed all year.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.760
And they weren't just
limited to wintertime feeding,

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.900
indeed you'll notice that
the feeding has changed

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.840
from the old hopper feeder with the
requisite trim and evergreen here,

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:59.050
shown from the nineteen teen's,
to the feeder here in summertime

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.650
with multiple different kinds

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:04.430
of food including fruits
and different levels.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.030
Next.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.290
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Water of course
is essential for backyard birds

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.480
and it's fun to watch
them drink and bathe.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.740
Birdbaths go back as far as
the ancient Greeks and Romans.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.920
Water attracts more
than feeder species.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.950
You might find bathing
warblers, too, for example,

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:25.120
especially this time of year.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.540
Moving water especially
brings in the birds.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.410
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: The next way is to
provide protection from predators,

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.930
in this case -- oh, I'm sorry
-- the next case is -- .

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:39.240
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker:
Carrol's suggested backyard.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.780
This was developed by Carrol
Henderson, our co-author.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.690
You can see a black and
white image of a backyard

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:50.950
from about the 1920's on the left.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:54.950
And on the right is Carrol
Henderson's backyard.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:42:00.880
He says if you can do it and
you want to get a lot of birds,

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:06.280
use a total of twelve to fifteen
feeders of many different types

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:11.500
in groups of three to four each
and offer a wide range of foods

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:15.690
from different kinds of
seeds to suet, grape jelly,

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:21.980
apple and orange slices,
meal worms, and sugar water.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.640
&gt;&gt; Paul Biacich: Next indeed is to
provide protection from predators,

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.370
in this case, in one case, cats.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.800 position:56%
The picture on the left shows Tabby.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.120
This is Edward Howe Forbush's
experiment of putting a bird

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.810
that Tabby killed, a warbler, a
yellow warbler I believe it was,

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:43.490
around the neck of poor Tabby
to teach it a lesson and to keep

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:48.560 position:56%
that dead, stinking bird around
Tabby's neck for days, if not weeks.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.870
Needless to say, it didn't work.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:56.700
But Forbush, in 1960, wrote the
classic piece, "The Domestic Cat:

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.750
Bird killer, mouser, and
destroyer of wildlife.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.750
Means of utilizing
and controlling it."

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.760
Well, there's decent
ways to control it.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.230
One method is to maintain a
ten foot clearance around sites

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.800
that are hiding place free in
terms of a ten foot clearance

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.320
around your bird feeders.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.400
The opposite is to encircle
the site with wire fencing.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.680
That keeps the bird feeder
from becoming a cat feeder.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.890
Similarly, the next case
is to provide protection

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:29.870
from predators using
good brush piles,

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:34.070
offering the birds quick
escapes from sky borne perils,

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.090
either Cooper's hawks

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:38.730
or Sharp-shinned hawks
visiting the feeders.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.990
Birds do take readily
to these brush piles.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:47.840
And if you keep the brush piles,
again, away from the feeders,

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.270
about ten feet away,
it also keeps them

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:53.410
from being hiding places for cats.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:58.230
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: The latest bird
feeder designs are easy to clean

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:02.620
and this is good news because
people who have been feeding birds

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.770
for a while know that some of
those feeders were very hard

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.830
to get really, really clean.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:10.520
Cleaning and disinfecting feeders

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.710
and bird baths routinely
is a best practice.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:18.910 position:56%
And remember to change out your
hummingbird sugar water nectar every

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:20.620
couple of days.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.650
Every few days will do.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:27.060
Bird feeding is important
today for many reasons.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.620
It's a good business.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.800
It's educational and entertaining.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.510
And it connects us to nature.

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:39.670
Over decades the hobby has taken
surprising twists and turns.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:44.140 position:56%
Carrol Henderson's bird feeding tips
build on the past to create safe

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:49.180
and successful bird feeding
in the twenty-first century.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:56.320
And we are going to leave you
with what we first sought here

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.540
at The Library of Congress,
the now digitized silent film,

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.470
"Caring for the Birds in Winter."

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:09.290
And we are going to find --

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.290
I might need Dappen's [assumed
spelling] help again --

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.570
that start button.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:15.910
There we go.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:17.210
All right.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:20.750
And this was made by
Edison's Studios.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.410
We saw reference to
it, found it here.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:28.120
Made by Edison's Studios,
produced by Howard Cleaves who was

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:32.650
at the Natural History Museum
there in Staten Island.

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:36.570
And it's mostly about Boy Scouts,

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.230
Boy Scouts caring for
the birds in winter.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:42.470
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: You will notice
the almost military doughboy look

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.710
of our World War I of these Boy
Scouts in the winter putting

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:49.120
in a pole, and putting a
feeder on top with the trim.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.600
Notice the standard trim.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.540
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker:
Nice sheltered feeder.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:02.080
Now keep your eyes on the kids
who are eating the peanuts.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.140
[ Laughter ]

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.940
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: And this
is a string of peanuts

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.320
which isn't a common practice
in the United States anymore.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.130
It's very common in Great
Britain to have string

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.310
of peanuts for the birds.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:14.710
And here they wrapped them around.

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:17.750
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: We think
that's a good bird feeder idea.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:27.880
So putting seed on the
platform feeder there.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.180
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Guests
arrive for dinner.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.510
Okay. Oh, there are that many.

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:32.810
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker:
They're thinking about it.

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:34.110
Oh, there's one.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Maybe juncos there.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:36.710
I can't -- it's hard to tell.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:38.010
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Yeah.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.310
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Ah.

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:40.610
And here comes a chickadee.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:41.910
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker:
Always the first.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:43.210
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Yeah.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:45.510
Black capped chickadee
on the peanuts.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:53.330
There's some white breasted
nuthatch I believe coming in.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:54.630
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Mm-hmm.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:57.590
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Upside
down as it's wont to do.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:00.330
Almost woodpecker like
but upside down.

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:05.360
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: The
camera liked this bird.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.350
And this is interesting to
see how this was put up.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:15.500
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: [Inaudible] like
I said, there's the trim and -- .

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.340
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Mm-hmm.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:19.690
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Another chickadee.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.080
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Mm-hmm.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.590
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Wish I could
tell what seed they were using.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:24.890
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Yeah.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.190
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: It's unclear.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.490
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Hard to see.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:28.790
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: There doesn't
seem to be any sunflower in there.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:31.060
Probably some hemp, folks.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.360
Coconut, here they're making,

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.330
here they're sawing the
coconut at both ends.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.710
And they're grinding
up the beef fat.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:38.770
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker:
Looks like a hard job.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.650
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: At least
they're not tasting it.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:44.310
Then they're going
to mix it with seed.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:47.350
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker:
Suet and ground peanuts.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:51.220
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: They
mix, stuffing it there.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.640
And hanging it up in the snow.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.940
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Yes.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.740
This is the image we
used in our book.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.530
Ta-da.

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:00.960
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: And it's
a red breasted nuthatch.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.260
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Mm-hmm.

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.560
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Coming.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:08.010
The size of the hull regulates
the quality of the guest.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:12.280
And for some reason they tossed
in this: People throwing in -- .

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.580
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Doesn't fit in.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.880
Maybe it's the benefactors.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.180
[ Laughter ]

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.210
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: They
made this all possible.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.510
And -- .

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:26.530
This was very common to
establish bird feeding stations,

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:33.880
community stations and run
by communities and Boy Scouts

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.210
in the woods or in
the village squares,

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:39.150
particularly in the New England.

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.830
We guess that this may have
been from upstate New York.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:45.980
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Now they're
going to create a snow feeder.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:50.960
Keep your eyes open for some boys
who fight with swords in here.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.450
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: They're
packing down the snow

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:59.600
so the seed doesn't
disappear into the -- .

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.150
And here we come -- .

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:02.450
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Juncos.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:03.750
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: More juncos, yep.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:05.270
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: And
this is close to the end.

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:11.410
Juncos look fed and the
film just kind of ends.

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:12.960
[Laughs].

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.410
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: As does our talk.

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:16.510
Thank you very much.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:19.070
[ Applause ]

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:23.080
&gt;&gt; Angel Vu: Thank you so
much, Margaret and Paul.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.500
That was fascinating.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.520
And now we're going to open
the floor up for any questions.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.360
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Great.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.660
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Yes.

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:34.180
&gt;&gt; I vaguely recall, maybe 30
years ago, reading that the spread

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:38.140
of feeding had some effect on,
for example, northern cardinals,

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.220
the winter range as far
as the north [inaudible].

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.140
Are there other dramatic
effects like that,

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.530
the distribution of animals?

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:47.390
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Well,
probably feeder-wise,

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:50.980
it's probably not dependent
on but it probably helps.

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:54.560
I would include -- cardinals
would be among the first

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.300
which would have been starting
over a hundred years ago

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.740
when they started moving north.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.100
But other southern birds that have
moved north and have been helped

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:08.570
by feeders have been tufted
titmouse, red bellied woodpecker,

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.740
and probably Carolina wren in so
far as that they come to suet.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.090
And the Carolina wrens
are an example

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:20.250
of blizzard threatened birds.

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:23.410
In New England when
it's a tough, tough,

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:27.370
tough winter the Carolina
wrens, having just reached,

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:32.340
"just" reached New England
maybe in the 1980's and 90's,

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:34.710
they're hammered back when
in very difficult winters

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:38.350
and it may take a few years or
half a decade for them to recover.

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:41.450
So in that case, you know, a
feeding station might be important

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:46.380
for your Carolina wrens if
you live in Vermont or Maine.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.870
But otherwise I don't think there's
much that we can attribute in terms

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:55.090
of northern spread
having to do with feeders.

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.420
I think there is a western spread

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.840
when we're dealing
with house finches.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.330
And I think house finches
have really been accelerated

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:08.800
and accommodated by feeding
stations as they've moved west.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.460
Margaret, do you have
anything to add there?

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.760
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Sounds good.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:16.520
I was going to mention Carolina
wren as really a dramatic example.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.040
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Yeah.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.350
Anyone else?

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:20.650
Yes.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:26.070
&gt;&gt; I was amused to see "Feed
the Birds Now" had been produced

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:28.670
by the National Cartridge.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:33.310
I mean, I always think
of cartridges and guns.

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:41.030
So I wondered if indeed they
were promoting feeding the birds

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:44.450
so they could shoot
the birds [inaudible].

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:45.750
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Yeah.

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:47.900
Federal Cartridge Corporation
was for many,

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:51.330
many years extremely
active in conservation,

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:58.410
perhaps mainly due toward
their rural base, their owners,

00:51:58.410 --> 00:51:59.830
the family that owned the company

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:01.740
and that still owns
the company I believe.

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:04.190
I'd have to ask Carrol that.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:07.770
And their interest in game birds,

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.990
mainly that game birds
be they grouse, or quail,

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:14.660
or pheasant would survive
through the winter if you fed.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.250
They had a whole series
of these PSA's,

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:20.240
public service announcements,
as ads.

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.130
They even had them, wisely enough
and this was very admirable,

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:28.430
they had them not to shoot the
hawks that visit your chicken yard

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:30.390
which was quite remarkable.

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:37.330
Indeed the arms and ammo
companies in 1911 were instrumental

00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:42.730 position:56%
in forming the Wildlife Management
Institute which was deeply committed

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:47.890
and has been deeply committed to
conservation from that avenue.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:49.190
And so it's very interesting.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.490
It's a good question.

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.490
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: And there
was community bird feeding going

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:55.560
on so groups of people would
get together and go out

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:59.330
and feed the birds,
especially in heavy snows.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.520
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: And a lot of that
during the Depression was scratch,

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:09.100
not necessarily quality seeds, but
seed that was swept up at the mill,

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:13.270
on the floor, and put into bags,
and first given away to farmers

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:15.080
and community people to spread

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.180
at community feeders
or in their backyards.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.310
Later on they said, "Hey, you know,
we could start charging ten cents

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:22.490
or a nickel a bag for
these big bags."

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:24.040
And that's what they
did and that's part

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:27.160
of the transition into
this bird feeding.

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.460
Yes.

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:40.850
&gt;&gt; Is there anything you can do for
ground cover to ensure that worms

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.020
and other insects are
available [inaudible].

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.320
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Yes.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:49.320
We have a lot of insectivorous
birds around right now of course

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:54.440
and the best thing that people
can do is to plant for birds.

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:59.710 position:56%
And even if you just have, you
know, some food plants, for example,

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.260
when I go out of town I don't
worry about my hummingbirds

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:06.810 position:56%
because I have coral honeysuckle and
that's there for the hummingbirds.

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:11.270
And the health of insects
is going to increase

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:17.770
and therefore be available to birds
if you keep nice native plants

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:21.100
around and don't use pesticides.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.710
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: I highly
recommend Doug Tallamy's book,

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:26.010
"Bringing Nature Home."

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.940
It's a fabulous book on the
connection between native plants

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:35.940
and native insects, and
concomitantly, connected to birds.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.150
I will tell you privately I have a
phobia against insects but I read

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:40.840
and thoroughly enjoyed the book.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.710
And it's an extremely important,
an extremely important book.

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:47.320
Doug Tallamy, "Bringing
Nature Home."

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.660
It's about the backyard.

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.310
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: But one
thought is to think of a plant

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:54.820
as a kind of bird feeder.

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.120
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Indeed.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.940
And cover is good, is important,
not only in spring and summer

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:04.540
when it's blossoming, and
when it's full of insects

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:09.260
and worms underneath, but also
in terms of wintertime to serve

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:12.670
as literally cover for
birds, protection from wind,

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:15.300
snow, and predators, too.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.150
Any other questions
before we -- yes, go ahead.

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.210
&gt;&gt; There was, you showed
a device meant

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.080
to discourage English sparrows.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.110
Are the same little brown
sparrows that we have everywhere?

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.410
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: Yes.

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:29.000
The English sparrows are now called
house sparrows, were introduced

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:39.170
to Brooklyn, New York, 1850, 1852,
I think two or three releases.

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:43.490
And it was thought that
they would eat gypsy moths

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:44.790
and gypsy moth worms.

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:46.840
It didn't work.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.350
They spread all over the country.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:53.960
They became bullies to other
birds and became undesirable.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.170 position:56%
This was a device not to discourage,
you wisely used the word,

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.800
or politically correct to
use the word discourage.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.950
This was a device to capture so
you could dispose of these birds.

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:09.190
Curiously they have been
declining over the last,

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:11.740
house sparrows have been declining
over the last 30, 40 years.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:15.460
And that's particularly because
of the decline of the horse.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.950
In urban areas, in cities
house sparrows flourished

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:23.040
because of spilled grain and
feeding horses, oats in particular.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:27.380
Also they would recycle the
manure that wasn't fully,

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:30.420
necessarily digested by
the horse on city streets.

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.720
House sparrows would do very well.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.530
They don't do that well now.

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.290
They may be in some urban areas
including Washington, D.C.,

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:39.990
and maybe your backyard but
they are highly reduced.

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:42.210
Margaret, did you get
the results from -- ?

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:44.290
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Also
in Europe they're declining

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:49.290 position:56%
and it's remarkable because a lot of
people who put up birdhouses don't

00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:50.590
like house sparrows a lot.

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:53.770
They can be very aggressive,
especially toward bluebirds.

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:59.030
And, but you can go online and
see people in England weeping

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:03.010
about the decline in
house sparrow populations.

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:06.980
House sparrows are not a
protected bird in this country.

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:11.230
They're not protected under
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Baicich: They're not native.

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:13.890
They're not native just like
starlings are not native birds.

They're not protected.

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:20.810
So they are disposed of and
dispatched accordingly many places.

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.140
Looks like we've run out of time.

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.660
It's been a delight to be with
you and an honor to be here.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.960
Thank you.

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.310
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker: Very much.

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.360

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:33.010
