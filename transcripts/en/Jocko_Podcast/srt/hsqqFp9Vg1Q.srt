1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,390
How do you deal with being evaluated
specifically by different people with

2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:07,390
different opinions and motives?
Oh,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,970
how do you deal with being evaluated?
Well,

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,950
I can tell you right now,

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,660
nobody likes being
evaluated, right? Nobody.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,950
Now you might get somebody that
says, oh, I love being coached in.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,380
And there are some people that
are pretty positive about that.

8
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:30,440
And as a matter of fact, I have clients
where they want to be coached, right?

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,940
But most people, especially in a normal
environment, like if you got new hires,

10
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,280
someone to coach you.
Okay.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,440
But most people in a normal environment,

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,180
they don't like being evaluated.
They don't like being judged,

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,100
always judging.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,970
So the first thing you have to do when
it comes to being evaluated is get that

15
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:57,140
in your head that you like.

16
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:01,280
Everybody else has defense mechanisms
and they're going to flare up.

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,660
As soon as somebody says
something critical of you,

18
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,060
as soon as somebody goes to evaluate you,

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,110
your defense mechanisms are going to
go up. And then once that happens,

20
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:16,670
once you feel those defense mechanisms
go up, you got to put your ego in check.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,133
Mm hmm.

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,070
You got to put your ego in
check and then once you do that,

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,090
you gotta listen. Listen,
I know it sounds crazy.

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,540
Listen to what they're saying.
Don't even,

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,290
don't even think of a response.
Say to yourself, you know what,

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,910
I'm not even gonna Respond. I'm only going
to listen to what they're saying. Yeah,

27
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:43,480
but [inaudible] and to kind of cheat
your already can't even take it. No, no,

28
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:46,690
I can't take it. Oh, I'm saying,
but I think, um, cause people will,

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,440
will quote unquote do that, but they
won't really do it as far as just,

30
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,860
I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just
gonna listen there. That's actually,

31
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,410
that's actually like, that's
actually how they set it up to look.

32
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:58,690
I'm not even gonna say anything. I'm
just going to listen. Yes, exactly.

33
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:02,500
What I'm talking about is like you
don't owe or they'll all body language,

34
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,730
you know, the kind of where
they are. Like, you know,
they'll do that kind of stuff.

35
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,000
Don't do that. Don't do
that. So you're right.

36
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,850
You got to listen and not just listen to,
but truly listen,

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,410
not listen just with your ears,

38
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:18,880
but listen with your mind and
your brain and with an open mind,

39
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,200
an open mind,

40
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,760
and then think about what people are
saying and then see it is important to see

41
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:28,750
it from their perspective. Because if
you just see it from your perspective,

42
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:31,150
you're not even seeing what
the criticism really is.

43
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,960
You're only seeing the
defense of the criticism.

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,600
So actually get in their mind and say,
wow,

45
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,450
what does this look like
from their perspective?

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Why would they be taking the effort and
the risk and the challenge of trying to

47
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:50,770
present this problem to me if it wasn't
important or they just doing it just to

48
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,640
make me mad. No, they're trying
to help you. And you know what?

49
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,050
Just like just like a joke
and they say like every joke,

50
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,850
some little truth to it.
Yeah. Every little criticism.

51
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,920
Even if the person is your archrival,

52
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,480
their criticism is built on something.
Yeah.

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,750
So what is that reality that
you can take away from it,

54
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,820
even though you've got to take it with a
grain of salt, especially if the person,

55
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:21,820
like it says here, if the person has
different opinions and mode as well,

56
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:25,030
of course they have different opinions.
You want people with different opinions,

57
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,500
maybe they have different motives,

58
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:30,400
so maybe you think they're trying to usurp
your authority or something like that.

59
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,220
So you, maybe you got to
take it with a grain of salt,

60
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,250
but find the grain of truth in there
too and find what it is from their

61
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:44,580
perspective,
what the problem is and learn from it.

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,700
And one of the most beautiful things
about this is you take the criticism and

63
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:55,350
you make adjustments. You know, how
do I deal with about being evaluated?

64
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,910
I try and accept the evaluation and
make adjustments to improve myself as a

65
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:00,744
human.

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,353
Hmm.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,470
That's how I deal with being evaluated.

68
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,430
And I'm not saying I deal with it
anybody better than anybody else because

69
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,310
everybody gets defensive,
myself included.

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,633
Mm.

71
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,680
You know, we had a little conversation
when we started tonight, right? Sure.

72
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,750
You said, I repeated some stuff
on the last podcast, allegedly,

73
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,580
and you know, and then we talked
through it and then I said,

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,530
you know,
and you know,

75
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:34,490
I noticed that your camera work was a
little bit off and you know, it just the,

76
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,360
my point was just to prove how defensive
we all get can yeah. We all get,

77
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,960
and you know what I did? I said, you
know what? I noticed that too, you know,

78
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,980
but as far as me repeating,

79
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:45,770
there was a couple little sections
and it was because we pulled,

80
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I pulled from multiple different books
and they had a little bit of overlap and

81
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,940
looking back on it probably shouldn't
have. But at the time I thought,

82
00:04:55,941 --> 00:05:00,140
you know what? This is emphasizing
really important points. Yeah.

83
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,230
But still people don't want to hear
the same thing over and over again.

84
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:05,030
So I probably shouldn't have done that.

85
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:10,010
So guess what criticism accepted right on.
I will adapt,

86
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,903
adjust,

87
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,840
and I will make improvements to my game
based on your criticism of my technique,

88
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:17,390
my skill, and my life. Yup.
