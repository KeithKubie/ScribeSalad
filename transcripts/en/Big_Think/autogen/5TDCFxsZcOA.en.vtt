my name is Austin Buckner and I have a

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549
my name is Austin Buckner and I have a
 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.940
my name is Austin Buckner and I have a
question about the multi-verse so if

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
question about the multi-verse so if
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.610
question about the multi-verse so if
there does exist an infinite amount of

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620
there does exist an infinite amount of
 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.759
there does exist an infinite amount of
universes then mathematically there's a

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769
universes then mathematically there's a
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.860
universes then mathematically there's a
100 chance that there exists at least

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870
100 chance that there exists at least
 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.230
100 chance that there exists at least
one universe out there in the multiverse

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
one universe out there in the multiverse
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.560
one universe out there in the multiverse
that cannot support the idea of any

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
that cannot support the idea of any
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.689
that cannot support the idea of any
other universe existing except for that

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
other universe existing except for that
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.050
other universe existing except for that
one particular universe and my question

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
one particular universe and my question
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.269
one particular universe and my question
is doesn't this create a paradox in the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
is doesn't this create a paradox in the
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.250
is doesn't this create a paradox in the
multi-universe idea Austin you are

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
multi-universe idea Austin you are
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.170
multi-universe idea Austin you are
asking a fabulous question about

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180
asking a fabulous question about
 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.049
asking a fabulous question about
multiverses the answer for me is clearly

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
multiverses the answer for me is clearly
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.840
multiverses the answer for me is clearly
I don't know this is to say is it just a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
I don't know this is to say is it just a
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.720
I don't know this is to say is it just a
question of definition that there is one

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
question of definition that there is one
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.930
question of definition that there is one
universe and within it our sub vs. or

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
universe and within it our sub vs. or
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.540
universe and within it our sub vs. or
multiverses or is it actually everything

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
multiverses or is it actually everything
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.799
multiverses or is it actually everything
that we know and see and can detect is

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809
that we know and see and can detect is
 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.160
that we know and see and can detect is
nominally replicated at some other

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170
nominally replicated at some other
 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.420
nominally replicated at some other
dimension or some other space beyond

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
dimension or some other space beyond
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.420
dimension or some other space beyond
space that we are only able to imagine

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
space that we are only able to imagine
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.190
space that we are only able to imagine
and the only reason we think that they

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
and the only reason we think that they
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200
and the only reason we think that they
might exist these multiverses beyond

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
might exist these multiverses beyond
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.810
might exist these multiverses beyond
space-time is because there's no reason

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
space-time is because there's no reason
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.789
space-time is because there's no reason
to exclude them like there's no reason

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
to exclude them like there's no reason
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.690
to exclude them like there's no reason
they couldn't exist

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
they couldn't exist
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.850
they couldn't exist
these are wonderful questions I've seen

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
these are wonderful questions I've seen
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070
these are wonderful questions I've seen
many talks on this I've gone to symposia

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
many talks on this I've gone to symposia
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.410
many talks on this I've gone to symposia
about this and I don't know the answer

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
about this and I don't know the answer
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.410
about this and I don't know the answer
however we have the Spitzer Space

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
however we have the Spitzer Space
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810
however we have the Spitzer Space
Telescope where we have Hubble Space

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
Telescope where we have Hubble Space
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.160
Telescope where we have Hubble Space
Telescope if we're going to have James

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
Telescope if we're going to have James
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530
Telescope if we're going to have James
Webb Space Telescope and these

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
Webb Space Telescope and these
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.120
Webb Space Telescope and these
instruments along with ground-based

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
instruments along with ground-based
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.520
instruments along with ground-based
telescopes are peering farther and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
telescopes are peering farther and
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.550
telescopes are peering farther and
farther into the past looking at light

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
farther into the past looking at light
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.910
farther into the past looking at light
that came from the Big Bang and the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920
that came from the Big Bang and the
 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.249
that came from the Big Bang and the
unknowable time the Planck time getting

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
unknowable time the Planck time getting
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039
unknowable time the Planck time getting
back that far and so what came before

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
back that far and so what came before
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230
back that far and so what came before
that is that even a meaningful question

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
that is that even a meaningful question
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.080
that is that even a meaningful question
is it just our perception and the nature

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
is it just our perception and the nature
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.499
is it just our perception and the nature
of our perception of time that limits

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
of our perception of time that limits
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.630
of our perception of time that limits
our ability to understand what might be

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
our ability to understand what might be
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.990
our ability to understand what might be
beyond our universe or not these are

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
beyond our universe or not these are
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.109
beyond our universe or not these are
wonderful questions but here's also when

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
wonderful questions but here's also when
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.520
wonderful questions but here's also when
you get a chance support space

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
you get a chance support space
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.310
you get a chance support space
exploration because learning more about

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
exploration because learning more about
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.139
exploration because learning more about
the cosmos tells us more about ourselves

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
the cosmos tells us more about ourselves
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.770
the cosmos tells us more about ourselves
and tells us more about where we all

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
and tells us more about where we all
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.729
and tells us more about where we all
might have come

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739
might have come
 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.059
might have come
and then ultimately are we alone in all

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069
and then ultimately are we alone in all
 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.270
and then ultimately are we alone in all
this in the cosmos or in this universe

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280
this in the cosmos or in this universe
 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.460
this in the cosmos or in this universe
or beyond whoa it's a great question

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
or beyond whoa it's a great question
 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.449
or beyond whoa it's a great question
