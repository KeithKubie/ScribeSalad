00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.570
- You Jack?
- Yeah.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.330
How you doing?

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.500
- How you doing?
- Good.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.430
I'm Frank

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.430
Hello, Frank,
nice to meet you.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.730
Dani said this is
generational, huh?

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.200
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Fourth gen?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.300
Fourth generation.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.900
1946, that's when my
great-grandfather and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.030
grandfather went into business.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.000
My father took over
the business in 1970,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I took over the
business in 1990.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.170
FRANK: How many
acres you got here?

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.930
40 acres.
FRANK: 40 acres?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.630
You guys gotta clean the
property up, or something?

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.330
Well, yeah.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.570
Things are moving here.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.900
There's a big housing
development going next door.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.100
The whole area is changing.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.170
You know, people in new
houses aren't gonna wanna

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.030
see all this junk around here.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.600
And I really don't want my
family to have to clean this up

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.930
if something happens to me.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.770
I want to have it all
neat and tidy now.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.370
My grandfather just loved Mack
Trucks, the old chain drives.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.300
MIKE: Yeah.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.530
Mack Truck was
just something he

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.270
always really
endeared and loved,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.430
so I have several of them.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.270
My grandfather and
great-grandfather

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.530
couldn't afford a Mack Truck.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.770
Mack Truck was top of the line.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.800
They always dreamed of
having a Mack Truck.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.570
So basically, we have a lot
of trucks and everything,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.300
but mostly we like Macks.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.370
How many you got?

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.870
Well, now we're
down to about 35,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.830
but the collection, at one
time, was up to about 300.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.030
You're down to 35?

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.130
- Yeah, we're down to 35.
- 300?

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.170
Yeah.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.000
Collecting of the
antique Mack Trucks

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.400
didn't happen till
probably the late 70s.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.600
It was my grandfather
that actually

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.970
bought the first antique truck.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.230
Then my father and I
started buying them,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.300
and it was just-- my father
would go across the country,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.470
from here to California,
buying Mack Trucks.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.230
My dad and I would go out to
people's places of business,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.400
houses, wherever,
and buy memorabilia,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.100
tractors, trucks, or what
have you, and bring it home.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.170
He had the sickness, huh?

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.200
He had the sickness.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.770
That's the way I
am with motorcycles.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.330
We did it week,
after week, after week.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.570
Do you have anything
in these containers?

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.770
Well, there's nothing
really in these containers,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.070
they're pretty much empty.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.470
But I've got some trailers
that have some stuff in them

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.900
that we can go look at.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.400
Ha, yeah.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.330
So Frank and I crawl
inside of a trailer

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
that the roof has caved in on.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.230
If we're gonna find
something in this place,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.830
we're gonna have to dig.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.630
Underneath it, over
it, crawl through it.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.570
These are the kind of
picks that we love.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.430
That's cool.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.000
An old oil sand table.
- Yeah.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.430
It was a motor display
table, more or less.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.170
Different tiered display table.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.800
I had forgotten it was there.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.670
MIKE: 100% pure paraffine.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.070
JACK: Amoco.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.000
MIKE: Yeah, the legs are bent,
and they're twisted, and stuff.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.370
But that can be heated up,
and it can be straightened.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.930
The porcelain is
really in good shape.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.270
Both sides porcelain, nice.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.130
This one's actually
the worse of the two.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.530
JACK: Yeah.
MIKE: This big chip.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.830
Want me to make
you an offer on it?

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.400
JACK: Yup.
MIKE: $350.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.200
- That's fair.
- We doing it?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.400
All right, cool.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.600
MIKE: Who knew that
this thing was in here?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.630
Even Jack forgot it
was in here, because it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.130
was buried under so much stuff.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.700
And that's the kind of
pick you want to be on.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.170
What's that rocket
thing back there?

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.830
- Old gumball machine.
- Let me see that.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.030
Let's go back there.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.030
In the very back, I could
see this rocket ship.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.100
And I think I know what
it is, but I'm not sure.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.370
FRANK: Oh, yeah.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.800
MIKE: Look at that, Frankie.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800
It's exactly what I
thought it was going to be.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.170
I'll tell you what,
the guy that designed

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.500
this was absolutely brilliant.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.370
He wanted to attract a
child to come up to it,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.130
to be fascinated by it,
bum a quarter from his mom,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.430
and hit this sucker.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.830
All the color of the gumballs,
all the different colors

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.530
would have been
here, on display.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.500
And then you've got
blue, white, red.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.800
[music playing]

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.970
What a great piece.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.370
Yeah, I've seen them for
sale a lot of different places,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.330
when restored, to go
for $1,000, $1,200.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.430
MIKE: Really?

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.730
JACK: Oh yeah, they're--
they're big dollars.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.600
MIKE: No kidding.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.830
I haven't seen one restored.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.900
Yeah, it's rusty, it's
dirty, it's faded.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.870
I mean, what are you
thinking on this?

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.100
Probably around $200.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.600
MIKE: But it still draws you in.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.930
All right, I'm gonna do it.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.930
It's cool.
