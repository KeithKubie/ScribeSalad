00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.149
The birth rate for twins is going up!

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.229
And in related news, my desire to have children
has plummeted.

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:15.270
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you've
been on the internet at all the past couple

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.180
days, then you've probably seen this adorable
and also somewhat gross photo of twins born

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.940
in Ohio, who emerged from the womb holding
hands.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.940
AWWWWWWW.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.440
This is especially noteworthy because the
twins are monoamniotic - meaning they share

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.540
the same amniotic sac and placenta.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.249
It's a rare occurrence, happening in around
1 in 10,000 births - and it's extremely risky,

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:42.640
because the twins have a high chance of becoming
entangled in the umbilical cords during pregnancy.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.879
Thankfully, these two were born healthy and
happy - but it got me thinking, what are the

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.479
odds of having twins?

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.879
Turns out it's a lot higher now, than it was
even a few decades ago.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.210
In 2010, twins accounted for about 1 in 30
births - and while that may seem extremely

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.620
high, keep in mind that fraternal twins - those
who don't share identical features - make

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.539
up well over two-thirds of that.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.399
Even so, these numbers are continuing to rise.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.000
The birth rate for twins has risen by 76%
over the past 30 years, and there are several

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.030
reasons why that might be.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.469
Most of it, is due to a rise in fertility
treatments - which increases the odds of having

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.250
multiple births by around 20-40%.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.070
Another factor, is the fact that women are
now waiting longer to have children.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.090
As we get older, our bodies go through hormonal
changes - that cause us to release multiple

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.170
eggs at once.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.140
So even though women over 35 are less likely
to get pregnant overall, they're also more

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.579
likely to have multiple births, in the event
that they do.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.509
For women age 40, the odds of having twins
is around 7%, and at 45, that number goes

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.280
up to a whopping 17%.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.560
There's also genetic factors that make us
more likely to have multiple births.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.280
For example, if someone in your family has
given birth to twins, then you are also more

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.280
likely to have them.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.729
And the same goes for your children.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.999
The more pregnancies you've had - the more
likely you are to have twins.

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:04.369
And if you've already had a set of fraternal
twins, then you're much more likely to have

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.110
another pair sometime in the future.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.540
Being a certain race can also predispose you.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.290
For instance, African-Americans are more likely
to have twins than any other race, while Hispanic

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.480
and Asian people are the least likely.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.860
Then there are things you would never even
consider to have an effect, like body type.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.270
Studies have shown that twins are more common
in women who are taller and heavier, than

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.670
in women who are small or underweight.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.070
Another study from 2003, shows that women
who take folic acid supplements during their

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.500
time of conception, increase their odds of
having twins by 40%.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.190
And multiple reports conclude that women who
increase their dairy consumption before and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.820
during conception - are up to 5x more likely
to have twins, perhaps due to the synthetic

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.820
growth hormones that are injected in cows.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.710
Believe it or not, there is an entire subset
of women devoted to "twinning," which is the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.420
practice of changing your diet and habits,
in order to increase your odds of having multiple

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.420
births.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.430
And aside from all the medical complications
twins can bring - personally, the idea of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.690
having two separate people growing inside
of me for 9 months - is kinda terrifying.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.890
But I'm also not a mother, so the thought
of having children, in general, is kinda terrifying.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.580
Can you tell I'm easily scared?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.520
Anyway, I'm sure some of you out there watching
this, have given birth to twins - and if you

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.480
have, we'd love to hear about your experience.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.730
Just leave your thoughts in the comments below,
and as always - thanks for watching!
