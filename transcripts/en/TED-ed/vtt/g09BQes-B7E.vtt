00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:09.209
Which of these entities 
has evolved the ability

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:13.485
to manipulate an animal
many times its size?

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:15.888
The answer is all of them.

00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:17.498
These are all parasites,

00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:21.925
organisms that live on 
or inside another host organism,

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:25.591
which they harm and sometimes even kill.

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:30.447
Parasite survival depends on transmitting
from one host to the next,

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.532
sometimes through 
an intermediate species.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:38.568
Our parasites elegantly achieve this
by manipulating their host's behavior,

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:42.011
sometimes through direct brain hijacking.

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.155
For example, this is the Gordian worm.

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.503
One of its hosts, this cricket.

00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:52.033
The Gordian worm needs water to mate,
but the cricket prefers dry land.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.635
So once it's big enough to reproduce,

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:59.676
the worm produces proteins that garble
the cricket's navigational system.

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:02.875
The confused cricket 
jumps around erratically,

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:04.353
moves closer to water,

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:08.602
and eventually leaps in,
often drowning in the process.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:10.976
The worm then wriggles out to mate

00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:13.353
and its eggs get eaten 
by little water insects

00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:14.700
that mature,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.083
colonize land,

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:19.166
and are, in turn, eaten by new crickets.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.438
And thus, the Gordian worm lives on.

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:26.298
And here's the rabies virus,
another mind-altering parasite.

00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:28.990
This virus infects mammals, often dogs,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.592
and travels up the animal's 
nerves to its brain

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.258
where it causes inflammation 
that eventually kills the host.

00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:40.371
But before it does, it often increases
its host's aggressiveness

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:45.246
and ramps up the production
of rabies-transmitting saliva,

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:47.435
while making it hard to swallow.

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:51.124
These factors make the host 
more likely to bite another animal

00:01:51.124 --> 00:01:55.332
and more likely to pass 
the virus on when it does.

00:01:55.332 --> 00:02:01.021
And now, meet Ophiocordyceps,
also known as the zombie fungus.

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:05.841
Its host of choice is tropical ants
that normally live in treetops.

00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:10.858
After Ophiocordyceps spores 
pierce the ant's exoskeleton,

00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:15.482
they set off convulsions 
that make the ant fall from the tree.

00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:20.330
The fungus changes the ant's behavior,
compelling it to wander mindlessly

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.829
until it stumbles onto a plant leaf with
the perfect fungal breeding conditions,

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.979
which it latches onto.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.432
The ant then dies,

00:02:28.432 --> 00:02:34.982
and the fungus parasitizes its body
to build a tall, thin stalk from its neck.

00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:37.934
Within several weeks, 
the stalk shoots off spores,

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:43.592
which turn more ants 
into six-legged leaf-seeking zombies.

00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:48.863
One of humanity's most deadly assailants
is a behavior-altering parasite,

00:02:48.863 --> 00:02:50.848
though if it's any consolation,

00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.016
it's not our brains 
that are being hijacked.

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:57.968
I'm talking about Plasmodium,
which causes malaria.

00:02:57.968 --> 00:03:02.082
This parasite needs mosquitoes
to shuttle it between hosts,

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:05.908
so it makes them bite more frequently
and for longer.

00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:09.020
There's also evidence 
that humans infected with malaria

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.020
are more attractive to mosquitoes,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.685
which will bite them 
and transfer the parasite further.

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:17.737
This multi-species system is so effective,

00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:22.430
that there are hundreds of millions
of malaria cases every year.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.742
And finally, there are cats.

00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:28.383
Don't worry, there probably 
aren't any cats living in your body

00:03:28.383 --> 00:03:29.848
and controlling your thoughts.

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:31.550
I mean, probably.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.305
But there is a microorganism
called Toxoplasma

00:03:35.305 --> 00:03:39.733
that needs both cats and rodents
to complete its life cycle.

00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:43.082
When a rat gets infected
by eating cat feces,

00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:47.057
the parasite changes chemical levels
in the rat's brain,

00:03:47.057 --> 00:03:50.498
making it less cautious
around the hungry felines,

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:52.750
maybe even attracted to them.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.515
This makes them easy prey,

00:03:54.515 --> 00:03:59.493
so these infected rodents
get eaten and pass the parasite on.

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:01.774
Mind control successful.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:06.209
There's even evidence that the parasite
affects human behavior.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.683
In most cases, 
we don't completely understand

00:04:08.683 --> 00:04:12.988
how these parasites manage 
their feats of behavior modification.

00:04:12.988 --> 00:04:14.528
But from what we do know,

00:04:14.528 --> 00:04:17.005
we can tell that they have 
a pretty diverse toolbox.

00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:21.434
Gordian worms seem to affect
crickets' brains directly.

00:04:21.434 --> 00:04:23.654
The malaria parasite, on the other hand,

00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:26.897
blocks an enzyme 
that helps the mosquitoes feed,

00:04:26.897 --> 00:04:30.823
forcing them to bite over 
and over and over again.

00:04:30.823 --> 00:04:34.509
The rabies virus may cause 
that snarling, slobbering behavior

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.972
by putting the immune system
into overdrive.

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:39.333
But whatever the method,

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.000
when you think about how effectively

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.437
these parasites control 
the behavior of their hosts,

00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:51.374
you may wonder how much of human behavior
is actually parasites doing the talking.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:55.039
Since more than half of the species
on Earth are parasites,

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.057
it could be more than we think.
