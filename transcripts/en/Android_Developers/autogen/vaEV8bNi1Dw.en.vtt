00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.130
and let's start off with screen sizes
 

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.130

actually going to be low-cost devices
 

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.320
actually going to be low-cost devices
and of course with low-cost devices you

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:17.330
and of course with low-cost devices you
 

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.700
and of course with low-cost devices you
tend to find that their hardware

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:18.710
tend to find that their hardware
 

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.770

one of the things that they focused on
 

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.630
one of the things that they focused on
is improving the emulator performance so

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:31.640
is improving the emulator performance so
 

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.370
is improving the emulator performance so
what you should be doing from a screen

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:33.380
what you should be doing from a screen
 

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.170
what you should be doing from a screen
size point of view is setting up

size point of view is setting up
 

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.389
size point of view is setting up
multiple emulator configurations and

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399
multiple emulator configurations and
 

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.850
multiple emulator configurations and
then deploying your app to these smaller

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:39.860
then deploying your app to these smaller
 

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.370
then deploying your app to these smaller
screen sizes or lower densities and

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:42.380
screen sizes or lower densities and

and you can make rapid changes in the

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:47.510
and you can make rapid changes in the
 

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.600
and you can make rapid changes in the
layout editor now because Android studio

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:49.610
layout editor now because Android studio
 

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.579
layout editor now because Android studio
has instant run so when you make a

00:13:51.579 --> 00:13:51.589
has instant run so when you make a
 

00:13:51.589 --> 00:13:52.990
has instant run so when you make a
change and deploy it on the emulator

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000
change and deploy it on the emulator
 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.120
change and deploy it on the emulator
again it's not repackaging your whole

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.130
again it's not repackaging your whole
 

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.490
again it's not repackaging your whole
app and just distributing it it's just

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:57.500
app and just distributing it it's just
 

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.930
app and just distributing it it's just
sending the changes across to your

00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:58.940
sending the changes across to your
 

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.850
sending the changes across to your
running app so the turnaround time is

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:00.860
running app so the turnaround time is
 

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.189
running app so the turnaround time is
much faster so we can we can actually

00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199
much faster so we can we can actually
 

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:07.090
much faster so we can we can actually
make these changes rapidly of course

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:07.100
make these changes rapidly of course
 

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.509
make these changes rapidly of course
next is memory usage because low cost

00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519
next is memory usage because low cost
 

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:12.939
next is memory usage because low cost
devices will have less RAM and I just

00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:12.949
devices will have less RAM and I just
 

00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:14.230
devices will have less RAM and I just
want to clarify when we talk about

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240
want to clarify when we talk about
 

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.780
want to clarify when we talk about
memory here we mean RAM not storage

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:16.790
memory here we mean RAM not storage
 

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.660
memory here we mean RAM not storage
we'll get the storage in a minute you

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:19.670
we'll get the storage in a minute you
 

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.189
we'll get the storage in a minute you
want to adjust your behavior by the

00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199
want to adjust your behavior by the
 

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:22.780
want to adjust your behavior by the
amount of RAM that's on the device and

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:22.790
amount of RAM that's on the device and
 

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.750
amount of RAM that's on the device and
there's one API that will raise lots of

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760
there's one API that will raise lots of
 

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.480
there's one API that will raise lots of
warning signs and you should be using it

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:28.490
warning signs and you should be using it
 

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.840
warning signs and you should be using it
today and that API is is low RAM device

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:31.850
today and that API is is low RAM device
 

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.930
today and that API is is low RAM device
if that API returns true to you at

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:34.940
if that API returns true to you at
 

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.930
if that API returns true to you at
runtime you know that in your app you

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:37.940
runtime you know that in your app you
 

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.540
runtime you know that in your app you
need to be aggressive about keeping your

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:40.550
need to be aggressive about keeping your
 

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.490
need to be aggressive about keeping your
footprint down because this is a very

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:42.500
footprint down because this is a very
 

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.319
footprint down because this is a very
constrained environment that your app

00:14:44.319 --> 00:14:44.329
constrained environment that your app
 

00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:48.280
constrained environment that your app
will be running in the other API you can

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.290
will be running in the other API you can
 

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.240
will be running in the other API you can
use this get memory

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.250
use this get memory
 

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.400
use this get memory
and that helps you understand how much

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:51.410
and that helps you understand how much
 

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.639
and that helps you understand how much
memory budget you have in your app there

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:54.649
memory budget you have in your app there
 

00:14:54.649 --> 00:14:56.259
memory budget you have in your app there
are strategies that you can use to lower

00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:56.269
are strategies that you can use to lower
 

00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:59.379
are strategies that you can use to lower
the memory usage are things like holding

00:14:59.379 --> 00:14:59.389
the memory usage are things like holding
 

00:14:59.389 --> 00:15:01.720
the memory usage are things like holding
on to things in memory for a little

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:01.730
on to things in memory for a little
 

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.889
on to things in memory for a little
amount of time being more aggressive

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:02.899
amount of time being more aggressive
 

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:06.040
amount of time being more aggressive
about releasing it not keeping it in

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.050
about releasing it not keeping it in
 

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.769
about releasing it not keeping it in
memory images also consume a lot of

00:15:08.769 --> 00:15:08.779
memory images also consume a lot of
 

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:11.079
memory images also consume a lot of
memory so when you have a low RAM device

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:11.089
memory so when you have a low RAM device
 

00:15:11.089 --> 00:15:12.999
memory so when you have a low RAM device
or when you have a device that you know

or when you have a device that you know
you've got low memory budget on just use

00:15:15.939 --> 00:15:15.949
you've got low memory budget on just use
 

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:17.889
you've got low memory budget on just use
a lower resolution even if it's slightly

when the system detects that it's
 

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.210
when the system detects that it's
running out of storage it will clear out

find that they use expandable storage
 

00:19:19.379 --> 00:19:21.259
find that they use expandable storage

everybody loves their smartphones
 

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.520
everybody loves their smartphones
everybody hates their smartphones when

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:43.530
everybody hates their smartphones when
 

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.810
everybody hates their smartphones when
they die because they've run out of

battery and apps are usually the

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:47.730
battery and apps are usually the

contributor to that now when we talk

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:50.730
contributor to that now when we talk
 

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.760
contributor to that now when we talk
about low-cost devices of course it

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:52.770
about low-cost devices of course it
 

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.380
about low-cost devices of course it
means that they're going to come with

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:54.390
means that they're going to come with
 

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.720
means that they're going to come with
smaller capacity batteries so it's

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:56.730
smaller capacity batteries so it's
 

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.330
smaller capacity batteries so it's
important for us to focus on optimizing

00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340
important for us to focus on optimizing
 

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.690

our battery use the first thing we

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700
our battery use the first thing we
 

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.270
our battery use the first thing we
should do is ensure that the device is

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:05.280
should do is ensure that the device is
 

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.390
should do is ensure that the device is
not being kept awake unnecessarily so go

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400
not being kept awake unnecessarily so go
 

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.890
not being kept awake unnecessarily so go
ahead and look for wakelocks in your

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:09.900
ahead and look for wakelocks in your
 

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.380
ahead and look for wakelocks in your
code and remove them all of them if you

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:12.390
code and remove them all of them if you
 

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.590
code and remove them all of them if you
can but certainly as many of them as you

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600
can but certainly as many of them as you
 

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.960
can but certainly as many of them as you
are able to because a wakelock holding

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:17.970
are able to because a wakelock holding
 

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.480
are able to because a wakelock holding
on to a wakelock tells the device that I

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:20.490

even though the screen is off the CPU is
 

00:27:27.419 --> 00:27:29.930
even though the screen is off the CPU is
fully spun up and that's bad that

important we've talked about lots and
lots of different technical details but

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:26.860
lots of different technical details but
 

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.770
lots of different technical details but
of course how we present our information

of course how we present our information
 

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.260
of course how we present our information
to our user is the thing that you must

touch ripples are really really really
really important I can't stress this

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:41.650
really important I can't stress this
 

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.720
really important I can't stress this
enough because when we think about our

enough because when we think about our
 

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:48.120
enough because when we think about our
devices when we touch the screen we need

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:48.130
devices when we touch the screen we need
 

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.910

that feedback we provide it and often I
 

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.750
that feedback we provide it and often I
find apps where I will have like an

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.010
index of content I will hit that content
not only will it not give me any touch

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:02.020
not only will it not give me any touch
 

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.080
not only will it not give me any touch
feedback but it will be unresponsive

lower spec devices this
 

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.160
lower spec devices this
even more important because it takes

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.170
even more important because it takes
 

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.830
even more important because it takes
