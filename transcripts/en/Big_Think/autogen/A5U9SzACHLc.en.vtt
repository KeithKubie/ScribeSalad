Yale University

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.480
 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.900
so the capuchins always study are really

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910
so the capuchins always study are really
 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.459
so the capuchins always study are really
distantly related but they're actually a

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469
distantly related but they're actually a
 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.170
distantly related but they're actually a
great model for human cognition for a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180
great model for human cognition for a
 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.600
great model for human cognition for a
couple of reasons one is that being a

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610
couple of reasons one is that being a
 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.249
couple of reasons one is that being a
primate that kind of branched off about

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259
primate that kind of branched off about
 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.499
primate that kind of branched off about
35 million years ago they actually tell

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509
35 million years ago they actually tell
 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.690
35 million years ago they actually tell
us something about what human evolution

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700
us something about what human evolution
 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.070
us something about what human evolution
human cognition probably looked like a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080
human cognition probably looked like a
 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.990
human cognition probably looked like a
really long time ago so it actually

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000
really long time ago so it actually
 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.060
really long time ago so it actually
gives us insight not just into our very

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070
gives us insight not just into our very
 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.460
gives us insight not just into our very
recent phylogenetic past as studies with

recent phylogenetic past as studies with
 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.319
recent phylogenetic past as studies with
chimpanzees might do but capuchins

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329
chimpanzees might do but capuchins
 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.429
chimpanzees might do but capuchins
actually tell us something about you

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439
actually tell us something about you
 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.080
actually tell us something about you
know really phylogenetically old

similarities that we might share with

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590
similarities that we might share with
 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.160
similarities that we might share with
other primates

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.689
one cool thing about primates is that

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699
one cool thing about primates is that
 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.610
one cool thing about primates is that
they like us are extremely social

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
they like us are extremely social
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.799
they like us are extremely social
creatures so they grow up in the context

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
creatures so they grow up in the context
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.180
creatures so they grow up in the context
of social groups they're around other

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
of social groups they're around other
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.899
same species and the social
relationships they form really affect

relationships they form really affect
 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.149
relationships they form really affect
their entire lives so it affects you

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159
their entire lives so it affects you
 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.560
their entire lives so it affects you
know what kind of food they're gonna get

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
know what kind of food they're gonna get
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.180
know what kind of food they're gonna get
you know based on who they hang out with

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
you know based on who they hang out with
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.680
you know based on who they hang out with
and what rank they are you'll

high-ranking individuals have easy
 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.859
high-ranking individuals have easy
access to food whereas low ranking

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869
access to food whereas low ranking
 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:05.270
access to food whereas low ranking
individuals might have to wait their

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
individuals might have to wait their

turn it affects the kind of meeting
success they can get you know the kind

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
success they can get you know the kind
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.090
success they can get you know the kind
of Alliance is the they form and the way

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
of Alliance is the they form and the way
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.649
of Alliance is the they form and the way
they sort of set up their little social

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
they sort of set up their little social
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.240
they sort of set up their little social
groupings actually can you know affect

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
groupings actually can you know affect
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.740
groupings actually can you know affect
just how well they do in terms of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
just how well they do in terms of
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.570
just how well they do in terms of
natural selection so social groups are

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
natural selection so social groups are
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.010
natural selection so social groups are
really important for most primate

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
really important for most primate
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.450
really important for most primate
species

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460
 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.460
one of the reasons it took scientists so

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470
one of the reasons it took scientists so
 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.650
one of the reasons it took scientists so
long to figure out how to ask monkeys

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660
long to figure out how to ask monkeys
 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.180
long to figure out how to ask monkeys
about what they know about other minds

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190
about what they know about other minds
 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.060
about what they know about other minds
is that oftentimes researchers were

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070
is that oftentimes researchers were
 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.560
is that oftentimes researchers were
trying to set up studies that might make

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570
trying to set up studies that might make
 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.180
trying to set up studies that might make
sense to human but probably don't make

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190
sense to human but probably don't make
 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.430
sense to human but probably don't make
sense to a monkey so one kind of study

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440
sense to a monkey so one kind of study
 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.740
sense to a monkey so one kind of study
actually involved a setup where a human

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750
actually involved a setup where a human
 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.590
actually involved a setup where a human
was trying to help a primate get a piece

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600
was trying to help a primate get a piece
 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.210
was trying to help a primate get a piece
of food that was hidden so different

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220
of food that was hidden so different
 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.500
of food that was hidden so different
pieces of food are hidden the monkey

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510
pieces of food are hidden the monkey
 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.940
pieces of food are hidden the monkey
can't see where they are but the human

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950
can't see where they are but the human
 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.440
can't see where they are but the human
was kind of looking and pointing at one

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
was kind of looking and pointing at one
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.090
was kind of looking and pointing at one
of these pieces of food in general

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100
of these pieces of food in general
 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.890
of these pieces of food in general
primates did really badly on this year

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900
primates did really badly on this year
 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.720
primates did really badly on this year
embarrassingly badly even with training

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730
embarrassingly badly even with training
 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.850
embarrassingly badly even with training
they kind of never got it but that

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860
they kind of never got it but that
 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.440
they kind of never got it but that
actually makes sense like never in a

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450
actually makes sense like never in a
 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.910
actually makes sense like never in a
monkey's life would ever intentionally

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920
monkey's life would ever intentionally
 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.160
monkey's life would ever intentionally
cue a human experimenter to wear a piece

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170
cue a human experimenter to wear a piece
 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.510
cue a human experimenter to wear a piece
of food was this was just a situation

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520
of food was this was just a situation
 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.840
of food was this was just a situation
that was totally weird so the insight

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850
that was totally weird so the insight
 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.310
that was totally weird so the insight
that we as scientists had was that well

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320
that we as scientists had was that well
 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.320
that we as scientists had was that well
let's use the situations that monkeys

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330
let's use the situations that monkeys
 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.570
let's use the situations that monkeys
are naturally using to deceive us maybe

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580
are naturally using to deceive us maybe
 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.860
are naturally using to deceive us maybe
this is where they'll actually show us

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870
this is where they'll actually show us
 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.600
this is where they'll actually show us
they understand something and you know

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610
they understand something and you know
 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.370
they understand something and you know
now 5-10 years later there's you know

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380
now 5-10 years later there's you know
 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.309
now 5-10 years later there's you know
tons of studies suggesting exactly that

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319
 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.320
one reason it's important to actually

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330
one reason it's important to actually
 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.690
one reason it's important to actually
study the evolutionary origins of say

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700
study the evolutionary origins of say
 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.850

you know our economic troubles and so on

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860
you know our economic troubles and so on
 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.429
you know our economic troubles and so on
is that oftentimes when we learn some

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439
is that oftentimes when we learn some
 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.770
is that oftentimes when we learn some
behavior or some bias is built in by

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
behavior or some bias is built in by
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.699

it means it's actually really hard to

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209
it means it's actually really hard to
 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.809
it means it's actually really hard to
overcome so you know it's really hard to

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819
overcome so you know it's really hard to
 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.670
overcome so you know it's really hard to
convince people that cheesecake doesn't

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680

were aware of them the problem in the
economic domain is my guess is that the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
economic domain is my guess is that the
 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.910
economic domain is my guess is that the
biases we're seeing in US and in monkeys

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920
biases we're seeing in US and in monkeys
 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.819
biases we're seeing in US and in monkeys
are going to be equally hard to turn off

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829
are going to be equally hard to turn off
 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.990
are going to be equally hard to turn off
but these are ones that it's hard to

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000
but these are ones that it's hard to
 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.119
but these are ones that it's hard to
even be aware of how strong they are so

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129
even be aware of how strong they are so
 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.140
even be aware of how strong they are so
I think one of the important things

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150
I think one of the important things
 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.640
I think one of the important things
about seeing these kinds of errors and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650
about seeing these kinds of errors and
 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.259
about seeing these kinds of errors and
monkeys is just not only are they old

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269
monkeys is just not only are they old
 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.119
monkeys is just not only are they old
but they're gonna be really hard to get

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129
but they're gonna be really hard to get
 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.449
but they're gonna be really hard to get
over

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459
over
 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.879
over
so policies that try to deal with these

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889
so policies that try to deal with these
 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.530
so policies that try to deal with these
biases it might be well-served to say

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540
biases it might be well-served to say
 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.449
biases it might be well-served to say
look let's just assume these biases are

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459
look let's just assume these biases are
 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.280
look let's just assume these biases are
in place and how can we design policies

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290
in place and how can we design policies
 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.530
in place and how can we design policies
that can accept them and sort of deal

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540
that can accept them and sort of deal
 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.199
that can accept them and sort of deal
with them as they are

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.270
one thing we're really interested in is

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
one thing we're really interested in is
 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.670
one thing we're really interested in is
whether monkeys have the opportunity to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680
whether monkeys have the opportunity to
 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.500
whether monkeys have the opportunity to
think twice right know we can you know

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510
think twice right know we can you know
 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.509
think twice right know we can you know
experience this bias and succumb to it

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519
experience this bias and succumb to it
 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.190
experience this bias and succumb to it
we can also be very meta about it and

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
we can also be very meta about it and
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.110
we can also be very meta about it and
think about you know well you know I can

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120
think about you know well you know I can
 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.490
think about you know well you know I can
talk to you now about these biases you

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500
talk to you now about these biases you
 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.780
talk to you now about these biases you
know the monkeys probably aren't you

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790
know the monkeys probably aren't you
 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.190
know the monkeys probably aren't you
know sitting around the forest talking

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200
know sitting around the forest talking
 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.119
know sitting around the forest talking
to each other about the kinds of

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129
to each other about the kinds of
 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.910
to each other about the kinds of
economic biases they have so the the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920
economic biases they have so the the
 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.190
economic biases they have so the the
fact that we can kind of think twice paw

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
fact that we can kind of think twice paw
 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.229
fact that we can kind of think twice paw
is kind of inhibit they sort of

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239
is kind of inhibit they sort of
 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.300
is kind of inhibit they sort of
prepotent or the sort of instinctual

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310
prepotent or the sort of instinctual
 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.539
prepotent or the sort of instinctual
bias that gives us a weapon against

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549
bias that gives us a weapon against
 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.399
bias that gives us a weapon against
these sorts of biases but in some sense

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409
these sorts of biases but in some sense
 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:05.869
these sorts of biases but in some sense
we have to know they're there in the

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879
we have to know they're there in the
 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.610
we have to know they're there in the
first place to actually implement these

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620
first place to actually implement these
 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.500
first place to actually implement these
kind of wait wait wait let me stop pause

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510
kind of wait wait wait let me stop pause
 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.000
kind of wait wait wait let me stop pause
think about it and try to come up with

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010
think about it and try to come up with
 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.069
think about it and try to come up with
the right decision so I think awareness

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079
the right decision so I think awareness
 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.460
the right decision so I think awareness
that we have these biases in these

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
that we have these biases in these
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.990
that we have these biases in these
everyday situations and that we're

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
everyday situations and that we're
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.490
everyday situations and that we're
really affected by them is actually very

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500
really affected by them is actually very
 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.870
really affected by them is actually very
important

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880
 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.240
our newest line of work is actually

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250
our newest line of work is actually
 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.730
our newest line of work is actually
trying to explore whether or not the

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740
trying to explore whether or not the
 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.550
trying to explore whether or not the
monkeys share some of the aspects of

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560
monkeys share some of the aspects of
 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.350
monkeys share some of the aspects of
human social cognition that we're not

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360
human social cognition that we're not
 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.480
human social cognition that we're not
very proud of so these are things like

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490
very proud of so these are things like
 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.400
very proud of so these are things like
the fact that we are very very

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410
the fact that we are very very
 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.320
the fact that we are very very
prejudiced even when we don't realize we

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330
prejudiced even when we don't realize we
 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.210
prejudiced even when we don't realize we
are we have these implicit biases

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220
are we have these implicit biases
 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.800
are we have these implicit biases
against out group members against

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810
against out group members against
 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.150
against out group members against
individuals of different religions

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160
individuals of different religions
 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.980
individuals of different religions
different races and so on and these

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990
different races and so on and these
 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.630
different races and so on and these
biases play themselves out in really

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640
biases play themselves out in really
 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.850
biases play themselves out in really
insidious ways we'd really like to know

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860
insidious ways we'd really like to know
 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.830
insidious ways we'd really like to know
how these biases work but there are lots

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840
how these biases work but there are lots
 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.390
how these biases work but there are lots
of possibilities on the table for where

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400
of possibilities on the table for where
 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.590
of possibilities on the table for where
they come from right you know we grow up

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600
they come from right you know we grow up
 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.900
they come from right you know we grow up
in a biased society there are lots of

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910
in a biased society there are lots of
 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.130
in a biased society there are lots of
kind of cultural influences that are

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140
kind of cultural influences that are
 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.890
kind of cultural influences that are
biases are these the real culprits or is

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900
biases are these the real culprits or is
 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.300
biases are these the real culprits or is
it something a little bit deeper is it

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310
it something a little bit deeper is it
 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.620
it something a little bit deeper is it
something maybe older that might be

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630
something maybe older that might be
 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.780
something maybe older that might be
harder to override so we actually

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790
harder to override so we actually
 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.250
harder to override so we actually
started studying whether the monkeys

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260
started studying whether the monkeys
 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.620
started studying whether the monkeys
share some of our human-like prejudice

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630
share some of our human-like prejudice
 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.380
share some of our human-like prejudice
against the out-group our first study

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390
against the out-group our first study
 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.910
against the out-group our first study
really just asked this in a really

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920
really just asked this in a really
 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.620
really just asked this in a really
simple way we said do monkeys

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630
simple way we said do monkeys
 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.660
simple way we said do monkeys
spontaneously distinguish between guys

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670
spontaneously distinguish between guys
 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.250
spontaneously distinguish between guys
that are in their in-group and guys that

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260
that are in their in-group and guys that
 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
that are in their in-group and guys that
are in the out-group so the experiment

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270
are in the out-group so the experiment
 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.540
are in the out-group so the experiment
was super simple we did this down at our

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550
was super simple we did this down at our
 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.220
was super simple we did this down at our
field site in Puerto Rico where we study

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230
field site in Puerto Rico where we study
 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.350
field site in Puerto Rico where we study
rhesus monkeys monkeys free range around

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360
rhesus monkeys monkeys free range around
 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.880
rhesus monkeys monkeys free range around
and we sort of showed up with a sort of

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890
and we sort of showed up with a sort of
 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.430
and we sort of showed up with a sort of
big billboard which had come two covers

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440
big billboard which had come two covers
 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.780
big billboard which had come two covers
at the end of it when we opened the

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790
at the end of it when we opened the
 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.670
at the end of it when we opened the
covers that had two pictures of

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680
covers that had two pictures of
 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.770
covers that had two pictures of
different monkeys one guy from their

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780
different monkeys one guy from their
 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.480
different monkeys one guy from their
group and one guy from the out group and

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490
group and one guy from the out group and
 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.490
group and one guy from the out group and
the really simple measure was do the

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500
the really simple measure was do the
 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.380
the really simple measure was do the
monkeys increase their vigilance they

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390
monkeys increase their vigilance they
 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.120
monkeys increase their vigilance they
kind of get worried about and stare at

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130
kind of get worried about and stare at
 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.070
kind of get worried about and stare at
more at the guy who's in our group again

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080
more at the guy who's in our group again
 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.510
more at the guy who's in our group again
this is you know first trial of monkeys

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520
this is you know first trial of monkeys
 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.920
this is you know first trial of monkeys
I've ever seen this sort of weird

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930
I've ever seen this sort of weird
 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.930
I've ever seen this sort of weird
billboard set up but we found the

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940
billboard set up but we found the
 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.400
billboard set up but we found the
expected result one you might expect

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410
expected result one you might expect
 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.410
expected result one you might expect
from humans which is that spontaneously

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420
from humans which is that spontaneously
 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.150
from humans which is that spontaneously
the monkeys actually direct their

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160
the monkeys actually direct their
 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.620
the monkeys actually direct their
vigilance towards the guy who's in their

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630
vigilance towards the guy who's in their
 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.590
vigilance towards the guy who's in their
out group the the worrying thing is this

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600
out group the the worrying thing is this
 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.120
out group the the worrying thing is this
seems very similar to the way that

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130
seems very similar to the way that
 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.400
seems very similar to the way that
humans can devote their attention to out

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410
humans can devote their attention to out
 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.860
humans can devote their attention to out
group members and in our next line of

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870
group members and in our next line of
 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.450
group members and in our next line of
studies we want to see well you know

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460
studies we want to see well you know
 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.040
studies we want to see well you know
they're just kind of looking longer at

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050
they're just kind of looking longer at
 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.630
they're just kind of looking longer at
these guys where do they actually treat

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640
these guys where do they actually treat
 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.950
these guys where do they actually treat
them differently in other words do they

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960
them differently in other words do they
 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.780
them differently in other words do they
associate them with bad things in their

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790
associate them with bad things in their
 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.540
associate them with bad things in their
environment and there's a long line of

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550
environment and there's a long line of
 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.280
environment and there's a long line of
studies in people trying to look at

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290
studies in people trying to look at
 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.350
studies in people trying to look at
whether people do this implicitly

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360
whether people do this implicitly
 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.020
whether people do this implicitly
there's a study known as the implicit

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030
there's a study known as the implicit
 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.330
there's a study known as the implicit
association test which basically asks

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340
association test which basically asks
 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.770
association test which basically asks
you to do a couple categorizations

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780
you to do a couple categorizations
 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.420
you to do a couple categorizations
you're doing you're categorizing good

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430
you're doing you're categorizing good
 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.830
you're doing you're categorizing good
and bad words and you're also

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840
and bad words and you're also
 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.330
and bad words and you're also
categorizing in-group and out-group

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340
categorizing in-group and out-group
 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.850
categorizing in-group and out-group
members you know say you know your

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860
members you know say you know your
 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.530
members you know say you know your
religion versus a different religion and

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540
religion versus a different religion and
 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.940
religion versus a different religion and
using this task

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950
using this task
 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.200
using this task
researchers have shown that it's

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210
researchers have shown that it's
 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.140
researchers have shown that it's
actually very hard to categorize your

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150
actually very hard to categorize your
 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.720
actually very hard to categorize your
in-group with the bad words and your

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730
in-group with the bad words and your
 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.860
in-group with the bad words and your
out-group with the good words are

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870
out-group with the good words are
 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.300
out-group with the good words are
actually slower and you make more errors

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310
actually slower and you make more errors
 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.990
actually slower and you make more errors
when these categories don't match up

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000
when these categories don't match up
 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.280
when these categories don't match up
suggesting that you know even though we

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290
suggesting that you know even though we
 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.720
suggesting that you know even though we
don't like to think we do we have these

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730
don't like to think we do we have these
 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.030
don't like to think we do we have these
biases against our group members that

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040
biases against our group members that
 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.020
biases against our group members that
can play out in these really simple

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030
can play out in these really simple
 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.030
can play out in these really simple
contexts so we basically did the same

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040
contexts so we basically did the same
 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.950
contexts so we basically did the same
categorization measure with our monkeys

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960
categorization measure with our monkeys
 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.390
categorization measure with our monkeys
we give them kind of a series of

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400
we give them kind of a series of
 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.460
we give them kind of a series of
different pictures that either matched

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470
different pictures that either matched
 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.010
different pictures that either matched
in their valence so they were all kind

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020
in their valence so they were all kind
 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.630
in their valence so they were all kind
of good images to the monkey so they

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.640
of good images to the monkey so they
 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.670
of good images to the monkey so they
were all bad images to the monkeys the

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680
were all bad images to the monkeys the
 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.990
were all bad images to the monkeys the
idea is in those cases the monkey should

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000
idea is in those cases the monkey should
 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.400
idea is in those cases the monkey should
get bored kind of good thing good thing

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.410
get bored kind of good thing good thing
 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.230
get bored kind of good thing good thing
good thing or a bad thing bad thing bad

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240
good thing or a bad thing bad thing bad
 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.440
good thing or a bad thing bad thing bad
thing or we set up a list of pictures

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450
thing or we set up a list of pictures
 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.570
thing or we set up a list of pictures
where the valence is differed and one of

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580
where the valence is differed and one of
 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.310
where the valence is differed and one of
these cases was one of pictures of their

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320
these cases was one of pictures of their
 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.830
these cases was one of pictures of their
in-group members and pictures of bad

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840
in-group members and pictures of bad
 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.230
in-group members and pictures of bad
things in this case scary spiders and

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240
things in this case scary spiders and
 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.480
things in this case scary spiders and
what you found is that when the valence

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.490
what you found is that when the valence
 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.890
what you found is that when the valence
is were inconsistent so in other words

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:29.900
is were inconsistent so in other words
 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.510
is were inconsistent so in other words
when they in group members were paired

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520
when they in group members were paired
 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.430
when they in group members were paired
with these bad spiders that actually

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440
with these bad spiders that actually
 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.020
with these bad spiders that actually
increased the monkeys processing time

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.030
increased the monkeys processing time
 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.760
increased the monkeys processing time
suggesting that they don't treat those

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:36.770
suggesting that they don't treat those
 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.160
suggesting that they don't treat those
categories the same way however when you

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.170
categories the same way however when you
 

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.200
categories the same way however when you
put out group members with bad things

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210
put out group members with bad things
 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.510
put out group members with bad things
like spiders they actually process them

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520
like spiders they actually process them
 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.790

a member of its out group is basically
 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.350
a member of its out group is basically
in some sense equivalent emotionally or

in some sense equivalent emotionally or
 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.150

thing when we did when we tried to look
 

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.250
thing when we did when we tried to look
at positive images so in group members

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.260
at positive images so in group members
 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.990
at positive images so in group members
the monkey seemed to process

the monkey seemed to process
 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.150
the monkey seemed to process
like fruits really positive you know

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160

it actually takes them a lot of

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:14.540
it actually takes them a lot of
 

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.710
it actually takes them a lot of
processing time what it seems like is

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:17.720
processing time what it seems like is
 

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.210

the male's actually switch groups so the

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:09.470
the male's actually switch groups so the
 

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.079
the male's actually switch groups so the
monkeys provide this really cool window

00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:11.089
monkeys provide this really cool window
 

00:09:11.089 --> 00:09:12.370
monkeys provide this really cool window
because the females live in these very

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:12.380
because the females live in these very
 

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.840
because the females live in these very
stable groups that they're gonna be in

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:13.850
stable groups that they're gonna be in
 

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:14.680
stable groups that they're gonna be in
for their whole lives

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:14.690
for their whole lives
 

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.900
for their whole lives
where the male's actually switch and so

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:16.910
where the male's actually switch and so
 

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.880
where the male's actually switch and so
the male is actually or in one group for

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:18.890
the male is actually or in one group for
 

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.530
the male is actually or in one group for
a certain stage of their lives and then

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:20.540
a certain stage of their lives and then
 

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.090
a certain stage of their lives and then
switch to a new group so they kind of in

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:22.100
switch to a new group so they kind of in
 

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.639
switch to a new group so they kind of in
some sense have to update their

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:23.649
some sense have to update their
 

00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:25.630
some sense have to update their
information about what group they're and

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:25.640
information about what group they're and
 

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.769
information about what group they're and
who they like and who they don't like

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:26.779
who they like and who they don't like
 

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:30.340
who they like and who they don't like
and so on

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:30.350
 

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.710
our conclusion from this recent line of

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720
our conclusion from this recent line of
 

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.750
our conclusion from this recent line of
work suggests that first that monkeys

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760
work suggests that first that monkeys
 

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.690
work suggests that first that monkeys
actually spontaneously form associations

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.700
actually spontaneously form associations
 

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.030
actually spontaneously form associations
form categories about groups in the same

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040
form categories about groups in the same
 

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.050
form categories about groups in the same
way that humans do

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.060
way that humans do
 

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.330
way that humans do
so the perhaps the exact same thing that

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:43.340
so the perhaps the exact same thing that
 

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.470
so the perhaps the exact same thing that
humans do when they think about

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480
humans do when they think about
 

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.060
humans do when they think about
individuals from a different race

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.070
individuals from a different race
 

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.140

the monkeys are doing when they're

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.150

the monkeys are doing when they're
thinking about individuals from a

thinking about individuals from a
 

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.860
thinking about individuals from a
different social group beyond just the

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:50.870
different social group beyond just the
 

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.840
different social group beyond just the
fact that they categorize them they also

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:52.850
fact that they categorize them they also
 

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.400
fact that they categorize them they also
seem to have valence them in the same

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:54.410
seem to have valence them in the same
 

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.680
seem to have valence them in the same
way as humans do namely they team that

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:56.690
way as humans do namely they team that
 

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.390
way as humans do namely they team that
they tend to think of the in-group is a

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:58.400
they tend to think of the in-group is a
 

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.940
they tend to think of the in-group is a
positive entity maybe actually devote

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:00.950
positive entity maybe actually devote
 

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.100
positive entity maybe actually devote
resources more to the in-group and they

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.110
resources more to the in-group and they
 

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.240
resources more to the in-group and they
think of the out-group as a negative

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.250
think of the out-group as a negative
 

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.060
think of the out-group as a negative
entity the thing in humans is that we

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.070
entity the thing in humans is that we
 

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.830

over these kinds of biases might even be

over these kinds of biases might even be
harder than social psychologists have

answer that seems to be coming up might
have to do with the way that humans

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.400
imitate other individuals so there was
recently a study by Andy white and his

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:23.410
recently a study by Andy white and his
 

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.290
recently a study by Andy white and his
colleagues trying to look at the ways

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:25.300
colleagues trying to look at the ways
 

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.900
colleagues trying to look at the ways
that human children imitate a person

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:27.910
that human children imitate a person
 

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.460
that human children imitate a person
acting on a tool versus the way that

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:29.470
acting on a tool versus the way that
 

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.500
acting on a tool versus the way that
chimpanzees imitate and so the

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:31.510
chimpanzees imitate and so the
 

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.449
chimpanzees imitate and so the
experiment went like this both children

00:12:33.449 --> 00:12:33.459
experiment went like this both children
 

00:12:33.459 --> 00:12:34.920
experiment went like this both children
and chimpanzees were given a little

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:34.930
and chimpanzees were given a little
 

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.819
and chimpanzees were given a little
puzzle box

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:35.829
puzzle box
 

00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:37.470
puzzle box
it was opaque they couldn't see how it

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480
it was opaque they couldn't see how it
 

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.910
it was opaque they couldn't see how it
worked but they get to watch a human

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920
worked but they get to watch a human
 

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.490
worked but they get to watch a human
demonstrator open it up and the steps to

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:41.500
demonstrator open it up and the steps to
 

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.410
demonstrator open it up and the steps to
open it upward of two parts first it

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:43.420
open it upward of two parts first it
 

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.000
open it upward of two parts first it
involves kind of tapping the puzzle box

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.010
involves kind of tapping the puzzle box
 

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.860
involves kind of tapping the puzzle box
on the top and this sort of way and then

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:46.870
on the top and this sort of way and then
 

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.420
on the top and this sort of way and then
it involves opening a door and taking

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:48.430
it involves opening a door and taking
 

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.150
it involves opening a door and taking
out a tree so both kids and chimpanzees

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160
out a tree so both kids and chimpanzees
 

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.829
out a tree so both kids and chimpanzees
after seeing this can follow the

00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:52.839
after seeing this can follow the
 

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.540
after seeing this can follow the
experiment are perfectly so they do the

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:54.550
experiment are perfectly so they do the
 

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.690
experiment are perfectly so they do the
tapping part open the door get the tree

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:56.700
tapping part open the door get the tree
 

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.090
tapping part open the door get the tree
now you do the same search setup except

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:00.100
now you do the same search setup except
 

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.340
now you do the same search setup except
instead of the box being opaque it's now

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:02.350
instead of the box being opaque it's now
 

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.100
instead of the box being opaque it's now
transparent and it's obvious to both the

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.110
transparent and it's obvious to both the
 

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.259
transparent and it's obvious to both the
child the child subjects and the

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:07.269
child the child subjects and the
 

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:09.960
child the child subjects and the
chimpanzees that the whole tapping part

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:09.970
chimpanzees that the whole tapping part
 

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.449
chimpanzees that the whole tapping part
at the top is just bogus like the

00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:12.459
at the top is just bogus like the
 

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.710
at the top is just bogus like the
tapping doesn't actually go anywhere

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:13.720
tapping doesn't actually go anywhere
 

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.410
tapping doesn't actually go anywhere
it's like kind of a false top so you can

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:16.420
it's like kind of a false top so you can
 

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.090
it's like kind of a false top so you can
see as you're watching a person do this

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:18.100
see as you're watching a person do this
 

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.829
see as you're watching a person do this
that you don't need to do this all you

00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839
that you don't need to do this all you
 

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:22.470
that you don't need to do this all you
have to do is open the door when you

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480
have to do is open the door when you
 

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.240
have to do is open the door when you
give this puzzle to chimpanzees they do

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.250
give this puzzle to chimpanzees they do
 

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.889
give this puzzle to chimpanzees they do
what you might expect to be the smart

00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:25.899
what you might expect to be the smart
 

00:13:25.899 --> 00:13:27.329
what you might expect to be the smart
maneuver they're just kind of cut to the

00:13:27.329 --> 00:13:27.339
maneuver they're just kind of cut to the
 

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:28.860
maneuver they're just kind of cut to the
chase and open the door and take the

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:28.870
chase and open the door and take the
 

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.280

want you to do this with human children

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:31.570
want you to do this with human children
 

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.199
want you to do this with human children
however what you find surprisingly and

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:34.209
however what you find surprisingly and
 

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:35.639
however what you find surprisingly and
perhaps embarrassingly for our species

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:35.649
perhaps embarrassingly for our species
 

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:37.710
perhaps embarrassingly for our species
is that the human children slavishly

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720
is that the human children slavishly
 

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.019
is that the human children slavishly
imitate the person they see so even

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:40.029
imitate the person they see so even
 

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:41.280
imitate the person they see so even
though they can clearly see you that

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:41.290
though they can clearly see you that
 

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.110
though they can clearly see you that
this you know poking in the top is a

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120
this you know poking in the top is a
 

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.160
this you know poking in the top is a
stupid gesture they do it anyway what it

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:47.170
stupid gesture they do it anyway what it
 

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.410
stupid gesture they do it anyway what it
seems like is that humans really are

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:49.420
seems like is that humans really are
 

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.689
seems like is that humans really are
paralyzed by watching the actions of

00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:51.699
paralyzed by watching the actions of
 

00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:53.519
paralyzed by watching the actions of
others actually seems to change our

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:53.529
others actually seems to change our
 

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:55.139
others actually seems to change our
causal intuitions about how different

00:13:55.139 --> 00:13:55.149
causal intuitions about how different
 

00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:57.750
causal intuitions about how different
objects work this is bad when people do

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760
objects work this is bad when people do
 

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.519
objects work this is bad when people do
really stupid things on boxes and open

00:13:59.519 --> 00:13:59.529
really stupid things on boxes and open
 

00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:01.290
really stupid things on boxes and open
them the wrong way but it's great for

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:01.300
them the wrong way but it's great for
 

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.269
them the wrong way but it's great for
the cumulative evolution of Technology

00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279
the cumulative evolution of Technology
 

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.710
the cumulative evolution of Technology
because it means you don't have to know

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720
because it means you don't have to know
 

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.290
because it means you don't have to know
the physics or the the causal aspects of

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:07.300
the physics or the the causal aspects of
 

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.880
the physics or the the causal aspects of
how something works you just basically

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:08.890
how something works you just basically
 

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.710
how something works you just basically
follow somebody's actions do that

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720
follow somebody's actions do that
 

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.079
follow somebody's actions do that
yourself then you can pass on these

00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:13.089
yourself then you can pass on these
 

00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:14.819
yourself then you can pass on these
kinds of cultures to the next generation

00:14:14.819 --> 00:14:14.829
kinds of cultures to the next generation
 

00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:16.949
kinds of cultures to the next generation
and so in some sense the fact that

00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959
and so in some sense the fact that
 

00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:18.930
and so in some sense the fact that
chimpanzees don't rely on social and

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:18.940
chimpanzees don't rely on social and
 

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.120
chimpanzees don't rely on social and
as much as they seem to rely on physics

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:21.130
as much as they seem to rely on physics
 

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.880
as much as they seem to rely on physics
actually means they might not learn

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:23.890
actually means they might not learn
 

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.800
actually means they might not learn
about technologies in the same fast way

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:25.810
about technologies in the same fast way
 

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.660
about technologies in the same fast way
that humans do because if you think

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:27.670
that humans do because if you think
 

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.130
that humans do because if you think
about the kinds of technologies that we

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.140
about the kinds of technologies that we
 

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.690
about the kinds of technologies that we
deal with you know they're often so

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:30.700
deal with you know they're often so
 

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.430
deal with you know they're often so
physically complex that we can't explain

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440
physically complex that we can't explain
 

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.500
physically complex that we can't explain
them you know I use my iPhone every day

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:34.510
them you know I use my iPhone every day
 

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.270
them you know I use my iPhone every day
but I have no idea how it works you know

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:36.280
but I have no idea how it works you know
 

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.100
but I have no idea how it works you know
I slide the little bar and that's what I

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.110
I slide the little bar and that's what I
 

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.310
I slide the little bar and that's what I
understand but for chimpanzee is all of

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:41.320
understand but for chimpanzee is all of
 

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.990
understand but for chimpanzee is all of
the technologies they work have physics

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000
the technologies they work have physics
 

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.270
the technologies they work have physics
that are really obvious so affordance is

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:45.280
that are really obvious so affordance is
 

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.530
that are really obvious so affordance is
that they could see that anyone could

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:46.540
that they could see that anyone could
 

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.170
that they could see that anyone could
see somehow actually paying attention to

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:49.180
see somehow actually paying attention to
 

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.850
see somehow actually paying attention to
social information more than physics

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:50.860
social information more than physics
 

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.980
social information more than physics
might have allowed us to go beyond the

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:52.990
might have allowed us to go beyond the
 

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.780
might have allowed us to go beyond the
kind of obvious way things work to new

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:54.790
kind of obvious way things work to new

00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:58.930
 

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.740
oh yeah I think science is very sexy I

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:01.750
oh yeah I think science is very sexy I
 

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.400
oh yeah I think science is very sexy I
mean there are a lot of big scientific

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:05.410
mean there are a lot of big scientific
 

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.769
mean there are a lot of big scientific
puzzles when it comes to sexual

00:15:07.769 --> 00:15:07.779
puzzles when it comes to sexual
 

00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:09.000
puzzles when it comes to sexual
reproduction you know why do we choose

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.010
reproduction you know why do we choose
 

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.180
reproduction you know why do we choose
to have sex it'd be much easier to just

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:12.190
to have sex it'd be much easier to just
 

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.920
to have sex it'd be much easier to just
kind of you know Budd little clone you

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:13.930
kind of you know Budd little clone you
 

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.470
kind of you know Budd little clone you
know it saves lots of time and energy

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480
know it saves lots of time and energy
 

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.790
know it saves lots of time and energy
waste and disease and all these things

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800
waste and disease and all these things
 

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.280
waste and disease and all these things
but you know many many animals in the

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.290
but you know many many animals in the
 

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.170
but you know many many animals in the
animal kingdom actually put in the time

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:22.180
animal kingdom actually put in the time
 

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.120
animal kingdom actually put in the time
and energy and risk the disease and you

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.130
and energy and risk the disease and you
 

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.100
and energy and risk the disease and you
know all the pains and heartache to

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.110
know all the pains and heartache to
 

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.230
know all the pains and heartache to
actually sexually reproduce so it's a

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240
actually sexually reproduce so it's a
 

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.480
actually sexually reproduce so it's a
big puzzle in evolutionary biology and

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.490
big puzzle in evolutionary biology and
 

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:31.530
big puzzle in evolutionary biology and
then when you start looking at the

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:31.540
then when you start looking at the
 

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.870
then when you start looking at the
different ways animals go about sexual

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880
different ways animals go about sexual
 

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.310
different ways animals go about sexual
reproduction all the different ways they

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:35.320
reproduction all the different ways they
 

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.380
reproduction all the different ways they
go about finding mates and you know

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:37.390
go about finding mates and you know
 

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.540
go about finding mates and you know
strategizing to get mates and convincing

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:39.550
strategizing to get mates and convincing
 

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.180
strategizing to get mates and convincing
individuals to mate with them and so on

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:41.190
individuals to mate with them and so on
 

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.889
individuals to mate with them and so on
you know it's kind of just fascinating

00:15:43.889 --> 00:15:43.899
you know it's kind of just fascinating
 

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:45.120
you know it's kind of just fascinating
to see all the strategies that are out

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.130
to see all the strategies that are out
 

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.280
to see all the strategies that are out
there and in many ways humans are real

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:47.290
there and in many ways humans are real
 

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.110
there and in many ways humans are real
outliers in this so it's it's fun to

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120
outliers in this so it's it's fun to
 

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.370
outliers in this so it's it's fun to
look at the kinds of techniques that we

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:50.380
look at the kinds of techniques that we
 

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.560
look at the kinds of techniques that we
see across the animal kingdom

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:54.570
 

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.580
well humans are very funny species when

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:58.590
well humans are very funny species when
 

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.440
well humans are very funny species when
it comes to sexual reproduction we're

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:00.450
it comes to sexual reproduction we're
 

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.080
it comes to sexual reproduction we're
very weird relative to our closest

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.090
very weird relative to our closest
 

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.500
very weird relative to our closest
living primate relatives the other Apes

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:05.510
living primate relatives the other Apes
 

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.860
living primate relatives the other Apes
so we for the most part seem to be a

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:09.870
so we for the most part seem to be a
 

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.140
so we for the most part seem to be a
pair bonded species in other words a

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.150
pair bonded species in other words a
 

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.610
pair bonded species in other words a
male and a female get together and form

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:13.620
male and a female get together and form
 

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.380
male and a female get together and form
this pair bond and kind of cooperatively

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:15.390
this pair bond and kind of cooperatively
 

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.990
this pair bond and kind of cooperatively
rear their young there's nothing really

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000
rear their young there's nothing really
 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.420
rear their young there's nothing really
like that in the the rest of the great

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:20.430
like that in the the rest of the great
 

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.540
like that in the the rest of the great
ape species in chimpanzees are our

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:23.550
ape species in chimpanzees are our
 

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.610
ape species in chimpanzees are our
closest living relative you see lots of

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620
closest living relative you see lots of
 

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.730
closest living relative you see lots of
multi-male multi-female reproductive

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:28.740
multi-male multi-female reproductive
 

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.350
multi-male multi-female reproductive
behavior meaning you know females are

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360
behavior meaning you know females are
 

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.670
behavior meaning you know females are
mating with multiple males males are

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680
mating with multiple males males are
 

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.790
mating with multiple males males are
mating with multiple females but also in

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800
mating with multiple females but also in
 

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.980
mating with multiple females but also in
chimpanzees you also see that males and

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:36.990
chimpanzees you also see that males and
 

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.840
chimpanzees you also see that males and
females just aren't interested in sex

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:38.850
females just aren't interested in sex
 

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.940
females just aren't interested in sex
during the period where females aren't

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:40.950
during the period where females aren't
 

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.640
during the period where females aren't
very productive so female chimpanzees

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:43.650
very productive so female chimpanzees
 

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.400
very productive so female chimpanzees
advertise their receptivity the period

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:46.410
advertise their receptivity the period
 

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.050
advertise their receptivity the period
where they're fertile by having this

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060
where they're fertile by having this
 

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.520
where they're fertile by having this
huge sexual swelling that kind of blows

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:49.530
huge sexual swelling that kind of blows
 

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.530
huge sexual swelling that kind of blows
up and males are kind of only interested

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540
up and males are kind of only interested
 

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.220
up and males are kind of only interested
during this period somehow humans you

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.230
during this period somehow humans you
 

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.080
during this period somehow humans you
know unlike our closest living relatives

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:57.090
know unlike our closest living relatives
 

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.340
know unlike our closest living relatives
have kind of gotten rid of this you know

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:58.350
have kind of gotten rid of this you know
 

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.440
have kind of gotten rid of this you know
human females of course don't go around

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.450
human females of course don't go around
 

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.840
human females of course don't go around
advertising with you know really robust

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:02.850
advertising with you know really robust
 

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.460
advertising with you know really robust
blown-up read sexual skins when they're

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:04.470
blown-up read sexual skins when they're
 

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.010
blown-up read sexual skins when they're
receptive which is a bit of a puzzle you

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.020
receptive which is a bit of a puzzle you
 

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.780
receptive which is a bit of a puzzle you
know why did we lose this trait just in

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:08.790
know why did we lose this trait just in
 

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.450
know why did we lose this trait just in
the last seven million years you know

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:11.460
the last seven million years you know
 

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.770
the last seven million years you know
these are the kinds of things that hang

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780
these are the kinds of things that hang
 

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.360
these are the kinds of things that hang
on for long periods of time in primate

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:14.370
on for long periods of time in primate
 

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.100
on for long periods of time in primate
evolution so the fact that we got rid of

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:16.110
evolution so the fact that we got rid of
 

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.300
evolution so the fact that we got rid of
this really quickly is a bit of a puzzle

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:17.310
this really quickly is a bit of a puzzle
 

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.520
this really quickly is a bit of a puzzle
so kind of weird relative so they're

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:19.530
so kind of weird relative so they're
 

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.500
so kind of weird relative so they're
closely related primates when it comes

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:21.510
closely related primates when it comes
 

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.950
closely related primates when it comes
to sex and our sexual behavior the our

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:24.960
to sex and our sexual behavior the our
 

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.620
to sex and our sexual behavior the our
other closest so we have two closest

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:27.630
other closest so we have two closest
 

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.140
other closest so we have two closest
living primate relatives it's a tie

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.150
living primate relatives it's a tie
 

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.550
living primate relatives it's a tie
between chimpanzees so common

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:31.560
between chimpanzees so common
 

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.830
between chimpanzees so common
chimpanzees and their sister species

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840
chimpanzees and their sister species
 

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.320
chimpanzees and their sister species
bonobos and chimpanzees and bonobos

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:36.330
bonobos and chimpanzees and bonobos
 

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.780
bonobos and chimpanzees and bonobos
greatly differ in their own sexual

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:38.790
greatly differ in their own sexual
 

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.870
greatly differ in their own sexual
behavior bonobos are sort of the make

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880
behavior bonobos are sort of the make
 

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.270
behavior bonobos are sort of the make
love not war kind of primate they tend

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280
love not war kind of primate they tend
 

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.980
love not war kind of primate they tend
to be way less violent and aggressive

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:45.990
to be way less violent and aggressive
 

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.410
to be way less violent and aggressive
than chimpanzees and one of the

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:48.420
than chimpanzees and one of the
 

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.880
than chimpanzees and one of the
behaviors that allows them to overcome

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:49.890
behaviors that allows them to overcome
 

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.710
behaviors that allows them to overcome
that is the fact that they're very

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720
that is the fact that they're very
 

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.690
that is the fact that they're very
sexually oriented so in a lot of the

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700
sexually oriented so in a lot of the
 

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.920
sexually oriented so in a lot of the
situations that would cause aggression

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:54.930
situations that would cause aggression
 

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.380
situations that would cause aggression
in chimpanzees bonobos actually resort

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:57.390
in chimpanzees bonobos actually resort
 

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.530
in chimpanzees bonobos actually resort
to having sex to kind of diffuse any of

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:00.540
to having sex to kind of diffuse any of
 

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.690
to having sex to kind of diffuse any of
the anxiety or the stress about the

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700
the anxiety or the stress about the
 

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.950
the anxiety or the stress about the
situation so it's another puzzle for

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960
situation so it's another puzzle for
 

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.820
situation so it's another puzzle for
humans is that

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:07.830
humans is that
 

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.490
humans is that
we have one of one of our closest living

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.500
we have one of one of our closest living
 

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.590
we have one of one of our closest living
relatives is very aggressive very

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600
relatives is very aggressive very
 

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.570
relatives is very aggressive very
warlike you kind of a lot of the stuff

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.580
warlike you kind of a lot of the stuff
 

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.490
warlike you kind of a lot of the stuff
that we explicitly say we kind of don't

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500
that we explicitly say we kind of don't
 

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.529
that we explicitly say we kind of don't
like as much about the human species our

00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:18.539
like as much about the human species our
 

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:20.299
like as much about the human species our
other closest Driven living relative is

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:20.309
other closest Driven living relative is
 

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:23.750
other closest Driven living relative is
very peaceful you a very kind of social

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760
very peaceful you a very kind of social
 

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.850
very peaceful you a very kind of social
sexual oriented has lots and lots of

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860
sexual oriented has lots and lots of
 

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.980
sexual oriented has lots and lots of
female bonds there's a bit of a puzzle

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:27.990
female bonds there's a bit of a puzzle
 

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.110
female bonds there's a bit of a puzzle
in the field of you know what parts of

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120
in the field of you know what parts of
 

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.269
in the field of you know what parts of
these two guys did the humans get you

00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:32.279
these two guys did the humans get you
 

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:33.620
these two guys did the humans get you
know we more like chimpanzees are more

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:33.630
know we more like chimpanzees are more
 

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.019
know we more like chimpanzees are more
like bonobos still big puzzles in the

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:36.029
like bonobos still big puzzles in the
 

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:40.150
like bonobos still big puzzles in the
field of primate cognition

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160
 

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.610
the human reproductive system is one

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:42.620
the human reproductive system is one
 

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.159
the human reproductive system is one
that we don't really have a great grasp

00:18:45.159 --> 00:18:45.169
that we don't really have a great grasp
 

00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:47.710
that we don't really have a great grasp
on because in some sense we pair-bond

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720
on because in some sense we pair-bond
 

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.440
on because in some sense we pair-bond
for the most part but across all human

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:50.450
for the most part but across all human
 

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.029
for the most part but across all human
cultures there's really a push to push

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039
cultures there's really a push to push
 

00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:54.100
cultures there's really a push to push
me so in most human cultures there are

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:54.110
me so in most human cultures there are
 

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.100
me so in most human cultures there are
at least some males who take on multiple

Arctic bird it's a drab looking because

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320
Arctic bird it's a drab looking because
 

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.900
Arctic bird it's a drab looking because
it lives in the Arctic very hard to get

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:29.910
it lives in the Arctic very hard to get
 

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.690
it lives in the Arctic very hard to get
food and do everything but it kind of

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700
food and do everything but it kind of
 

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.270
food and do everything but it kind of
allows for its beauty to come out in

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280
allows for its beauty to come out in
 

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.250
allows for its beauty to come out in
really strange ways and one of these

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260
really strange ways and one of these
 

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.410
really strange ways and one of these
ways is that it has an incredibly

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:39.420
ways is that it has an incredibly
 

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.670
ways is that it has an incredibly
attractive armpit

attractive armpit
 

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.620
attractive armpit
so it's armpit is very white very clean

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:42.630
so it's armpit is very white very clean
 

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.680
so it's armpit is very white very clean
and it will do flash displays for

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:45.690
and it will do flash displays for
 

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.080
and it will do flash displays for
females where males will kind of get out

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.090
females where males will kind of get out
 

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.240
females where males will kind of get out
in a field and sort of flash its armpit

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:50.250
in a field and sort of flash its armpit
 

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.160
in a field and sort of flash its armpit
and if the females like the armpit they

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:52.170
and if the females like the armpit they
 

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.050
and if the females like the armpit they
kind of fly from miles and miles and

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:54.060
kind of fly from miles and miles and
 

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.220
kind of fly from miles and miles and
then they'll kind of if you do this

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.230
then they'll kind of if you do this
 

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.830
then they'll kind of if you do this
wonderful armpit display in the females

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840
wonderful armpit display in the females
 

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.570

think that they do so they have a case

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:43.270
think that they do so they have a case
 

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.680
think that they do so they have a case
of you know consider a lunch line when

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:46.690
of you know consider a lunch line when
 

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:47.910
of you know consider a lunch line when
you have different foods in different

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:47.920
you have different foods in different
 

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.590
you have different foods in different
orders and let's say that we could

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600
orders and let's say that we could
 

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.570
orders and let's say that we could
figure out for sure that the first piece

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:51.580
figure out for sure that the first piece
 

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.860
figure out for sure that the first piece
of food is going to affect what you

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:52.870
of food is going to affect what you
 

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.230
of food is going to affect what you
by which police the food should we put

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240
by which police the food should we put
 

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.940
by which police the food should we put
first well we could be paternalistic and

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:56.950
first well we could be paternalistic and
 

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.070
first well we could be paternalistic and
put the broccoli first you know we could

00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.080
put the broccoli first you know we could
 

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.630
put the broccoli first you know we could
say no we're gonna ignore that and put

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640
say no we're gonna ignore that and put
 

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.310
say no we're gonna ignore that and put
the the Cheesecake first and so on

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320
the the Cheesecake first and so on
 

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.049
the the Cheesecake first and so on
but you know one of the foods has to go

00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:04.059
but you know one of the foods has to go
 

00:26:04.059 --> 00:26:06.299
but you know one of the foods has to go
first or we have to decide to be random

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:06.309
first or we have to decide to be random
 

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:08.220
first or we have to decide to be random
every day and switch it up you know when

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.230
every day and switch it up you know when
 

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.930
every day and switch it up you know when
we set up policies we set up these

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:09.940
we set up policies we set up these
 

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.910
we set up policies we set up these
structures that have to have a default

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:11.920
structures that have to have a default
 

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.130
structures that have to have a default
option that have to sway choices somehow

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:14.140
option that have to sway choices somehow
 

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.530
option that have to sway choices somehow
and so the question is you know how do

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:16.540
and so the question is you know how do
 

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.780
and so the question is you know how do
we want to sway them and realizing how

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:18.790
we want to sway them and realizing how
 

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.090
we want to sway them and realizing how
these biases work and that because of

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:21.100
these biases work and that because of
 

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.680
these biases work and that because of
our work with the monkeys they might

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:22.690
our work with the monkeys they might
 

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.210
our work with the monkeys they might
really be hard to override I think

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:24.220
really be hard to override I think
 

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.549
really be hard to override I think
suggest that in fact we need to take

00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559
suggest that in fact we need to take
 

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:28.919
suggest that in fact we need to take
these kinds of policy suggestions really

00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:28.929
these kinds of policy suggestions really
 

00:26:28.929 --> 00:26:30.240
these kinds of policy suggestions really
seriously and deal with the question

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:30.250
seriously and deal with the question
 

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.140
seriously and deal with the question
that you know we have to set these

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.150
that you know we have to set these
 

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.570
that you know we have to set these
policies up somehow and we know that how

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:33.580
policies up somehow and we know that how
 

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.620
policies up somehow and we know that how
we set them up is going to affect

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:34.630
we set them up is going to affect
 

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.030
we set them up is going to affect
choices you know what should we really

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.040
choices you know what should we really
 

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.910
choices you know what should we really
decide to do

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:39.920
 

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.340
there's lots of really old work in

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:42.350
there's lots of really old work in
 

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.730
there's lots of really old work in
social psychology suggesting that the

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:45.740
social psychology suggesting that the
 

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.920
social psychology suggesting that the
way other people act can have a really

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:47.930
way other people act can have a really
 

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.990
way other people act can have a really
strong influence on us so there are a

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000
strong influence on us so there are a
 

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.330
strong influence on us so there are a
set of studies back in the 50s about

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:52.340
set of studies back in the 50s about
 

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.880
set of studies back in the 50s about
conformity so they typically go

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:54.890
conformity so they typically go
 

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.410
conformity so they typically go
something like this you're in a big

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:56.420
something like this you're in a big
 

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.730
something like this you're in a big
group of people you're asked to make a

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:57.740
group of people you're asked to make a
 

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.260
group of people you're asked to make a
decision about something really

00:26:59.260 --> 00:26:59.270
decision about something really
 

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.060
decision about something really
arbitrary that you should know like

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.070
arbitrary that you should know like
 

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.770
arbitrary that you should know like
which line is longer this line or this

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:02.780
which line is longer this line or this
 

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.200
which line is longer this line or this
line and what you're faced with is a

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.210
line and what you're faced with is a
 

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.700
line and what you're faced with is a
group of people who are all saying the

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:06.710
group of people who are all saying the
 

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.860
group of people who are all saying the
incorrect answer and what you find is

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:08.870
incorrect answer and what you find is
 

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.570
incorrect answer and what you find is
that striking number of subjects won't

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:10.580
that striking number of subjects won't
 

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.400
that striking number of subjects won't
go against what the group norm is

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:12.410
go against what the group norm is
 

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.950
go against what the group norm is
suggesting you know sometimes so

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960
suggesting you know sometimes so
 

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.540
suggesting you know sometimes so
strongly that it actually override what

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:16.550
strongly that it actually override what
 

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.330
strongly that it actually override what
you actually thought yourself so the the

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:19.340
you actually thought yourself so the the
 

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.280
you actually thought yourself so the the
presence of other people and what other

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:21.290
presence of other people and what other
 

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.740
presence of other people and what other
people expresses their preferences or

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:23.750
people expresses their preferences or
 

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:24.790
people expresses their preferences or
their knowledge and so on

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:24.800
their knowledge and so on
 

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.350
their knowledge and so on
it can affect us in a really deep way

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:26.360
it can affect us in a really deep way
 

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.140
it can affect us in a really deep way
again you know typically for positive

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:29.150
again you know typically for positive
 

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.610
again you know typically for positive
aspects you know these are probably the

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:30.620
aspects you know these are probably the
 

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.440
aspects you know these are probably the
things that allowed us to develop rich

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:32.450
things that allowed us to develop rich
 

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.450
things that allowed us to develop rich
cultures and so on but they also have a

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:34.460
cultures and so on but they also have a
 

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.580
cultures and so on but they also have a
negative aspect as well so I think the

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:36.590
negative aspect as well so I think the
 

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.350
negative aspect as well so I think the
implication is that we really just need

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360
implication is that we really just need
 

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.570
implication is that we really just need
to realize that this bias is there

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:40.580
to realize that this bias is there
 

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.980
to realize that this bias is there
realize that we're affected by these

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:41.990
realize that we're affected by these
 

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.250
realize that we're affected by these
things and and hopefully that'll let us

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:44.260
things and and hopefully that'll let us
 

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.190
things and and hopefully that'll let us
get better about it often a lot of the

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200
get better about it often a lot of the
 

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.370
get better about it often a lot of the
biases that we we study another

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:51.380
biases that we we study another
 

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.470
biases that we we study another
psychologists study you know the real

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:53.480
psychologists study you know the real
 

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.390
psychologists study you know the real
problem with them isn't necessarily just

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:55.400
problem with them isn't necessarily just
 

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.910
problem with them isn't necessarily just
that they're there that we make errors

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:57.920
that they're there that we make errors
 

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.760
that they're there that we make errors
or we show these illusions and so on

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:00.770
or we show these illusions and so on
 

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.830
or we show these illusions and so on
it's that we really have a strong

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840
it's that we really have a strong
 

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.990
it's that we really have a strong
feeling that we're not affected by them

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000
feeling that we're not affected by them
 

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.960
feeling that we're not affected by them
so when you show these kinds of biases

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:07.970
so when you show these kinds of biases
 

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.930
so when you show these kinds of biases
and errors and in demos in class

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:09.940
and errors and in demos in class
 

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.790
and errors and in demos in class
students who succumb to them are shocked

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:12.800
students who succumb to them are shocked
 

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.430
students who succumb to them are shocked
and students who just hear about people

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440
and students who just hear about people
 

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.230
and students who just hear about people
succumbing to them kind of laugh like

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240
succumbing to them kind of laugh like
 

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.270
succumbing to them kind of laugh like
you know I wouldn't show that bias yeah

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:19.280
you know I wouldn't show that bias yeah
 

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.250
you know I wouldn't show that bias yeah
so I think one of the the big problems

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:21.260
so I think one of the the big problems
 

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:22.780
so I think one of the the big problems
with this work is actually convincing

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:22.790
with this work is actually convincing
 

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.210
with this work is actually convincing
people no no you know you you will fall

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:25.220
people no no you know you you will fall
 

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.650
people no no you know you you will fall
prey to these things even though it

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:26.660
prey to these things even though it
 

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.460
prey to these things even though it
really feels like you won't so the the

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:30.470
really feels like you won't so the the
 

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.870
really feels like you won't so the the
hope is that the one key work shows that

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880
hope is that the one key work shows that
 

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.570
hope is that the one key work shows that
you know if these biases are really that

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:34.580
you know if these biases are really that
 

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.730
you know if these biases are really that
old you know maybe they're more powerful

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:36.740
old you know maybe they're more powerful
 

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.230
old you know maybe they're more powerful
than we thought maybe we really should

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240
than we thought maybe we really should
 

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.120
than we thought maybe we really should
pay attention to how they're affecting

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:40.130
pay attention to how they're affecting
 

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.710
pay attention to how they're affecting
our behavior

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720
 

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.820
we really are affected by our own

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:47.830
we really are affected by our own
 

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:52.770
we really are affected by our own
expectations so what we taste when we're

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:52.780
expectations so what we taste when we're
 

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.900
expectations so what we taste when we're
eating a particular meal or drinking a

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:54.910
eating a particular meal or drinking a
 

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.420
eating a particular meal or drinking a
particular wine is really based not on

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:57.430
particular wine is really based not on
 

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.760
particular wine is really based not on
the actual taste of that thing but our

00:28:59.760 --> 00:28:59.770
the actual taste of that thing but our
 

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.100
the actual taste of that thing but our
expectations about what we know from the

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.110
expectations about what we know from the
 

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.670
expectations about what we know from the
past so there's you know a series of

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:05.680
past so there's you know a series of
 

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.140
past so there's you know a series of
studies in the economics literature

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:07.150
studies in the economics literature
 

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.780

showing that if you think a wine is

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:09.790
showing that if you think a wine is
 

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.070
showing that if you think a wine is
actually worth you know a hundred

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080
actually worth you know a hundred
 

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.050
actually worth you know a hundred
dollars and but it's really worth ten

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:13.060
dollars and but it's really worth ten
 

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.700
dollars and but it's really worth ten
dollars it actually tastes differently

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:14.710
dollars it actually tastes differently
 

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.920
dollars it actually tastes differently
to you based on your expectation because

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:16.930
to you based on your expectation because
 

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.240
to you based on your expectation because
you know something about you know the

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:18.250
you know something about you know the
 

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.610
you know something about you know the
fact that or you like to think that $100

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:20.620
fact that or you like to think that $100

wines taste better than you know $10

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:22.390
wines taste better than you know $10
 

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.550
wines taste better than you know $10
wine so they wouldn't charge that much

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:23.560
wine so they wouldn't charge that much
 

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.440
wine so they wouldn't charge that much
and so on so our expectations actually

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:25.450
and so on so our expectations actually
 

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.350
and so on so our expectations actually

just kind of what we expect that our
real subjective experiences so the

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:32.790
real subjective experiences so the
 

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.220
real subjective experiences so the
realizing that your perhaps can actually

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:35.230
realizing that your perhaps can actually
 

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.990
realizing that your perhaps can actually
allow you to focus more on your

allow you to focus more on your
 

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.850
allow you to focus more on your
subjective experience and maybe overcome

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:38.860
subjective experience and maybe overcome
 

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.920

that bias down the line

the information we pay attention to
 

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.920
the information we pay attention to
tends to be very local and it tends to

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:53.360
tends to be very local and it tends to
be very relative and that can a lot of
