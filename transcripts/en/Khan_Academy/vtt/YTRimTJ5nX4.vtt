00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:11.240
Let's say we've got a rectangle
and we have two diagonals

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.140
across the rectangle-- that's
one of them, and then we have

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.910
the other diagonal --and this
rectangle has a height of h--

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.080
so that distance right there is
h --and it has a width of w.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.050
What we're going to show in
this video is that all of

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.890
these four triangles
have the same area.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.595
Now right when you look at it,
it might be reasonably obvious

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:47.060
that this bottom triangle will
have the same area as the top

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.440
triangle, as this top kind
of upside down triangle.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.710
That these to have the same
area, that might be reasonably

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.110
obvious. they have the same
dimension for their base, this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.860
width, and they have the same
height because this distance

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.840
right here is exactly half of
the height of the rectangle.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.270
They are symmetric; they
are equal triangles.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.800
They have the same proportions.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.520
Now it's probably equally
obvious that this triangle on

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.340
the left has the same area as
this triangle on the right.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.200
That's probably
equally obvious.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.960
What is not obvious is that
these orange triangles angles

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.020
have the same area as these
green, blue triangles.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.320
And that's what we're
going to show right here.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.930
So all we have to do is really
calculate the areas of

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.690
the different triangles.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.070
So let's do the orange
triangles first. and before

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.310
doing that let's just
remind ourselves what the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.060
area of a triangle is.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.200
Area of a triangle is equal
to 1/2 times the base of

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.030
the triangle times the
height of the triangle.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.260
That's just basic geometry.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.530
Not with that said, let's
figure out the area of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.660
the orange triangle.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.690
It's going to be 1/2
times the base.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.620
So the base of the orange
triangle is this distance

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.400
right here: it is w.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.734
So 1/2 times w.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.800
I want to do that in a
different color; the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.770
color I wrote the w in.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.040
Now what's the height here?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.580
Well we already talked about
it: it's exactly half way up

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.300
the height of the rectangle.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.815
So times 1/2 times the
height of the rectangle.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.700
So what's that going to be?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.295
You have 1/2 times 1/2 is 1/4
times width times height.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.820
So the area of that triangle
is 1/4 width height.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.810
So is that one.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.790
Same exact argument;
they have equal area.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.300
Now what's the area of
these green or these

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.020
green/blue triangles?

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.440
Well once again-- we'll do
this in a green color --area

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.980
is equal to 1/2 base.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.680
So these guys are
turned on their side.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.550
The best base I can think of
is this distance right here.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.110
Or if you look at this triangle
it's this distance right here;

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.900
it is the height of the
rectangle So now we're dealing

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.080
with, the base in this case is
the height of the rectangle.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.890
Don't want you to
get too confused.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.210
The height is now
going to be what?

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.950
So these triangles are turned
on the side, so what is

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.170
this distance right here?

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.640
Well it is exactly half
of the width, right?

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.190
We're going exactly half of
this distance right here.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.740
This point right here is
exactly halfway between

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.570
these two sides and halfway
between those two sides.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.880
So this distance right
here is 1/2 the width.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.400
Or the height of these sideways
triangles are 1/2 of the width.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.900
Little confusing: the base is
equal to the height of the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.960
rectangle, the height is equal
to 1/2 of the width. but if you

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.870
do the math here, area is equal
to 1/2 times 1/2, which is

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.450
1/4, height times width.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.560
Or you can just write that as
1/4 width times height, which

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.040
is the exact same area.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.110
So the area here is 1/4 width
times height, which is the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.870
exact same area as each of
these orange triangles.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.570
And it makes sense because
each of them are exactly 1/4

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.460
the area of the rectangle.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.540
Hopefully you enjoyed that.
