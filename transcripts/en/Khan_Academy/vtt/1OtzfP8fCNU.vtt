00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.740
Let's think a little bit about
the graphs of absolute value

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.340
functions.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.310
And I've defined one
right over here. f

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.480
of x is equal to negative 3
times the absolute value of x

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.220
minus 1 plus 9.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.040
And then we've
constrained its domain.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.140
This is for x
being-- or negative 4

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.170
is less than or equal
to x, which is less than

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.720
or equal to 5.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.360
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.795
and try to graph
this on your own.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.920
And clearly you could graph
this by just trying out

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.830
different x-values and plotting
the corresponding x and f

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.255
of x values, but really
think about the structure

00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:32.630
of this expression
to think about

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.990
where does it hit a
maximum or minimum point?

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.280
And where would the
vertex of it actually be?

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.310
So let's look at this
just holistically

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.810
before we even try some points.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.780
So we have an absolute value.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.570
This absolute value
here is clearly

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.450
going to always be
non-negative, and then we're

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.900
multiplying it by
a negative number.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.230
So this entire thing,
you have a negative times

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.640
a non-negative, so this
whole thing is always

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.430
going to be non-positive.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.610
The reason why I say
non-positive instead

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.900
of negative is that
because it could be 0.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.050
So this whole part
of the expression

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.470
is either going
to be 0, or it is

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.480
going to be a negative number.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.070
Now, if this is
always non-positive,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.060
what is the maximum
value of this function?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.910
Well, the maximum
value happens when

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.560
the absolute value
is equal to 0.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.420
When the absolute value part of
the expression is equal to 0,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.650
then this part is 0, and the
function hits its maximum value

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.290
at f of x is equal to 9.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.960
So when does our absolute
value part of this expression

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.010
equal 0?

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.340
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.630
When does the absolute
value of x minus 1

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.350
is going to be equal to 0
if x minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.450
If x minus 1 is equal to 0--
or if you add 1 to both sides--

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.240
you get x is equal to 1.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.660
So when x equals 1, we
hit our maximum point.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.580
This thing becomes
0, which makes

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.470
this whole thing equal to 0.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.328
And so we get the
point 1 comma 9.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.430
So let's graph that point.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.440
And actually, let me
do it in a color that's

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.870
easier to see on a
white background.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.760
1 comma 9 is the maximum
point right over here.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.150
And you could also
view this as the vertex

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.460
of this absolute value function.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.870
So 1 comma 9 is that
point right over there.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.120
And so we can already guess
the general shape of this.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.350
An absolute value
function either

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.890
looks something like that, or
it looks something like that.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.226
It would look like this if the
coefficient right over here--

00:02:59.226 --> 00:03:01.350
or i guess maybe I shouldn't
call it a coefficient.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.850
If the thing multiplying the
absolute value was positive,

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.600
then would it be upward
opening like that.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.520
But since it is negative, it is
going to be downward opening.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.400
We hit a maximum point
at the vertex in the case

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.790
we're just talking about for
the reasons we just discussed.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.322
But then what happens there?

00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:22.030
What happens to the
right of that vertex,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.990
and what happens to the
left of this vertex?

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.400
We don't have to do it this way.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.470
Once again, you could just
try out points if you like,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.090
but I like to really analyze
what's going on here.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.980
So let's break up this function
definition into two pieces.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.092
So let's say that f
of x is equal to--

00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:42.710
and we're going to break
it up into two pieces, one

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.240
piece to the right
of the vertex and one

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.590
piece to the left of the vertex.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.290
So to the right of
the vertex, that's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.380
going to be 1 is less than or
equal to x, which is less than

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.810
or equal to 5.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.762
And to the left
of the vertex-- so

00:03:59.762 --> 00:04:01.220
this is to the
right of the vertex.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.163
To the left of the vertex,
that's going to be-- let

00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:05.750
me do this in a different color.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.750
That's going to be negative
4 is less than or equal to x,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.300
and I'll just say less than 1.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.250
So just to be clear,
our whole domain

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.370
was between negative 4 and 5.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.227
Between negative 4 and
5 was our entire domain.

00:04:23.227 --> 00:04:25.310
Now, I'm breaking it up
to the right of the vertex

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.060
and the left of the vertex.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.750
So this right over here is
to the right of the vertex,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.810
and this right over here is
to the left of the vertex.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.580
So to the right of
the vertex, for x

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.930
being greater than or equal to
1, this absolute value-- or one

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.600
way to think about it, when x
is greater than or equal to 1,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.881
x minus 1 is going
to be positive,

00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:49.630
and the absolute value
of a positive thing

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.000
is just going to
be that same value.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.310
So for x is greater
than or equal to 1,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.310
our function is going to be
negative 3 times x minus 1 plus

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.280
9.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.860
Or if you wanted to
distribute the negative 3,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.270
this would be the same thing.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.186
Actually, let me write
it over here so that we

00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:10.650
can write the
simplified version.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.320
So it would be-- let me
give myself some space.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.480
So for x is greater
than or equal to 1,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.480
we don't have to think
about the absolute value.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.400
So it would be negative
3 times x minus 1

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:30.470
plus 9, which is negative
3x plus 3 plus 9,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.920
or negative 3x plus 12.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.900
So it's going to be
negative 3x plus 12

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.010
when x is greater
than or equal to 1.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.100
And the really interesting
thing, the slope

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.290
here is negative.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.517
We have a slope of negative 3.

00:05:44.517 --> 00:05:47.100
So starting from this point, if
we have a slope of negative 3,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.060
that means every time we move
1, increase in the x-direction,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.970
we're going to decrease
by 3 in the y-direction,

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.300
increase by x,
decrease by y by 3.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.200
So it's a slope of negative 3.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.410
So it will look like that.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.480
And let me actually
do it in purple

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.970
so that you can actually see it.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.509
That's not purple.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:09.050
There you go.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.340
That's purple.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.090
All right.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.815
So it would look like that.

00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:17.440
And actually let me
just make it clear.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.520
This is what I'm talking
about right over here.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.580
That piece of the function
is going to look like that.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.550
Now, what about when
x is less than 1?

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.240
Well, when x is less
than 1, x minus 1

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.770
is going to be negative,
and so the absolute value

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.190
is going to be the negative
of that actual function.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.770
So when x is less than
1-- let me write this.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.340
The absolute value
of x minus 1 is

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.300
equal to the negative of x
minus 1, which is the same thing

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.900
as 1 minus x.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:01.500
So our function is going to
be negative 3 times 1 minus x

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.730
plus 9, which is the
same thing as-- let's

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.370
see, if you distribute the
negative 3, it's negative 3

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:15.310
plus 3x plus 9, which
is equal to 3x plus 6.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.010
So the important
thing to realize here

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.390
is that our slope is positive 3.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.530
And you could even say that we
have a y-intercept here at 6,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.534
so it would be this
point right over here,

00:07:29.534 --> 00:07:30.950
and the line would
look like this.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.270
When your slope is positive
3, you increase x by 1,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.800
you increase y by 3.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.390
Or another way of thinking about
it, if you decrease x by 1,

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.690
then you decrease y by 3.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.570
So it would look like that.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.680
And we are done.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.010
We have graphed this
absolute value equation.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.510
Now, the whole
reason why I did this

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.660
is just so we learn it
a little bit deeper.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.990
But there would have been
a faster way of doing this.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.448
You could have just
said, hey, this

00:08:09.448 --> 00:08:11.710
is going to hit a maximum
point when x is equal to 1

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.430
because this non-positive
thing is going to hit 0.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.805
So you could have said
1 comma 9 is the vertex.

00:08:16.805 --> 00:08:19.180
And then you could have just
tried out the two endpoints,

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.777
knowing that between the
endpoints and the vertex,

00:08:21.777 --> 00:08:23.610
you're essentially just
dealing with a line.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.785
So you could have just evaluated
f of negative 4 and f of 5.

00:08:26.785 --> 00:08:29.410
You could have figured out these
endpoints and drawn the lines.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.520
But now we understand it
deeper, and that's always

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.620
a little bit more exciting.
