00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.674
Now that we know that we
can view interest rates

00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:04.672
as essentially the price of renting money.

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:06.672
I want to go through a bunch of scenarios

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:09.545
just so we can understand
how different things that

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:12.543
happen in the economy might
effect interest rates.

00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:15.123
I just draw a bunch of
supply and demand curves

00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:17.474
right over here. Once
again we're talking about

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:20.474
the market for essentially renting money.

00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:23.413
That right over here
is the price of money,

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:27.408
which we know is the interest rate on the

00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:31.150
vertical axis. Then the
horizontal axis we have

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.007
the quantity of money
that is borrow or lent

00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:38.209
in a given time period.
Quantity and this is a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.800
given time period that
is borrowed or lent.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.069
Quantity borrowed in a
year. We know there is

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.338
some ... if we just wanted
to draw a demand curve

00:00:53.338 --> 00:00:55.939
our starting demand curve.
The first few dollars

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.006
out in the economy
people are willing to pay

00:00:58.006 --> 00:00:59.801
a very high interest
rate on them. Then every

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:03.007
incremental dollar after
that people get less

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.400
marginal benefit. They
might not find as good

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.131
of a place to put that
money. Their borrowing

00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:08.736
it for a reason. Their
either going to borrow

00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:10.800
to consume to buy
something that they always

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.550
wanted that they think
will make them happy,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.668
or more likely their
borrowing it to invest it

00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:17.223
and hopefully getting a
return higher than what

00:01:17.223 --> 00:01:20.328
they are borrowing at. You have a marginal

00:01:20.328 --> 00:01:22.993
benefit curve that would
be downward sloping

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:25.199
something like that.
Maybe it looks something

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:30.002
like that. That is our
demand curve or our marginal

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:31.141
benefit curve.

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:33.384
The supply curve. Now,
once again this is the

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:35.004
exact same logic we use
with the demand and supply

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:36.926
curve for any good or service.

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:39.007
For money might look
like this. Those first

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.346
few dollars someone has
a very low opportunity

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:44.671
cost of lending it out,
so, their willing to

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.537
lend it out at a very low interest rate.

00:01:46.537 --> 00:01:48.604
Then every incremental
dollar after that theirs

00:01:48.604 --> 00:01:51.208
higher opportunity cost,
and people will lend

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:53.140
it out at a higher and higher rate.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.260
Then you have a market
equilibrium interest rate.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.346
Let me copy and paste
this. Then we could think

00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:02.133
about what happens in different scenarios.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:06.429
Copy and paste. Now we
have 2 scenarios that

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.356
we can work on, and then let
me just do 1 more. 3 scenarios.

00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:13.594
Let's think of a couple.
Let's say that the central

00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:15.669
bank of our country, in the United States,

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.334
that would be the Federal
Reserve, the central

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.341
bank prints more money.
Then decides to lend

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:23.134
out that money. That
actually is ... in the

00:02:23.134 --> 00:02:26.166
previous video I talked
about the central bank

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.864
printing money and then dropping it from

00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:30.198
helicopters, that is not
how money is actually

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:32.993
distributed. It is
disturbed when central banks

00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:35.927
print money. The way that
it enters into circulation

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:38.197
in most countries is that the central bank

00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:41.197
then goes and essentially
lends that money.

00:02:41.197 --> 00:02:44.056
The way it's done in the US Fed, most part

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:47.318
they go out and buy government securities

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:48.983
which is essentially lending money to the

00:02:48.983 --> 00:02:51.005
Federal Government. They
do that because that's

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:52.832
considered to be the safest investment.

00:02:52.832 --> 00:02:54.663
They go out there and they lend money.

00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:59.060
If this is our original supply curve.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.929
If this is our original
supply curve, but now

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.751
your Federal ... Central
Bank is printing more money

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.758
and lending it out.
What is going to happen

00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:10.463
over here? Your supply
curve is going to shift

00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:15.334
to the right at any
given price, at any given

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:17.794
interest rate. Your going to have a larger

00:03:17.794 --> 00:03:20.540
quantity of money being
available. It might look

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.455
something like ... your
new supply curve might

00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:25.538
look something like that.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.545
Assuming that's the
only change that happens

00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:30.716
you see its effect. Your
new equilibrium price

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:32.624
of money, the rent on
money, or the interest

00:03:32.624 --> 00:03:36.912
rate on money is now
lower. That's why when the

00:03:36.912 --> 00:03:39.049
Federal Reserves say I
want to lower interest

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.049
rates, they do so by printing money.

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.045
They print that money,
and they lend it out in

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:45.985
the market. That essentially
has the effect of

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:48.458
lowering interest rates.

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:50.208
Let's think about another situation.

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:59.257
Let's say this is the Fed
prints and lends money.

00:03:59.257 --> 00:04:01.848
Their lending the money by
buying government bonds.

00:04:01.848 --> 00:04:03.649
When you buy a government
bond, your essentially

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.319
lending that money to
the Federal Government .

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.575
I've done other videos
on that where we go into

00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:09.998
a little bit more detail on that.

00:04:09.998 --> 00:04:11.412
Let's think of another situation.

00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:21.474
Let's think about
consumer savings go down.

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.530
One interesting thing
about savings, savings

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.503
and investment are two
opposite sides of the same

00:04:26.503 --> 00:04:30.541
coin. When you save money
... you literally put

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:34.086
it into a bank. You
have the whole financial

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:36.169
system right over here.
This is the finincial

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.006
system. Financial system.
That money goes out and

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:45.086
is lent to other people.
For the most part,

00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:47.668
hopefully, that money
when it's lent is used

00:04:47.668 --> 00:04:52.257
to invest in someway. This is lending.

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:54.536
If consumer savings
goes down that means the

00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:57.339
supply of money will
be shifted to the left.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.678
At any given price and
any given interest rate

00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:01.674
their be less money available.

00:05:01.674 --> 00:05:04.534
In this situation our
supply curve is shifting

00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:09.586
to the left. That would
increase interest rates.

00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:11.601
Then you could even
make an argument that if

00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:13.869
consumers savings is
going down consumers are

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:16.928
going to borrow less as well. You could

00:05:16.928 --> 00:05:19.842
argue that maybe demand
would go up as well.

00:05:19.842 --> 00:05:23.735
Your demand could go
up and that would make

00:05:23.735 --> 00:05:27.862
the equilibrium interest
rate even even higher.

00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:31.323
Let's do another scenario.
Let's say that the

00:05:31.323 --> 00:05:34.273
Federal Government in
an effort to ... let's

00:05:34.273 --> 00:05:36.489
say that for whatever
reason, their trying to

00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:39.520
finance a war or some type
of public works project

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.321
and they don't want to raise taxes.

00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:44.251
The government decides to
borrow a lot more money.

00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:53.522
The government is essentially
going expand it's deficit.

00:05:53.522 --> 00:05:58.119
The government is going to borrow money.

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:00.410
Here our supply isn't
changing. I'm assuming

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.922
the Central Bank isn't
changing it's policies,

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:05.744
how much it's printing.
Savings rates aren't

00:06:05.744 --> 00:06:08.119
changing. The demand is going to go up.

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:10.657
Government is borrowing
money. The government

00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:13.075
is going to borrow more
money than it was already

00:06:13.075 --> 00:06:15.987
doing. At any given price
the demand for money

00:06:15.987 --> 00:06:18.450
is going to increase. We're going to shift

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.450
to the right, and our
new equilibrium interest

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.919
rate, remember the
rental price of money, is

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.187
going to go up.

00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:27.907
The whole point of this
is just to show you

00:06:27.907 --> 00:06:30.328
that you really can't think
about money like any other

00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:33.326
good or service. If the
supply of money goes

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:37.328
up then the price of
money, which is interest

00:06:37.328 --> 00:06:39.412
rates, will go down.
Let me write this down.

00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:44.586
If the supply goes up
then the price, which is

00:06:44.586 --> 00:06:48.581
just the interest rates goes down.

00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:56.187
If the demand goes up,
then the price of money

00:06:56.187 --> 00:07:03.081
will go up. Interest rates will go up.

00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:04.655
Then we think about all
the other combinations

00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:07.249
where demand goes down,
then interest would

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:09.076
go down. Which is essentially just price.

00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:12.115
If supply went down,
interest rates would go up.

00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:14.494
If something becomes
more scarce the price of

00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:16.395
it goes up. The whole
point of this is just

00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:17.984
to show that it's not that complicated.

00:07:17.984 --> 00:07:20.456
You'll see people say,
oh, government borrowing,

00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:22.334
it's crowding out other
savings, interest rates

00:07:22.334 --> 00:07:24.001
go up, and it sounds
like something deep is

00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:25.855
happening. They are just talking about the

00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:27.592
supply and demand for
money. You just have to

00:07:27.592 --> 00:07:29.674
remember that interest
rates really are nothing

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:32.340
more than the rental price for money.
