00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.242
In the last video, we began
to explore Stokes' theorem.

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:04.700
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.060
is to see whether it's
consistent with some

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.050
of what we have already seen.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.190
And to do that, let's imagine--
so let me draw my axes.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.340
So that's my z-axis.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.680
That is my x-axis.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.610
And then that is my y-axis.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.430
And now let's imagine a
region in the xy plane.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.770
So let me draw it like this.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.670
So let's say this is my
region in the xy plane.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.850
I will call that
region R. And I also

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.580
have a boundary of that region.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.470
And let's say we care
about the direction

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.720
that we traverse the boundary.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.650
And let's say we're
going to traverse it

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.180
in a counterclockwise direction.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.150
So we have this path that
goes around this region.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.890
We can call that c.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950
So we'll call that
c, and we're going

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.010
to traverse it in the
counterclockwise direction.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.310
And let's say that we also
have a vector field f.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.360
That essentially its
i component is just

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.030
going to be a
function of x and y.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.310
And its j component
is only going

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.530
to be a function of x and y.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.780
And let's say it
has no k component.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.230
So the vector field
on this region,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.750
it might look
something like this.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.422
I'm just drawing random things.

00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:21.880
And then if you go
off that region,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.350
if you go in the
z direction, it's

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.700
just going to look the same
as you go higher and higher.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.930
So that vector,
it wouldn't change

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.660
as you change your z component.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.450
And all of the vectors
would essentially

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.790
be parallel to, or
if z is 0, actually

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.100
sitting on the xy plane.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.480
Now given this, let's
think about what

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.010
Stokes' theorem would tell us
about the value of the line

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.980
integral over the
contour-- let me

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.470
draw that a little
bit neater-- the line

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:00.960
integral over the
contour c of f dot

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.960
dr, f dot lowercase dr,
Where dr is obviously

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.280
going along the contour.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.470
So if we take Stokes'
theorem, then this quantity

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.850
right over here should
be equal to this quantity

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.610
right over here.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.850
It should be equal to the double
integral over the surface.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.270
Well this region is
really just a surface

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.450
that's sitting in the xy plane.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.077
So it should really just
be the double integral--

00:02:26.077 --> 00:02:27.660
let me write that
in that same-- it'll

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.310
be the double integral over
our region, which is really

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.110
just the same thing
as our surface,

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.840
of the curl of f dot n.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.437
So let's just think about
what the curl of f dot n is.

00:02:40.437 --> 00:02:42.270
And then d of s would
just be a little chunk

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.510
of our region, a little chunk
of our flattened surface

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.220
right over there.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.180
So instead of ds,
I'll just write da.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.000
But let's think of what curl
of f dot n would actually be.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.060
So let's work on
curl of f first.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.910
So the curl of f--
and the way I always

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.810
remember it is
we're going to take

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.850
the determinant of
this ijk partial

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.820
with respect to x,
partial with respect to y,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.330
partial with respect to z.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.450
This is just the definition
of taking the curl.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.820
We're figuring out how
much this vector field

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.910
would cause something to spin.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.980
And then we want the
i component, which

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.416
is our function p, which is
just a function of x and y,

00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:26.990
j component, which is
just the function q.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.720
And there was no z
component over here, so 0.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.892
And so this is going
to be equal to-- well

00:03:32.892 --> 00:03:34.350
if we look at the
i component, it's

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.960
going to be the
partial of y of 0.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.570
That's just going to be 0, minus
the partial of q with respect

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.450
to z.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.000
Well what's the partial
of q with respect to z?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.190
Well q isn't a
function of z at all.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.470
So that's also going to be
0-- let me write this out

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.330
just so it's not too confusing.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.180
So our i component, it's
going to be partial of 0

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.130
with respect to y.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.000
Well that's just going to
be 0 minus the partial of q

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.290
with respect to z.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.340
Well the partial of
q with respect to z

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.700
is just going to be 0.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.500
So we have a 0 i component.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.260
And then we want to
subtract the j component.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.700
And then the j component partial
of 0 with respect to x is 0.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.079
And then from that you're going
to subtract the partial of p

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.180
with respect to z.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.590
Well once again, p is not
a function of z at all.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.160
So that's going to be 0 again.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.911
And then you have plus k times
the partial of q with respect

00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:34.410
to x.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.320
Remember this is just the
partial derivative operator.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.180
So the partial of q
with respect to x.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.450
And from that we're going
to subtract the partial of p

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.570
with respect to y.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.150
So the curl of f just simplifies
to this right over here.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.880
Now what is n?

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.250
What is the unit normal vector.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.300
Well we're in the xy plane.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.930
So the unit normal
vector is just

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.940
going to be straight
up in the z direction.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.390
It's going to have
a magnitude of 1.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.450
So in this case, our
unit normal vector

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.660
is just going to
be the k vector.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.490
So we're essentially just going
to take-- so curl of f is this.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.880
And our unit normal
vector is just

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.510
going to be equal to the k.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.920
It's just going to
be the k unit vector.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.230
It's going to go straight up.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.160
So what happens if we
take the curl of f dot k?

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.030
If we just dot this with k.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.080
We're just dotting
this with this.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.730
Well, we're just going to end up
with this part right over here.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.930
So curl of f dot the unit
normal vector is just

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.400
going to be equal
to this business.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.260
It's just going to be equal to
the partial of q with respect

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.980
to x minus the partial
of p with respect to y.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.944
And this is neat because
using Stokes' theorem

00:05:57.944 --> 00:05:59.610
in the special case,
where we're dealing

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.030
with a flattened-out
surface in the xy plane,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.960
in this situation, this just
boiled down to Green's theorem.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.030
This thing right over here just
boiled down to Green's theorem.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.920
So we see that Green's theorem
is really just a special case--

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.840
let me write theorem
a little bit neater.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.390
We see that Green's
theorem is really

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.800
just a special case
of Stokes' theorem,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.360
where our surface is flattened
out, and it's in the xy plane.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.140
So that should make us feel
pretty good, although we still

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.240
have not proven Stokes' theorem.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.530
But the one thing that I do
like about this is seeing

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.780
that Green's theorem and
Stokes' theorem is consistent

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.430
is now it starts to make
sense of this right over here.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.810
When we first learned Green's
theorem, we were like,

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.380
what is this?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.565
what's going on over here?

00:06:42.565 --> 00:06:44.190
But now this is
telling us this is just

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.920
taking the curl in this
region along this surface.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.840
And now starts to make a lot
of sense based on the intuition

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.090
that we saw in the last video.
