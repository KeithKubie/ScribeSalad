00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We put all these together, and we have a great series of hypotheses.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What's interesting is the word hypotheses.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I call that a $50 word.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That really sounds pretty important,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I use it when I teach this class in universities.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But you know what?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The word hypotheses is really a fancy word for guesses,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and if you really think about it when you fill out the business model canvas

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
all you have is a series of guesses.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That's it. That's all we have is a series of guesses.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What's great about the business model canvas is it allowed us to organize

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
our thinking not around functional organization like what is sales doing

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or what's marketing doing or what does our spreadsheet say

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but just around a series of thoughtful first guesses

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
about who do we think our customers are and what products are we making for them,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and how much are we going to charge, and that's great,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and you could sit around all day or all week in your conference room

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
figuring out what those are.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But the odds are you're probably wrong, but it's a great first starting point,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but the question is how do we change those guesses into facts?
