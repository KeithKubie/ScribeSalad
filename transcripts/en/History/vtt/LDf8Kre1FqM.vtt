[music playing]

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.840
ANNOUNCER: As a new day
dawns on Oak Island--

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.466
MARTY: Now it's pumping.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.884
ANNOUNCER: --Marty
Lagina and metal

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:11.594
detection expert Gary Drayton--

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:13.096
Yeah, that's better.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.806
ANNOUNCER: --are continuing
their investigation

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:19.102
of an old stone well on lot
16, located near the Money Pit

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.604
area, a structure
they hope might

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:28.194
provide new clues to help them
solve the 223-year-old mystery.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.070
Now we're draining.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.779
Here you go, bud.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.697
Ugh.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:31.740
You know, sort of--

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.408
Thanks.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:36.536
Well, I think I'm ready
to get back in there.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.580
All right.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.331
ANNOUNCER: Having
successfully drained the water

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.209
from the bottom of the
well, Marty and Gary

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.295
are eager to dig for
the metal targets

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.215
that Gary detected one day
ago in the hopes one or more

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.385
of them might be important
clues, or hopefully

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.219
pieces of treasure.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.309
Oh, what a sweet
little place this is.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:06.900
Would be nice to
find another stone

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.859
with an inscription on it.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:08.443
MARTY: Wouldn't it?

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.453
GARY: Unusual shape.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:19.621
MARTY: All right.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:20.330
We'll put this one
off to the side.

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.460
GARY: I'm trying
to feel for things.

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:33.301
MARTY: You wanna try your
metal detector on it?

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:33.885
Yeah.

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:37.263
Thanks.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:42.769
[electronic beeps]

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.978
GARY: I'll put it in well mode.

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:45.230
Yeah.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.359
GARY: [laughs] All
right, let's see.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.072
[electronic beeps]

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.031
It's iron.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.282
Whatever it is, it's iron.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.742
That's too bad.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:00.662
But I'm getting multiple
signals now on this,

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:03.832
ferrous and non-ferrous.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.960
So there could be
different metals in here.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.629
ANNOUNCER: A non-ferrous
signal indicating

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.714
the presence of
a precious metal,

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:14.425
such as silver or even gold?

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:15.426
I'm gonna try and pinpoint.

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:16.010
It's easier.

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:21.724
All right.

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:22.267
Here we go.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.730
Please don't be a nail.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.649
No, it is a piece--

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.150
ooh.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.028
It's a piece of decorated
lead, by the look of it.

00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:35.613
Really?

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:36.656
GARY: Put it in your hands.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.575
There's two pieces coming up.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:39.409
Got them?

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:39.951
MARTY: Yep.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.876
GARY: Oh, it's a--

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.252
What do you got?

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:50.378
GARY: I don't know yet,
but it looks shiny.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:53.548
[laughs] Oh.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.550
It's a-- oh, it's a--

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:01.806
I got a coin.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:02.515
MARTY: Do ya?

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:03.224
Yeah.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.767
It's a coin.

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:06.144
Don't tell me you're gonna
do your gold dance down

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.437
in the well.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.898
It's a 1 dollar--

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.149
Canadian dollar.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.025
Can't believe it.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:12.734
MARTY: You bugger.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.028
Oh, my god.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.363
Bugger all.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.282
I thought that
was a gold coin.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.868
I'm thinking to myself, how
am I gonna dance in here?

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:22.827
You'd do it.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.162
GARY: I would do it, yeah.

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.580
I'm gonna see if there's
any more of that.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.332
But that was like this
piece of decorated lead.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:31.127
You could see there was
some kind of design on it.

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:34.422
ANNOUNCER: A piece
of decorated lead?

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:37.216
Could it be related to the other
lead artifacts the team has

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:41.179
found on lot 21 on the
western end of Oak Island

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.848
and at Smith's
Cove, both of which

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:47.727
may be connected to
the Knights Templar?

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.520
MARTY: I'm gonna get that
cleaned up in a little bit.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.314
GARY: Yeah.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.315
I am getting soaked.

00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:58.655
MARTY: Hey, Rick.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.323
Morning, bud.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:03.409
Gary just found this,
a piece of lead.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.578
RICK: Interesting.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.205
GARY: Oh!

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.623
Detecting anything, Gary?

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:09.666
GARY: Definitely.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.334
There's more metal down here.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.420
But I just can't work 'cause
of the water pouring on me,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.797
and it's--

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:16.798
I wonder how we're
gonna stop that, though.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.299
GARY: It's filling up fast.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.008
All right, mate.

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:21.177
I'm coming out.

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.180
ANNOUNCER: Although the well
was previously pumped dry,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.266
due to the fact that it is
fed by a natural spring,

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:31.187
it has already begun to
refill with groundwater.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:34.107
Because of this,
Rick, Marty, and Gary

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:37.402
have decided to stop their
investigation for now in order

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.613
to devise a new strategy that
will allow them to conduct

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.991
a more thorough search.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.743
I mean, this is a
unique opportunity,

00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:48.413
a well next to the Money Pit?

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:52.041
And being the first person to
get whatever's down in that

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:53.001
well out?

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.002
That's pretty cool.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.254
Pretty cool.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.631
RICK: But, save it for
another day, right?

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.299
Yeah, for sure.

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:03.845
But I'm confident there's
gotta be something down there.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.221
All right, Gary.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.681
A job well done.
