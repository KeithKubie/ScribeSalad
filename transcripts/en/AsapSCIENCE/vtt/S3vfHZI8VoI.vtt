00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.020
allowing us to breathe, construct materials and do a lot more than you might realize.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.380
So, what would happen if it disappeared from the Earth for 5 seconds?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.900
If we first look at the loss of atmospheric oxygen as in oxygen in the air,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.620
you may not want to be traveling.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.800
Without oxygen, the internal combustion engines found in 215 million vehicles in the US alone

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.000
would be unable to turn heat into the work required to push the piston inside.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.320
Cars would most likely not start, and if already moving, would stop running immediately.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.220
Considering that an estimated 100 airplanes take off or land every minute,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.500
the loss of oxygen could also cause some early crash landings all over the world,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.320
although airplanes already in the air could probably glide safely until oxygen returned.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.940
But would you suffocate?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.340
Oxygen does play a crucial role in one of the last steps of cellular respiration,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.840
but luckily our bodies have alternative pathways that help us survive when we temporarily lack oxygen.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.320
For example, during intense exercise, muscle cells will use up all of their oxygen

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.540
and switch to a process called lactic acid fermentation, which uses glucose to produce energy.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.020
Cells lacking oxygen also have been shown to reprogram themselves

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.620
to prioritize and make the most necessary proteins first.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.040
All in all, if you can hold your breath for 5 seconds,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.440
then you'll most likely survive the atmospheric oxygen apocalypse.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.360
But when we take the question literally as in 'What would happen if we lost the oxygen atom completely?'

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.040
obliterating it from compounds like water, quartz and ozone,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.460
then the results become more devastating.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.600
If we consider non-living things alone,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.640
then nearly everything in the material world would turn into a metallic dust once oxygen is done.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.760
This includes buildings, cars, roads, clothes, furniture and more,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.860
as all our materials like concrete, wood, glass, stone, brick and cotton

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.520
all contain or are made up of an oxygen-based compound.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.140
Without the oxygen bond,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.520
many of these compounds would be left with their elements unbound and in their simplest form.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.660
And while all your favorite stores and possessions turn to dust,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.320
they'll be simultaneously collapsing into the center of the Earth

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.540
to be burned in a fiery oblivion.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.460
As oxygen makes up 46% of the Earth's crust,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.080
the ground beneath us would cease to exist.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.820
The ocean which covers about 70% of the Earth would evaporate and become hydrogen gas,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.340
and upon the return of oxygen 5 seconds later,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.680
the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen would release mass amounts of heat as water is produced again.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.060
So, the world would end all around us,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.360
but that's OK. You probably won't be around to witness any of this as all our living cells

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.000
contain water and will, like the ocean, evaporate into space as hydrogen gas.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.340
The rest of us would be dead dust as well.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.040
With oxygen and hydrogen gone, we've lost 75% of our elemental makeup,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.840
and only a pile of carbon, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus and other trace elements

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.180
would be what's left of our bodies.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.740
Without oxygen, it's safe to say you wouldn't feel so good.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.840
Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.520
If you love to hear about apocalypse-type scenarios,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.200
then make sure to check out our newest podcast called "Sidenote".

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.740
It's about human extinction, and whether or not the world is ending and taking humanity with it.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.360
I'll put a link in the description, so you can listen to that.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.640
You can find out whether we are optimistic, or whether or not we think things aren't looking so good.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.400
Make sure you subscribe on YouTube for more weekly videos, and we'll see you next week.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400
See ya!
