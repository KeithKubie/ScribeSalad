well I you know I like to say that we

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590
well I you know I like to say that we
 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.080
well I you know I like to say that we
need a certain degree of polarization

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090
need a certain degree of polarization
 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.560
need a certain degree of polarization
that democracy really depends upon

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
that democracy really depends upon
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.760
that democracy really depends upon
having a certain degree of polarization

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
having a certain degree of polarization
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.000
having a certain degree of polarization
so that voters can choose between the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010
so that voters can choose between the
 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.630
so that voters can choose between the
parties based on which set of policies

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640
parties based on which set of policies
 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.269
parties based on which set of policies
you really support and I think today

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279
you really support and I think today
 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.099
you really support and I think today
it's pretty clear I think what the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109
it's pretty clear I think what the
 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.830
it's pretty clear I think what the
parties stand for people for the most

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840
parties stand for people for the most
 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.450
parties stand for people for the most
part I think understand the differences

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460
part I think understand the differences
 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.649
part I think understand the differences
between the Democratic and Republican

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:34.659
between the Democratic and Republican
 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:40.259
between the Democratic and Republican
parties and they feel that there's a lot

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269
parties and they feel that there's a lot
 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.569
parties and they feel that there's a lot
at stake in these elections and

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579
at stake in these elections and
 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.069
at stake in these elections and
therefore that tends to increase the

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079
therefore that tends to increase the
 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.349
therefore that tends to increase the
level of interest certainly polarization

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359
level of interest certainly polarization
 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.489
level of interest certainly polarization
can go too far and you know in a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499
can go too far and you know in a
 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:54.899
can go too far and you know in a
democratic political system it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909
democratic political system it's
 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.590
democratic political system it's
important that those who are defeated

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600
important that those who are defeated
 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.989
important that those who are defeated
have to recognize and accept the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999
have to recognize and accept the
 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.380
have to recognize and accept the
legitimacy of the winners and the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390
legitimacy of the winners and the
 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.730
legitimacy of the winners and the
winners have to understand that you know

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740
winners have to understand that you know
 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.210
winners have to understand that you know
those who lost the last election may be

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220
those who lost the last election may be
 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.720
those who lost the last election may be
back in power in the future and what

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730
back in power in the future and what
 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.460
back in power in the future and what
we're seeing now in American politics is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470
we're seeing now in American politics is
 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.680
we're seeing now in American politics is
that sometimes the the rhetoric I think

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690
that sometimes the the rhetoric I think
 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.010
that sometimes the the rhetoric I think
it's so heated that you know there's a

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020
it's so heated that you know there's a
 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.910
it's so heated that you know there's a
tendency to sometimes question the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920
tendency to sometimes question the
 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.240
tendency to sometimes question the
legitimacy of the other side and we've

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250
legitimacy of the other side and we've
 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.740
legitimacy of the other side and we've
seen this on both sides that both among

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
seen this on both sides that both among
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.090
seen this on both sides that both among
Democrats and Republicans as a tendency

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100
Democrats and Republicans as a tendency
 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.910
Democrats and Republicans as a tendency
to question the legitimacy of the of the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920
to question the legitimacy of the of the
 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.649
to question the legitimacy of the of the
other party and the other side to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659
other party and the other side to
 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.340
other party and the other side to
question the the loyalty of the other

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350
question the the loyalty of the other
 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.510
question the the loyalty of the other
side the patriotism of the other side

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
side the patriotism of the other side
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.010
side the patriotism of the other side
you know so that kind of inflamed

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020
you know so that kind of inflamed
 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.350
you know so that kind of inflamed
rhetoric can sometimes also lead to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360
rhetoric can sometimes also lead to
 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.540
rhetoric can sometimes also lead to
threats of violence you know and I think

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550
threats of violence you know and I think
 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.279
threats of violence you know and I think
that is very unfortunate so I think

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289
that is very unfortunate so I think
 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.110
that is very unfortunate so I think
while having

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120
while having
 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.580
while having
clear differences between the parties is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
clear differences between the parties is
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.300
clear differences between the parties is
a good thing I think that some of the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310
a good thing I think that some of the
 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.119
a good thing I think that some of the
overheated rhetoric and personal

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129
overheated rhetoric and personal
 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.520
overheated rhetoric and personal
animosity that we've seen in recent

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
animosity that we've seen in recent
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.739
animosity that we've seen in recent
years is really not desirable
