Great job!

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.810
You are ready to go.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.020
In this lesson, you have learned
about responsive design, why it's so

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.130
important, and you've got the tools
to get started developing.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.020
&gt;&gt; And in the next lesson, you will
break down the basic components of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.620
responsive design, like the viewport,
element sizes and tap targets.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.510
At the end of the lesson,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.280
we'll have a chance to apply what you've
learned as you work on the hometown site.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.440
