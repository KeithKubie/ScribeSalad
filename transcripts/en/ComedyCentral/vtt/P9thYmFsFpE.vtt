00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:04.838
PERHAPS THE MOST POPULAR
IS RUNNING A FUNERAL HOME,

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:06.306
AND WITH PEOPLE DYING
DAILY

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.408
FROM EVERYTHING
FROM HEART ATTACKS

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:10.777
TO COLLAPSING
DURING A STOCK PHOTO SHOOT,

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:14.014
THE FUNERAL BUSINESS
HAS NEVER BEEN MORE PROFITABLE.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.249
JUST ASK CANDY BOYD.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:16.884
SHE'S BEEN RUNNING
BOYD FUNERAL HOME

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:20.254
IN LINWOOD, CALIFORNIA,
FOR OVER 15 YEARS,

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.788
AND TODAY,
I PAID HER A VISIT

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:24.391
WITH AN IDEA TO MAKE
HER BUSINESS EVEN BETTER.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.860
UNBEKNOWNST TO CANDY,
I WENT BY THE NIGHT BEFORE

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.263
IN MY USUAL DISGUISE
TO SCOPE THINGS OUT,

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.898
BUT MY BEARD
WAS COMING LOOSE,

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.533
SO I WAS TOO AFRAID
TO GO INSIDE,

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.601
SO I ENDED UP JUST
CHECKING OUT THEIR WEBSITE

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.571
TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:40.040
SO BASICALLY,
YOUR BUSINESS IS DEATH.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.742 line:0%
 
- CORRECT. CORRECT.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.444 line:0%
 
- AND THAT MUST BE
BITTERSWEET FOR YOU.

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:46.413
- I MUST SAY, IT IS.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:49.750
- BITTER BECAUSE PEOPLE DIE...
- RIGHT.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.818
- AND SWEET...
- RIGHT.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.520
- BECAUSE
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.589
- EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
- SO IT'S HARD,

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.758
BECAUSE YOU MAYBE GET EXCITED
WHEN SOMEONE DIES.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.060
- RIGHT, EXACTLY.
- BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE,

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.728
"I'M GONNA PROFIT FROM THIS..."
- RIGHT, EXACTLY, EXACTLY.

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:04.131
- BUT IT'S SAD BECAUSE, "OH..."
- EXACTLY, EXACTLY.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.232
- THEY'RE, LIKE, LOSING.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.433
- EXACTLY.
- SO IT'S A BALANCE.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.668
- IT'S A BALANCE.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.103
- MONEY WAS CLEARLY
IMPORTANT TO MRS. BOYD,

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:12.506
AND I SAW SHE WAS MISSING OUT
ON SOME PROFITABLE SERVICES

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.274
TO OFFER HER CUSTOMERS.

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:16.443
THE PLAN--I WANTED HER
TO GIVE PEOPLE

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.146
THE OPTION
OF BUYING MORE FRIENDS.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.182
- BUYING MORE FRIENDS?
- BASICALLY,

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.484
WHEN YOU DIE,
YOU WANT TO HAVE

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:25.953
A LOT OF PEOPLE
COME TO YOUR FUNERAL,

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:27.354
BECAUSE IT SHOWS
THAT YOU'RE WELL-LIKED.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.456
- CORRECT.
- SO I THINK YOU SHOULD

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.825
GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION
OF PAYING FOR ACTORS

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.861
TO BE FAMILY OR FRIENDS
AT A FUNERAL.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:36.096
- OH, I SEE, I SEE.
- LIKE, TO FILL THE ROOM.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.397
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- YEAH.

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:40.100
- AND IT COULD BE
A VERY PROFITABLE ADD-ON SERVICE

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.368
TO OFFER TO PEOPLE.
- WELL, I MEAN,

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:45.105
IT IS PRETTY INTERESTING.
I DON'T KNOW--

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:49.109
- I'D LOVE TO DEMONSTRATE
FOR YOU WHAT IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.644
- OH, SURE. THAT'D BE GREAT.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.446
-AND MAYBE THAT WOULD
HELP SELL IT TO YOU.
