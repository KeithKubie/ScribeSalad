00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is obviously they are all about local constraints.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
That's the entire point.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Every motions ties together two locations,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and every measurement ties together one location with a landmark.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Multiplication is just the wrong thing here, so they're all about additions.

00:00:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
These are the correct things to check.
