00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:09.205
Spindly trees,

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:11.015
rusted gates,

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:13.195
crumbling stone,

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:15.425
a solitary mourner—

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:18.955
these things come to mind 
when we think of cemeteries.

00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:20.355
But not so long ago,

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.945
many burial grounds were lively places,

00:00:22.945 --> 00:00:25.955
with blooming gardens and crowds of people

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:29.105
strolling among the headstones.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:32.255
How did our cemeteries 
become what they are today?

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.485
Some have been around for centuries,

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:37.495
like the world’s largest, Wadi al-Salaam,

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.535
where more than five million 
people are buried.

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:44.598
But most of the places we’d recognize 
as cemeteries are much younger.

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:46.458
In fact, for much of human history,

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:48.798
we didn’t bury our dead at all.

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:53.468
Our ancient ancestors had many other ways 
of parting with the dead loved ones.

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:55.451
Some were left in caves,

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:56.791
others in trees

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.601
or on mountaintops.

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:00.811
Still others were sunk in lakes,

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:02.181
put out to sea,

00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:04.041
ritually cannibalized,

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.831
or cremated.

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.581
All of these practices,

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.691
though some may seem strange today,

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.228
were ways of venerating the dead.

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:14.858
By contrast, the first known burials

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:17.318
about 120,000 years ago

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:19.848
were likely reserved for transgressors,

00:01:19.848 --> 00:01:22.308
excluding them from the usual rites

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:24.708
intended to honor the dead.

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:28.758
But the first burials revealed some
advantages over other practices:

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:32.098
they protected bodies from scavengers 
and the elements,

00:01:32.098 --> 00:01:35.818
while shielding loved ones from the 
sight of decay.

00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:38.998
These benefits may have shifted 
ancient people’s thinking

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.468
toward graves designed to honor the dead,

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.808
and burial became more common.

00:01:43.808 --> 00:01:47.178
Sometimes, these graves contained 
practical or ritual objects,

00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:49.128
suggesting belief in an afterlife

00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:56.710
Communal burials first appeared in North 
Africa and West Asia

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.660
around 10 to 15,000 years ago,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.690
around the same time as the first 
permanent settlements in these areas.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.130
These burial grounds created permanent 
places to commemorate the dead.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.660
The nomadic Scythians littered the steppes

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.300
with grave mounds known as kurgans.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.640
The Etruscans built expansive necropoles,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.980
their grid-patterned streets 
lined with tombs.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.150
In Rome, subterranean catacombs housed

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.850
both cremation urns and intact remains.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.620
The word cemetery, or “sleeping chamber,”

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.040
was first used by ancient Greeks,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.960
who built tombs in graveyards

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.470
at the edges of their cities.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.016
In medieval European cities,

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:44.256
Christian churchyards provided 
rare, open spaces

00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:45.646
that accommodated the dead,

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:49.106
but also hosted markets, fairs, 
and other events.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:51.046
Farmers even grazed cattle in them,

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:55.006
believing graveyard grass made 
for sweeter milk.

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:58.066
As cities grew during the industrial 
revolution,

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:03.426
large suburban cemeteries replaced 
smaller urban churchyards.

00:03:03.426 --> 00:03:07.766
Cemeteries like the 110-acre 
Père-Lachaise in Paris

00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:12.706
or the 72-acre Mt. Auburn 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:14.636
were lushly landscaped gardens

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:16.636
filled with sculpted stones

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.946
and ornate tombs.

00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:22.186
Once a luxury reserved for the rich 
and powerful,

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:23.856
individually marked graves

00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:27.726
became available to the middle 
and working classes.

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:30.016
People visited cemeteries for funerals,

00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:32.686
but also for anniversaries, holidays,

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:36.066
or simply an afternoon outdoors.

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:41.077
By the late 19th century, as more public 
parks and botanical gardens appeared,

00:03:41.077 --> 00:03:43.497
cemeteries began to lose visitors.

00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:47.346
Today, many old cemeteries are 
lonely places.

00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:50.086
Some are luring visitors back with tours,

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:52.336
concerts, and other attractions.

00:03:52.336 --> 00:03:54.616
But even as we revive old cemeteries,

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:57.396
we’re rethinking the future of burial.

00:03:57.396 --> 00:04:00.386
Cities like London, New York, and 
Hong Kong

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.636
are running out of burial space.

00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:05.286
Even in places where space isn’t so tight,

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.656
cemeteries permanently occupy land

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:10.776
that can’t be otherwise cultivated 
or developed.

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:13.426
Traditional burial consumes materials

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:16.465
like metal, stone, and concrete,

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:19.075
and can pollute soil and groundwater

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:21.045
with toxic chemicals.

00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:23.755
With increasing awareness of the 
environmental costs,

00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:26.165
people are seeking alternatives.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.745
Many are turning to cremation and 
related practices.

00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:31.985
Along with these more conventional 
practices,

00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:34.835
people can now have their remains 
shot into space,

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:36.995
used to fertilize a tree,

00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:38.405
or made into jewelry,

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:39.595
fireworks,

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:42.095
and even tattoo ink.

00:04:42.102 --> 00:04:46.602
In the future, options like these may 
replace burial completely.

00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:50.572
Cemeteries may be our most familiar 
monuments to the departed,

00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:52.382
but they’re just one step

00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:54.312
in our ever-evolving process

00:04:54.312 --> 00:04:57.382
of remembering and honoring the dead.
