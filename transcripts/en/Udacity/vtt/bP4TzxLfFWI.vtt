00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Remember from last unit, it took us quite a bit of effort

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to figure out what the period of a pendulum is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And we don't really want to have to repeat all that same work here with the electric field.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's see if there are any tricks we can do here to make this problem

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
look more like the problem we've already solved,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so we don't have to redo all of the work we've already done.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So in the last unit, we found that the period of a pendulum is equal to 2π times the square root

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of the length of the pendulum over g and this seems all well and good.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Except, we don't know what g is here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, it's tempting here to say, well, this is gravitational field strength

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so because we're dealing with an electric field,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we should just replace this with the electric field strength

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but this turns out to be a wrong assumption and let's see why.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In the case with gravity, we got that the force was equal to -mg

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we have the fortunate coincidence that this m here cancelled out

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
with the m and F=ma which just left the g.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In this case; however, we have that force is equal to the negative of the electric field strength

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
times the charge q and there's no mass here, so the mass isn't get to cancel with that m in F=ma.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Fortunately, we're not out of tricks just yet though, so the fact that I don't have an m here

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
poses somewhat of a problem, but it turns out I can just make an m up here out of nowhere.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If I multiplied this term by m and also divide it by m,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I haven't actually done anything to change this side of the equation

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because I've just multiplied it by 1, but now you'll notice that I have an m to cancel,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which would just leave Eq/m, so make that idea a little bit less confusing,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I can actually call this entire part of this side ge for the electric version of g

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and then my equation will look just like the equation F=-mg, except the g is slightly different.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But because this equation has the exact same form as this equation,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
both of these equations must have the exact same solution.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This means that we can go to our period equation here and just replace g here with ge,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and we know that this will be the period of this pendulum.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Plugging in our value for ge here, we get that the period is equal to 2π times the square root of

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the mass of above times the length of the pendulum over the electric field strength times the charge q.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And plugging in all my values for all of these variables,

00:02:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I get that the period of the pendulum swing is 2.12 seconds. Great job.
