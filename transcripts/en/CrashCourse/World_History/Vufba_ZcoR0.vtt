Hi, I'm John Green, This is Crash Course:
World History and today we're going to talk

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.710
about something that ought to be controversial:
The Renaissance.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.059
So you probably already know about the Renaissance
thanks to the work of noted teenage mutant

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.530
ninja turtles Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello,
and Raphael. But that isn't the whole story.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.220
Mr. Green, Mr. Green. What about Splinter?
I think he was an architect.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.040
Ugh, me from the past, youíre such an idiot.
Splinter was a painter, sculptor, AND an architect.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.860
He was a quite a Renaissance rat.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:34.640
[theme music]

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.340
Right, so the story goes that the Renaissance
saw the rebirth of European culture after

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.800
the miserable Dark Ages, and that it ushered in the
modern era of secularism, rationality, and individualism.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.010
And those are all in the list of things we
like here at Crash Course.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.340
Mr. Green. I think you're forgetting Cool
Ranch Doritos?

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.380
Yeah, fair enough.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.760
Then what's so controversial? Well, the whole
idea of a European Renaissance presupposes

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.640
that Europe was like an island unto itself
that was briefly enlightened when the Greeks

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.570
were ascendant and then lost its way and then
rediscovered its former European glory.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.520
Furthermore, I'm going to argue that the
Renaissance didn't even necessarily happen.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.300
But first, letís assume that it did. Essentially,
the Renaissance was an efflorescence of arts

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.790
(primarily visual, but also to a lesser extent
literary) and ideas in Europe that coincided

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.940
with the rediscovery of Roman and Greek culture.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.830
It's easiest to see this in terms of visual
art, Renaissance art tends to feature a focus

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.910
on the human form, somewhat idealized, as
Roman and especially Greek art had.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.500
And this "classicizing" is also rather apparent
in the architecture of the Renaissance which

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.340
featured all sorts of Greek columns and triangular
pediments and Roman arches and domes. In fact,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.760
looking at a Renaissance building you might
even be able to fool yourself into thinking

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.580
you're looking at an actual Greek building,
if you sort of squint and ignore the fact

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.900
that Greek buildings tend to be, you know,
ruins.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.380
In addition to rediscovering, that is, copying, Greek
and Roman art, the Renaissance saw the rediscovery

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.810
of Greek and Roman writings and their ideas.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.890
And that opened up a whole new world for scholars,
well, not a new world, actually since the texts

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.700
were more than 1000 years old, but you know
what I mean.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.480
The scholars who examined, translated, and
commented upon these writings were called

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.060
humanists, which can be a little bit of a
confusing term, because it implies they were

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.830
concerned with, you know, humans rather than,
say, the religious world.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.209
Which can add to the common, but totally incorrect,
assumption that Renaissance writers and artists

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.709
and scholars were, like, secretly not religious.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.349
That's a favorite favorite area of speculation
on the Internet and in Dan Brown novels, but

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.760
the truth is that Renaissance artists were
religious. As evidence, let me present you

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.720
with that fact that they painted the Madonna
over and over and over and over and over and STAN!

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.000
Anyway, all humanism means is that these scholars
studied what were called the humanities.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.360
Literature, philosophy, history.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.760
Today, of course, these areas of study are
known as the so-called dark arts. What? Liberal

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.780
arts? Aw, Stan, youíre always making history less fun.
I WANT TO BE A PROFESSOR OF THE DARK ARTS.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.960
Stan: The Dark Arts job is a dangerous position.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.019
Yeah, I guess that's true, so we'll
stick with this.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.109
Right so here at Crash Course, we try not
to focus too much on dates, but if Iím going

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.609
to convince you that the Renaissance didn't
actually happen, I should probably tell you,

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.389
you know, when it didn't happen. So traditionally
the Renaissance is associated with the 15th

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.960
and 16th centuries. Ish.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.200
The Renaissance happened all across Europe,
but weíre going to focus on Italy, because

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.230
I want to and I own the video camera. Plus,
Italy really spawned the Renaissance.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.260
What was it about Italy that lent itself to
Renaissancing? Was it the wine? The olives?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.969
The pasta? The plumbers? The relative permissiveness
when it comes to the moral lassitude of their

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.029
leaders? Well, letís go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.879
Italy was primed for Renaissance for exactly
one reason: Money.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.109
A society has to be super rich to support
artists and elaborate building projects and

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.730
to feed scholars who translate and comment
on thousand-year-old documents. And the Italian

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.570
city states were very wealthy for two reasons.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.559
First, many city states were mini-industrial
powerhouses each specializing in a particular

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:47.739
industrial product like Florence made cloth,
Milan made arms.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.560
Second, the cities of Venice and Genoa got
stinking rich from trade.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.960
Genoa turned out a fair number of top-notch
sailors, like for instance Christopher Columbus.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.300
But the Venetians became the richest city
state of all.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.260
As you'll remember from the Crusades, the
Venetians were expert sailors, shipbuilders,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.279
and merchants, and as you'll remember from
our discussions of Indian Ocean trade, they

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:14.589
also had figured out ways to trade with Islamic
empires, including the biggest economic power

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.129
in the region: the Ottomans.

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.089
Without trading with the Islamic world, especially
in pepper, Venice couldn't have afforded

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.530
all those painters, nor would they have had
money to pay for the incredibly fancy clothes

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.419
they put on to pose for their fancy portraits.

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.490
The clothes, the paint, the painters, enough
food to get a double chin, all of that was

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.389
paid for with money from trade with the Ottomans.

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.509
I know I talk a lot about trade, but that's
because itís so incredibly awesome, and it

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.519
really does bind the world together.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.240
And while trade can lead to conflicts, on
balance, it has been responsible for more

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.610
peaceful contacts than violent ones because,
you know, death is bad for business.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.110
This was certainly the case in the Eastern
Mediterranean where the periods of trade-based

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.300
diplomacy were longer and more frequent than
periods of war, even though all we ever talk

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.939
about is war because it's very dramatic,
which is why my brother Hank's favorite video

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:08.110
game is called Assassin's Creed, not Some
Venetian Guys Negotiate A Trade Treaty.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.060
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So here's another
example of non-Europeans supporting the Renaissance:

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.500
The Venetians exported textiles to the Ottomans.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.430
They were usually woven in other cities like
Florence, and the reason Florentine textiles

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.450
were so valuable is because their color remained
vibrant.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.740
That is because they were dyed with a chemical
called alum, which was primarily found in

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.460
Anatolia, in the Ottoman Empire.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.420
So to make the textiles the Ottomans craved, the
Italians needed Ottoman alum, at least until 1460.

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:40.659
When Giovanni da Castro, Pope Pius II's godson,
discovered alum, in Italy, in Tolfa.

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.470
And he wrote to his godfather, the Pope: "Today
I bring you victory over the Turk. Every year

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.840
they wring from the Christians more than 300,000
ducats for the alum with which we dye wool

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.939
various colors, But I have found seven mountains
so rich in this material that they could supply

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:02.189
seven worlds. If you will give orders to engage
workmen, build furnaces, and smelt the ore,

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:07.919
you will provide all Europe with alum and
the Turk will lose all his profits. Instead

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.359
they will accrue to you."

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.580
So the Pope was like, "Heck yeah." More
importantly he granted a monopoly on the mining

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.590
rights of alum to a particular Florentine
family, the Medicis.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.500
You know, the ones you always see painted.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.909
But vitally, Italian alum mines didn't bring
victory over the Turks, or cause them to lose

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:30.169
all their profits, just as mining and drilling
at home never obviate the need for trade.

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.749
Okay, one last way contact with Islam helped
to create the European Renaissance, if indeed

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.140
it happened: The Muslim world was the source of
many of the writings that Renaissance scholars studied.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.580
For centuries, Muslim scholars had been working
their way through ancient Greek writings,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.360
especially Ptolemy and Aristotle, who despite
being consistently wrong about everything

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.260
managed to be the jumping off point for thinking
both in the Christian and Muslim worlds.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.520
And the fall of Constantinople in 1453 helped
further spread Greek ideas because Byzantine

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.140
scholars fled for Italy, taking their books with them.
So we have the Ottomans to thank for that, too.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.080
And even after it had become a Muslim capital,
Istanbul was still, like, the number one destination

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.439
for book nerds searching for ancient Greek
texts.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:10.180
Plus, if we stretch our definition of Renaissance
thought to include scientific thought, there

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.780
is a definite case to be made that Muslim
scholars influenced Copernicus, arguably the

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.560
Renaissance's greatest mind.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.020
Oh, it's time for the open letter? An Open
Letter to Copernicus.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:29.060
But first, let's see whatís in the secret
compartment today. Wow, the heliocentric solar

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:35.499
system? Cool. Earth in the middle, sun in
the middle, earth in the middle, sun in the

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:37.749
middle. Ptolemy. Copernicus. Ptolemy. Copernicus.

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.689
Right, an open letter to Copernicus.

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:40.770
Dear Copernicus,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.659
Why you always gotta make the rest of us look
so bad?

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:45.729
You were both a lawyer and a doctor? That
doesn't seem fair.

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:49.580
You spoke four languages and discovered that
the earth is not the center of the universe, come on.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.500
But at least you didn't discover it entirely
on your own. Now, there's no way to be sure

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:55.509
that you had access to Muslim scholarship
on this topic.

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:59.419
But one of your diagrams is so similar to
a proof found in an Islamic mathematics treatise

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:02.219
that it's almost impossible that you didnít
have access to it.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.840
Even the letters on the diagram are almost
the same. So at least I can tell my mom that

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.760
when she asks why I'm not a doctor and a lawyer and
the guy who discovered the heliocentric solar system.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.479
Best wishes,
John Green

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:15.499
Alright, so now having spent the last several
minutes telling you why the Renaissance happened

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:19.960
in Italy and not in, I don't know, like India
or Russia or whatever, I'm going to argue

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.779
that the Renaissance did not in fact happen.

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:25.039
Let's start with the problem of time. The
Renaissance isn't like the Battle of Hastings

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:28.999
or the French Revolution where people were
aware that they were living amid history.

00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:33.169
Like, when I was eleven and most of you didnít
exist yet, my dad made my brother and me turn

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.540
off the Cosby Show and watch people climbing
on the Berlin Wall so we could see history.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.360
But no one, like, woke their kids up in Tuscan
village in 1512 like, "Mario, Luigi, come

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.560
outside. The Renaissance is here!"

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.620
"Hurry, we're living in a glorious new era,
where man's relationship to learning is changing."

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.680
"I somehow feel a new sense of individualism
based on my capacity for reason."

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.330
No. In fact, most people in Europe were totally
unaware of the Renaissance, because its art

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.930
and learning affected a tiny sliver of the
European population.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.270
Like, life expectancy in many areas of Europe
actually went down during the Renaissance.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.100
Art and learning of the Renaissance didn't filter down
to most people the way that technology does today.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.900
And really the Renaissance was only experienced
by the richest of the rich and those people,

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.640
like painters, who served them.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.380
I mean, there were some commercial opportunities,
like for framing paintings or binding books,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.190
but the vast majority of Europeans still lived
on farms either as free peasants or tenants.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.960
And the rediscovery of Aristotle didnít in
any way change their lives, which were governed

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.780
by the rising and setting of the sun, and,
intellectually, by the Catholic Church.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:38.420
In fact, probably about 95% of Europeans never
encountered the Renaissance's opulence or art or modes of thought.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.120
We have constructed the Renaissance as important
not because it was so central to the 15th

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:46.390
century. I mean, at the time Europe wasnít
the worldís leader in, anything other than

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.550
the tiny business of Atlantic trade.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.620
We remember it as important because it matters
to us now. It gave us the ninja turtles.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.900
We care about Aristotle and individualism
and the Mona Lisa and the possibility that

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.560
Michelangelo painted an anatomically correct
brain onto the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.520
because these things give us a narrative that
makes sense.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.260
Europe was enlightened, and then it was unenlightened,
and then it was re-enlightened, and ever since

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.040
it's been the center of art and commerce
and history.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.740
You see that cycle of life, death, and rebirth a lot
in historical recollection, but it just isn't accurate.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.920
So it's true that many of the ideas introduced to Europe
in the 15th and 16th centuries became very important.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.800
But remember, when we talk about the Renaissance,
weíre talking about hundreds of years. I

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:33.150
mean, although they share ninja turtledom, Donatello
and Raphael were born 97 years apart. And the

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:40.320
Renaissance humanist Petrarch was born in 1304,
229 years before the Renaissance humanist Montaigne.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:45.250
That's almost as long as the United States
has existed. So was the Renaissance a thing?

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:51.880
Not really. It was a lot of mutually interdependent
things that occurred over centuries. Stupid
