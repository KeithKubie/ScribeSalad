00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature, and you look great.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.840
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.480
Nah. Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:17.340
[Theme Music]

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.880
That William Shakespeare, he knew how to deliver
a compliment.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.080
That’s right, today, we’re talking about Shakespeare’s sonnets, 159 poems collected and published in 1609.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960
Mr Green, Mr Green, what’s a sonnet?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.320
Good question me from the past.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.280
In fact, such a good question that your 7th grade English teacher answered it for you, but apparently you’ve forgotten.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.920
A sonnet is a poetic form consisting of 14
lines.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.380
And there are various ways to order the stanzas
and the rhyme scheme,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.700
but the Shakespearean stanza — named for
Will not because he invented it,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.000
but, you know, because he was the best at
it — consists of three four line stanzas

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.690
and a final rhymed couplet.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.660
So, the rhyme scheme is:
A, B, A, B, C, D, C, D, E, F, E, F, G, G

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.700
And the meter in Shakespeare’s sonnets, as in much of Shakespeare’s plays, is iambic pentameter,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.260
which means that every line has 10 syllables,
consisting of five iambs.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.460
Which is just a fancy word for pairs of unstressed
and stressed syllables,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.249
so a line of a Shakespearean poem goes:
duh-DUH duh-DUH duh-DUH duh-DUH duh-DUH.

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:17.729
This turns out to do something to English
speaking brains that’s just very catchy.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.470
Like, a lot of times pop songs are written
in iambs.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.939
Like, a lot of times when we speak, we accidentally
speak in them.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.360
But when I’m trying to remember the sound
of iambic pentameter,

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.440
I just remember John Keats’s last will and
testament, which was one line of iambic pentameter.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.200
“My chest of books divide among my friends.”

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.980
So today we’re going to look at the history and controversy surrounding Shakespeare’s sonnets

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.400
and we’ll look at three particular sonnets.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.530
They’re often known by their first lines,
but they’re also known by numbers.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.669
So, we’re going to look at Sonnet 18, aka
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?,

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:52.969
Sonnet 116, Let me not to the marriage of
true minds admit impediment,

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.509
and Sonnet 130, My mistress’s eyes are nothing
like the sun.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.029
So the sonnet gets started, like so many great
things, in 13th-century Italy.

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:04.109
Dante got into it, and then Michelangelo.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.719
So the most famous early examples of sonnets
were probably those by Petrarch.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.399
He used a different structure from Shakespeare

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.739
and spent most of his time talking about a
woman named Laura

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.819
which you have to pronounce La-oo-ra to make
it fit the meter.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.739
Anyway, he barely knew Laura, but when did
that stop men from romanticizing women.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.920
English sonnets started in the 16th-century and by the 1590s there was a huge craze for them,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.820
kind of like the craze for boy bands in the
1990s.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.020
Except with less choreography and hair gel.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.700
This is more or less when Shakespeare started writing them.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.960
Dates for his sonnets are pretty inexact,
but actually that’s the least of our problems.

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.099
I mean, we know almost nothing about the poems,
except the sweet rhyme scheme.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.939
And that Shakespeare wrote them.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.240
And yes. We are sure that Shakespeare wrote them.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.720
He also wrote all of his plays, although the
earlier and later plays were probably collaborations.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.940
OK?
That’s settled.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.600
So Shakespeare wrote these sonnets, 154 of them, probably some time in the 1590s and early 1600s.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.280
We don’t know if the speaker in the sonnets
is Shakespeare himself or some imagined figure,

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.839
although it’s widely assumed that they’re
fairly personal, as were most sonnets.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.159
And we don’t know if these were all the
sonnets he wrote.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.420
They’re just the ones we have.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.140
And they might have been intended for and
audience of everyone,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.890
or just for the people they were written for,
or for an audience of no one.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.760
However, two of the sonnets showed up in a collection in 1599, so he definitely didn’t keep them too private.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.420
And a contemporary describes him as showing his “sugared sonnets” around to his “private friends.”

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.920
And then, in 1609, a reputable publisher named
Thomas Thorpe,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.940
published “Shakespeare’s Sonnets — Never
Before Imprinted.”

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.540
Well, except for those two published earlier.
Thanks, thought Bubble.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.820
So, the book is dedicated “To the only begetter
of these ensuing sonnets Mr WH.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.720
All happiness and that eternity promised by our ever-living poet wisheth that well-wishing adventurer in setting forth.”

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.900
Now this dedication is signed TT or Thomas Thorpe so we have no idea if the dedication was actually Shakespeare’s,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.240
or if it was just Thomas Thorpe, and we don’t
have any idea who Mr. WH is,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.840
although that hasn’t stopped scholars from
trying to find out.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.960
We also don’t know if Shakespeare wrote the sonnets in the order they were published in,

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.320
or if he wanted them to be published in that
order.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.450
So as originally published the first 17 sonnets
are addressed to a young man,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.010
telling him to settle down and have kids.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.160
And then sonnets 18-126 are still
concerned with that young man. Probably.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.960
Relatively few of the sonnets have gendered pronouns, which has caused a lot of bother over the last 400 years.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.240
But there’s fairly widespread agreement
these days that in these sonnets there is

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.000
a relationship between two men that is passionate,
and possibly even erotic.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.360
And this bothered a lot of earlier editors
so much,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.130
that some went to all the trouble to change
the pronouns from male to female.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.300
So, does this mean that Shakespeare was gay?

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.320
I don’t know!
I wasn’t alive in the 17th century.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.280
I also think it’s dangerous to read biography
into poetry.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.040
Also, in 16th and 17th century England, passionate
friendships among men were common,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.260
and they didn't necessarily involve sex.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.040
That said, I still think it’s worth noting
and understanding,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.420
that all of the most romantic and loving of the sonnets are those addressed to the young man.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.200
Like, sonnets 127-154, the ones addressed
to the so-called black mistress are a lot darker.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.900
And no one’s reading those at weddings.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.920
But about the black mistress or the dark lady, who appears in those sonnets, we also don’t know who she is.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.560
Scholars have suggested royal waiting women, female poets, at least one British-African brothel owner.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.550
But we don’t even know if she was black
as we use the term today,

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.550
or just brunette, in contrast to the blond
young man.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.240
But the dark lady sonnets are more complicated
than the ones addressed to the young man.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.379
The speaker feels tormented and ashamed of
his sexual attraction to the woman

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:35.900
and even in the sonnets praising her, he gets,
as we’ll see, some insults in.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.960
Like, in sonnet 144, he actually compares
the two muses.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.040
He talks of having two loves: “The better angel is a man right fair; The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.”

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.400
One more thing to know:

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.460
Although Shakespeare was a beloved and popular
playwright, his sonnets were not initially a hit.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.720
Like, that 1609 edition?
Pretty much nobody paid attention.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.280
In fact, for 200 years whenever anyone wrote about the sonnets it was to complain about how boring they were.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.620
One editor, explaining why he didn’t reprint
them in 1793 wrote that not even

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.430
“the strongest act of Parliament that could
be framed” would make readers like them.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.289
And yet, I quite like them.

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.869
Like, Shakespeare manages to cram a lot of
emotion even into his highly structured form.

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:22.189
And maybe most importantly, these sonnets make Shakespeare’s case for why he thinks poetry is important in the first place.

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:24.731
That people die, but poetry lives on.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.000
Like, in sonnet 55, Shakespeare writes,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.260
“Not marble nor the gilded monuments of
princes shall outlast this powerful rhyme

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.180
but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.”

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.700
And yet, quick side note, Shakespeare talks about how bright this young man’s memory will shine,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.020
uuh, but we know nothing about him!

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.620
The poetry may last, but people still don’t.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.760
So, OK, let’s move on to sonnet 18.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.560
Now if you’ve seen Shakespeare in Love, you know that Shakespeare wrote this for Gwyneth Paltrow.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.800
No.
He didn’t.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.720
In ‘Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer’s Day,’ the thee in question is that mysterious young man.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.720
Basically, Sonnet 18 is one big extended metaphor.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.650
But the hook is that it’s a metaphor that
the poet admits isn’t especially successful.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.629
Yes, the poet could compare his beloved to a summer’s day, but it turns out this comparison isn’t really apt.

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:15.930
Like, the beloved is nicer than a summer’s
day.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.750
The beloved has better weather.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.510
(Really? Better weather? Well, I guess this was England, so, yeah. Let’s just go with it)

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.699
And there’s always sometimes lousy about
summer days —

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.139
they’re too hot or they’re windy or if
they’re perfect, they’re over too quickly.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.479
But that’s not going to be the case with
the beloved, because just like in sonnet 55,

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:35.599
the poet is going to immortalize the beloved
in THIS VERY POEM.

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:38.210
Thereby he will make the young man perfect
eternally.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.190
Like, a summer day might end, but the beauty
of the beloved is going to go on forever

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.370
“So long as men can breathe or eyes can
see.”

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.160
And this wasn’t just, like, Shakespeare
being arrogant.

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:50.490
It was a pretty common trope of Elizabethan
verse,

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.780
this idea that human life is temporary, but
that poetry is forever.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:00.260
You have to remember, this was a time in human history where mortality was extremely common at all ages.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.599
It’s not like the vast majority of people
died old.

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:04.430
There was a lot of chance involved.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.050
So it makes sense to draw a distinction between
the constant changing of nature’s seasons,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.949
versus the eternality of lines of poetry.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:15.940
In the end, a poem that starts out saying that the beloved is not like a summer’s day,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.760
turns out to be a poem in praise not of the
beloved, or of summer, but of poetry itself.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.270
But there’s one more brilliant twist in
the poem.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.879
I mean, look at the end, future looking verbs
like

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:32.439
“shall not fade” and “nor shall brag”
give way to ones in the conditional like,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:38.600
“can read” and “can see” and then
to the present tense of “lives” and “gives.”

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.480
So maybe Shakespeare is admitting that poetry
has its own limits, too?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.460
And then there’s Sonnet 116, which is the one you’re most likely to hear at someone’s wedding.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.640
This one is also addressed to the young man.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.440
This is in some ways the high point of Shakespeare’s
love poetry,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.440
although it’s perhaps a more insecure poem
than it seems at first.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.470
Here it’s not poetry that’s the greatest
thing ever,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.090
although Shakespeare definitely gives a hat
tip to his own writing, but love itself.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:05.570
Now, just as in Sonnet 18, there’s worry
over the impermanence of human life and beauty,

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.350
how “rosy lips and cheeks” will be undone
by time and death.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:15.190
But hey, that won’t matter because love will last eternally or at least until “the edge of doom”

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.880
That’s what Shakespeare hopes, anyway.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.390
But maybe he isn’t certain, because he’s
playing some games with the language here,

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.650
and he’s showing how easily change and fickleness
can happen.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.980
Like, when you look at, or read the poem,
notice how easily words change in it

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.500
— alters to alteration, remover to remove.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.000
Maybe he’s worried that love might change,
too.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.840
I mean, look at that first line, “Love is not love,” and look at all the nos and nors and nevers in the poem.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.160
But in the end, he does come to an emphatic
conclusion.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.380
He says that if all the things he’s said about love are in error “I never writ, nor no man ever loved.”

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.800
Obviously, he has written, and men have loved.
So his defense of love is solid, right?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.710
Well, but then remember the line,
“Love is not love”?

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.420
There are all kinds of explorations in Shakespeare’s
work about what real love is.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.540
But for me at least, the best line of the poem is when he writes that “love is not time’s fool.”

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:09.200
True love, to Shakespeare, is not beholden to time. It doesn’t answer to time. It somehow transcends time.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.900
And lastly, let’s take a brief look at Sonnet
130, one of the ones addressed to the dark lady.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:20.240
This sonnet is almost a parody, a send-up of Petrarch’s sonnets about the lovely Laura, whom he barely knew.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.700
That weird Renaissance worship of the person
you met just one time, 20 years ago,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.490
and the constant exploration of every facet of their beauty, their mouth, their eyes, their cheeks, their hair.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.840
It gets a little overwhelming.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.050
In sonnet 130, Shakespeare simultaneously
does that, and refuses to do it.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.140
Like, If he suggested that a summer’s day
wasn’t a good enough descriptor of his beloved,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.070
now he’s suggesting that if you compare
his mistress to any of the typical stuff

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:49.160
—suns, roses, perfume— she’s going to
fall very short.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.300
Her breasts are the color of dun, her hair is like black wires, sometimes her breath smells.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.240
This strange descriptive aggression characterizes
many of the late sonnets,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.760
where the poet seems to feel ashamed about
being attracted to this woman.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.840
But again, there’s a twist in the end, as
there is with every good sonnet's final couplet.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.000
“And yet by heaven I think my love as rare/
As any she belied by false compare.”

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.940
Shakespeare isn’t saying, look, my mistress
has onion breath.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:20.020
Instead, the speaker is instead saying, all of you other poets have been exaggerating like crazy including past me.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:24.840
If you were actually going to describe people realistically, his lover would be as beautiful as any other.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.940
So take that, coral and perfume, and summer
days.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.750
And for me at least, that humanization of
the romantic other is more romantic,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.480
and ultimately more loving than any summer’s
day.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.660
And plus, she’s gonna get to live forever!

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.480
Well, not actually.
Because we’re all going to die.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.660
Even the species is going to cease to exist.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.120
