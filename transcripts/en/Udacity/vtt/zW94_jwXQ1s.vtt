00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, let's see. Let's compare this entry to this entry.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Every thing's the same except for the initial velocity.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What's happened? Well, the object has gone 10  further.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What about this entry to that entry?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well, again, every is the same except for the initial velocity, and the object's gone 20 m further.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
40 is 20 bigger than 20.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For this one and this one, the object's gone 30 m further.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If we compare this entry to this entry,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we've a 20 m increase, 40, and 60.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, what do you know?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
10 m is 10  1.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
20 is 10  2. 30 is 10  3. And so on.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In fact, this is always going to be the case.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The distance an object moves when it has some initial velocity

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is equal to V₀ times the time plus ½gt².
