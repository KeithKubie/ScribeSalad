00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.380
The Truth About Equestrian Statues

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.950
You’ll often hear that the way a soldier’s
horse is portrayed in an equestrian statue

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.910
indicates how the soldier died.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.840
This myth, perpetuated by many a tourist guide
the world over, simply isn’t true.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.380
An example of a tourist guidebook that perpetuates
the equestrian myth is the 1987 Hands on Chicago:

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.070
“At Sheridan Road and Belmont Avenue, the
statue of [General] Sheridan beckons troops

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.070
to battle.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.890
The horse General Sheridan rides is named
Winchester…

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.980
Winchester’s raised leg symbolizes his rider
was wounded in battle (the legs of [General]

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.649
Grant’s horse are on the ground, meaning
he was not wounded).”

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.280
This gives a pretty good account of the myth
as it is generally stated, but leaving out

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.489
the third commonly said option of the horse
having both front legs in the air, implying

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.199
the soldier died in battle.

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.460
Another caveat is that if the rider died of
complications from wounds received in battle,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.859
but at a later date from the battle, most
versions of this myth have it that just one

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.940
leg should be up as with the people who were
wounded but didn’t die of complications

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.389
from the wound.

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:05.670
According to the U.S. Army Center of Military
History, no such tradition has ever existed.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.979
This is not surprising considering that examples
of multiple equestrian statues of the same

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.960
person tend to be inconsistent in terms of
the horse’s legs positioning.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.729
But let’s not take the U.S. Army historian’s
word for it, let’s look at some examples.

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.580
First, take a walk around Washington D.C.,
which has the largest collection of equestrian

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.600
statues of any city in the world.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.570
From this, you’ll quickly be disabused of
the notion that the depiction of the horse’

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.700
legs has anything to do with the way the person
died, with only about 30% of this city’s

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.020
statues conforming to the aforementioned “rules”.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.740
(Given that there are 3 options here, that
30% number seems rather fitting.)

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.740
One of the oldest known equestrian statues
in the United States is the 1853 statue of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.869
General Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Park,
Washington D.C., which was made in celebration

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.939
of Jackson’s victory over the British at
the Battle of New Orleans.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.049
In this statue, the horse has both forelegs
in the air.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.389
Of course ,Jackson did not die in battle but
of tuberculosis.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:06.689
The person who cast that sculpture, Clark
Mills, was the first sculptor in the United

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.780
States to cast a horse with a rider where
the horse has some of its legs in the air

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.480
(in this case both)- at this point it was
more of a mark of the skill of the artist

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.760
to have the horse with legs in the air rather
than any sort of tradition relating to battle

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.040
and death.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.140
In cases where the same sculptor made multiple
equestrian statues that could potentially

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.489
apply to this “rule”, such as the case
of world renowned Irish sculptor Augustus

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.250
Saint-Gaudens, we see that he at times violated
the supposed tradition and other times seemed

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.599
to adhere to it.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.750
One such statue he made of General William
Techumsa Sherman has one of the front legs

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.980
of the horse raised.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.250
Indeed, General Sherman was wounded twice
in battle, and even had 3 horses shot out

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.250
from under him.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.250
He did not die in battle, but lived to the
ripe old age of 71, and is thought to have

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.750
died from pneumonia.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.909
So from that respect, this one fits.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.360
It should be noted, though, that this statue
also has one of the horse’s rear legs lifted.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.489
The equestrian statue horse legs myth doesn’t
seem to cover what that potentially would

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.300
mean… maybe… just maybe… it means the
horse is supposed to look like it’s running

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.270
and has nothing to do with the rider’s death/wounds…

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.850
There is also a major equestrian statue of
General Sherman at the General Sherman Memorial

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.439
in Washington D.C.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.409
This statue has the horse with all four legs
on the ground.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.640
(This is a common theme where multiple equestrian
statues exist.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.019
One would guess the differences have something
to do with sculptors wanting theirs to look

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.520
markedly different than the already existing
statue(s).)

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.549
The only place where this equestrian statue
“tradition” seems to hold with any sort

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.320
of consistency is with a few statues of soldiers
who fought in the Battle of Gettysburg.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.720
(This is thought to be how the myth got started
in the first place.)

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.560
Of the nearly 500 monuments at Gettysburg,
there are 6 equestrian statues.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.810
Five of the six conform to the myth and the
sixth loosely does, but the problem is the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.629
statue of General John Sedgwick, who died
at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House-

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.299
his equestrian statue has all four hooves
are on the ground.

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.520
(Aside: General Sedgwick’s reported last
words were: “What?

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.340
Men dodging this way for single bullets?

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.450
What will you do when they open fire along
the whole line?

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.170
I am ashamed of you.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.500
They couldn’t hit an elephant at this distance.”

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.970
He then took a bullet through his head fired
from about 900 meters (1000 yards) away.)

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.690
Of course, it could be argued that this “tradition”
was meant only to refer to what happened at

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.710
the battle of Gettysburg, in which Sedgwick
was not wounded nor did he die in.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.610
If that’s the case, then his is correct.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.270
However, if that’s the case then the statue
of James Longstreet in that collection is

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.270
not.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.670
He wasn’t wounded in Gettysburg, but his
statue has the horse with one foot raised.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.230
(He was wounded in the Battle of Glendale,
so that would fit there, but not if we’re

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.331
limiting the statue’s positioning based
on the battle of Gettysburg to make the statue

00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:50.260
of General Sedgwick fit.)

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.640
Even then, it seems odd such a code would
be created just for 6 statues of prominent

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.770
people who fought in the battle of Gettysburg,
and even more odd that if the code did exist

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.770
that they would have broken it in one of the
statues.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.180
Given there is no record of the sculptors
having done this intentionally, and the discrepancy,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.060
it’s really not clear that this is what
they were going for.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.390
It’s possible given the small sample size
and that this is the only place we find this

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.911
somewhat consistent correlation, it just randomly
happened to work out that way with the way

00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:21.960
the sculptors decided to make the statues.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.690
So this covers pretty thoroughly the statues
in America.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.470
What about the equestrian statues across the
pond?

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.830
The Ancient Romans had numerous examples of
equestrian statues, but unfortunately nearly

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.160
all were destroyed or melted down for use
in other things.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.670
One of the very few surviving equestrian statues
from Rome was of Emperor Marcus Aurelius who

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.390
died in 180 of an illness.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.510
His horse in that statue has one foreleg up
in the air.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.820
There is no record of Marcus Aurelius ever
being wounded in battle and as a prominent

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.290
Roman and eventual Emperor, it’s unlikely
he saw much direct, close-up battle time (though

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.650
was a part of many battles).

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.050
And if you’re wondering, probably the only
reason the statue of Marcus Aurelius survived

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.610
when most all the others did not is that for
a long time it was misidentified as a statue

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.250
of Emperor Constantine the Great, who was
a Christian Emperor.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.330
Why is this important to its preservation?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.540
Because many of the Roman statues were melted
down to make things like church bells, coins,

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.990
and sculptures for churches.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.850
Melting down a statue of Constantine would
have been borderline blasphemy.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.440
Given this, it’s perhaps no surprise to
learn that there is also a surviving equestrian

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.140
statue of Emperor Constantine, in this case
with the horse having both front legs up.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.990
Constantine did not die in battle, rather
of natural causes.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.190
Fast-forward to more recent times, in Medieval
Europe and there really aren’t many equestrian

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.700
statues, as they were (and are) very expensive
to make and require an exceptionally skilled

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.700
sculptor.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.620
The few examples that exist don’t seem to
correlate at all with any sort of horse leg

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.620
tradition.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.920
For one brief, slightly more recent example,
we have King Louis XIV who had an equestrian

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.600
statue at Versailles with both forelegs on
the horse in the air.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.640
Louis XIV died of gangrene at the age of 77,
not in battle.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.380
Given that many a sculptor has worked on equestrian
statues throughout history, if there is supposed

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.090
to be some sort of code, even if not generally
followed, there would be documentation of

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.600
it somewhere- after all, they have to pass
that code on.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.630
Not surprisingly, there is not.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.050
It’s almost as if the sculptor just chooses
the horse’s attitude to suit personal artistic

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.550
preference…

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.940
Bonus Facts:
• If a statue with a rider and horse is

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.150
called an “equestrian statue”, you might
be wondering what a statue of just a horse

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.150
is called.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.770
That answer is an “equine statue”.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.590
• “Equestrian” comes from the Latin
“eques”, meaning “knight”, which in

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.419
turn derives from “equus”, meaning “horse”.

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:53.090
• A much lesser known statue myth has to
do with European knights.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.990
The myth goes that if the knight’s statue
or tombstone depicts them with their legs

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.490
or arms crossed, then the knight fought in
one of the Crusades.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.050
The idea behind this is that crossing the
legs or arms represents the cross of Christ,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.560
more or less that the soldiers “took up
their cross” to go fight in the Crusades.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.980
As with the equestrian statue myth, there
is no evidence whatsoever to support this

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.260
notion.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.420
• Another common myth you’ll hear many
a tourist guide around the equator say is

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.830
that what hemisphere you’re in effects the
way the water swirls down the toilet or drain.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.800
They’ll even sometimes take you a few hundred
meters on one side of the equator and show

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.899
you water swirling one way, then a few hundred
meters from that on the other side of the

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:35.990
equator and show it swirling the other.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.990
Magic!

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.150
In fact, of course, what hemisphere you’re
in has almost nothing to do with the way water

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:52.209
swirls down toilets 

00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:54.829
and drains.
