00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.690
 
good afternoon and thank you for coming

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700
good afternoon and thank you for coming
 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.290
good afternoon and thank you for coming
to listen to me

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300
to listen to me
 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.200
to listen to me
as you heard I've been here so long ago

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210
as you heard I've been here so long ago
 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210
as you heard I've been here so long ago
before even this university was

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
before even this university was
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.240
before even this university was
established as it is now

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250
established as it is now
 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.330
established as it is now
it was the mirror Institute and I must

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
it was the mirror Institute and I must
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.440
it was the mirror Institute and I must
tell you it looks the same most of it

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450
tell you it looks the same most of it
 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.049
tell you it looks the same most of it
the ceiling is the same

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059
the ceiling is the same
 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.740
the ceiling is the same
the elevators are the same the flow is

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
the elevators are the same the flow is
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.090
the elevators are the same the flow is
the same people have changed and the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
the same people have changed and the
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.479
the same people have changed and the
entrance is not for the 5th Avenue but

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
entrance is not for the 5th Avenue but
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.139
entrance is not for the 5th Avenue but
otherwise I'm really happy to come back

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
otherwise I'm really happy to come back
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.799
otherwise I'm really happy to come back
here since I left 50 years ago more or

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
here since I left 50 years ago more or
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.270
here since I left 50 years ago more or
less 50 years ago I was here only once

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280
less 50 years ago I was here only once
 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.280
less 50 years ago I was here only once
invited to give a lecture and they today

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290
invited to give a lecture and they today
 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.690
invited to give a lecture and they today
so a may collect the statistics that was

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
so a may collect the statistics that was
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.380
so a may collect the statistics that was
given earlier certain pH days today

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
given earlier certain pH days today
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.100
given earlier certain pH days today
I think it's 14 because I also got one

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110
 
 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.540
 
[Applause]

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550
 
 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.050
 
and I must tell you that in my opinion

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060
and I must tell you that in my opinion
 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.590
and I must tell you that in my opinion
although the ceremonies here are longer

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600
although the ceremonies here are longer
 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.740
although the ceremonies here are longer
than in many other places it's very

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750
than in many other places it's very
 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.470
than in many other places it's very
impressive they are very impressive and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480
impressive they are very impressive and
 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.060
impressive they are very impressive and
people are very friendly and I think it

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070
people are very friendly and I think it
 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.640
people are very friendly and I think it
includes you as part of of this

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650
includes you as part of of this
 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.240
includes you as part of of this
establishment so I don't really know

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250
establishment so I don't really know
 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.710
establishment so I don't really know
what to tell you and what you want to

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720
what to tell you and what you want to
 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.790
what to tell you and what you want to
hear and maybe I will start with a

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800
hear and maybe I will start with a
 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.710
hear and maybe I will start with a
question that they few questions that

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720
question that they few questions that
 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.880
question that they few questions that
everybody asks me oh not everybody saw

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890
everybody asks me oh not everybody saw
 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.720
everybody asks me oh not everybody saw
it many times I'm being asked how come

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
it many times I'm being asked how come
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.200
it many times I'm being asked how come
we went on for such a long time on a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210
we went on for such a long time on a
 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.600
we went on for such a long time on a
project that was considered impossible

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610
project that was considered impossible
 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.780
project that was considered impossible
and the answer is I was really curious

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790
and the answer is I was really curious
 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.990
and the answer is I was really curious
I was curious since I was five years old

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000
I was curious since I was five years old
 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.560
I was curious since I was five years old
but on this particular point which say

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570
but on this particular point which say
 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.390
but on this particular point which say
this particular question which I want to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400
this particular question which I want to
 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.449
this particular question which I want to
describe now in a few sentences this was

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459
describe now in a few sentences this was
 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.750

my dream was to understand it so let me

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760
my dream was to understand it so let me
 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.490
my dream was to understand it so let me

function is is done and the ribosome

function is is done and the ribosome
 

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.660
function is is done and the ribosome
cannot function and next generation will

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:18.670
cannot function and next generation will
 

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.610
cannot function and next generation will
not have protein so we'll have one for

identified a few of them and we are
 

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.260
identified a few of them and we are
working on it now so I see that maybe we

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:58.270
working on it now so I see that maybe we
 

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.400
