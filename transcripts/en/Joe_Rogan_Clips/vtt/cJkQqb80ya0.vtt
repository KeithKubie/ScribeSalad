1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.020
To imagine like a police officer walking up to a car that's freaky enough.

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.500
You don't know what's inside.
That's like you're playing roulette.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.920
You don't know what's inside that car.
You know,
like,
look,

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.170
there are some bad police out there.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.090
But as just put yourself in that spot where you're a cop getting out your car,

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.800
walking to a car with tinted windows,
knocking on the window,

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.160
you don't know what you're going to kill.
No.
If it's a barrel of a shotgun,

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.320
you don't know.
You have no idea.
You have no idea.

9
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:35.820
And people have to realize that that tension they carry with them all day,

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.110
they might have 20 of those interactions.
Absolutely.
All Day and,
and,

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.350
and a couple could've been really bad for.
Yeah.

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.830
And if you have you given them any bullshit or don't appreciate or respect that,

13
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.980
they're immediately going to go,
oh,
okay.
Yeah,
he fucking asshole.

14
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.260
And you're the enemy now.
And it's horrible.

15
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:57.060
It's horrible that we give a person the kind of power that police officers have

16
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:57.781
when they abuse it.

17
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:02.781
But it's also horrible that we create this relationship between fellow citizens

18
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:04.930
of prep as a cop is just a citizen citizens,

19
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:09.180
just one of us where we are the enemy if we're not following the book,

20
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:10.590
especially when the book is stupid,

21
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.740
like it's pot laws or something dumb like that,
like,

22
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.950
or you're catching guys getting jerked off like Jesus Christ.
You know,

23
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.620
I've been pulled over a couple of times and I,
I got to say,
you know,

24
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.690
most of them,
like my dad,
you know,

25
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:24.150
they say a a black thing to do when you have a black father,

26
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:28.170
they tell you very early on when a cop pulls you over,
hands out,
let them see it.

27
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.580
You know,
it's taught to us when we're born and raised,

28
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.440
especially where I grew up.
So,
you know,
I even been profiled and I'm like,

29
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.880
you know,
like,
and I'm half black,
you know,
you don't know what I really am.

30
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:42.690
A lot of people,
but I've been profiled so I know when I see,

31
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.470
when I hear the stories and I've been in cars with my friends that are dark skin

32
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:50.910
black and they've been pulled over and it's a thing where you're upset because

33
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:54.570
you feel like you're being profiled.
But man,
what's that cop walks over.

34
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.410
You need to show all due respect because they,

35
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.950
they control that game now it's a 100% their gang,

36
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.040
once they pull up to your window,
you're in their cart.

37
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.170
Of course should think that they are entirely necessary for a civilized society,

38
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:14.400
100% and if you want to be able to call the police,
if some shit is going down,

39
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.590
you should appreciate them when they're there.
And you know,

40
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:20.580
this does not discount all the bad cops.
Yeah,
absolutely not discount.

41
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:23.960
All the things that we've all seen,
the shootings were unjustified punching.

42
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:24.794
They were on justified.

43
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.490
This is what we have to keep though perspective because there's so many

44
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:30.330
interactions.

45
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.430
There's so many cops out there that are dealing with PTSD all day long because

46
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:37.860
for a decade or two decades of their life,

47
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.020
they have been dealing with crime and violence all day long,
every day.

48
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.850
And they dress like the enemy.

49
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.260
They're not just a cop there capo as to where a cop outfit.
So everywhere you go,

50
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.550
like when you weren't playing quake and you play in teams to the hatchery goes

51
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.910
Kuwait dude has a special flag over his head.
You know that's a target.

52
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.110
I mean if you see,
if you see cops are like bad guys,
see cops as the enemy,

53
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.820
you're being paid to be the enemy.

54
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.690
Even if you've never had an interaction of euro bad guy and that's a cop,

55
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.650
that's the enemy.
And that is a crazy but position to ask people to be.

56
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.400
Even for people that don't have interactions with cops a lot,

57
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.290
they still considered the enemy.
Sure.

58
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.350
Cause if they pull you over for speeding like I,
it's gone through my mind.

59
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.060
It's like nobody's on the road right now.

60
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.380
Why are you pulling me over for speeding?
Like I'm not hurting anybody.

61
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.040
It's just a waste of time trying to write a ticket because they have to write a

62
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.570
certain amount of tickets.
And that's,

63
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:35.080
and that's when I think it goes over the top where it's like,
come on now.

64
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.720
I was talking to a cop about that.
I said,
okay,
no,
let me ask you this.

65
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.080
What if everybody agreed to never speed?

66
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.440
Like we made a like a six month agreement in this country where we would never

67
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:48.130
speed and no one speed it.

68
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.370
And there was no more traffic violations in terms of speeding tickets.

69
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.260
What the fuck would happen?
And he was like,

70
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:56.810
people would just get laid off left and right.
They would just,
yeah,
he just like,

71
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.530
I think they would just slash to the police department,

72
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.220
they put quotas on you cause you're a glorified revenue collector.
I mean,

73
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:05.140
that's what those,
don't you think that's a problem though?

74
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.150
Like when you're pulling people over,

75
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.860
and I think that it all looked the problems with the police and people start

76
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:16.540
from the core.
And that's a major problem if you have to pull over people,

77
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:20.470
even if you're a cop and go,
eh,
they're not really doing anything bad,

78
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.180
but I have to meet my quota of tickets that starts from a very negative place.

79
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:29.050
Terrible,
terrible place,
place.
Terrible place in,
terrible place for,

80
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.070
for both parties.

81
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.610
Terrible plays for the cop to bury his head in the sand and realize he's writing

82
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:35.530
someone a ticket for no reason.
You know,

83
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:38.110
like you catch someone speed limit 65 they're sick.

84
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:42.430
They're going 69 you pull them over like kit though.
Fuck,
I've really,
yeah.

85
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.580
You can't even pay attention.
Like there's no way,

86
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.110
unless I'm not looking at the road like it,

87
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.980
unless I have cruise control or I'm not looking at the road all,

88
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:54.190
I might get to 69 and my backup to 65 again,

89
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.620
even if I'm trying to go the speed limit,

90
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.960
but I know people that have been pulled over four miles over 100% yeah.

91
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.460
But as a driver of that car going four miles over,
you're pissed.
Yeah.

92
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.170
Like automatically checked.
Yeah.
You just got jacked in your mind.

93
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.620
Are protecting and we all know he's writing a ticket just to write a ticket.

94
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.880
It's probably the 27th or 28th of the month and they got to meet their quota and

95
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:18.940
he just put like,
that's where they drive driving to Vegas is the worst.

96
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.150
They set up traps and especially close to the end of the month,
you know,

97
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:24.730
if you're driving to Vegas,
go to speed limit because you're waiting for you.

98
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.690
I got pulled over by plane.
Oh have you seen this?
Go into Vegas.

99
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.140
They have planes that now radar you,
they don't even,

100
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.480
and then they send out cop cars,
pull your own radars,

101
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:38.740
you and then a cop car pulls you over lay.
Yes.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.
Yeah.

102
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.690
And that was the last time we went to Vegas.

103
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:45.340
I went with my wife and son and we got pulled like a cop car came out of

104
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:49.150
nowhere.
And my wife,
here's the difference,

105
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.590
you know the,
this shows that my wife is white from Wyoming.
Right?

106
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.840
And this is the big difference.
That's real white,

107
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.750
that that's why it's like pilgrim.
That's like Casper the friendly ghost white.

108
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.100
That's like cowboy,
white translucent.
I literally,

109
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.810
right.
Only cowboys up there.
Wyoming cowboys.
Yeah.
Did you,

110
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:12.610
your wife grew up on a ranch?
No.
Shit.
No,
no,
no.
I think the cities,
yeah,

111
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.580
they grew up in Gillette,
Gillette,
Wyoming.
Oh fuck.
Is that Gillette,

112
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:20.780
Wyoming people there?
I think 3000 come on.
Nah,
seriously.

113
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.800
They're like the Brady bunch.
I married into the Brady plan.
Like,
seriously,

114
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.710
they're real life,
right?
It's like,
good morning Michael.
How are you?

115
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.170
Like they are those peats Kinda cool.
No,
that's great.

116
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.190
So a cop pulls us over for this Vegas trip and this is the difference in

117
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.001
cultures we have.

118
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:38.480
And this is why I tried to tell my wife when the cop came over his name,

119
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:43.370
let's say officer Andrew,
he comes over,
I'm very polite.
I said,
yes sir,

120
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.080
you got it.
No problem.
I was speeding.
No problem.
My wife and the cop goes,

121
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:51.740
we pulled you over by a plane.
So he gives me a ticket and I'm like,
hey officer,

122
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.400
have a great day.
See you too,
sir.
My wife is in the backseat with my son.

123
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.570
Rolls down the window when he's walking away and goes,
excuse me,
uh,

124
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.360
how do you know it was this black SUV?

125
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.340
I see lots of black SUV is passing us and it's from a plane.

126
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.250
Are you serious?
And I'm like,
I'm about to die.

127
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.720
The cop turns back around like comes to my side of the window and says,

128
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:16.840
excuse me Ma'am and it,

129
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.050
but just the privilege to be able to talk to a cop like that cause she has no

130
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:25.460
idea.
She has no idea.
That's the real white privilege.
That's the real one.

131
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.020
And I'm like,
hey.
And I'm like telling the car,
tell me about,
I'm telling the cop,

132
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:34.190
I'm saying,
hey baby,
it's okay.
I was speeding.
You can about this onstage.
No,

133
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.690
you fucking should.
I know,
Dude.
That's hilarious.
And I'm like,

134
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.680
you should for sure.
[inaudible] stage.
It's,
it's just,

135
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:46.150
it scared me because I was scared because she's the cop comes back around.

136
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.940
Write that down right now.
Okay,
Kate,
that pad,
write that down.
Write it down.

137
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.850
You must talk about this on stage.
Wife,
cop

138
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.450
life claim privilege,
plain radar,

139
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:04.010
black SUV,
Wyoming cowboy white people.

140
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.730
We've got a whole suite we got stang catch too.

141
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.140
So shoehorn soap,
horseshoe.

142
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.220
He comes back over and he's trying to explain to my wife like about a plane and

143
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:20.790
she's given this cop attitude.
Oh No.
Yeah.
Oh No.

144
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.750
Well we drive off.
I go,
baby,
you cannot do that.
Like you almost killed me.

145
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.090
She was like,
stop being ridiculous.
I'm like,
no,
no.
You really know.

146
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.810
You really could have gotten me killed.
You'd never,
never,
no wrong guy.

147
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:35.990
Wrong place.
Wrong time.
Wrong history,
wrong background,

148
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:39.680
wrong state of mind that he's in.
What if he didn't like a black dude?

149
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:43.190
Married to a white woman?
For sure.
Yeah.
Like,
and she didn't get that,

150
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:47.000
but now she gets that because we have a son.
You know what I mean?

151
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:51.830
So I think once you have a multi ethnic son,
now she's like,
oh,

152
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:55.410
I'm all about marijuana.
I'm all about,
she doesn't like,

153
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.250
she's all about the ethnic cartoons and not the white,

154
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.880
but she's trying,
she's trying.
She's got a good mindset.
Yes.

155
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:05.040
She's trying to inner families trying,
you know,

156
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.780
it sucks that anybody has to ever worry about getting accidentally shot by a

157
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:10.614
cop.

158
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.330
And the problem I think is not going to go away until the problem of crime goes

159
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:17.130
away.
And that's not going to happen either.

160
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.790
So what do we do to make life safer for everybody?

161
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.240
That's a real good fucking question.
Well,
I think awareness for sure.

162
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:25.950
Like people being aware of all these videos.

163
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.490
That's one thing that I think that black black lives matter did that people

164
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.470
don't want to accept,
but it's really important.
It's,

165
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:36.390
it became a national thought.
Yes.
It's not just another story in the news.

166
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:40.560
It's a national thought.
Like this is a movement to try to eradicate this.

167
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.630
And all the times where you've seen guys plant guns on people after they've

168
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:47.970
shot.
I'm like almost crazy videos.
Yeah.

169
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:52.920
You see videos of black people with no guns getting shot and then here's the

170
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:56.100
problem.
They go to court and then the cops are innocent.

171
00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:59.250
You see the one where the guy throws the gun down on the ground or was it,

172
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.230
was it a taser?
What did he throw down on the ground?

173
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.590
There was like he shot him and then as he's coming up to the body,

174
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:08.400
he dropped something on the ground when I was growing up,
at least,

175
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:11.730
I don't know when it changed,
but cops were supposed to shoot,
not to kill you,

176
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:16.350
but to handicap you,
like shoot you in the leg,
shoots you in the arm.
She doesn't,

177
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:17.370
not that good a shot.

178
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.610
There's a lot of cops that are just not good at shooting guns.

179
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:23.700
I mean there's a lot that our military trained that are very professional and

180
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:26.610
very serious who are,
but it's like,
look,

181
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.810
I've watched a video the other day of a guy getting into altercations,
off duty.

182
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:34.890
Cop got into an altercation with this guy and he tried to pull his gun out.

183
00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:37.200
The guy grabbed him,
grabbed his risk.

184
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:41.400
I did not know how to fight at all and probably only knew how to shoot people.

185
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.090
He gets taken down.
The Guy,
obviously new Jujitsu took.
We took them down,

186
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:47.040
mounted them,
took the gun from him,

187
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:51.320
threw the gun away and beat the fuck out of them from the mount pound doc.

188
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.690
I turns his back.
He gets his back.
He's beating the shit out of them.

189
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.070
It's horrific because this cop thought he was safe and pulled his gun.

190
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.900
But this isn't like one example of like,

191
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:04.020
just because someone's a cop doesn't mean they're a well trained,
prepared.

192
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.740
There are those out there for sure.

193
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.990
There were also some slops like I've seen some guys that are there,
a cop.

194
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:14.460
I'm like,
Bro,
you can't run up block.
Fuck.
Are you a cop?
Yeah.

195
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.451
Yeah.
You know,

196
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:18.960
like this is a ridiculous position for you to put yourself in and anybody else.

197
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:22.800
You're trying to protect your handicap by Gluttony,
you know?
But,

198
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.730
but at the same time,
we do need them.
We need need,

199
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.250
need the cops because we need them to be more respected and appreciated.

200
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.010
They're not very respected and appreciated by a lot of people.
I think that's a,

201
00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:36.210
and see what a huge miss service.
What I hate about this conversation,

202
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.020
whatever side they're on with the cops are gonna pull whatever they want because

203
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:42.870
we've talked negative or not negative.
We said some things about,

204
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.710
and I hate how we're in such a polar place where,
Oh,

205
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:49.980
you're either form or against it and that's like with everything and that's what

206
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:50.281
I hate.

207
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:54.130
You can't have a conversation anymore and that's where we're at right now.

208
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:58.630
It's like you can't say anything wrong with cops because then you don't support

209
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:00.460
the cops.
If you support the cops,

210
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:02.560
then you'll get attacked by the other side going,

211
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.600
oh well they kill innocent people.
I know.

212
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.060
And someone can take a clip of anything that you've said today without further

213
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:13.720
elaboration because most of what you said,
you further elaborate.
Absolutely.

214
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.950
They could take that one snippet and just put a little clip up somewhere.

215
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.740
Michael Yo said this,
or worse yet quoted,
this is what he said about cops.

216
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:22.900
We look,
fuck him.
I thought he was pro cup.
