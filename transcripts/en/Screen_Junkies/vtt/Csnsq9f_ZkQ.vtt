00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.520
From Marvel Studios

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.800
and Universal(?!)

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.020
comes the second movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.240
that we're doing an Honest Trailer for because Infinity War's coming out.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.300
We've already done all the other MCU movies

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.500
and Black Panther...

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.260
isn't...

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.140
on...

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.560
Blu-Ray yet.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.540
Meet Bruce Banner.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.160
No, not the one people like.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.180
Who's that?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.940
He never played the Hulk, did he?

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.640
No, you know the one I'm talking about.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.880
The Death to Smoochy guy.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.360
There he is!

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.820
Ed Norton shines as the first Marvel actor to show off how many crunches he did for the part.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.000
ABS!!!

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.480
And he's bringing his incredible range to a role that has him act like he's on xanax.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.740
"I know a few techniques could help you manage that anger very effectively." "You zip it."

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.680
While off camera he's bringing his incredible ego to a full rewrite of the script under the fake name Edward Harrison.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.380
You want to get Terrence Howarded? Because that's how you get Terrence Howarded.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.240
Join Bruce for a story where he runs away from the military.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.180
Runs away from the military

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.900
AND runs away from the military.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.040
AGAIN

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.780
But sometimes when his little Fitbit thingy hits 200 he'll turn into the Hulk-

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.000
an unstoppable rage monster that's actually a huge danger to the entire planet,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.440
the economy of Brazil,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.520
and all of Harlem.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.320
Yeesh, I'm glad he flew off to not-planet-Hulk

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.060
there wouldn't be an Earth left for Thanos to punch

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.180
"HULK SMASH"

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.260
Before Gwyneth Paltrow took a four year hiatus

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.680
and before Natalie Portman took an indefinite absence?

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.620
"I dumped her, it was a mutual dumping"

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.760
Liv Tyler dropped off the face of the MCU without so much as an easter egg.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.520
Stand and smile as the actress spends much of the movie STANDING and SMILING

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.700
as she doesn't get anything, or even anyone, to do.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.280
"I can't get too excited."

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.260
"Not even a little excited?"

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.560
You've always wanted to see the Hulk match up against a villain that can equal his powers.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.280
Well, too bad, because he's fighting the skinny British guy from Resevoir Dogs.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.100
He's a decorated veteran with zero personal connection to Bruce Banner.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.580
And zero threat to the Hulk.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.080
But when he shoots himself full of tainted Captain America juice

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.400
he'll turn into one of the most forgettable monsters in the MCU.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.900
"The mixture could be...an abomination."

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.080
That was so bad, he got his ass kicked all the way into Batman v Superman.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.320
Go back to the days before Marvel had this whole universe thing on autopilot

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.540
where our nerd boners would only get little tastes of fan service

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.760
A sequel was only lightly implied instead of blatantly setting up five more movies

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.360
It put it's post-credits scene before the credits

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.600
"What if I told you we're putting a team together."

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.000
And didn't make a billion dollars

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.580
AGH... that's like Green Lantern money, ugh.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.020
"I know what it's like

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.560
to not live up to expectations."

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.940
So strap in for this odd sequel, prequel, reboot, origin movie

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.720
that's better than we give it credit for

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.020
Because whatever you think about the film itself

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.860
it gave us Mark RuffaHULK

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.420
"Puny god."

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.960
and paved the way for Ed Norton to join Wes Anderson's fancy boy cinematic universe.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.500
Oh man, I cannot wait for the Royal Tenenbaums to fight Steve Zeesou in Budapest Hotel: Infinity Floor

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.300
Okay Green Goblin, nobody punches out Flash Thompson in this quirky hotel and gets away with it.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.640
"Dónde es... ¿Dónde estoy?"

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.640
"En Guatemala."

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.700
Yeah, it's probably not the first time a white guy got so hammered in Brazil he woke up half naked in Guatemala.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.880
Spring break '97! WHOO!

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:29.220
