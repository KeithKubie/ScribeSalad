00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
CORY: Hello everybody.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.170
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.360
I'm joined in studio today by
Bill Reichert, an entrepreneur,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.050
founder and MD of the
Garage Technology Fund.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.551
How are you?

00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.591
BILL REICHERT: Thank you.

00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:13.245
Doing great.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.520
CORY: So tell us a little
bit about Garage Fund.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.930
And we were talking
a little bit before,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.097
and how that's been an
entrepreneurial endeavor on DC.

00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:23.930
BILL REICHERT: Yeah.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.300
So as I was saying, I
spent most of my career

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.230
as an entrepreneur, starting
up mainly software companies.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.130
And then in 1998 I got
together with Guy Kawasaki

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.320
and a few other people to try
to reinvent the venture space.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.340
And so we started Garage
Technology Ventures

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.150
to be a new kind of
venture capital firm.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.030
And so the big idea was to have
the broadest global outreach

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.180
of any venture capital firm.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.810
So from day one, our big idea
was that the next big thing

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.070
is not really about technology.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.720
It's about entrepreneurship.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.020
And so what we wanted
to do was to tap

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.860
every brilliant
entrepreneur we could find,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.090
wherever they were on the
globe, and then bring them

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.490
in to the venture ecosystem,
fund them along the way,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.440
and take a piece of
equity as part of that.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.570
So we did companies from all
over the world and from nearby,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.030
out of Stanford, like companies
like Pandora on the one hand,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.600
and then a company out
of Finland called u-NAV,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.800
which did a chip.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.900
So we've been all over the
place starting up companies.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.230
So that was the big idea
for Garage when we started.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.950
Fast forward.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.180
It's now 2015.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.960
It's a wildly different world.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.710
And we were right,
it turned out,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.030
that entrepreneurship
has gone global.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.700
And so we've decided to partner
with the group here called

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.400
F50, to create the
F50 Garage Venture

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.320
Fund, to take advantage of all
of energy that's going on here.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.820
So we've got-- for
those of you who

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.240
are listening-- we've got
thousands of entrepreneurs

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.100
here, meeting and greeting
one another across I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.920
think 100 different
pavilions, with all sorts

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.570
of new technologies, from space
technology to software apps

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.980
to 3D manufacturing,
to you name it.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.910
So that's what I love is finding
these brilliant, emerging

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.730
entrepreneurs, figuring out a
way to help them be successful,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.064
and then investing in the
best of them along the way.

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:29.660
CORY: So that's awesome.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.156
And you did turn out to be
really prophetic, it seems.

00:02:32.156 --> 00:02:33.406
If you look around this room--

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:34.540
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.915
CORY: So do you
have any thoughts

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:37.820
as to why that happened?

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.906
Like, why the kind of
rise of entrepreneurialism

00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:41.140
across the globe?

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.970
BILL REICHERT: Yeah, so
the great thing that's

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.170
happened over this
last 15 years is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.380
that through the combination
of the internet and mobile,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.905
and then wireless technology,
and then standardization

00:02:53.905 --> 00:03:00.910
of technologies, you can have
two graduate students in Mumbai

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.430
hack together an app
over the weekend,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.935
launch it Monday, and reach
2 and 1/2 billion people all

00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:08.210
over the planet.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.830
So good news, bad news,
if you're an entrepreneur.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.160
It used to be if you were a
Silicon Valley entrepreneur,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.938
all you had to worry about
were the other Silicon Valley

00:03:17.938 --> 00:03:19.330
entrepreneurs.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.210
Now you've got to worry about
everybody across the planet.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.560
So because of
these technologies,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.540
it's been easier than
ever to start a company.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.720
But the thing not too
many people talk about

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.140
is that it has never been harder
to build a successful company.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.400
So it's this crazy dichotomy
if you're an entrepreneur.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.610
It's easy to get started,
but it's really hard

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.185
to be the winner.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.810
CORY: So that's
interesting, because we

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.210
do see a lot of
opportunity, I guess,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.450
of what you'd call top of
the funnel entrepreneurship.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.074
It's been harder to move through
to what you might call a scale

00:03:55.074 --> 00:03:56.152
stage company.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.680
And so do you see
Garage, at some point,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.730
spending some time
working on that?

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.565
As you saw that wave coming?

00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:05.910
BILL REICHERT: Well, absolutely.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.130
At the end of the day, what
we're most interested in

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.798
is finding the
best entrepreneurs

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:13.560
and then investing in
them through content,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.350
through events, through
online materials,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.917
through speaking and presenting.

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:21.000
We want to give back to
the entrepreneur community

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.710
to help them be most successful.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.960
Now everybody can
go a different path.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.350
And one of the important things
that entrepreneurs should know

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.120
is that the only
way to be successful

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.590
is not through venture capital.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.235
That was a double negative.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.340
But in any case,
there are plenty

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.270
of ways to be successful
without having

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.070
to bang your head against the
venture capital brick wall.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.670
And I'm one of the first
to encourage entrepreneurs,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.130
if you can fund your company
through revenues, God bless.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.010
Go do it.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.440
But sometimes you
need outside help.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.560
You need investors.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.820
And so the big idea behind
the F50 Garage Venture Fund

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.370
is to build this network
of investors, a larger

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.930
community of investors,
who are looking

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.920
for these high performing
startup companies,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.180
co-invest together, and help
those companies be successful.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.730
So unlike a typical venture
fund, which all they've got

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.520
is their own fund, the idea
behind the F50 Garage Fund

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.490
is to bring a
network of investors

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.568
together around these companies
and give entrepreneurs

00:05:32.568 --> 00:05:36.464
access to that larger
network, so it's not just us.

00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:39.440
So that gives entrepreneurs
a lot more choices,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.670
and a lot more potential
to be successful.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.795
CORY: And do you find
this analogous at all

00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:46.390
to some of the online
investing platforms?

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.420
BILL REICHERT: Yeah.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.420
The idea of
syndicating is not new.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.920
The idea of online is not new.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.080
The big idea with F50 is rather
than focusing at the very, very

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.480
early stage crowdfunding
types of companies,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.050
we're sitting sort
of at the next level.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.980
So what we're focused
are the graduates

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.810
of the incubators and
accelerators of the Angel Lists

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.270
and the other
crowdfunding, Kickstarters.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.020
So we want to take
those graduates

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.850
and help them get
to the next level.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.030
So our network is
institutional investors

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.590
that are writing bigger
checks than just Angels.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.770
We also have a lot
of Angels, as well as

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.960
other traditional venture
capital and corporate venture

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.600
capital partners in the model.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.450
So we see ourselves
as being part

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.645
of the continuum of the
ecosystem for entrepreneurs.

00:06:40.645 --> 00:06:42.320
CORY: So how does
that process work

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.166
if I'm an entrepreneur looking
to get found in the community.

00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:47.340
How would that work?

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.150
BILL REICHERT: So
that's a great question.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.315
So the first thing
you do is you plug in.

00:06:52.315 --> 00:06:56.260
And the first place you
plug in is at F50.io.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.280
So go to F50.io.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.420
If you're an entrepreneur,
you can register

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.630
and you can put together your
profile on the F50.io site.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.080
And then you can use that to
tap into a network of investors,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.310
other entrepreneurs,
and other resources

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.460
to help you grow your company.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.890
So the intent is that
the online platform

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:23.350
helps you connect, network, and
learn, but also offline events.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.070
Real time face to face
events are critical.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.755
CORY: So obviously
with the global reach

00:07:28.755 --> 00:07:31.700
that you guys have, you're
going to see a lot of deal flow.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.000
So what is the advice you could
give to entrepreneurs who are

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.612
looking to reach out to you?

00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:39.670
BILL REICHERT: Thank you.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.650
Thank you.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.650
So one thing I
spend a lot of time

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.720
trying to help
entrepreneurs get better at

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.300
is being more effective at
articulating their value

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.020
proposition.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.610
So most entrepreneurs,
most developers,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.760
they love to talk
about their product.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.960
I was there too.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.680
I thought my product was so
beautiful, it was so gorgeous,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.530
it was so sexy, it was so cool.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.270
And we love talking
about our products.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.200
But at the end of
the day, customers

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.390
want to know what value
you create for them.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.050
Investors want to know, what
is your unique and compelling

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.960
value proposition?

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.160
So entrepreneurs,
please, when you're

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.120
talking to investors, when
you're talking to customers,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.360
when you're talking
about your company,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.130
don't get wrapped
up in the product.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.720
Three tricks to
being successful--

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.370
be clear, be compelling,
and be credible.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.799
So be really clear what it
is you're doing and for whom.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.430
Be compelling.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.530
Make sure it's clear what
the value is that you create.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.392
What's your compelling
benefit for your customers?

00:08:51.392 --> 00:08:53.320
It can't just be
a little better,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.130
it's got to be a lot better.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.370
It's got to be insanely
better if you're going

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.400
to get people to pay attention.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.870
And then lastly, be credible.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.475
Because the problem
is, everybody lies.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.970
We all lie.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.290
So that's OK.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.050
But to differentiate yourself
from all the other liars,

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.250
it's really helpful if you can
offer some concrete evidence

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.630
that what you're saying is true.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.420
That you really are different,
that there are customers

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.840
who have looked at what
you're doing and said wow,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.020
that's amazing stuff.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.325
Let's do that instead
of that other stuff

00:09:34.325 --> 00:09:35.710
that we used to use.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.580
So be clear, be compelling,
and be credible.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.188
That's my advice
to entrepreneurs.

00:09:41.188 --> 00:09:42.900
CORY: Yeah, that's
excellent advice.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.100
So we talked about this
a little bit earlier,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.824
we talked about technology
barriers are very low nowadays.

00:09:48.824 --> 00:09:50.240
So the barrier to
entrepreneurship

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.200
is actually pretty low.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.900
What, in the
technology space today,

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.680
whether it's virtual reality
or self-driving cars--

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.370
what excites you right now?

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.120
BILL REICHERT: Needless
to say, investors,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.940
we get this question
all the time.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.240
And I used to then start trying
to pick out the coolest thing I

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.600
saw last week.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.570
And there's always
something incredibly cool

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:12.380
I saw last week.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.840
But the answer is
in fact, pretty much

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.662
everything is
exciting right now.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.450
So my phrase is
everything's trending.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:30.710
It's not like there's anything
that's really out of favor.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.650
Amazingly, gaming is still hot.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.370
And apps are still hot.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.810
But everything
else has opened up.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.520
And so we're looking
at material science,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.930
and what's going on there.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.870
And that leads over into
this 3D printing thing.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.690
And this is the company
I saw last week.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.810
This eye-watering,
amazing technology

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.610
out of Lawrence Livermore that's
going to transform 3D printing.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.030
Unbelievable stuff.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.500
To all the stuff in artificial
intelligence, machine learning.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.650
This artificial neuron
company that I saw,

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:13.740
that is building a neuron in a
chip that is 5,000 times faster

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.310
than a neural network computer.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.470
5,000 times.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.690
Amazing stuff!

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.985
So everything-- I
mean, I can't hardly

00:11:20.985 --> 00:11:26.560
think of a sector that
isn't interesting right now.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.270
Not to mention everything
Google has its fingers in.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.340
You guys have your
fingers in, obviously,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.020
in the virtual reality, and
in the autonomous vehicles,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.520
and all this AI stuff,
and machine learning,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.502
and everything in between.

00:11:42.502 --> 00:11:43.906
It's an amazing time.

00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:45.310
CORY: It's a very exciting time.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.740
BILL REICHERT:
It's unbelievable.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.220
CORY: Quantum on the horizon.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.192
BILL REICHERT: Right.

00:11:48.192 --> 00:11:50.276
Any day now we're going
to have quantum computing.

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:51.942
CORY: And that just
blows everything up.

00:11:51.942 --> 00:11:53.524
BILL REICHERT: And
then now fusion.

00:11:53.524 --> 00:11:54.024
Fusion?

00:11:54.024 --> 00:11:57.426
Fusion's going to happen.

00:11:57.426 --> 00:12:00.342
So it's an astonishing time.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.070
Thanks to Google for stimulating
all this interest globally

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:12.226
around tapping into all
these opportunities.

00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:13.600
CORY: And that's
really why we're

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.180
excited to be places like
here, with these really

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.540
interesting individuals
to be excited about.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.049
So that's a good segue
into another question.

00:12:21.049 --> 00:12:22.715
What is your favorite
Google technology?

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.620
BILL REICHERT: I mean,
there's so many things

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.870
that Google has permeated.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.610
So obviously, Google
Search and Google Mail

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.230
just permeate our lives.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.750
And so we don't even
think of them anymore.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.590
It's like the fish in the water.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.420
You don't know that you're in
water because Google is just

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.370
there.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.040
Unless you travel to China.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.270
And then you kind
of all of a sudden--

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.642
you're in China and you say,
well, let me just-- crap,

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:57.350
I can't.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.020
Wow.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.810
OK.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.726
So that might have been
politically incorrect.

00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:01.890
I don't know.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:07.330
But I just love that
Google is willing to tackle

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.390
anything and everything.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.660
I had the opportunity
to be over at Google X

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.030
and see the renewable energy
things that Google is doing,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.840
and the Wi-Fi things
that Google is doing.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.450
And those are very,
very cool technologies.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.752
But I got to say, just this
last weekend I was particularly

00:13:27.752 --> 00:13:31.536
enamoured of Google Photos.

00:13:31.536 --> 00:13:34.870
Just the beautiful
simplicity with which

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.930
I can just upload that
massive, chaotic mess of photos

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.210
that I've got, and you
guys organize it for me.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:43.710
Thank you.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.586
CORY: Actually, that's one of
my favorite things as well.

00:13:45.586 --> 00:13:47.252
BILL REICHERT: I
really appreciate that.

00:13:47.252 --> 00:13:47.931
Yeah.

00:13:47.931 --> 00:13:49.971
CORY: Well, thank you
very much for joining me.

00:13:49.971 --> 00:13:51.595
BILL REICHERT: Well,
thank you so much.

00:13:51.595 --> 00:13:52.410
It's been such a pleasure.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.175
CORY: And thank you
guys for joining me.

00:13:54.175 --> 00:13:58.130
My name is Cory on site at
Founder World in San Francisco.
