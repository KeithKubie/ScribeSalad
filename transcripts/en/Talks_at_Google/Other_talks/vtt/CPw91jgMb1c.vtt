RICHARD BUERY: All
right, good evening.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.630
So I googled from
inside Google today.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.291
I'm very excited.

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:11.040
No reason, I just
wanted to be able to say

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.990
that I had done that.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.260
I hope everyone's doing well.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.400
Very excited to be here.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.200
Congratulations--

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.200
ERIC SCHWARZ: Thank you.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.699
RICHARD BUERY: --on
an amazing book,

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.730
an amazing career,
an amazing service,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.852
in creating a great
organization, which

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:25.810
I have a personal thanks,
because I think we've

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.190
talked about this before.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.794
My cousin [? Janitzia ?]
[? Rhoades ?] was one

00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:31.960
of the first-- I think maybe
even in the first class

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.350
of Citizen Schools up in Boston.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.710
ERIC SCHWARZ: Yasmina's--

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.751
RICHARD BUERY: Yasmina,
my aunt, my aunt Yasmina.

00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.890
So from my family,
let me say thank you.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.660
So tell me, in starting Citizen
Schools, what was the problem?

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.466
Why create Citizen Schools?

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.840
ERIC SCHWARZ: I
started it really

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.960
out of a sense of frustration.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.420
First, let me say to
Google, thank you guys.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.130
[? Gautham ?] personifies
what's been so amazing

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.010
about this partnership, which
started in Mountain View,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.280
came to Cambridge, New York,
Chicago, Research Triangle

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.780
Park.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.200
And we have like 500 people
like [? Gautham ?] who

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.300
have incredible energy,
incredible passion.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.210
And they teach robotics.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.340
They teach programming
an Android phone.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.460
But they also teach-- I talked
to an 80-year-old guy who

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.664
learned engineering
at age 50 and now

00:01:24.664 --> 00:01:26.830
is one of the top engineers
in the Cambridge office.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.675
He teaches the history
of jazz and blues music,

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:31.910
and kids love it.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.390
[? Gautham's ?] teaching a
6 Degrees Networking course

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.380
this year, and he did
Shark Tank last year.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.330
And it's an amazingly
creative group.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.588
So thank you so much to our
hosts from Google for having us

00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:43.022
here.

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:45.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.790
But Richard, I started
Citizen Schools 20 years ago

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.350
the same reason I really
wrote the book, which

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.420
is both frustration at what
seems like a broken education

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.230
dialogue that was
kind of broken then

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.100
and is really broken now,
a strong sense that we were

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.230
trying a whole lot of things
working really hard to improve

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.169
schools, but doing it within
a box of six hours a day,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.202
one teacher in
front of the room.

00:02:12.202 --> 00:02:14.717
Kids learned just in
that time at school

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:16.050
in a sort of traditional method.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.360
And it was clear 20 years
ago that wasn't working.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.740
It was clear 20 years ago
that upper-income kids

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.810
like me were getting a lot more.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.520
And now there's been
sort of an arms race

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.190
to the top in
upper-income communities.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.130
And kids are getting
much, much, much more.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.160
The gap between upper
and lower income kids

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.780
has gotten much bigger, even
since starting Citizen Schools.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.910
But we also have
more proof that when

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.560
you bring through a program
like Citizen Schools

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.710
the same robotics classes,
the same enrichment,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.160
the same extra academic
coaching, the same extra hours

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.281
of mentorship to
low-income kids,

00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:53.780
they'll get the
same kind of results

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.700
that their
middle-income peers get.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.590
So that was the basic idea.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.020
Bring chances to be
successful, chances

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.860
for kids to meet great
mentors like [? Gautham, ?]

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.840
and chances to have
more time to learn.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.939
Pretty basic stuff,
and it works.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.480
RICHARD BUERY: And
why middle school?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.800
You could have started out
early childhood, elementary.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.900
You could have gone
later high school.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.890
Why middle school?

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.440
ERIC SCHWARZ: Well, as some of
my family members and cousins

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.898
in the room know,
middle school was

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:22.999
sort of a tough time for me, to
the point where at one point--

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.040
RICHARD BUERY: My son just
started middle school.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.650
Please don't scare me.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.510
ERIC SCHWARZ: I saw
that on Facebook today.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.190
Well, fourth and fifth grade
were kind of tough for me, too.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.070
So your son's
probably got a leg up.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.080
But it got so bad, my mom came
in to meet with my teachers

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.390
for the n-th time.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.810
And my French teacher turns
to me after the session

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.060
and says, your poor
mom, your poor mom.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.730
RICHARD BUERY: Oh,
excellent teaching.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.290
Great teaching moment.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.610
ERIC SCHWARZ: So middle
school was difficult for me,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.350
and it's difficult
for a lot of kids.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.340
It's the broken part of the
American education pipeline.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.450
If you look actually at the
international comparisons,

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.150
our kids in fourth
grade are up there

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.180
with South Korea and Finland
and the other top countries.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.020
By eighth grade, we're a
little below the middle

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.750
and headed down.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.722
And I think that's because
middle school kids are, first

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:16.180
of all, pushing
their parents away,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.980
so they need mentors
from the outside.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.529
We don't do a good job of
providing those mentors.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.410
And second of all,
they're at an age

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.570
where they need to experiment.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.440
And we want them to do that in
a good way, in a healthy way.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.340
They need to make things, and
get up out of their chairs,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.525
and move, and learn in
those different ways.

00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:37.040
And too much of school is
around sitting in a chair,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.570
and sort of being talked
to, and memorizing things.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.030
And that may have worked in a
1950s-era industrial economy,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.250
but it doesn't work now.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.500
And so we need to change that.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.760
And the focus of Citizen
Schools in middle school

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.880
feels like the last best chance
to really get kids and put them

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.990
on a pathway to success.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.510
And kids are old enough to
do some pretty cool things,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.685
and they can design
an Android app.

00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:03.310
RICHARD BUERY: You
make a powerful case

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.590
in "The Opportunity Equation,"
available for $10 in the back,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.090
all proceeds benefiting
Citizen Schools.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.410
You make a very powerful
case for the primary driver

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.376
of achievement gap being not
so much the quality of schools

00:05:19.376 --> 00:05:21.500
but the differential
investments that some families

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.990
can make in early childhood
education, out of school time

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.710
learning, summer learning.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.460
Here in New York City,
we're in the middle

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.680
of a really massive expansion
early childhood system.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.430
Starting Monday, we're
doubling the number

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.720
of after school programs we
have for middle school students.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.534
And there was a really-- yeah,
you can applaud for that.

00:05:40.534 --> 00:05:42.285
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:46.060
And it was a really big
bruising political battle

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.770
to get those resources
here in New York.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.460
And I think part of it-- I'm
sure there's a lot to it.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.570
But I think part of it
is that for many folks,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.580
there's this sense, somehow,
that after school is extra.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.925
It's nice gravy.

00:05:59.925 --> 00:06:02.710
But you make the point in the
book that it's not just gravy.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.250
It's the driver.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.760
How do we make that case to the
broader country, that these are

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.975
not nice to haves, but
these are must haves?

00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:13.350
ERIC SCHWARZ:
Well, that's what I

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.150
hope the book will help
to do a little bit.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.020
And before I talk
any more about that,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.260
I want to say that this
guy here is amazing.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.940
And New York's lucky to have him
in the role that he's in now.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.230
But Rich grew up in Brooklyn,
right after Harvard--

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.300
I think right after
Harvard-- started

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.290
an amazing program
called Groundworks

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.660
that does after school
extended learning,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.390
college prep, a whole
lot more, became

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.480
head of the Children's
Aid Society,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.550
and then recently came into
this great leadership role

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.160
with Mayor de Blasio.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.690
But I think you're right.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.530
After school,
particularly 20 years ago,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.680
and still too much
today, is seen

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.720
as an afterthought,
sort of a nice to have.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.700
And I think if you look
at the reason for why

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.940
the gap between upper and
lower-income kids-- which

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.930
when I grew up was
about two grade levels.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.430
There's always been a gap, but
it was about two grade levels

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.930
then.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.260
Now it's four grade levels.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.010
The gap in college graduation
rates was 40% to 6%.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.960
Now it's almost 80% to 8%.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.390
So in both cases, the
gap's almost doubled,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.390
and there's no evidence that
schools are more unequal.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.060
Schools are a little
unequal wealthier

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.790
to lower-income communities.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.390
But there's a lot of evidence
that upper-income families

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.895
have tripled their investment
in learning-- from Russian math,

00:07:28.895 --> 00:07:31.730
to Kuhlman math,
to robotics camp,

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.490
to music coaching, and
all kinds of things that

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.270
build social capital, and
build intellectual skills,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.380
and give leadership
opportunities to upper-income

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:41.880
kids.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.950
And that's what's
created this huge gap.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.989
So I think we just need
to make that clear.

00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:49.030
And we're not going to
stop upper-income families

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.870
for doing that.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.110
I do that for my kids, and
you do that for your kids,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.950
and we're going to
keep doing that.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.290
But if we're going to have
sort of a shadow education

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.850
system delivering incredible
results to upper-income kids,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.933
we need to find a way to
bring that, take that out

00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:06.749
of the shadows,
bring it to all kids,

00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:08.290
so that all kids
have the opportunity

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.172
to do similar cool things.

00:08:10.172 --> 00:08:12.380
RICHARD BUERY: I think one
of the awesome innovations

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.229
of Citizen Schools-- besides
the name, by the way.

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:17.270
I have to ask you how you
came up with that name.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.370
It's one of the best nonprofit
names I've ever heard.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.920
But I think one thing
that's so powerful

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.985
about it is the idea of
engaging citizens in education.

00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:31.740
And you think about
politically, and how

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.271
do you create a
movement like this,

00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:35.770
I think one of these innovations
is that this work is really

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.169
driven by citizens.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.909
You have engineers at Google
who are doing this work.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:40.490
ERIC SCHWARZ: That's right.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.130
RICHARD BUERY: And then there
is a power there in terms

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.169
of making this
movement move forward.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:45.422
I'm curious.

00:08:45.422 --> 00:08:46.630
Was that sort of intentional?

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.220
Did you sort of have in
your mind at the beginning

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.678
that one of the
ways you were going

00:08:49.678 --> 00:08:51.937
to drive this work
forward is by getting

00:08:51.937 --> 00:08:54.020
some of the wealthier,
some of the more resourced,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.690
in society into
schools, or is it just

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.477
sort of a happy
[INAUDIBLE] coincidence?

00:08:58.477 --> 00:09:00.810
ERIC SCHWARZ: No, it was
partly out of a personal desire

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.190
to want to teach but not
be a full-time teacher.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.490
But I think that is something
that a lot of people feel.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.080
There's a lot of people who
want to connect with kids.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.995
And we're giving kids access
to Google and Fidelity

00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:15.160
and other cool places.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.520
But we're also giving those
engineers and those lawyers

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.300
and others access to kids who
have a lot of creative ideas

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.770
and a lot of potential.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.400
And that's a really cool
part of the program.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.710
It is one of our goals to
help with you, and with TASC

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.470
in the room, and others to lead
a movement so expanded learning

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.192
time becomes the new normal.

00:09:36.192 --> 00:09:38.400
And I want to introduce--
maybe he can just stand up.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.090
He's in the room
somewhere-- my successor

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.594
as CEO of Citizen Schools,
who's an amazing person, Steven

00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:44.510
Rothstein in the back.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.432
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:47.432 --> 00:09:50.990
So if you didn't meet
Steven beforehand,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.520
he's an incredibly
skilled political leader.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.180
When he was a
seventh-grader in Brookline,

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.640
he closed down his school in
protesting the Vietnam War.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.050
He knows about commerce.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.620
He built Citizens Energy as
the world's first nonprofit oil

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.930
company.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.140
And we're thrilled.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.520
It's now day four,
day five on the job,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.400
and I'm incredibly
excited to support him.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.530
And he, I think, is
thinking a lot about,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.710
how do we accelerate our work
in trying to build a movement?

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.120
How do we make the political
case for extended learning

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.170
time?

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.460
Part of it, I think, is
getting powerful people

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.610
from all walks of life to
have empathy with poor kids

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.160
so they don't become those
kids, they become our kids,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.740
and they have much more
of a sense of possibility.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.030
And the other thing that
holds back, I think,

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.190
movement on extended
learning is a sense of,

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.260
that's not going to work.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.940
I think there's a lot of
people that say, oh, well, that

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.910
probably can't work.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.590
That's too expensive,
or it just won't work.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.270
And so I think we've made a
major commitment at Citizen

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.990
Schools to develop
top-shelf data, multimillion

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.820
dollar studies that
show this works.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.200
This works as well or better
than the best charter schools.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.710
This narrows and usually
closes and sometimes reverses

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.480
achievement gaps with
middle-income kids.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.560
And so I think data, empathy
through getting powerful people

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.710
connected to kids, and
then just persuasion--

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.400
it's a generational effort.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.630
Because old
paradigms die slowly.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.680
And the paradigm
of just school is

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.849
with the teacher for
six hours, and you've

00:11:26.849 --> 00:11:29.140
got to get kids out to work
on the farm-- we don't have

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.190
many kids leaving school
to work on the farms.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.160
But we still have an
agrarian era schedule

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.460
and an industrial
era delivery model

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.394
that we really need
to move beyond.

00:11:38.394 --> 00:11:39.810
Apologies to this
side of the room

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.246
for having my back
partly to you.

00:11:41.246 --> 00:11:41.996
RICHARD BUERY: OK.

00:11:41.996 --> 00:11:42.746
I'll talk to them.

00:11:42.746 --> 00:11:43.620
You talk to them.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.412
ERIC SCHWARZ: We'll work it out.

00:11:45.412 --> 00:11:47.245
RICHARD BUERY: Can you
talk more about that?

00:11:47.245 --> 00:11:50.520
You talked about the
investments you've made in data.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.880
How do we know that
Citizen Schools works?

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.360
What do you actually measure?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.270
ERIC SCHWARZ: So,
from early on, we've

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.290
figured that people
intuitively trusted

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.990
that a model where
kids get to make

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:09.020
cool things with engineers, and
publish newspapers, and do all

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.660
this hands-on work would
build social skills

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.762
and interpersonal
skills and a set

00:12:15.762 --> 00:12:17.220
of things that are
hard to measure,

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.240
and that Citizen Schools really
does build in the powerful way.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.170
But we figured people
would mostly not

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:27.790
trust that it built grades,
graduation rates, and test

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.710
scores.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.590
And we were starting
in Massachusetts,

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.900
which is lucky to have one of
the best testing systems, which

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.060
isn't perfect but tends to
test higher order thinking

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.180
skills more than a lot of sort
of simple fill in the bubble

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.250
tests.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.370
So we committed 10 years ago to
really be measured in part by,

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.209
do our kids do
better on the MCATs?

00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:48.000
Do they finish high
school at higher rates?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.740
Do they go into college
at higher rates?

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.530
And the first study we did
started about 10 years ago,

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.180
ended about five years ago.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.950
And it looked at kids
just in our optional

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.430
after school program.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.940
And they erased
the achievement gap

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.170
on passing the
MCATs in 10th grade

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.082
having been in the
program in middle school,

00:13:04.082 --> 00:13:05.540
and they erased
the achievement gap

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.540
on finishing high
school on time.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.870
So that was super exciting.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.219
And now we've evolved from
an after school program

00:13:12.219 --> 00:13:13.760
to a model where we
work with schools

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.900
to work with every
kid in the school.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.917
So the whole school becomes
a nine or 10 hour day,

00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:20.500
and we call it
expanded learning time.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.958
And we think that's really the
new model for urban schools,

00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.604
that every kid has a
nine or 10 hour day.

00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:27.020
It's just if you
go to school, you

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.478
don't get out of
school until 5:00.

00:13:28.478 --> 00:13:30.871
It's not an optional
thing to stay or go.

00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:32.370
But it's not all
sitting in a chair,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.770
and it's not all one teacher
in front of the room.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.575
It's a whole second shift
of educators from AmeriCorps

00:13:37.575 --> 00:13:40.580
and from places like
Google that come in

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.080
and really bring alive learning
in the afternoon, but also

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.690
all day long.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.410
And we partner with teachers
in really powerful ways

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.782
to team up throughout
the whole day.

00:13:48.782 --> 00:13:50.990
RICHARD BUERY: And just
following up on that thought,

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.240
you talked before
about things you

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.990
do for your own children,
things I do for my children.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.650
There is a tension,
perhaps, I think.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:05.930
My kids, the crap I take them
to, the art classes, sports,

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.250
and all the stuff, it
never, ever occurs to me

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.030
to sort of ask for an evaluation
of the impact of my child's

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.995
basketball program
on his test scores.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.810
It almost seems
sometimes like we

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.180
think that the things that
our children benefit from,

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:29.625
that we know in our
hearts drive resiliency,

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:32.860
drive teamwork skills, drive
interpersonal skills, just

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.680
drive joy-- sometimes I
just feel like, why don't we

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.680
believe poor kids deserve that?

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:42.580
And that maybe isn't
a fair question.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.630
But why does it always
have to be proven?

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.697
Why can't we just say--

00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:47.030
ERIC SCHWARZ: Just common sense.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.488
RICHARD BUERY:
--that poor children

00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:52.040
deserve joyful
experiences out of school?

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.595
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.740
ERIC SCHWARZ: They do.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.220
They deserve every experience
that upper-income kids

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.010
take for granted.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.960
And those skills
are more and more

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.070
provably important
to moving ahead.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.670
And part of what
the book gets at

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.570
is that while test scores,
if it's a good test,

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:20.210
is a little piece of what you
need, it's sort of a low bar.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.960
That's part of it.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.560
You need that.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.990
It's necessary but
way insufficient

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.940
to be a leader in
modern society.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.720
And there's a chapter
in the book that's

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.410
about social capital, what
Robert Putnam and others have

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:33.730
talked a lot about.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:38.460
Because what moved me ahead
was not so much great grades.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.820
I tested fine, but I had
pretty terrible grades.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.840
But my father knew Gary
Hart, and he introduced me

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.850
to Gary Hart, and I got a
job on that Senate campaign

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.260
as a 19-year-old.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.770
And that was a life-changing
experience for me.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:57.770
And it is social capital that
moves a lot of people forward.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.660
And some people assume,
well, that's a lost cause.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.880
You either have it or not
based on your ZIP code

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.880
or who your parents are.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.560
But that's not true.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.400
Social capital is absolutely
something that can be imparted.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.400
And the kids that
[? Gautham ?] has worked with,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.426
they've learned social skills.

00:16:14.426 --> 00:16:16.800
He learned the hands up thing,
but they learned that too.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.620
But they've also met him.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.600
And in three years, if
they want an internship

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.220
through his cool
summer internship

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.410
program-- I know Boston
has, New York probably has,

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.860
too-- they've got
someone to call.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.690
We have many kids now
who are in college

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:33.000
who had a citizen teacher they
worked with write an essay,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.450
write a recommendation for
them going into college.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.050
So it's a whole set of skills.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.226
It's the chance to be creative.

00:16:40.226 --> 00:16:41.600
And one of the
biggest mismatches

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.729
between what schools are
doing and what kids need

00:16:45.729 --> 00:16:47.270
is schools aren't
doing nearly enough

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.620
to teach creativity
and innovation.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.380
They're still way too much
around memorizing and following

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.370
rules.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.910
And in the old days, you could
get a good job, middle class

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.800
job, following rules.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.735
But now most good jobs
you have to innovate

00:17:00.735 --> 00:17:02.520
where there's no playbook.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.270
So how do you build
the skills to innovate

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.640
where there's no playbook?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.285
You only do that
by practicing it.

00:17:08.285 --> 00:17:09.910
And if you don't
practice it in school,

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.368
where are you going
to practice it?

00:17:11.368 --> 00:17:13.810
For upper-income kids, they
practice it at robotics camp.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.839
They practice it starting
with little arts and crafts

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.300
projects or just
that music project.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.060
My daughter went to Argentina
for three a half weeks

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.200
last summer singing.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.800
And that probably
won't do anything

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.450
to improve her MCAT scores.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.730
But she wrote back.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.240
She said, Dad, I'm
living the life.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.420
I'm giving out autographs.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.836
We're doing these concerts,
and I'm giving out autographs.

00:17:35.836 --> 00:17:38.040
And it made her feel
so good about herself,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.750
and it made her more confident
in talking to people.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.500
And that's a big
part of success.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.260
RICHARD BUERY: That's awesome.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.051
So I want to read one
of my favorite quotes

00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:46.510
from your book,
which I wrote down.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.926
There were couple
of great quotes.

00:17:47.926 --> 00:17:50.040
But one of my favorites--
it's early in the book--

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.640
is, "How likely is it
that a child will grow up

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.654
to become an engineer if
she has never met one?"

00:17:56.654 --> 00:17:58.070
Talk a little bit
more about that,

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:02.020
what the inspiration that
your citizen teachers

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.980
provide to the people
in the program.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.920
ERIC SCHWARZ: Well, the motto
or goal of Citizen Schools

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.571
is to help every kid discover
and achieve their dreams.

00:18:13.571 --> 00:18:15.570
And there's a lot of hard
work in the achieving.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.500
There's a lot of data.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.410
There's a lot of coaching on
getting better at teaching.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.430
There's a lot of
learning from school day

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:27.280
faculty and a lot of trying
to continuously improve.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.830
But it also starts with just
discovering your dreams.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:34.470
And every kid has dreams
to do cool things.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.020
But they're often
dreams that are

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.665
drawn from a fairly small
selection of career ideas

00:18:39.665 --> 00:18:42.550
that they've seen on
TV or they've seen,

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.756
maybe, around them.

00:18:43.756 --> 00:18:46.130
And one of the coolest things,
I think, about the program

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:51.420
is giving kids a chance
to work with engineers.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.500
We have a rocket scientist who's
taught seven times over a class

00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.310
called It is Rocket Science
where kids get to launch

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.170
these rockets in the
backyard of their school.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.450
And their final WOW! event
at the end of the semester

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.460
is they're on a
hookup through Skype

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.840
with real astronauts from NASA.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.630
And they're
calculating how to do

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.010
a simulated landing of
a rocket on the moon.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.180
And they've got to calculate
how to do it amidst lunar

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.620
windstorms and all these
different challenges.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.570
That opens up all kinds
of cool opportunities.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.830
And literally, for a
black girl growing up

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.220
in the South Side of
Chicago, the chances

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.550
that she's met an engineer in
school or in her neighborhood

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.870
are sadly low.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.060
And yet so many
jobs in the future,

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.630
so many middle to
upper-income jobs,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.350
are going to be in engineering.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.710
That's just one example.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.090
And we're not a career program
to push her into engineering.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.392
But we've got a bunch
of kids in four schools

00:19:55.392 --> 00:19:57.600
in Chicago, every kid in
these four different schools

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.290
that we're in, now
getting a lot of chances

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.930
to work with engineers, but
also lawyers and architects

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.940
and carpenters and
a whole lot more.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.770
RICHARD BUERY: You
mentioned the WOW!.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.090
And has anybody here
never been to see a WOW!

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.316
at Citizen School?

00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:15.440
All right, so a few of you.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.830
So do yourself a favor.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.329
Can you invite folks to come?

00:20:18.329 --> 00:20:19.370
ERIC SCHWARZ: Absolutely.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.203
RICHARD BUERY: So do
yourself a favor-- just

00:20:21.203 --> 00:20:24.881
entirely awesome, awesome.

00:20:24.881 --> 00:20:26.380
When we started
Groundwork-- I think

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.525
I see Matt Klein
in the back, right?

00:20:28.525 --> 00:20:29.400
So that's Matt Klein.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.619
We were starting Groundwork.

00:20:31.619 --> 00:20:32.660
What do you think we did?

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.260
We actually studied the way
Citizen Schools was organized,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.780
in part because you
had this great--

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.130
I just love the name of a WOW!.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.822
You had the great marketing
and ideas to get the words,

00:20:43.822 --> 00:20:45.530
get these powerful
ideas, across in a way

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.895
that could capture
people's imaginations.

00:20:48.895 --> 00:20:50.520
And I'm just kind of
curious generally.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.962
How intentional was
all of that when

00:20:52.962 --> 00:20:54.420
you were building
the organization?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.003
ERIC SCHWARZ: It was
very intentional.

00:20:56.003 --> 00:20:57.980
And the idea behind the WOW!

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:03.820
was not just sort of a cool
word with two W's and an O.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.160
But the idea was to have kids
do work that was high enough

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.980
quality and interesting enough
that it got adults to say,

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.260
wow, I can't believe that
sixth grader could do that.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.530
And that was the goal.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:22.000
A lot of kids put out a little
mimeograph one-page newspaper.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.040
The first WOW!

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.810
Citizen Schools was me-- I used
to be a journalist-- working

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.070
with 10 kids to publish an
eight-page tabloid newspaper

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.620
on real newsprint and
with advertisements

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.785
that paid for it.

00:21:33.785 --> 00:21:34.679
And that was cool.

00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:36.470
And when people saw
that, when they brought

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.590
that back into the school, it's
like, wow, that's really cool.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.500
Your byline is right there.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.200
And a lot of kids might
do a little mock trial

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.810
in the classroom where
they argue about something.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.060
Our kids go to the
federal courthouse

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.230
in front of Justice
Breyer in one case,

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.860
or in front of state
and federal judges

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.670
at this amazing courthouse.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.770
And they're wearing their
Sunday best clothes.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.905
The jury box is filled with
people like in this room

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:03.530
right now, and their
parents are there,

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.050
and their teachers are
there, importantly,

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.420
seeing them in a
whole new light.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.990
So a kid who may be a
special needs student who

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.760
the teacher's kind of
decided, well, they're

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.120
not going to be a great
student, all of a sudden

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.645
they do the closing argument.

00:22:17.645 --> 00:22:19.770
And the teacher sees them
in a whole different way.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:25.250
So not every apprenticeship
leads authentically

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.510
to adults saying that in
the most authentic way.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.480
But that's our
aspiration, to have

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.550
every class say, wow,
that is really cool.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.485
And my sixth grader might
not be able to do that,

00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:38.570
and I might not be
able to do that.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.945
Increasingly, the kids are
doing things that I definitely

00:22:40.945 --> 00:22:42.765
can't do, like
program an Android,

00:22:42.765 --> 00:22:45.190
an app for Android phone.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.180
I have a hard time
erasing photos.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.690
I was trying to erase a
photo to clear up space,

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.255
because my daughter had taken
so many photos on my phone.

00:22:52.255 --> 00:22:56.370
And I had to get [? Khalid ?]
to help me do it.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.530
RICHARD BUERY: Well,
I have to say, wow.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.470
So that leads me to another
one of my favorite quotes,

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:06.620
and I think also relevant to
talking about your background.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.250
"Our job is to catch
kids doing things right."

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.646
And I know that for
so many children,

00:23:13.646 --> 00:23:15.300
the traditional part
of the school day

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.801
did not often give children
the sense of an opportunity

00:23:18.801 --> 00:23:20.550
to feel like they've
done something right.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.466
And I think one of
the exciting things

00:23:22.466 --> 00:23:24.590
about the work of Citizen
Schools and organizations

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.770
like it is you give
children a chance

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.180
to excel in a variety of ways
that they might not have.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.480
And that's an experience
they can take with them.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.367
I'd love to hear if you have
any great stories about kids who

00:23:35.367 --> 00:23:37.200
have come through the
program over the years

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.430
who you feel like the spark--
the kids who were struggling

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.820
in the traditional school day
for whom the extended learning

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.200
time of Citizen Schools helped
them recapture a love of school

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.700
generally.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.830
ERIC SCHWARZ: Yeah,
and just a quick story

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.740
about that idea of
catching kids doing things

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.420
right-- the first summer
of Citizen Schools,

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.630
we had 60 students and about
60 volunteers teaming up

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.500
to teach 20 different classes.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.910
And one of the classes was
led by a police officer

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:10.020
in Boston Dennis Rory, who was
a community police officer.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.780
And he would always show
up in his blue uniform.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.350
And one day we had a picture
of him in his full uniform

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.740
on a pogo stick jumping around.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.860
So he's a very joyful guy.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.520
And he said, as a
community police officer,

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.100
the other police officers, they
kind of catch the bad guys.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.360
That's their job.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.460
My job and your job
at Citizen Schools

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.670
is to catch kids
doing things right.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.380
And he taught this great class
where kids developed a brochure

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.269
around community policing,
and that was their WOW!.

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:39.310
And that really stuck with
us, since we've always

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.620
tried to do that.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.280
So many stories about kids-- one
that's coming to mind right now

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.770
is a student named Jonathan
Edwards, no relationship

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.870
to the former
presidential candidate.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:57.360
But Jonathan was-- his record
if you looked him up at school

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.980
would be special needs student,
D student, D's for grades

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.410
on average, probably
won't finish high school,

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.510
in fifth, sixth grade.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.830
But if you got to
know him a little bit,

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.990
you learned this
kid loved animals.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.314
And this bat had once
flown into the brick wall

00:25:17.314 --> 00:25:18.730
outside of his
mother's apartment.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:22.030
And he had picked the bat
up, put it in a shoebox,

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.860
nursed the bat in his
house back to health.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.360
But he had never
made the connection

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:32.080
between his love of animals
and veterinary care or biology

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.630
or math.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:39.280
He took a class taught by a
young doctor who had grown up

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.240
in New Orleans, followed
a somewhat similar path

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.470
to Jonathan to Harvard
Medical School.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.590
He taught a class called
Drugs on the Brain

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:50.390
where kids had a chance to hold
a human brain in their hands,

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.780
dissect a sheep's brain, put
a little droplet of alcohol

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.690
on it.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.390
And it was
transformative for him.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.990
Because he all of a
sudden just saw something.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.410
And he held a boa
constrictor another time.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.400
He saw a link between
some of his passions

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.630
and a future career.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.230
And he transitioned out of
special education classes

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.760
into regular education classes.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.520
And we see that happen a lot as
kids who are sort of typecast

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.460
as a certain kind of kid,
who feel like failures,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.700
discover success
at Citizen Schools.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.450
And it may not be the
first apprenticeship

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.800
or the second apprenticeship.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.350
But it might be the third
that they feel like, wow, that

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.110
was successful, and I build
the muscle memory of success.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.120
And then the next time
it's a little bit easier,

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.850
whether it's another
apprenticeship,

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.740
or it's a sport,
or it's math class.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.130
RICHARD BUERY: You, of
course, write and speak

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.660
passionately about opportunity.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.040
This is an idea on which
our country is built,

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.670
the idea that where
you start life

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.010
should not dictate
where you end life.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.350
And you also present
some stark statistics

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.450
that really challenge that idea.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.490
And I think it's
troubling to really come

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:01.750
to terms with the fact that
although equal opportunity has

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.385
never been fully true, what's
troubling about the moment we

00:27:06.385 --> 00:27:09.680
live in now is that you could
argue that in many ways,

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.436
we're not even going
in the right direction,

00:27:12.436 --> 00:27:14.810
that the amount of a child's
income that can be predicted

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.710
by their parents' income
is growing, not declining.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.220
It's fundamentally an American
idea, and one that I think

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.975
is hard as citizens
to come to grips with.

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:27.950
And so I guess I would ask you
where the country is right now.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.660
Are you optimistic?

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.050
Do you think we can get on
the right path in making

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.292
"The Opportunity Equation" real?

00:27:35.292 --> 00:27:36.500
ERIC SCHWARZ: I think we can.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.172
I think we're seeing
it more and more

00:27:38.172 --> 00:27:40.380
clearly work for a certain
portion of our population.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.900
But what you say is so true.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.730
We're living in a time, the
first time in American history,

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:52.740
where opportunity is actually
declining and not growing,

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.875
where inequality is
growing, not declining.

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:59.000
We've made some progress,
though we have a long way

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.540
to go around inequality of race.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.760
And that gap in
terms of test scores,

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.180
et cetera, is half what
it was at the end of World

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.850
War II but still way too big.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.920
But inequality based on
income is twice as big

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.050
as it was 40 years ago.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.840
And there are a lot of forces
in a worldwide economy that

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.490
will make it hard.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.360
If you get that extra
education, your services

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.600
are more in demand
and drive up income.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.675
But the thing that
makes me optimistic

00:28:31.675 --> 00:28:33.800
is that there are a lot
more people besides Citizen

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.930
Schools that are
doing this work.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.270
And when we started this,
there were a few dozen examples

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:44.640
of low-income schools that were
lifting kids to the performance

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.370
level of high-income schools.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.690
Now there's hundreds
and hundreds, maybe even

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.690
a low number of thousands.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.007
We're involved in
30 of them where

00:28:55.007 --> 00:28:56.590
it's a whole new
kind of school that's

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.390
delivering
extraordinary results.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.050
But the National
Academies Foundation

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.160
is doing amazing things.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.510
High Tech High out in
California, the Met School,

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.620
ExpandED with TASC.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.900
There's some number of
schools, probably 1,000, 2,000,

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.649
that are delivering
great results by giving

00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:17.440
low-income kids what
upper-income kids take

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.430
for granted.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.870
So that, I think,
eventually will take hold.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.030
The second thing that
makes me optimistic

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.100
is it doesn't have
to cost that much.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:33.660
It would cost about $6 billion
to bring high-quality expanded

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.580
learning time to every middle
school in the country that's

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.180
majority low income.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.070
That would reach
millions of kids.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.490
It's very doable.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.880
It won't be done in
the next three years.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.380
It can be done in
the next 10 years.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.090
What New York is trying now
with trying to make extended day

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.260
omnipresent-- not for
every kid in the school,

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.590
but for a lot of the kids in the
school-- in every middle school

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.430
over the next several years, and
trying to do pre-K in a big way

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:04.600
too, is a big experiment
on, can we do big things?

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.230
And I think that whenever the
country has done big things

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.710
from the founding of the
country through the Civil Rights

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.260
Movement, it's been
citizens in the lead.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.530
And government
ultimately follows.

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.170
Particular people
in government lead.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.540
You're leading, and
your mayor is leading.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.840
But we won't be able
to do this nationally

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.040
if we don't have citizens
at the forefront.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.470
And that's what's so exciting to
me about Citizen Schools is we

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.870
need [? Gautham, ?] and we
need [? Khalid, ?] and we need

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:37.390
their colleagues, along with
millions more like them,

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.350
demanding extra
opportunity for all kids.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.810
Because Google needs it.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.720
The other sad thing that I
think is the last thing that

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.900
makes me optimistic is
the interest alignment

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.870
between upper-income
power brokers

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.300
and lower-income kids is greater
than it's ever been before.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.230
That wasn't there I think
in the '50s and '60s.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:04.940
But today, McKinsey estimates
that we have a 3% to 5%

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.740
permanent recession
imposed on our economy,

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.530
lowering everyone's standard
of living, because of the fact

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:14.270
that poor kids are learning
at such lower levels

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.400
relative to their middle
and upper-income peers.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.510
RICHARD BUERY: Yeah.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.900
I know we're going to
have some time I think

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.233
for questions from the audience.

00:31:20.233 --> 00:31:22.860
But can I just ask one more
question before we do that?

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.929
You are, I think,
without exaggeration,

00:31:26.929 --> 00:31:29.220
one of the leading social
entrepreneurs in our country.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.445
You built an amazing
organization.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.980
Everybody is not going
to quit their career

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.670
and build an
organization like that.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:43.140
So for people, not only in this
audience but out in the world,

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.150
who want to contribute to
making equal opportunity

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.577
real for children, what
does the average citizen do?

00:31:48.577 --> 00:31:50.160
ERIC SCHWARZ: That's
a great question,

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.490
and the last chapter of
the book gets into that.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:56.450
And some of it is advocating
for government to do more,

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.920
and pushing
government to do more,

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.720
and thanking government when it
does what you guys are trying

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.980
to do around extended day
and early childhood and more.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.180
Some of it is get
directly involved.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.361
So that could be-- we've got a
half-dozen schools here in New

00:32:11.361 --> 00:32:13.110
York that Citizen
Schools is working with.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.200
And we're looking for
more citizen teachers

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.059
to teach any number of things.

00:32:17.059 --> 00:32:18.600
It doesn't have to
be rocket science.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.900
It can be whatever
you're passionate about.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.115
It can be the history
of blues and jazz music.

00:32:24.115 --> 00:32:25.990
But it doesn't have to
be at Citizen Schools.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.614
It could be at one
of the TASC schools.

00:32:27.614 --> 00:32:31.840
It could be through MentorNet
or Big Brothers Big Sisters.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.830
But get involved.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.190
Or in the summer,
hire a student.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.900
Hire a high school student.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.100
That can be a ladder.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.739
That creates a ladder
of opportunity.

00:32:40.739 --> 00:32:42.780
If you don't have time to
do one of those things,

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.790
but you have a little
bit of extra money,

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.650
think about how much money
you spend on your own kids

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.850
to go to Argentina.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:51.910
And say, well, maybe
I'm going to match that,

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.089
and I'm going to still
do that for my kids.

00:32:54.089 --> 00:32:55.630
But I'm going to
take an equal amount

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.570
and give it to Citizen
Schools, or give it

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.580
to another organization
that's providing

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.760
similar things to all kids.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.460
So I think people
need to get involved.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.130
And it's fun.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.640
You heard from [? Gautham. ?]
It's really fun.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.100
The Citizen Schools
people are awesome.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.020
You get to work with
incredibly cool people.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.500
You learn a lot.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.420
And it makes life
more enriching,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.607
and it makes our country
and city stronger.

00:33:17.607 --> 00:33:18.940
RICHARD BUERY: Great, thank you.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.940
ERIC SCHWARZ: Thank you.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.210
RICHARD BUERY: Let's open
up for some questions.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.501
Do want people to use the mics?

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:24.030
CREW: Yes.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.529
RICHARD BUERY: Would you mind
going to the side to the mics?

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.240
It's a race.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:29.740
It's a race.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:34.006
Who will get to the mic first?

00:33:34.006 --> 00:33:35.970
Oh, we have a winner.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.819
Maybe introduce yourself, too.

00:33:37.819 --> 00:33:38.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:45.230
I'm Linda [? Freed. ?] And
thank you to both of you

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:50.020
on all counts for your visionary
work and making it work.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:34:00.960
Eric, when you're talking
about citizens taking the lead,

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.740
one of the many things that is
profoundly important about what

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.480
you're saying is the
message that all of our kids

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.610
are all of our responsibility.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:17.929
And in my experience,
not everybody gets that.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:22.280
And so I was wondering--
and we need to, obviously.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.409
The people in the room get it,
clearly, because they're here.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:31.250
But in your experience--
and for both of you really--

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:37.070
what are the ahas, the
wows, that actually

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:43.210
can transform one
understanding to the other?

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.400
ERIC SCHWARZ: I think
it starts with exposure.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.770
I think human beings
learn through experience

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.699
and relationships.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:56.490
And so if you only read about
kids or see stuff on TV,

00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:57.760
you form a set of impressions.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.304
You maybe hear
from other people.

00:35:00.304 --> 00:35:02.720
And you don't have any chance
to combat those stereotypes.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.300
You don't have any chance to
build empathy and build love

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.940
for kids who are different from
you or from a different ZIP

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:09.640
code.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.850
So we need to find
ways to scale up

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:16.350
the idea of connecting people
across different lines.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.050
And Citizens' goal is
one model for doing that.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.510
It's not the only model, but
I think it's very important.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.280
Robert Putnam talks
about social capital.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.390
And to get ahead, you
need your tight circles

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.890
of the people you
go to church with,

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.889
the people in your
neighborhood who support you.

00:35:29.889 --> 00:35:32.220
But you also need what he
calls bridging social capital

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.580
to connect with
the world outside.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.410
And that's true for
rich people, too.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.790
Everyone needs that
sense of connection

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:42.165
to folks beyond their core.

00:35:42.165 --> 00:35:43.810
You want to--

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:45.700
RICHARD BUERY: Well,
no, I would agree.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.750
It's one of the ways in which
residential and educational

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.980
segregation are so pernicious.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.060
Because what it does, it allows
us to perpetuate the idea

00:35:55.060 --> 00:36:00.040
that those around us are other
and different and separate.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.050
And if people are separate, then
you have no investment in them.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:08.770
So I do believe that,
ultimately, the country has

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:13.495
to sort of take seriously the
idea of the broader community.

00:36:13.495 --> 00:36:15.120
I was trained as a
civil rights lawyer.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.170
I didn't practice
very long, but I

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.580
was theoretically a
civil rights lawyer once.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.150
And I do really
believe this work

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:24.560
is an extension of that work.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.330
Because m what
we're trying to do

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:32.750
is to create justice
for our citizens.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.530
But to do that, you
have to actually believe

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.930
that your neighbor
is your citizen.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:41.730
And in a country like
this, and a city like this,

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.700
that can be a difficult thing.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.740
So I do believe it's
a bedrock question.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.940
Because how do you get people
connected in a world where

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.431
there are so many ways not
to be connected, I think

00:36:51.431 --> 00:36:52.930
is one of the
fundamental challenges

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:56.450
for how do we bring to
the light the just country

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:57.430
that we imagine.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.430
ERIC SCHWARZ: Well said.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.470
RICHARD BUERY: Hi.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.370
AUDIENCE: Good evening.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.530
My name is Diana Breen.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.830
I'm on the board of the Cypress
Hills Childcare Corporation.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.710
And deputy mayor,
first I just want

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:14.020
to congratulate you on an
ambitious rollout of UPK.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.174
Mr. Schwarz, I was
wondering if you--

00:37:16.174 --> 00:37:16.674
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:16.674 --> 00:37:17.174
Yes.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:21.610
And after school tomorrow.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:23.693
RICHARD BUERY: I'm going
to have a bunch of drinks

00:37:23.693 --> 00:37:25.755
right after this, by the way.

00:37:25.755 --> 00:37:27.380
AUDIENCE: Mr. Schwarz,
I was wondering,

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.840
if you had a special Citizen
Schools time machine,

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.919
and you could go back, as you
were building the organization,

00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:35.335
are there any
things strategically

00:37:35.335 --> 00:37:38.479
or with programming that you
would have done differently?

00:37:38.479 --> 00:37:40.020
ERIC SCHWARZ: That's
a cool question.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.350
I should ask Steven
for what the answer is.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.060
And it's kind of a
cool opportunity now

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.140
for the organization
to reinvent itself

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:56.120
with an amazing base of support
and take it to the next level.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.310
One of the things I
really struggle with,

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.850
and Steven is struggling with,
and we're thinking about,

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:04.200
is, how do you simultaneously
build an organization

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.480
and build a movement?

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.410
And a lot of people I
think in this world,

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.826
a lot of social entrepreneurs,
think about that challenge.

00:38:09.826 --> 00:38:12.290
And you can get trapped in
the challenges of building

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.810
your own organization and
lose sight of the movement.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.220
But you can also just
talk about the movement

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.340
and lose sight of the results.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.860
And I'm very proud of the
results that we've delivered,

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.640
and I'm very proud
of the contribution

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.810
we've made to a movement.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.850
But it's at the earliest stages.

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:30.350
And I think with
Richard, with TASC,

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.766
with a lot of the other
people in this room,

00:38:32.766 --> 00:38:33.515
there's potential.

00:38:33.515 --> 00:38:37.810
And I wish I'd done even more
on this over the last 10 years

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:43.080
to really push hard on getting
all levels of government

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.330
to really invest in
expanded learning time

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:49.240
as the necessary complement to
this kind of shadow education

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.410
system that's growing up in
upper-income communities.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:53.640
And it's starting to happen.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.730
Governor Cuomo and
Governor Christie

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.899
don't agree on that
many things necessarily.

00:38:57.899 --> 00:38:59.690
They're both putting
expanded learning time

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.160
into their budgets.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.720
And the president is
getting behind this

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.550
in a few different ways.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.000
More and more
school districts are

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.416
starting to think about, all
right, we need to scale this.

00:39:09.416 --> 00:39:12.500
And if we want to ever
have a chance, a prayer,

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.097
of having our kids catch up with
their upper-income neighbors,

00:39:16.097 --> 00:39:17.430
they're going to need more time.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:18.270
They're going to
need more mentors.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.686
They're going to
need more chances

00:39:19.686 --> 00:39:21.700
to kind of make
things and experiment.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.360
Thank you.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.840
RICHARD BUERY: Is that part
of the Cypress Hills Local

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.465
Development Corporation?

00:39:24.465 --> 00:39:25.690
AUDIENCE: It's a subsidiary.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.440
RICHARD BUERY: OK.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.885
That's one of the most amazing
organizations in the city,

00:39:28.885 --> 00:39:29.537
and great work.

00:39:29.537 --> 00:39:30.620
AUDIENCE: I think so, too.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.099
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:32.099 --> 00:39:34.140
RICHARD BUERY: I think we
probably only have time

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.430
for one more maybe.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.909
ERIC SCHWARZ: I'll
get John afterwards.

00:39:39.909 --> 00:39:40.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.850
My name is Oscar Robles.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:44.960
I work for US2020, which is an
organization that was born out

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.194
of Citizen Schools
to connect 1 million

00:39:47.194 --> 00:39:48.860
STEM-- Science,
Technology, Engineering,

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.318
and Math-- professionals to
hands-on project-based learning

00:39:51.318 --> 00:39:53.550
for under-represented
kids in those fields.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:56.730
And my question is
around-- something

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.480
I've really enjoyed reading
so far in the book, Eric, is

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.460
your incredible tenacity for
the idea of Citizen Schools.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.250
I mean, here we
are 20 years later

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:06.820
after you started the idea
in your basement, really.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.220
So I would love to hear a
little bit about the grit

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.740
that it took to keep Citizen
Schools alive at times

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.070
when it was really difficult
for social entrepreneurs

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:16.680
like myself.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.280
And with US2020, we're
just a year and a half out.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.067
How did you keep
the vision in mind,

00:40:22.067 --> 00:40:23.650
keep the folks who
were doing the work

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.610
on the ground impassioned
toward that vision,

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.190
and be able to get
it to where it's

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.980
grown now here 20 years later?

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.360
ERIC SCHWARZ:
Well, thanks Oscar.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.420
And this US2020
is a good example

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.490
of Citizen Schools helping
to sort of lead a movement,

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.640
and working closely with
the White House and others

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.200
on this, to get a million
science, technology,

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.334
engineering, and math folks
out there working at Citizen

00:40:45.334 --> 00:40:47.750
Schools, but also working at
TASC, and working in schools,

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.430
and working at Girl Scouts,
and all kinds of places.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:53.530
So that's awesome, and thank
you Oscar for your work on that.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.370
For me, it's been
a labor of love.

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:59.720
It's really awesome
seeing your baby grow up.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.770
And at every step
of the way, that's

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:06.240
been a personal kind of
heart feeling I've had.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.790
On hard days, I remember
in the beginning,

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:11.910
my kind of go-to plan was
to go talk to a parent.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.570
And I remember the first
summer it was like 95 degrees.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:17.067
We were in a school
in Dorchester.

00:41:17.067 --> 00:41:18.900
Richard, you've probably
been in the school.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.160
It's actually where
Yasminia went to school.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.490
And no air conditioning, school
is under construction-- there's

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:26.880
broken glass all over the place.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.860
It was 98 degrees inside
and outside day after day.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.570
And I think we were making a
lot of headway with the kids,

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.850
but sometimes it
wasn't so clear.

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.900
And when I had hard
days, I would go talk

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.324
to some parents, who would
often pick up their kids at 6:00

00:41:42.324 --> 00:41:43.240
at the end of the day.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.540
It was a full-day
summer program.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.880
And always, even if
it seemed tough to us,

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.730
they were so proud
and so excited.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:55.320
And they were so thrilled
to see their kids

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.410
working with engineers, and
working with filmmakers,

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:01.350
and working with journalists
and lawyers and carpenters.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:05.230
And so that really fed
me in a powerful way.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:07.390
I taught seven apprenticeships.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.410
So I taught journalism
in the beginning.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.480
But my dad's a lawyer, so I
argued a lot around the dining

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.500
room table and never went into
law like you and like dad.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:19.100
But I taught a couple mock
trial classes, taught a business

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.869
class, and that kept me
close to the action as well.

00:42:22.869 --> 00:42:23.910
But it's been incredible.

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.390
And this book--
last thing I'll say

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.964
before you just sort of
close it down for the night.

00:42:28.964 --> 00:42:30.630
This book has been a
labor of love, too.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:32.838
Because I've worked on it
over the last couple years.

00:42:32.838 --> 00:42:35.210
It was a gift to be
able to finish it right

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.690
as I was passing
the baton to Steven

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.510
and preparing to start a
new nonprofit in the higher

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.140
education world.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.770
It's a gift to be able to tell
the story of Citizen Schools,

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:47.600
tell a little bit of
my own personal story,

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.390
but really tell a
story about what

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:52.150
I think is going on in the
country, what's really causing

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.762
this growing achievement gap--
it's very different from what

00:42:54.762 --> 00:42:56.890
a lot of people think--
and hopefully give people

00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:00.272
some confidence that we don't
have to accept that status quo.

00:43:00.272 --> 00:43:01.730
There's actually
lots of examples--

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:05.060
Citizens was a great one--
of how we can come together

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.220
as a country in
very affordable ways

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.180
to lift up opportunity
for all kids.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.480
And so last plug for the
book-- they have a lot of them

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.380
out there.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.550
Google subsidized the price.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:15.410
They're only $10.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.300
You can buy them to give
to friends and to family,

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.612
as well as take
one for yourself.

00:43:20.612 --> 00:43:22.820
And there's a great local
bookstore, McNally Jackson,

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:23.320
that's here.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.250
And I'm donating all author
proceeds to Citizen Schools.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:28.450
So thank you so much for coming.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.360
Thank you to Google for hosting.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.200
And Richard, thank you for
being a great partner up here.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.040
This is awesome.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.081
RICHARD BUERY: Thank you.

00:43:35.081 --> 00:43:37.200
Yeah, let me just say,
just to wrap up again,

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.226
really do buy the book,
"The Opportunity Equation,"

00:43:41.226 --> 00:43:43.110
"Opportunity Equation."

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:46.450
And as Eric said, proceeds do
go towards Citizen Schools.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:49.600
And it's hard to imagine
a better investment

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.830
than the organization
Citizen Schools.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.595
I want to thank you
for your leadership,

00:43:54.595 --> 00:43:55.970
for your leadership
in this work,

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:59.180
for your dedication to
our country's future.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.220
And thank you for helping
to inspire all of us

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.190
to be better citizens.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.260
It's my honor to be
your friend, and I

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.430
can't wait to see what
happens next in your career.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:06.930
Thank you.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:07.230
ERIC SCHWARZ: Awesome.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.130
Thank you so much.

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:11.180
