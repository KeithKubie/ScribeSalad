00:00:09.646 --> 00:00:10.636
&gt;&gt;Today is what date?

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:14.266
&gt;&gt;Class: 10/04/05.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It begins in the first
five minutes of first period.

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:18.906
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What kind
of a number do I have?

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:20.726
Is it a composite number?

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:22.616
A prime number or a square number?

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:23.976
&gt;&gt;Class: Square.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It continues
throughout the day.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.536
&gt;&gt;Boy: 3666.

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:28.926
&gt;&gt;Girl: Isn't it one square, though?

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:29.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In history class.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:33.196
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: We're going to measure
the length of Titanic outside.

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:34.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Art class.

00:00:35.116 --> 00:00:37.746
&gt;&gt;Art teacher: Whatever you
make, has to be cut out...

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:39.646
&gt;&gt;Class: Symmetrical.

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:40.976
&gt;&gt;Symmetrically.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:42.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Computer Lab.

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:43.926
&gt;&gt;Gould: And the next one.

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:45.336
&gt;&gt;Class: Four negative four.

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:47.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And it ends in
last period, music class.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.386
&gt;&gt;Music teacher: We're
going to take the math idea

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:54.866
of below zero, and
turn it into music.

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:56.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It is part
of most everything

00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:57.886
that happens at Fullerton IV.

00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:01.896
A K-5 school in Roseburg,
Oregon, it is...

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:04.846
&gt;&gt;Girl: But time would be
only times-ing it by what?

00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:07.026
So it can be any number at all.

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:08.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The magic of math.

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You are
absolutely correct!

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:14.236
&gt;&gt;Garrison: To me, math
is really not a subject.

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:19.096
It really allows kids to learn
how to reason and problem-solve,

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.776
and learn how to effectively
communicate.

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.336
&gt;&gt;Music teacher: Now music is sound,

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:26.456
so what would be the
opposite of sound?

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:27.366
Yeah?

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:28.066
&gt;&gt;Girl: Silence?

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:29.396
&gt;&gt;Music teacher: Silence.

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:29.886
How many of you...

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:32.736
&gt;&gt;Music teacher: If they
can't think conceptually,

00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:34.826
it opens up not just math.

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:36.966
It opens up thinking.

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:39.976
It makes connections for
them in the real world.

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:42.966
&gt;&gt;Music teacher: Now remember to
put some silence in your pattern.

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.796
&gt;&gt;Music teacher: It allows
them to explore music and art.

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:50.726
And so math is really the foundation.

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:54.546
&gt;&gt;Music teacher: Oh, I see some
really wonderful positive/negatives.

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:56.326
Just like those math numbers.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:57.256
Great!

00:01:57.556 --> 00:02:00.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With all the
engaging ways to learn here,

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:03.696
it's not surprising most
Fullerton students say...

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:06.416
&gt;&gt;Girl: My favorite subject is math.

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:06.816
&gt;&gt;Girl: Doing math.

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:07.646
&gt;&gt;Girl: Probably math.

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:08.016
&gt;&gt;Girl: Math.

00:02:08.016 --> 00:02:08.856
&gt;&gt;Boy: I like math a lot.

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.306
&gt;&gt;Boy: Probably soccer.

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:12.126
&gt;&gt;Girl: Probably reading and math.

00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:13.986
&gt;&gt;Boy: I just like
to add and subtract.

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:15.666
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: What's your
second favorite subject?

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:17.056
&gt;&gt;Boy: Playing with friends.

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:18.876
&gt;&gt;I like division the most.

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:18.986
&gt;&gt;Girl: Math.

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:21.516
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: What do you
like to do in the classroom?

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:22.986
&gt;&gt;Boy: Probably math.

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:23.256
[laughs]

00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:28.186
&gt;&gt;Girl: My favorite
subject is actually math!

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:29.646
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: How come?

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:31.956
&gt;&gt;Girl: I just like it!

00:02:32.156 --> 00:02:34.646
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: Ooh, and we raise a
quiet hand if you notice something.

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:35.326
Give everyone...

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:37.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fullerton's
math curriculum is based

00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:40.336
on a continuous review
of best practices.

00:02:40.336 --> 00:02:43.746
And delivered by highly trained
teachers, beginning in kindergarten.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.886
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: Tell me about
green/blue, green/blue, green/blue.

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:47.276
&gt;&gt;Boy: It's a pattern.

00:02:47.276 --> 00:02:49.076
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: It's a pattern.

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:51.896
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: The kids will look
for me, oftentimes for the answer.

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:55.256
And I can give them the
correct answer every time.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.776
But what I want them to do is to
talk their way through the problem.

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.626
&gt;&gt;Whisper to your neighbor
what you notice about his.

00:03:02.856 --> 00:03:05.066
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: We use a word at
our school called "discourse."

00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:08.166
And it's the ability for kids
to communicate back and forth

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:10.696
between each other, so that
they can start to understand

00:03:10.696 --> 00:03:12.426
that problem, or communicate
it to me.

00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:13.616
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: Do you think
it's still a pattern?

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:18.766
&gt;&gt;Girl: No, if you just took
this part off, and put the green

00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:23.976
in the middle and then the blue
on the top, it would be a pattern.

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:25.706
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: This would be a pattern.

00:03:26.156 --> 00:03:29.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since the new math
curriculum was instituted in 2000,

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:31.656
math test scores have soared.

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:35.096
Now 98 percent of third
grade students score

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:36.616
at or above grade level.

00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:40.046
This, despite the fact that
the number of students on free

00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:42.996
and reduced lunch has also
climbed to 60 percent.

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:47.746
&gt;&gt;Garrison: When you look at children
who have personal life struggles,

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:53.086
too often adults make excuses and
minimize their ability to learn.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.086
And one of the things that
I said to the staff is,

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:59.976
"Socio-economics does not
put a cap on achievement."

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:02.506
&gt;&gt;Gould: So there's about
how many possibilities?

00:04:02.696 --> 00:04:03.586
&gt;&gt;Boy: One Hundred.

00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:04.516
&gt;&gt;Gould: One hundred.

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:05.266
Very good.

00:04:05.526 --> 00:04:06.096
Excellent.

00:04:06.406 --> 00:04:08.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To further
support math instruction,

00:04:08.316 --> 00:04:10.846
the district provides
a part-time math coach

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:13.056
in Master Teacher, Mike Gould.

00:04:13.546 --> 00:04:15.266
&gt;&gt;Gould: We've come
to the realization

00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:17.296
that everybody can learn mathematics.

00:04:17.436 --> 00:04:19.956
And it's not a question
of capacity anymore.

00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:21.596
It's a question of
how do you deliver it

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:23.396
and how do you allow
people to think about it?

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.356
&gt;&gt;You got to hone in on
those thinking skills.

00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:29.776
&gt;&gt;I think a perfect example
is four-and-a-half divided

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:30.426
by one-and-a-half.

00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:32.916
What's the first thing
that comes into your mind?

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:34.386
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I have no clue.

00:04:34.726 --> 00:04:36.336
&gt;&gt;Gould: Yep, that's
the typical answer.

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:40.976
Where if you were to hear a story,
"If I have four-and-a-half dollars

00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:43.516
and I'm going to give a
dollar-fifty to each of my friends,

00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:44.786
how many friends do I have?"

00:04:46.066 --> 00:04:48.276
Well, it's an obvious answer, three.

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:50.266
Rather than, "Oh, I can't do this.

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:52.726
I never did understand how to
flip and invert and multiply

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:53.806
and all those other weird things.

00:04:54.446 --> 00:04:56.826
So it's making the
mathematics come alive.

00:04:58.046 --> 00:04:59.086
&gt;&gt;Class: Three negative four.

00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:01.836
&gt;&gt;Gould: Everybody has
an avenue to learn.

00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:07.786
We just have to find
that right avenue.

00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:09.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Everybody
includes the students

00:05:09.646 --> 00:05:12.156
in Steph Neyhart's
Alternative Learning Center.

00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:16.646
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: The program is for kids
who have emotional, behavioral,

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:20.046
maybe social disorders that get
in the way of their learning

00:05:20.046 --> 00:05:21.916
in a regular classroom setting.

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:23.956
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: You know,
walk up there and stand

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:25.896
where you think 100 feet is.

00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:28.626
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: And the goal is
to help these kids to learn

00:05:29.126 --> 00:05:31.976
and to be passionate and
excited about learning.

00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:33.796
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: Well, that's what we're
learning here is how to estimate,

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:35.066
because it's really hard to estimate.

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:36.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With help from
some of their friends...

00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:37.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher's assistant:
Think that's 100 feet?

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:38.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...Mrs.

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:41.516
Neyhart's charges set out
to measure off the Titanic.

00:05:42.146 --> 00:05:46.776
All 882-and-a-half feet of
it in their own backyard.

00:05:47.416 --> 00:05:50.146
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: We began by researching
it and gathering books and looking

00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:51.886
at pictures and doing
some internet studies.

00:05:52.306 --> 00:05:54.706
And our goal initially
was to write about it.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:57.296
But in that process, we
came up with all this math!

00:05:57.756 --> 00:05:59.646
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: Hey you
guys were really close!

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:01.806
Your estimates have
gotten a lot closer.

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:03.556
Go ahead and mark that.

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:08.296
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: We discovered that the
Titanic was 882-and-a-half feet long.

00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:11.966
And we realized we had
no idea what that was.

00:06:12.216 --> 00:06:12.976
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: We're at 800.

00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:14.626
So we kind of got to shift
gears here, don't we?

00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:17.226
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: When you do a project
like this, I'm always impressed

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:20.986
with the long-term effects of the
learning, and how it incorporates

00:06:20.986 --> 00:06:23.166
so many different kinds
of math into it.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:24.746
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: One, two, three, sixty.

00:06:24.746 --> 00:06:25.866
One, two, three, seventy.

00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:28.066
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: These are also
hands-on learners, most of them.

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:31.316
And they prefer to be able to be
doing things when they're learning.

00:06:31.676 --> 00:06:33.506
And so it gets them
very excited about it.

00:06:33.606 --> 00:06:34.106
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: Let's look and see.

00:06:34.106 --> 00:06:34.586
Are there any cars?

00:06:34.586 --> 00:06:35.206
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: They love math.

00:06:35.336 --> 00:06:37.296
&gt;&gt;Neyhart: See that
white square down there?

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:40.066
Can you imagine a ship
that is that long?

00:06:40.436 --> 00:06:41.646
How can a ship that big float?

00:06:42.856 --> 00:06:44.336
Maybe that's our next investigation.

00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:47.136
&gt;&gt;Gould: What we're going to do today
is I'm going to give you a problem.

00:06:47.136 --> 00:06:49.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers are
excited about math here, too.

00:06:49.516 --> 00:06:53.496
&gt;&gt;Gould: And so the
problem is 133 subtract 87.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:56.326
You have to do it at least
three different ways.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Ongoing workshops
like this one bring teachers

00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:01.856
of all grade levels
together to hone their craft.

00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:05.446
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And I knew if I put the 80
with the 100, it was an automatic 20,

00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:07.276
it was an easy number
for me to work with.

00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:10.186
And then that left me with
the seven that I didn't use.

00:07:10.636 --> 00:07:12.396
If I put it there, it was confusing.

00:07:12.456 --> 00:07:14.366
So I put it with the 30.

00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:17.876
&gt;&gt;Gould: As adults, we were taught
that we didn't have to justify why.

00:07:18.406 --> 00:07:19.586
We just had to get the right answer.

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:23.426
And quite often we didn't-- you
know, I'm speaking for myself--

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:25.236
I didn't know how to
get the right answer.

00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:26.416
It just showed up.

00:07:26.926 --> 00:07:29.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So I'm breaking
it apart into place values,

00:07:29.686 --> 00:07:32.866
as well as using common
numbers that I understood.

00:07:33.356 --> 00:07:35.436
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: Our school
district did a phenomenal job

00:07:35.436 --> 00:07:39.636
of adopting a curriculum that allows
children to communicate about math.

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:41.966
And then they trained us.

00:07:42.646 --> 00:07:43.976
And they trained us really well.

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:46.156
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Get each one to 100,
and then add those two numbers...

00:07:46.156 --> 00:07:47.516
Oh! [laughs] And you
wanted to know...

00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:48.606
&gt;&gt;Gould: Benchmarks.

00:07:49.066 --> 00:07:50.576
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: Everyone
is on the same page.

00:07:50.576 --> 00:07:53.236
Everyone's really working
together really well.

00:07:53.776 --> 00:07:55.136
And I think that's what it takes.

00:07:55.546 --> 00:07:58.976
&gt;&gt;You need to think like your kids,
because they will come up with

00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:01.136
that wacky idea, and darn
it, it's going to work!

00:08:01.136 --> 00:08:01.776
&gt;&gt;Gould: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:04.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition to wacky
solutions to math problems,

00:08:05.316 --> 00:08:07.666
Fullerton students came
up with a unique solution

00:08:07.666 --> 00:08:09.246
to a problem many schools face.

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:11.466
&gt;&gt;Garrison: Our custodians work hard,

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.926
but we've been cut in
all areas of support.

00:08:15.166 --> 00:08:17.396
And so I said, "What
do you want to do?"

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.196
And they said, "We could
go and clean classrooms."

00:08:19.656 --> 00:08:23.266
And so they now know how to
clean blinds the right way.

00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:27.206
And clean countertops
and clean desks.

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:28.996
And I mean, they have it down.

00:08:28.996 --> 00:08:30.976
And they make a huge contribution.

00:08:32.046 --> 00:08:32.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Nearly half

00:08:32.676 --> 00:08:36.416
of the students here spend their
midday recess cleaning desks,

00:08:36.706 --> 00:08:40.846
scrubbing floors, and raking leaves
in exchange for small treats,

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:43.226
and a chance to have
lunch with the principal.

00:08:43.706 --> 00:08:46.156
&gt;&gt;Garrison: You have
children who have never had

00:08:46.156 --> 00:08:49.246
to follow directions
and do a careful job.

00:08:49.926 --> 00:08:54.666
They've never had to listen to
another student and actually follow

00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:56.376
that student's direction.

00:08:56.376 --> 00:09:01.206
And so they're getting a sense
of what a work ethic really looks

00:09:01.206 --> 00:09:07.956
like on a day-to-day
basis in a bigger arena.

00:09:08.076 --> 00:09:10.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whether the problems are
big or small, the common denominator

00:09:10.356 --> 00:09:12.276
for success at Fullerton
seems to be "math."

00:09:12.776 --> 00:09:13.736
&gt;&gt;Girl: My number is even.

00:09:14.106 --> 00:09:18.086
So you could just cross
off all the odd rows.

00:09:18.446 --> 00:09:21.186
&gt;&gt;Garrison: To listen to
children actually say,

00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:24.466
"This is what I was thinking
when I solved this problem.

00:09:24.786 --> 00:09:29.306
And here's why I thought that, and
for them to learn how to listen

00:09:29.306 --> 00:09:31.596
to each other, it goes beyond math."

00:09:32.056 --> 00:09:34.456
&gt;&gt;Rasmussen: You can
solve small problems,

00:09:34.456 --> 00:09:36.956
still have time left to play.

00:09:36.986 --> 00:09:40.376
&gt;&gt;Garrison: It really allows
them to be great problem solvers.

00:09:40.376 --> 00:09:43.586
And my personal belief is if
you can problem-solve in life,

00:09:43.726 --> 00:09:48.626
you can do anything you want.

00:09:48.626 --> 00:09:48.716
&gt;&gt;Kids: Yeah!

00:09:49.146 --> 00:09:50.836
