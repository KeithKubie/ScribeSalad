00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.640
In the first video
on futures fair value

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.210
we learned that it was the
price at which an investor would

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.710
be neutral between buying
the stock on the actual stock

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.154
market or buying the front
month futures contract.

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:14.570
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.570
talk about how
does one interpret

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.519
the fair value, especially
relative to the futures price.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.060
So let's say you
wake up one morning.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.100
The market hasn't opened yet,
the stock market hasn't opened,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.370
and you see a quote like
this for stock ABCD.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.650
The fair value, according to the
closing of yesterday's trading,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.050
the fair value is $102,
but the futures market,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.660
which usually has trading
hours beyond the regular market

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.890
and often times 24 hours,
so the futures market

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.030
trading price for the
front month future,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.450
even though the fair value based
on yesterday's closing is 102,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.000
the futures market is
trading it at $101.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.600
So how would you
use that information

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.210
or how would one interpret
that information?

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.440
So in the futures market,
people are trading the futures

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.270
contract, they're buying
and selling at a price

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.500
below the fair value based
on yesterday's close price.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.320
So what that means is is
that the market thinks

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.920
that this is actually no longer
the correct price of the stock.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.200
They think that the
correct price of the stock

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.750
is the stock at
which they would be

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.025
neutral between that price
and this futures contract.

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:21.150
So I don't know what it is.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.525
You would have to discount it
back by the risk-free rate,

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:25.840
but maybe it's something
like-- so this is implicitly

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.370
saying that the correct price
of the stock isn't $100.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.540
if the futures
price was $102, it

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.200
would say that the
stock should be 100.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.419
If the futures
prices is $101, it

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:37.710
means that maybe the stock
is something less than that.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.435
Maybe if we do our math maybe
it implies a stock price of $99.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.230
So the way you would potentially
act on it, although it's easier

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.695
said than done is
say, well, look.

00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:55.790
That means that, at least
in the very early stages

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.410
once the market opens, the
stock is going to go down.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.452
Now, your initial reaction
might be saying, wow,

00:02:01.452 --> 00:02:02.410
this is really amazing.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.035
This is some type of
a future indicator

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:05.900
and it is a pretty
strong future indicator.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.990
When you see this, when you see
the actual price of the future

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.980
being below the fair
value, it is very likely

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.790
that the stock will open down.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.980
Unfortunately, you have many,
many very sophisticated,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.720
high-frequency
traders who already

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.930
have their computers
set up to look

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.990
at this type of a
discrepancy and they're

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.540
going to be ultra
fast and they're

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.810
optimizing how fast their
bandwidth is so that they

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.970
can do these in a
matter of split seconds.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.410
So it's very,
very, very unlikely

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.740
that an average investor or
even a reasonably sophisticated

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.920
investor will be able
to take advantage

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.380
of this type of an arbitrage
or this type of an expected

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.590
arbitrage to know that this
price is likely to go down.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.220
Now, if the opposite
happened and let's

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.190
say that the fair
value is $102, which

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.660
implies the fair value of the
front month futures contract

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.100
is $102, which implies
$100 stock price.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.210
Let's say that the
futures is actually

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.250
trading even though
the fair value is $102,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.540
let's say that it
is trading at $105.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.510
So this is a situation that
since the market closed,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.021
the futures market
for some reason

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.020
thinks that the stock is
going to be worth more.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.140
This would imply a
stock price of maybe,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.390
I don't know what it might be.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.931
I'm not going to do
the math exactly,

00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:24.500
but maybe a price
of $103 or $104.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.710
And so if you saw this
where the futures price is

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.350
above the fair value
in the pre-market,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.940
that means that the
stock is likely to go up.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.290
But once again, it's very
hard to take advantage

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.623
of because you're going to
see that movement very, very,

00:03:36.623 --> 00:03:37.980
very quickly.
