00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.700
Turns out, our parents were right: listening
to loud music CAN ruin our hearing. But how

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.929
much exactly? And how does it all work?

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.929
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I’m
sure we all heard these little nuggets of

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.730
wisdom from our parents growing up. Don’t
sit too close to the TV, you’ll go blind.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.760
Don’t listen to loud music, you’ll go
deaf. And while the first one might be bunk,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.759
it turns out - loud music actually CAN ruin
your hearing. Who knew our parents could be

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.939
right?

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.050
According to a new study published this week
in Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, listening to

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.239
loud music can cause physical changes to our
auditory nerves, that lead to hearing loss

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.870
later in life - and difficulty understanding
speech.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.090
Now typically, when a person starts to experience
hearing loss, one of the first things to go

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.610
is their ability to understand speech - particularly
in noisy situations. So this study specifically

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.809
looked at the cellular mechanisms associated
with hearing loss and tinnitus - which is

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.219
a ringing of the ears - triggered by exposure
to loud sounds.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.390
Previous research has shown that repeated
exposure to loud sounds can cause our myelin

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.410
- which is the material that coats all of
our nerves, including our auditory nerves

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.580
- to wear down, and become thinner. Now typically,
when you hear a sound, that sound gets transmitted

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.120
to your brain, through a series of electrical
signals that are jumping from one myelin domain

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.130
to another. And that gap between domains,
is called a Node of Ranvier.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.020
When you’re exposed to loud sound, though,
the thinning of your myelin causes those nodes

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.700
to widen - which also forces your auditory
channels to redistribute their resources,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.740
in response to that change. So in a nutshell,
it takes longer for sounds to reach your brain.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.850
Now even though we’ve known this, it’s
still been kind of a mystery up until now,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.550
as to what actually causes the hearing loss.
Is it the thinning of that myelin, or the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.790
redistribution of those auditory channels?

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.890
Well, thanks to the new data modeling techniques
employed in this study, we now know that the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.200
majority of hearing loss is directly caused
by the thinning of your myelin. And knowing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.420
this, brings us one step closer to being able
to target and repair the CAUSE of hearing

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.060
loss, instead of just treating the symptoms.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.470
It also probably wouldn’t hurt to turn the
music down a little. Just a friendly suggestion.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.190
I’m sure some of you out there are seasoned
concert-goers, so what do you guys think?

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.970
Have you noticed your hearing getting worse
over the years? Let us know your thoughts
