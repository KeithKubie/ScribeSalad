00:00:00.616 --> 00:00:02.972
- [Voiceover] Lina was
watching a football game.

00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:07.554
The team she was cheering for
gained six yards on one play.

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:10.433
It lost eight yards on the next play.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:13.857
It lost another two yards
on the following play.

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:17.015
Lina wants to know what
her team's net change

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:21.055
in field position was
after these three plays.

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.529
Which of the following equations

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.550
matches the situation above?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.931
So, let's think about it.

00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:27.035
The team she was cheering for,

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:28.768
first they gained six yards.

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:31.182
So that's positive six yards.

00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:33.028
Then they lost eight.

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:35.965
So it'd be six minus eight.

00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:37.892
And then it lost another two.

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:40.468
So, six minus eight minus two.

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:43.241
This is six minus eight but then plus two.

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.788
So, this isn't right.

00:00:44.788 --> 00:00:47.330
This is six plus negative eight

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.281
which is equivalent to six minus eight,

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.465
plus negative two.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:53.227
So, this would be equivalent
to six minus eight minus two.

00:00:53.227 --> 00:00:54.230
Or another way to think about it,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.188
they gained six yards.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:58.521
Then they lost eight yards.

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:00.425
And then they lost another two yards.

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:01.865
So, definitely go with that one.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.397
Let's keep going.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.471
Eddie and Fran are scuba diving.

00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:11.569
Eddie is 35 meters below
the surface of the water,

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:15.853
and Fran is eight meters
directly above him.

00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:18.561
The following situation describes this,

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:22.470
or the following equation
describes this situation.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.990
So let's see, Eddie is 35 meters

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.672
below the surface of the water.

00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:28.123
So, when we're below the surface,

00:01:28.723 --> 00:01:31.107
or the more below the surface we are,

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:33.870
the more negative, I guess
is what we're doing here.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.382
So, if we're at the surface of the water,

00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:38.972
you would be at zero meters.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.681
And they tell us Fran is
eight meters above him.

00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:46.826
So we're taking Eddie's depth at 35 meters

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:48.822
and then Fran is eight meters above.

00:01:48.822 --> 00:01:50.181
So, we're adding eight,

00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:54.325
to figure out Fran's depth
of negative 27 meters.

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:57.761
Notice, this is eight
meters above Eddie's depth.

00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.919
So, negative 27 is Fran's depth.

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:04.866
She is 27 meters below
the surface of the water.

00:02:05.342 --> 00:02:07.002
So, select all that apply.

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:10.183
Fran is 27 meters below
the surface of the water.

00:02:10.183 --> 00:02:11.785
Yeah, that's what we just talked about.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.465
If your depth is, or
I guess you could say,

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:18.286
if you're at negative 27

00:02:18.286 --> 00:02:20.283
that means 27 meters below the water.

00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:21.722
If you were at positive 27,

00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:24.427
that means you're at 27
meters above the water.

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:26.018
So that's what they're telling us.

00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:27.678
Fran's position relative to the surface

00:02:27.678 --> 00:02:31.103
of the water is negative 27 meters.

00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:35.325
Yeah, I think that's a
reasonable way to say it.

00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:38.080
It's a little bit more confusing.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.064
But, yeah, she is negative 27 meters

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:42.444
below the surface of the water

00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:43.826
which we just said up here.

00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:46.078
So I think that's fair
enough to say that as well.

00:02:46.924 --> 00:02:48.655
Let's do one more.

00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:51.000
Fred's basement is flooded.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.100
The basement floor is 3.4 meters

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.579
below the ground floor.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:56.561
Alright, that makes sense

00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:59.974
that the basement is below
the ground, 3.4 meters.

00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:02.585
The water is 1.2 meters high.

00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:06.012
The following equation
describes this situation.

00:03:06.597 --> 00:03:10.875
So negative 3.4, that's where the floor

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:12.279
of the basement is.

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.091
It is 3.4 meters below the ground floor.

00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:17.562
So the ground floor would be zero.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:19.732
So, it's 3.4 meters
below the ground floor.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.520
So, that's the negative 3.4.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.331
But then the water is 1.2 meters.

00:03:23.331 --> 00:03:25.579
The top of, the surface of the water,

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.737
is 1.2 meters above the
floor of the basement.

00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:31.778
So this negative 2.2 is how high

00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:34.133
the top of the water is.

00:03:34.657 --> 00:03:36.777
So, what does negative 2.2 tell us?

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.135
Well, the top of the water is 2.2 meters

00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:42.328
below the ground floor.

00:03:42.328 --> 00:03:43.654
Yep, that's right.

00:03:43.654 --> 00:03:46.197
The water's 1.2 meters above the floor

00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:50.074
of the basement which
is negative 2.2 meters.

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:52.976
And this is all relative
to the ground floor.

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:53.928
So if the ground floor was zero,

00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:56.239
the top of the water is negative 2.2,

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.328
which means the top of
the water is 2.2 meters

00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:00.429
below, that's what the negative tells us,

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.193
below the ground floor.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.493
The water is 2.2 meters deep.

00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:05.294
No, that's not right.

00:04:05.294 --> 00:04:07.917
They tell us that the
water is 1.2 meters high

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:09.531
or 1.2 meters deep.

00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:10.552
So, that's not right.

00:04:10.552 --> 00:04:11.887
And we're not going to
click None of the above

00:04:11.887 --> 00:04:14.753
because we definitely
found, we found an answer.
