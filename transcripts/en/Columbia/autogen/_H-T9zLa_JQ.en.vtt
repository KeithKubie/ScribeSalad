00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:15.179
that has kind of been overarching over
 

00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:17.060
that has kind of been overarching over
the whole day that hasn't necessarily

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:17.070
the whole day that hasn't necessarily
 

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.049
the whole day that hasn't necessarily
been explicitly spoken about but it was

00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:20.059
been explicitly spoken about but it was
 

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:22.669
been explicitly spoken about but it was
it's about becoming a leader but then

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679
it's about becoming a leader but then
 

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:26.779
it's about becoming a leader but then
how leaders inspire new leaders and i

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:26.789
how leaders inspire new leaders and i
 

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:28.879
how leaders inspire new leaders and i
think the word that was missing that I

00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:28.889
think the word that was missing that I
 

00:18:28.889 --> 00:18:30.379
think the word that was missing that I
kept wanting to hear people talk about

00:18:30.379 --> 00:18:30.389
kept wanting to hear people talk about
 

00:18:30.389 --> 00:18:35.720
kept wanting to hear people talk about
was the need to trust people to be in

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:35.730
was the need to trust people to be in
 

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.820
was the need to trust people to be in
charge of their own leadership and you

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:37.830
charge of their own leadership and you
 

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.499
charge of their own leadership and you
can lead people but then at some point

00:18:39.499 --> 00:18:39.509
can lead people but then at some point
 

00:18:39.509 --> 00:18:41.690
can lead people but then at some point
you have to step away and trust that

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700
you have to step away and trust that
 

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.999
you have to step away and trust that
they're going to go off and and become a

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:44.009
they're going to go off and and become a
 

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:46.279
they're going to go off and and become a
butterfly and so there's that trust

00:18:46.279 --> 00:18:46.289
butterfly and so there's that trust
 

00:18:46.289 --> 00:18:48.529
butterfly and so there's that trust
issue that I think is really important

00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:48.539
issue that I think is really important
 

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:51.310
issue that I think is really important
part of the process so thank you so much

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320
part of the process so thank you so much
 

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.879
part of the process so thank you so much
the yep I mean that's the other thing

00:18:55.879 --> 00:18:55.889
the yep I mean that's the other thing
 

00:18:55.889 --> 00:18:57.590
the yep I mean that's the other thing
that I was thinking about in terms of a

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600
that I was thinking about in terms of a
 

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.210
that I was thinking about in terms of a
question that I didn't ask but i think

00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220
question that I didn't ask but i think
 

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.850
question that I didn't ask but i think
is equally important is how are you

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860
is equally important is how are you
 

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.129
is equally important is how are you
receptive to leadership or how are you

00:19:04.129 --> 00:19:04.139
receptive to leadership or how are you
 

00:19:04.139 --> 00:19:06.529
receptive to leadership or how are you
receptive to mentorship and so i think

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539
receptive to mentorship and so i think
 

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:09.409
receptive to mentorship and so i think
just as much as we've talked about what

00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:09.419
just as much as we've talked about what
 

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:10.820
just as much as we've talked about what
does it take to be a leader in what is

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:10.830
does it take to be a leader in what is
 

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.549
does it take to be a leader in what is
good practice in leading it's just as

00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559
good practice in leading it's just as
 

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:14.810
good practice in leading it's just as
important to sort of understand how to

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820
important to sort of understand how to
 

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.730
important to sort of understand how to
follow and how to be mentored and so i

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740
follow and how to be mentored and so i
 

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.739
follow and how to be mentored and so i
think that could probably be another

00:19:18.739 --> 00:19:18.749
think that could probably be another
 

00:19:18.749 --> 00:19:21.919
think that could probably be another
full day of conversations but as people

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:21.929
full day of conversations but as people
 

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:23.570
full day of conversations but as people
take away from this and think about it

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580
take away from this and think about it
 

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.680
take away from this and think about it
that piece of it

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:25.690
that piece of it
 

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.730
that piece of it
should be a part of the takeaway I think

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740
should be a part of the takeaway I think
 

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.580
should be a part of the takeaway I think
there was something that mean that

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:32.590
there was something that mean that
 

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:36.899
there was something that mean that

Elliot mentioned earlier about you know
these not being Lyford that's you know

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.070
these not being Lyford that's you know
 

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.669
these not being Lyford that's you know
decisions that are being made which you

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679
decisions that are being made which you
 

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:43.350
decisions that are being made which you
know I jot it down well then if every

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360
know I jot it down well then if every
 

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.080
know I jot it down well then if every
decision isn't a life or death you know

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.090
decision isn't a life or death you know
 

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.779
decision isn't a life or death you know
situation then you know having more

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:48.789
situation then you know having more
 

00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:50.759

could be wrote low risk and high reward
so there is that that trust element that

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480
so there is that that trust element that
 

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.210
so there is that that trust element that
you know what's what's the worst that

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:57.220
you know what's what's the worst that
 

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.950
you know what's what's the worst that

done about my perception of something as
opposed to saying you are doing it this

00:29:59.860 --> 00:29:59.870
opposed to saying you are doing it this
 

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.440
opposed to saying you are doing it this
way where you actually end up making it

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:02.450
way where you actually end up making it
 

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.930
way where you actually end up making it
about yourself or it's about the person

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:04.940
about yourself or it's about the person
 

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.910
about yourself or it's about the person
who's giving feedback it's not about as

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:06.920
who's giving feedback it's not about as
 

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.220
who's giving feedback it's not about as
much about the person who's getting the

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:09.230
much about the person who's getting the
 

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.530
much about the person who's getting the
feedback and so I think if you can set

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:11.540
feedback and so I think if you can set
 

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.880
feedback and so I think if you can set
down some ground rules and I'm sure

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:12.890
down some ground rules and I'm sure
 

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.290
down some ground rules and I'm sure
there's literature out that out there

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:14.300
there's literature out that out there
 

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.090
there's literature out that out there
about how to do this and Beth can

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:16.100
about how to do this and Beth can
 

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.220
about how to do this and Beth can
probably counsel you through how to do

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:18.230
probably counsel you through how to do
 

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.770
probably counsel you through how to do
this if you need guidance and that way

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:20.780
this if you need guidance and that way
 

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.290
this if you need guidance and that way
but you know I think that should happen

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:23.300
but you know I think that should happen
 

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.810
but you know I think that should happen
before you actually get to the feedback

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:25.820
before you actually get to the feedback
 

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.320
before you actually get to the feedback
stage

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:26.330
stage
 

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:32.769
stage
it's just my two cents I think it's

00:30:32.769 --> 00:30:32.779
it's just my two cents I think it's
 

00:30:32.779 --> 00:30:34.930
it's just my two cents I think it's
really important to kind of tease out

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:34.940
really important to kind of tease out
 

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.509
really important to kind of tease out
exactly what that person is looking for

00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519
exactly what that person is looking for
 

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:39.700
exactly what that person is looking for
to because they can say oh can you tell

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:39.710
to because they can say oh can you tell
 

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.950
to because they can say oh can you tell
me you know what I need to do better but

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960
me you know what I need to do better but
 

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.659
me you know what I need to do better but
I think it's important to look at okay

00:30:43.659 --> 00:30:43.669
I think it's important to look at okay
 

00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:46.060
I think it's important to look at okay

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.930
to not just take that question at face
value but to tease out what that

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:19.940
