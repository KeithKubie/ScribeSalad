&gt;&gt; Speaker One: From the Library
of Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.590
&gt;&gt; In our final talk before lunch,
Patrick Cronin and Thomas Neville,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.730
organizers of THATClass,
will share a story

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.890
about their summer camp last year,
working with high school students

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.890
to research the 1968
Washington, D.C. riots.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.230
Thomas, Patrick, please
take it away.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thomas Neville: Honor to be here.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.410
Thank you, very much.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.920
&gt;&gt; Singer: Everybody ready.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.220
[inaudible].

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.520
[ Singing ]

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.890
Oh, I feel all right, this morning.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.190
Yeah.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.510
[ Blues Guitar Music ]

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.010
[ Singing And Guitar Music ]

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.310
[ Singing ]

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:55.160
You ain't nothin' but a hound
dog, [inaudible] 'round my door.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.460
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker Two: Can you tell me
what you [inaudible] to begin?

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.780
&gt;&gt; Student One: So, I'm into music.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.990
And I'm just trying to figure
out, or just look at things,

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.360
how music like influences
the society, culture,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.000
and just really anything
about music.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.560
And I was told about a court
case on Elvis Presley copyright

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.710
on the song ''Hound Dog''.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.760
Pretty sure a lot of
people know that.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.970
And basically, it's actually
a version [inaudible]

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.270
African [inaudible].

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.060
An African American wrote
it and it was their song.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.360
But kind of, Elvis kind
of made it his own.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.450
&gt;&gt; Student Two: It's an interesting
change, since you know, usually,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.320
[inaudible] library, you
only go into libraries.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.980
As a student, I've really seen
archives before this [inaudible].

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker Two: What do you think
you're going to find in the file?

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.190
&gt;&gt; Student Three: I'm
not sure, right now.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.920 position:56%
But this guy, I'm still trying to
figure out what he got arrested for.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.870
But yeah. I don't know, yet.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.300
Hopefully, something interesting.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker Two: What
did [inaudible]?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Student Four: The [inaudible]
Ferry Towers master plans from 1950.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker Two: Okay.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.380
And how did you come about
wanting to know about this?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.000
&gt;&gt; Student Four: Well, ideas,
like have some projects

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.300
like [inaudible] housing.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.750 position:56%
So, I'm looking at housing designs
and like history throughout Atlanta.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.390
And I'm also going to like look
how it's designed, because I want

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.080
to have a new design that
doesn't victimize the residents

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.020
that stay there.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker Two: Okay.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.660
&gt;&gt; Joel Walker: The internet,
you're just looking at,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.100
you know, a digital copy.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.110
And I just can't imagine
that kids get overly excited

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.400
about looking at a screen.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.060
&gt;&gt; Student Two: It [inaudible]
provides a more interesting aspect

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.770
than if you're looking
just on a computer.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.310
Since coming here, just
looking at it in person,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.650 position:56%
you really get the interesting feel.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.130
I don't know how to describe it.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.980
It's nicer, I guess.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker Two: And physically,
in front of you, what is that?

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.970
&gt;&gt; Student One: Well, this is
what I was just told, a song disc.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.830
I'm not sure exactly what this is.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.650
But I know the one
before it, this is.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.120
Because these are records.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.700
And they're 45's.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.810
So, 45 is a lot of speed.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.580
And this is, this is right
here, is ''Hound Dog''.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker Two: And how is
listening to music on this different

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.640
than listening to music
through that?

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.210
Or is it the same?

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker Three: It's not.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.290
&gt;&gt; Student One: It's not the same.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.730 position:56%
Because well one, it's I don't know.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.030
It's vert authentic.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.440
That's the only thing I can say.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.620
All the snap, crackle, and pops.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.130
&gt;&gt; Joel Walker: The other thing
is not everything is going

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.280
to be on the internet.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.910
You know, we've calculated that if
we scan 40,000 scans a month here,

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.990
we would be done in 1,300 years.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.680
And so, not everything is
going to be on the internet.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.330
And what is on the internet
has already been discovered.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:23.240
Where when you have the box
experience, you may find something

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.480
that nobody else has found, before.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.680
And that's actually more
common than people might think.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker Two: Did
that happen, today?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.300
&gt;&gt; Joel Walker: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.690
A young lady looked at
record group, it was RG31.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.440
I don't remember the
name of the record group.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.360
I had never been on
that record group.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.020
Nathan had never been
on that record group.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.000
Sarah [assumed spelling] had
never been on that record group.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.540
And we have worked here
for a combined 22 years.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.620
&gt;&gt; Student Four: I wanted
to look at the outside

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.430
and how you can't really
see when you're segregated,

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.550
how people that need
housing can't afford it.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.650
But people that have
housing, they can.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.460
I wanted to see how to bring
both of these people together.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.820
And so, it doesn't victimize a
lower class than upper class.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker Two: I think
I'm going to come back

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.140
and see what else you find, later.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.530
Thank you, so much.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.900
&gt;&gt; Student Four: You're welcome.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.840
&gt;&gt; Patrick Cronin: We met
these students that morning.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.890 position:56%
Now, traditionally, when high school
students go to the National Archives

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.070
or to a special collections
area, they get a tour.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.410
And they're lucky if
they see, maybe,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.170
some prize collections
and then, they go home.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.230
So, before lunch, this group got to
use the finding aids, themselves.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:04.140
They got to consult personally
and privately with an archivist.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.150
And they got to touch
neglected archival materials.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.940
Then, in the afternoon,
they were ready

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.740
to let the archival materials
guide their research.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.530
&gt;&gt; Thomas Neville: So, Patrick
and I started work with students

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.860
and archives about five years, ago.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.610
We were both teaching history at
a nearby high school, together.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.190
When we arrived, it was one of
these schools where, largely,

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.580
that engagement with
the past was restricted

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.990
to the traditional textbook
and testing curriculum.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.290
And Patrick had come in with a lot

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.590
of project based learning
experience.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.890
I've been dabbling with archives.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.190
And we had been strategizing

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.490
on what might make a richer
experience for these students.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.790
And what might they actually be
capable of if you empowered them

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.090
and put them in that position.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.390
And the result was us
being the students first,

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.690
as you saw on the last slide.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:46.990
And because the limitations
of a normal school,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.290
we can't just hop up
and leave campus.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.590
So, we went to the archives.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.890
We went to another archive.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.190
And we bundled what we could
and recreated what we could

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.490
of the archive in the
classroom, to get started.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.790
We replaced a textbook unit
with local archival materials

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.090
that cover the same time, and we
felt addressed the same things

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.390
and challenged to the
American experience.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.690
So, just a few things that you
can see in this time period.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.990
Students merging technology and
primary documents in the classroom.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.290
Working with experts
from the community.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.160
This is local writer and
historian, John Muller.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.930
We scaffold them up
to the experience,

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.300
and then we bring them
to the archives.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.230
This is the National
Archives, just down the road.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.350
And the first student that
got their research ID.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.240
We had go into the finding
aids, work with the archivists.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.540
Learn how to make a pole.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.440
She put in her pole, and as the
students finished getting their

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.340
research cards, they came in

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.390
and they taught one
another how to do this.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.720
And they left there, knowing how
to navigate that location in a way

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.010
that some other folks might have
said, ''Yeah, but that's sort

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.490
of above their pay
grade,'' so to speak.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.370
Actually, when we arrived
on the research side,

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.570
they said student groups, they
[inaudible] on the other side.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:50.560 position:56%
And so, these students kind of came
in and broke the norm in that sense.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.990
And we also interacted
with community members.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.900
This is the legendary Reverend
O.J. [assumed spelling],

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.070
giving us a oral history
walking tour

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.430
of the alley that he grew up in.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.000
Because this is one of the topics
that our students are researching.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.490
And in addition to not just
interacting with the archives,

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.000
we had them thinking about how
can you represent this information

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.300
that you're finding?

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.120
The interpretations that you're
making, in different ways?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.420
We had them exploring how

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.380
to use different visual mapping
tools, including MapStory.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.160
And here you see a nice little
Tweet representing the efforts

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.070
that they made to map the history
of alley communities in Washington,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.840
D.C. And the result was
that they got to present,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.580
they were the opening presentation

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.270
at the D.C. Historical
Studies Conference.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.570
They shared their process

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.140
as high school students
engaging in this kind of work.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.900
And we saw, throughout
that spread of time,

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.130
that if you gave these
students the opportunity,

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.370 position:56%
whether in the classroom or in the
archive, that they would be excited.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.470
That they were capable and that
the contribute to the construction

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.910
of our understanding of our past.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:58.070
&gt;&gt; Patrick Cronin: But we
kept running into limitations.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.300
Those conventional
structural limitations.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:09.050
May they be a bell schedule, or
just a constraint of the classroom.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.160
They could be a scheduling a field
trip, getting permission forms.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.370
All of these, there's
many, many more.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.850
I'm sure many of you have
actually encountered some of these.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:23.520
So, we started to think, okay,
what's happening elsewhere

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.150
where they've done away with or
ameliorated some of these concerns?

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.660
And the only thing we
could find is in STEM.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:38.140
So, this is a photograph
of a STEM lab that is

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.440
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.310
It's called NuVu.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:47.490
It was started by an MIT
architectural design PhD student.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.340
And the general model
is the kids are pulled

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.870
from their traditional high school

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.190
and they work here,
full time, as a student.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.410
And they're engaged in
some really great work.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:08.820
We went from that concept and said,
how can we start a program that is

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.510
without these limitations?

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.000
Though, naturally, we
went to the summer.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.890 position:56%
And our first project was uncovering
the 1968 riots in Washington,

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:24.310
D.C. And it was at the Washington,

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:29.270
D.C. public library special
collections, funded by them.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:35.660
Here's a picture that is in
the lab of the humanities.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.140
Right. It wasn't artificial,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.080
like that studio you
saw for STEM in NuVu.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.310
It was a common location.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.420
This is, well, the former
Kipling area library

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:58.380 position:56%
in the Carnegie Building, just up
the road, soon to be an Apple store.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.830
We took students to those places

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.630
where overhead is already
taken care of.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.430
Right. Galleries, libraries,
archives, and museums.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.500
Most of which are free
to the public.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.450
And they're welcoming
us with open arms.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.120
Please bring students.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.930
Very glamorous work.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.810
Students wearing white gloves.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.220
Right. This is our
little hub for the summer,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.070
sixty-hour program, two years ago.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.540
Students collaborating
on independent research.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:41.810
Then, working together on a formal
project, a product, if you will.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.020
We brought in outside experts.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.150
Here, leaning over the
computer and leaning

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.450
over a student is a man named
Brian Kraft [assumed spelling].

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:53.480
He's involved, currently, in a
ten-year project to map, digitally,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.890
every building in Washington,

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.550
D.C. To call him an expert
is an understatement.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:06.660
He's leaning over a student who's
working with some RTIS maps.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.100
In fact, it's a map he created.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.530
So, we though actually
we'd bring him out.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:19.720
At this time, Brian was, this
is, for lack of a better word,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.050
student Brian or little Brian.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.800
Was 14 at the time.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.050
Also, the minimum age that
a researcher can get a card

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.190
at the National Archives.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.500
And Brian, why don't
you come on out?

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.510
Brian is currently.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:43.250
[ Applause ]

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:49.460
He's currently a rising junior at
School Without Walls in Washington,

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:54.720
D.C. But he's also one of
15 students in the city

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.460
who was just accepted to George
Washington University's early

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.510
college program.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:07.560
[ Applause ]

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.740
We thought we'd have Brian
give us his perspective on.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.880
We'll show you some visuals
as we've sort of been doing.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.940
And he'll maybe tell you
a little bit more detail,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.480
what he's worked on that's visible.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Kraft: Okay.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.080
So, yeah, that's Brian Kraft.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.930
So, on my lap is a D.C.
report, government report

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.920
on the riots and the damage.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.200
So, if you see, it's
this like street images,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.080
like on each block of the damage.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.240
So, basically, what I'm trying
to do is replicate that image

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.530
or those images, and so,
sorry, if I'm rambling.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.650
But in this book, there's this
whole like a fold-out page

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.970
of like a hand-drawn damage map
of the entire Seventh Street

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.510
and 14th Street during the riots.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.970
So, what I'm trying to do is
basically draw out each block,

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.050
each building, color it in.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.130
If it's like damaged,
how damaged it is.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.310
If it's salvageable
or unsalvageable.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.780
And replicate it, digitally.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.290
And basically, at this stage,
I was really, you know,

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.080
immersed in my work, So,
when he came, I was like,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.240
I don't really need his help, but.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.270 position:56%
But you know, I still, you know, was
polite, you know, I took his tips.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.210
Like, you know.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.390
But I didn't, I wasn't, so.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.460
But still, you know, it
was a valuable experience.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.320
And that actually turned
into a internship offer

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.990
at his engineering firm, GMT.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.710
So, that was cool.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.010
I didn't get to do it.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.000
I didn't get security clearance,
because they're not going to let,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.160
you know, a 14-year-old touch
multimillion dollar documents.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.880
So, I couldn't do that.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.750
But still, good experience.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.350
So, this is the beginning stage of.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.410
So, this is from the
archive, National Archive.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.410
So, we had, I think,
two, three hours.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:59.930
So, this is basically our only
time to gather original documents.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.830
And so, that's me,
holding that camera,

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.660
and that's one of my
partners, James.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.600
So, basically, what we did for two
hours straight, I held the camera.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.340
He flipped the page.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.640
I took the picture.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.940
Flip it. I took the picture.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.700
Flip it. And that was, I
don't know, 30 minutes.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.500
Then, I took a break for my neck.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.730
And I went back at it.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.900
So, we were doing that
for two hours, straight.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.150 position:56%
So, once we got all the information,

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.790
I shared the pictures
with my other partners.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.190
And we had to put it
in this spreadsheet.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.880
So, it's basically 30
columns, horizontally.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.600
Different information, like
the percentage of damage,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.840
how much the damage cost,
the owner of the building.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.540
If it's repairable, what type of
damage; glass, water, fire damage.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.630
And it's about like 90
people in that spreadsheet.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.590
And then, I had to import that
spreadsheet into this map.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.690
So, these little black dots,
those are each of the 90 people

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.350
that we collected the reports on.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.450
And if you would click, if
you were to click on it,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:02.330
you'd see their name, their
age, the building that they own,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.620
the address, what type of damage.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.920
So, there's that.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.550
And then, the red, yellow,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.120
and orange spots you can see
here, is the extent of damage.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.090
That was the hand-drawn
map I was talking about.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:18.910 position:56%
I literally had to take a mouse and
draw the rectangle, draw the square,

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.730
and then color it in for, I don't
know, about 11 street's worth.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.630
From L to Q, or S,
I don't even know.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.050
But yeah, I had to do that.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.950
And then, if you can barely
see these little plus marks,

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.740
those are the images of each block.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.360 position:56%
So, you are able to get like digital
visual, then an actual visual.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.120
And then, if you click on it,
like the individual details

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.790
about the specific building.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.290
&gt;&gt; Patrick Cronin:
Unbelievable work that Brian did.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.140
And we've decided we
would do another project,

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.690
the very next summer.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.290
And sure enough, I got an email
from Brian, ''Hey, can I help

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.590
and do a different
project?'' I said, ''Well,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.620 position:56%
you just continue work on the riots.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.920
You don't need me.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.360
What am I going to do for you?

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.660
Just work on the riots.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.280
Finish'', you know, ''Go
finish your map.'' He said,

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.580
''No, I want to do something.

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.730
I want to do your new topic,
''Downtime and Debauchery

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:21.660
in Civil War Washington''.'' We
looked at brothels in the city.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.480
The goal of this project was
to take it to the next level.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.590
We thought Brian was
doing amazing work,

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.590 position:56%
but how do we know where the bar is?

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.330
And so, we looked at
existing projects.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.730
This is from Ken Winkle
at University Nebraska,

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.430
''Civil War Washington''.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.710
And on this map, there's
a missing layer.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.770
And the layer is brothels
during the Civil War.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:50.100
So, Brian made the layer.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.660
And it started to get the
attention of the National Archives.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.830
And in fact, Brian was one
of a few high schoolers

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.330
to do the first digitization
that exists

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.320
in the National Archives catalog.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.840
&gt;&gt; Thomas Neville: So, one more
project we'd like to highlight,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.740 position:56%
I think, brings in another aspect of
where we think the potential can be

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.860
for students working
with collections.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.550
As a teacher at the American School
of Paris, I started a project

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.520 position:56%
and partnership with the local World
War One cemetery, that's managed

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.460
by the American Battle
Monuments Commission.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.280
And meeting with the
supervisors there, they said,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.230
''We have all these
soldiers buried here.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.260
And for most of them, we don't
know anything beyond what's

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.170
on the grave stone.''
And as a teacher,

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.040
that was the perfect problem
statement to start with,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.680
in getting the students engaged.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.780
So, I had my, go back real quick.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.850
Thanks. Eighth graders in
Paris, partner with middle

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.070
and high schoolers from Lopez
Island, Washington State,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:52.650
to research the 29 Washingtonians
buried in this cemetery.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.740
And here's a student who's starting

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:02.580
with the little bit
of data that she has.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.680
And just a glimpse into
this remote collaboration.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.280
These students, nine hours apart,
working together using collections

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.090 position:56%
in their respective countries to try

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.310
to collaborate and
tell these stories.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.070
And this is an example.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.370
This is Raymond Bennett.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.930
He died on the first day of
the Battle of Chateau-Thierry.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:25.870
And this is a mix of documents that
were both digitized and available

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.480
in certain databases,
like Chronicling America.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.050
But also, archives and
materials that weren't digitized.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.690
And these students, these
eighth graders learned how

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.590
to identify relevant archives,
write them very polite emails.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.000
And ask them if they had
any relevant documents

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.070
and if they could digitize
them and email them to Paris.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.370
And they did.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.150
And now, they've aggregated
their work on an app

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.150
that you can download, right now,
for free, on the Apple store.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.870
And you can go to the cemetery
and whatever they have found

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.810
about these soldiers is pinned
to the location of their grave.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.590
And you can stand there at the
grave and learn about somebody who,

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.400
just four months ago,
we knew nothing about.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:07.600
And we were joined in
less than three months

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.970
by an independent researcher
in Pennsylvania,

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.120
who offered her own research about
Jewish soldiers from that state.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.600
Independent researcher from
West Virginia, who has confirmed

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.500
that he convinced the Undergraduate
Public History Department,

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.150
University of West Virginia,
to join in, in the fall.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.150
A family from Illinois,
whose ancestor is buried

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.040
in the [inaudible]
cemetery that we studied.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.340
She shared all of her documents

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.840
and let us digitize
them, for the first time.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.220
They'd been kept in a cigar box.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.350
And a school in New York
City, you might have heard of,

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.100
called Stuyvesant, and
their students jumped in.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.670
And offered more than I
could handle at the time.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.130
And now, you can go, as
these students are doing,

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.710
and learn about the
research of others, for free.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.320
Stuff that was never available
before, on a free app.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.140
And we're hoping to get more and
more involvement on this project

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.210
and projects like this, that
connect collections across space.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:03.490
And get students engaged in
processes that develop real skills.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Patrick Cronin: Like to
reemphasize that this was Tom's work

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.090
with middle school students.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.590
Something to think about.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:16.510
Maybe, we could trickle up.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.650
[ Laughter ]

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:27.850
This is a little excerpt from
an article written last year.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:33.510
And Brian was interviewed
for the article.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.340
[ Laughter ]

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.090
The line after, we don't have
it, was high praise, indeed.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.390
But that's okay.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:51.860
We want to come back to Brian,
here, and simply ask him sort

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:58.490
of off the cuff, he's
asking for more time.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.410
The middle schoolers asked, well,

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:01.920
if you had one thing,
what could you do?

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.220
Well, we need more time.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.060
We just need more time.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.840
What would you have
done with more time?

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Kraft: Yeah.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.880
So, the map, that was
Seventh Street.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.930
But another major street during
the riots was 14th Street.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.840
And I wasn't really
able to get to that.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.030
So, if I had more time, I probably
would have done 14th Street.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.680
And then, also, probably would
have gone back to archives,

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.010
take more pictures,
get more information.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.370
Probably have more individuals in
the spreadsheet and import that.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:32.450
But yeah, that's basically
what that was about.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.570
And I think, you know,
archives learning is just

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.710
so much more valuable.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.730
No offense, but more valuable
than textbook learning.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.210 position:56%
Because, you know, you're
experiencing information first-hand,

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:48.320
primary source, you know, usually
superior to secondary sources.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.020
And you can reach your own
conclusions and remember,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.470
and you retain more information,

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.990
once you reach your
own conclusion based

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.500
on the information
that's given to you.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.140
So, I just think archival
learning is much more,

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.320
you know, viable than textbook.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.100
&gt;&gt; Patrick Cronin: And we had
the final challenge, then.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:08.230
What if students like Brian
had an entire semester?

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:13.740
But your gut reaction is, yeah but.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.630
What if we rethink that?

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:17.930
I'll ask, again.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:23.760
What if students like Brian
had an entire semester?

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.060
Yes and.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.280
&gt;&gt; Thomas Neville: I would just
add that each of the projects

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.160
that we've shown you along the way,
we've been met with ''yeah buts''.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.370
And Patrick and I, sort

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.090
of our protocol is we call
each other out on that.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:44.420
And we've been very adamant about
saying, ''Give me a yes and.'' So,

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.700
we're asking you to
think about that.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.190
And you can share that conversation

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.750
as the lovely deep voice has
been saying on social media.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:57.760
But we just, don't
yeah but us, right now.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.380
If that was possible, yes and.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.510
Thank you, very much.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:11.050
