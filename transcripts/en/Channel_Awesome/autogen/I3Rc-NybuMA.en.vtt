yeah I feel like this is South Park
where Jesus has to answer that question

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:44.019
where Jesus has to answer that question
 

00:14:44.019 --> 00:14:45.329
where Jesus has to answer that question
he's like I'm not gonna touch that one

00:14:45.329 --> 00:14:45.339
he's like I'm not gonna touch that one
 

00:14:45.339 --> 00:14:46.139
he's like I'm not gonna touch that one
with a 10-foot Pole

00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:46.149
with a 10-foot Pole
 

00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:47.939
with a 10-foot Pole
that's what I want to be like right now

00:14:47.939 --> 00:14:47.949
that's what I want to be like right now
 

00:14:47.949 --> 00:15:06.390
that's what I want to be like right now
but we have to for you the vibe for you

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:06.400
 
 

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.460
 
you
