00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.800
The history of film is full of tragic love
stories, from Casablanca

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.370
to Brokeback Mountain, Brief Encounter, Ghost,
An Affair to Remember, Titanic, or Amour…

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.559
The list goes on and on!

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.520
Movies seem to capture that mix of yearning,
anguish, and exhilaration that comes with

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.270
falling in love so well.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.040
Especially when that love can’t last.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.050
And that’s because film is, at its core,
an emotional medium.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.470
It immerses us in a world with intricate settings
and sounds.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.850
And we live vicariously through characters
as their stories unfold before us.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.620
No one can chart the complex course of the
human heart quite like the filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.020
And the film In the Mood for Love is a great
example of his skill, whether we see it as

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.440
a deep meditation on human longing, or a reflection
of the sociopolitical tensions in our world.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:59.360
[intro music plays]

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.600
In the Mood for Love tells the story of a
doomed love affair set in 1960s Hong Kong.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.810
It was released in 2000 and hailed an instant
classic, winning awards all over the globe,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.820
from Cannes to Chicago.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.299
But the film’s journey to the screen began
years before that.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.420
In the mid-1990s, Wong Kar-Wai, the film’s
writer-director, was riding a wave to the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.560
forefront of international cinema.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.310
Films like 1990’s Days of Being Wild
and 1994’s Chunking Express put him on the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.280
map as an exciting young filmmaker with a
distinctive voice.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.409
He achieves that voice by working in a very
unusual way: He often goes off-script and

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.729
follows inspiration as it strikes, sometimes
changing the nature of a film in the middle

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:37.729
of a shoot.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.939
As a result, many of his films end up playing
with time, repeating moments or scenes.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.009
He’s not afraid to fragment a narrative
to illuminate deep yet simple truths about

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.439
the human experience.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.749
In his book on Wong Kar-Wai, the film scholar
Stephen Teo notes that “Wong’s films are

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:55.030
best seen as a series of interconnecting short
stories.”

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.939
In the Mood for Love fits that bill.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.609
It’s a movie made up of gestures, like closely
observed looks between characters, and moments,

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.189
like shots of people walking down the street
or racing up a flight of stairs.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.960
Individually, the shots are gorgeous and atmospheric.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.710
Collectively, they take on new meaning and
depth, and build a portrait of intense longing.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.270
The film’s story came together slowly over
many years.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.300
At one point it was going to be a sequel to
his breakout film, Days of Being Wild.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.470
Later, it would be a romance called Springtime
in Beijing.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.220
Wong Kar-Wai even started shooting some of
the movie under the title Secrets at the same

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.500
time he was making Happy Together in Hong
Kong.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.840
Eventually, he found inspiration in a novella
by Liu Yi-chang called

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.470
“Dui Dao,” or “Intersection.”

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.970
True to its title, this vaguely stream-of-consciousness
work follows the interior monologues of two

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.370
characters whose paths keep crossing in the
streets of Hong Kong.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.840
And, from this spark, he created the film
In the Mood for Love as we know it today.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.460
Tony Leung plays Mr. Chow, a married man who
rents a room in one of Hong Kong’s famously

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.950
overcrowded apartment buildings.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.300
Mrs. Chan, played by Maggie Cheung, and her
husband rent the room next door.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.340
Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan often find themselves
home alone, their spouses off traveling for

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.660
business or working late.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.640
In fact, their spouses are so absent from
the film that the movie never shows us their faces!

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.360
Eventually, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan discover
that their spouses are having an affair.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.960
So our heroes embark on an affair of their
own.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960
Sort of.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.690
Rather than jumping into each other’s arms
or beds, they skirt the edges of an actual

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.150
romantic relationship.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.540
They “play-act” the roles of each other’s
spouses.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.080
And they improvise ways that affair might
have started.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.120
When they go to dinner, Mrs. Chan orders Mr.
Chow the steak she imagines her husband would

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120
have had.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.620
And Mr. Chow orders her a spicy dish his wife
would enjoy.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.700
Later, they act out an imagined confrontation
between Mrs. Chan and her husband, where she

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.520
accuses him of having a mistress.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.480
Mrs. Chan: I didn't expect it to hurt that much.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.040
Mr. Chow: This is just a rehearsal.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.460
And finally, in an emotionally brutal scene,
they rehearse the end of their own affair.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.480
It leaves Mrs. Chan devastated, as make-believe
hits too close to home.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.310
Throughout their relationship, they collaborate
on a serialized story Mr. Chow is writing

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.960
and spend a single night together in a hotel.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.980
What they do that night is left a mystery.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.660
And while it’s clear to us that these two
are falling in love, they keep denying it

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.690
to themselves, even as their ambitions and
fears become more intertwined.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.260
In the end, their love can’t survive, and
they go their separate ways.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.980
A devastating coda shows them just missing
each other over the years, and eventually

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.600
makes it clear that their affair will never
be rekindled.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.580
On its surface, In the Mood for Love is a
straightforward story of repressed love.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.730
And, as with most Wong Kar-Wai films, it’s
meticulously designed, arranged, and shot.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.280
Wong is a known fan of film noir and melodramas
from Hollywood’s Golden Age, like Douglas

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.790
Sirk’s All that Heaven Allows.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.960
And he saturates this film with dark urban
streets, deep shadows, and almost lurid reds

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.380
and blue-greens – the colors of passion,
guilt, and jealousy.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.070
Wong has often cited Alfred Hitchcock’s
Vertigo as a chief inspiration for In the

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.070
Mood for Love.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.760
It’s another film drenched in color, built
on suspense, in which characters play-act

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.760
a relationship.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.150
In this film, the camera embraces the central
affair in ways the characters never do.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.510
It slides back and forth between them at dinner.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.790
It tracks them in slow motion through the
street.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.040
And it observes them thinking alone, their
faces betraying none of the emotions roiling

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.040
under the surface.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.010
Instead, those emotions spill forth through
those brilliant colors and a lush romantic

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.470
soundtrack that spans Japanese and Chinese
period pop songs and Spanish-language ballads

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.930
sung by Nat King Cole.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.750
Time and again, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan are
photographed through other objects – like

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.290
doorways, windows, furniture, or mirrors – as
though they’re being watched.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.260
Because, of course, they are.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.260
By us.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.150
As wonderfully designed and shot this film
is, its real power is revealed in how the

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.980
characters act out their spouses’ affair
with each other.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.580
In “Film &amp; History: An Interdisciplinary
Journal,” Humanities scholar Tony Hughes-d’Aeth

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.210
looks at the film through a Freudian lens.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.740
By reading the story this way, you can see
how the same fatal flaw that has doomed their

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.870
real marriages dooms their fantasy affair
too.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.800
Hughes-d’Aeth writes: “Both Mr. Chow and
Mrs. Chan are, beneath their suave mannerisms,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.390
paralyzed by a single, devastating idea: I
am not enough for the other.”

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.040
So the movie could be a deep examination of
tragedy, of two people who can’t escape

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.669
the sense of insufficiency they feel toward
their spouses, even when they have the chance

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.160
to start over with someone new.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.260
In this reading of the film, the romanticism
of the design, camerawork, and soundtrack

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.600
are in sharp contrast to the characters’
inability to accept that romance in their lives.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.460
In other words, the mood is set, and the love
may be real, but Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan can’t

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.210
bring themselves to act on it.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.180
In the end, they keep missing each other – first
in Singapore, and then back in Hong Kong.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.280
And this reading suggests that this is because
they’re more comfortable loving the imagined

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.070
versions of each other, rather than the real
people.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.100
Basically, the fantasy is what’s driving
their affair.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.360
And as much as In the Mood for Love zeroes
in on Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan’s story, another

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.310
way to look at this movie is to examine how
their relationship is a prism that reflects

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.520
the geo-politics of Hong Kong at the time.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.280
The film is explicitly set in Hong Kong between
1962 and 1966, a pivotal time in the history

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.280
of the territory.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.070
And even though the politics of the era take
place entirely in the background of the film,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.630
some critics argue that they’re key to fully
understanding it.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.070
The film begins in 1962, a period of relative
stability in the region.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.380
At the time, Hong Kong was a British colony
and a waypoint for emigrants leaving the economic

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.610
and political uncertainty of mainland China
for other countries.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.490
And those who settled permanently in Hong
Kong found themselves in an unusual place

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.690
– one where east met west and communism
met capitalism.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.610
The music and film studies scholar Giorgio
Biancorosso described Hong Kong at the time

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.300
as: “a political, social, and cultural space
that has become distinctly local, a space

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.270
defined both by the immigrant’s desire of
starting from scratch and the islander’s

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.340
sense of being separate.”

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.380
This idea of being stuck between two worlds
also drives the central conflict of In the

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.380
Mood for Love.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.080
Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan find themselves caught
between their own failed marriages, their

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.020
desire for each other, and their allegiance
to the restrictive social codes of the time

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.020
and place.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.230
When the film jumps to 1966, not only has
their love affair become deeply broken, but

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.280
the political realities of Hong Kong have
become chaotic too.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.700
1966 was the start of the Chinese Cultural
Revolution, a violent class struggle that

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.480
gripped mainland China for the next decade.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:13.560
Now, in 1966 in the world of the film, Mrs.
Chan returns to Hong Kong.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.010
She visits her former landlady, who essentially
set Mrs. Chan’s affair in motion.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.610
Her former landlady says she’s leaving Hong
Kong for the United States because of the

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.790
political instability.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.940
So just as the safe harbor of Hong Kong is
going through major changes, the space that

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.060
first incubated the love between Mrs. Chan
and Mr. Chow is coming to an end.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.759
That sense of uncertainty and of lost possibilities
infuses the film from its first carefully-crafted

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:37.380
frame to its last.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.669
So whatever lens you use to analyze In the
Mood for Love, the film holds up.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.999
It’s both a technical achievement and a
poetic examination of two people who fall

00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:50.939
deeply in love but are unwilling or unable
to accept happiness together.

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:53.040
Which is, ultimately, kind of haunting.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.380
Next time, we’ll trade the restrained longing
of 1960s Hong Kong for the raucous, scorching,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.550
hip-hop-infused Brooklyn of Spike Lee’s
Do the Right Thing.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.990
