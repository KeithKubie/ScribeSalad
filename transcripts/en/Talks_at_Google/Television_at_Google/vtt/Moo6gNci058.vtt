DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.941
We'll do a couple songs.

00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:19.398
And then we'll talk, and then
we'll do a couple more songs,

00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:21.127
and then we'll get
the fuck out of here.

00:05:26.678 --> 00:05:27.422
Thank you.

00:05:30.398 --> 00:05:34.300
I want to say something so I can
scroll the fuck out of there.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.126
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:35.960
If I say something--

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.709
I said it again, so
now I got to look at--

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:38.630
SPEAKER 1: I'm stuck.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.766
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I've got to
stop saying fuck, so that--

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:43.170
oh, shit.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.680
Now I'm-- this is bad.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.180
All right.

00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:53.320
Oh.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.350
OK, we'll do another song now.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.464
We'll do the-- we'll do
"Every Third Thought?"

00:05:58.464 --> 00:05:59.380
"Every Third Thought."

00:09:52.819 --> 00:09:54.316
Thank you.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.740
Real good-- my mother
would be OK with that.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:07.020
[LAUGHS] We'll do
one more, and then

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.420
we'll do a little chatting?

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.110
Yeah, OK, cool.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.135
Uh, what you want to do?

00:10:12.135 --> 00:10:12.985
SPEAKER 1: Little "Highwater"?

00:10:12.985 --> 00:10:14.780
DAVID DUCHOVNY: "Hell
or Highwater," OK.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.604
We'll do "Hell or Highwater."

00:15:31.188 --> 00:15:31.688

[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:40.440
SPEAKER 2: Hello.

00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:41.440
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Hi.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.630
SPEAKER 2: So first
off, thanks for coming.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.460
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Thanks for having me.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.220
SPEAKER 2: We appreciate it.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.420
I want to start with, like,
some broader questions.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.645
And then sort of work my way
down to more specific stuff

00:15:52.645 --> 00:15:53.270
about you work.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.811
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I
like your strategy.

00:15:54.811 --> 00:15:56.000
SPEAKER 2: Thank you.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.275
So first question is, like,
in tech, so we have this--

00:15:59.275 --> 00:16:00.150
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Tech?

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.740
You lost me.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.860
SPEAKER 2: We have a huge--

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.330
one of our buzzwords
is pivoting.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.640
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Uh oh.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.050
SPEAKER 2: And, you know,
you've done academia.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.810
You know, you went to Princeton
and Yale, all but dissertation.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.830
You've, you know, movies,
TV shows, "X-Files,"

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.280
"Californication,"
and now music.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.612
So I guess my question for
you is, you seem to have--

00:16:19.612 --> 00:16:20.570
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Novels.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.562
I've got a third novel coming--

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:21.950
SPEAKER 2: You
write novels, too.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:22.310
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
I don't want to--

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.090
I pivot.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.610
SPEAKER 2: Novels, too--

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.604
I wanted to ask more
about that later as well.

00:16:28.604 --> 00:16:29.770
I read "Bucky Fucking Dent."

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.230
DAVID DUCHOVNY: You did?

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.700
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, I did.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.350
So--

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.570
DAVID DUCHOVNY: That's
it, is you've read it?

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:34.570
Are you going to say
anything about it?

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.829
SPEAKER 2: No, I'll be
giving compliments later on.

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:37.620
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Oh!

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.197
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:39.530
SPEAKER 2: So you seem to have--

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.540
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I don't
like that strategy.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.900
I like the strategy--

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.980
compliments off the top.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.157
But anyway, go ahead.

00:16:44.157 --> 00:16:44.740
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.360
So you seem to have pivoted
a lot, successfully,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.100
in your career.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.490
So how are you able to do it?

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.700
What sort of challenges
did you face?

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.280
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Oh,
well, I mean, it--

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.070
I just think it's not that
I get bored so easily.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.960
I just think I have looked
for other modes of expression

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.119
to convey whatever it is I
feel I was put here to convey,

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.690
so just finding different
ways of expressing whatever

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.000
it is on my mind or
my heart at the time.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.740
So I started out as a
writer, unpublished,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.720
and then I became an actor.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.540
And then I went back to
being a writer, actor,

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.050
and then I discovered music
and started writing, you know,

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.280
lyrically that way and also
rediscovered myself as a prose

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.280
writer at the same time.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.780
So I don't know.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.490
It wasn't really intentional.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.870
It's more just,
like, I don't know

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.940
how to phrase it in a way
that makes total sense.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:47.420
But it's just like looking for
another window out or window

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.650
open to communicate something
through that open window.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.240
I've lost it now.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.070
But I think-- but
your question, you

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.820
know, it afforded me
a lot of opportunity.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.360
Because I had notoriety
as an actor to be given

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.150
a listen as a musician
or a read as a novelist.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:09.800
At the same time,
though, you know,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.860
I'm open to attacks of
just being a dilettante.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.300
So it's both.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.340
I get an opportunity to reach
more people than I probably

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.440
would if I didn't have
any kind of notoriety.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.504
But also I don't
get taken seriously.

00:18:23.504 --> 00:18:24.920
Like, what the
fuck are you doing?

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.420
You know?

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.960
Why don't you just
stay in your own lane?

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.820
SPEAKER 2: Is your Twitter
tagline still dilettante?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.320
DAVID DUCHOVNY: No,
but that's good.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.700
It was.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.280
When I used to actually
involve myself in it.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.840
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, when I first
followed you it was dilletante.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.160
I really like that tagline.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.626
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
I'll bring it back.

00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:43.360
Brad?

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:43.860
Dilletante.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.047
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, so
I guess my second--

00:18:50.047 --> 00:18:52.130
I think, from a lot of
your writing-- like I said,

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.740
I read "Bucky Fucking Dent."

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.746
I really enjoyed it.

00:18:54.746 --> 00:18:56.370
You can talk more
about it if you want.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.410
It's David's second novel.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.370
So the main character
lives in the Bronx.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.100
Much of it-- it's, like,
all set in New York.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.140
In "Hell or Highwater,"
a lot of your songs

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.540
also reference New
York, your first album.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:08.810
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I know.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:09.310
I know.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.600
SPEAKER 2: So what are your
favorite New York haunts?

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.016
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
What's my problem?

00:19:13.016 --> 00:19:14.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.330
SPEAKER 2: Where can we find
you on a random Tuesday night?

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.205
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Home.

00:19:18.205 --> 00:19:21.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.610
I grew up in New York.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.980
So it's in me just as
a reference, you know?

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.590
It has all this feeling for me.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.737
And I don't say that
I love New York.

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:31.820
I'm not one of those guys.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.610
I kind of love-hate
it, with the emphasis

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.660
on hate a lot of the time.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.580
So I find myself just writing
about it in a weird way.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.630
As much as I always
talk about leaving it,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:49.530
I feel like I'm destined to
never leave it in some way.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.530
Even though I think I've
been trying to leave it

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.339
for most of my adult life.

00:19:53.339 --> 00:19:55.880
So I think that's kind of the
push-pull with me and New York.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.379
I mean, I grew up
not far from here.

00:19:57.379 --> 00:19:59.675
I grew up, I told you, 11th
Street and Second Avenue.

00:19:59.675 --> 00:19:59.990
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.990
DAVID DUCHOVNY: And it's
all very different now.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.990
But you know, this is
my favorite neighborhood

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:09.230
of New York, the East
Village and the West Village.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.735
To me, that really has
a lot of nostalgia.

00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:12.860
Because I used to hang out.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.260
I did hang out here.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.300
There was a movie theater
where The Equinox is

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.000
now, which tells
you everything you

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.150
need to know about New
York, on Greenwich and 12th,

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.646
I think it is.

00:20:27.646 --> 00:20:28.229
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.490
So I think I want
to get a little more

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.970
into your current album.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.820
I know that some of your
songs, I think, "Spiral"

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.470
was written by your bandmates.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.790
"Marble Sun" was kind of
a collaborative effort.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.116
I assume, you know,
the rest is solo.

00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:48.740
Do you prefer--

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.365
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Well,
not really solo--

00:20:50.365 --> 00:20:53.360
but the other ones
would have been songs

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.784
that I first wrote on my own
and then brought to the guys

00:20:57.784 --> 00:20:58.700
and we worked on them.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.310
So, yeah, I guess the
inspiration would be solo.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.700
And then the actual
execution of them

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.962
would be more of a team effort.

00:21:06.962 --> 00:21:07.670
SPEAKER 2: I see.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.274
Do you prefer like
one over the other?

00:21:09.274 --> 00:21:10.940
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I'm
just not good enough

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.650
to really bring it home myself.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.300
I mean, I'm not--

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.130
I'm not, like, a
schooled musician.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.664
And I throw chords together
and put words and melodies

00:21:19.664 --> 00:21:20.330
on those chords.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.455
And then, you know, when
we first started working--

00:21:22.455 --> 00:21:25.970
and I will introduce you to the
guys when they come back up,

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.431
if they haven't left
already-- have they left?

00:21:29.431 --> 00:21:31.930
You know, I was, like-- they
were, like, oh, this song needs

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:32.270
a bridge.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.811
And I'm, like, well,
what's a bridge?

00:21:33.811 --> 00:21:34.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:39.556
So an architectural question
I didn't understand.

00:21:39.556 --> 00:21:41.180
So it's been a learning
process for me,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.180
collaborating with them.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.400
And I'm sure a learning
process for them.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.480
And I will say that one of
the good things about working

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.090
with somebody who
has no education

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.780
in that particular
field, and just has feel

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:57.110
is that I make mistakes that
are interesting sometimes.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.274
I make mistakes that
are horrible sometimes.

00:21:59.274 --> 00:22:01.190
But I also make mistakes
that are interesting.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.590
And that might make
sense here at Google.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.050
I don't know how they tell
you to be in the culture.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.110
SPEAKER 2: Fail fast.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.605
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Fail fast?

00:22:07.605 --> 00:22:09.104
SPEAKER 2: That's
what they tell us.

00:22:09.104 --> 00:22:11.250
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I don't
understand what that means.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.674
It means if you're on a bad
road, get off it quickly?

00:22:13.674 --> 00:22:15.590
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, I guess,
like, make mistakes.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.600
But learn from them fast.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.855
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Oh.

00:22:19.855 --> 00:22:21.855
I used to always quote
this Beckett thing, which

00:22:21.855 --> 00:22:23.480
was fail again, fail better.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.480
I wonder if it's been
ripped off by you guys.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.210
Fail fast?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:30.850
All right.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:31.490
Fail fast.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.560
I'm going to ponder on that.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.720
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, so related to
that a little birdie told me,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.490
or some publication I read,
that you didn't pick up

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.170
a guitar until, like--

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.050
you didn't learn guitar
until three years

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.790
or so before "Hell
or Highwater."

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.624
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah.

00:22:51.624 --> 00:22:53.040
SPEAKER 2: Is there
a reason why--

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.050
like first of all,
I guess, do you

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.259
regret picking it up so late?

00:22:55.259 --> 00:22:56.133
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah.

00:22:56.133 --> 00:22:57.530
SPEAKER 2: And
was there a reason

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.580
why you chose to self-learn
versus get a teacher,

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.320
or you know, when you obviously
have the resources, right?

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.795
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.062 --> 00:23:09.270
DAVID DUCHOVNY: That's funny.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.972
BRAD DAVIDSON: David,
we just got a check

00:23:13.972 --> 00:23:16.695
and we can afford
guitar lessons.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:19.194
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:19.194 --> 00:23:21.110
DAVID DUCHOVNY: You guys
want to take it over?

00:23:25.389 --> 00:23:26.930
Well, you know, it's
a good question,

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.638
because I actually
have an answer for it.

00:23:28.638 --> 00:23:31.400
Which is, I didn't
want any homework.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.680
I mean, I didn't want
it to feel like I

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.850
was doing it for anybody.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.790
I just wanted to teach myself
the chords and the songs

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.410
that I wanted to play on my
own, in my room, by myself.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.070
And nobody ever
asked me to sing.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.130
As you know, that
first song was rough.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.765
I have trouble, you know, I
mean, it's, like, my pitch

00:23:47.765 --> 00:23:48.707
is learned.

00:23:48.707 --> 00:23:51.290
So nobody ever said, you know,
David's got to be in the choir,

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.420
because we got to
hear that boy sing.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.160
So there I am--

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.100
there I am, learning
my chords and singing

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.960
as best I can in my room.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.060
And the last thing I
wanted was to have to--

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.790
all my life, I've been doing
homework, as you referenced.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.200
I've been in school.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.910
When I act, I got
to learn lines.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.680
I got to show up prepared.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.572
I have homework every day.

00:24:11.572 --> 00:24:12.530
I didn't want homework.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.830
I didn't want
somebody to have to--

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.460
you did not practice, David.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.930
You did not do your scales.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.710
So I just wanted it to be fun,
without any kind of pressure.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.510
So this is the only time
in my life it's ever been.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:27.230
Everything I've ever done was
for somebody else's appraisal.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.470
So it makes no sense
that I would actually

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.947
bring out this music for
other people's appraisal

00:24:32.947 --> 00:24:33.530
at this point.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:34.886
But that's where I'm at.

00:24:34.886 --> 00:24:36.260
SPEAKER 2: So you
want to keep it

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.030
as your own thing,
right, just you?

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.510
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Well, no,
obviously not, obviously not.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.890
I bring it out, you know.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.730
At some point, I started to
feel like it was worthwhile

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:47.960
and it was good.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.170
And I wanted to share it.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.290
So that guy who just
spoke, Brad Davidson,

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.300
he was really pushing
me to get better.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.280
And so the songs are worthwhile.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.870
And so it was just me
being pushed, eventually.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.230
And then it's just ironic that
something that started out just

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:11.990
for me ends up being
something that I do in public.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.619
SPEAKER 2: I think in
the Cambridge sort of--

00:25:14.619 --> 00:25:16.160
DAVID DUCHOVNY: It's
just I can never

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.440
get all those guys to come to
my house with all their stuff

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.660
and set up in my living room.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.536
So I got to do it out here.

00:25:21.536 --> 00:25:22.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.680
SPEAKER 2: I think in the
Cambridge performance--

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.805
so David also performed
in our Cambridge office--

00:25:26.805 --> 00:25:28.430
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Oh,
that's right, yeah.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.190
SPEAKER 2: --you were joking
that people used to tell you,

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.540
like, don't sing.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.240
Like, know they told you
you weren't a singer.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.190
And then you got
a voice teacher.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.460
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.085
SPEAKER 2: And that
sort of reminded me

00:25:40.085 --> 00:25:43.250
of the age old question
of talent versus grit.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.136
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah.

00:25:44.136 --> 00:25:45.840
SPEAKER 2: And I wanted to
get your thoughts on that.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.839
Like, you're obviously
a great singer now.

00:25:47.839 --> 00:25:48.630
DAVID DUCHOVNY: No.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.810
No.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.910
But I have a voice, you know,
and I get up there and I sing.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.170
I'll make mistakes.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.860
You know, I'm pitchy, like
they say on "American Idol."

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.820
You know, pitchy?

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.250
But grit versus talent--

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.421
I think grit is a
talent, you know.

00:26:06.421 --> 00:26:07.920
I played a lot of
sports in my life.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.060
And I've seen guys with
tons of talent, but no grit.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.730
And you kind of tend to blame
people with no grit in a way

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.730
that you wouldn't blame
somebody with no talent.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:18.840
You know?

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.060
And I really do believe
that grit is a talent.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.060
I don't know if it's
learned or if it's genetic.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.340
But it's one thing I've tried
to teach my kids is resiliency,

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.230
I guess, is another word for it.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.740
It's the ability to keep
at something when you suck.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.080
And that was one of the
reasons why I took up guitar,

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.600
aside from wanting to
please myself in my room,

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.580
was I had young kids.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.340
And I was adamant that
I would find something

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.610
that I didn't know how to do.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.270
And I wanted them
to be musicians.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.980
Not for their job,
but I just wanted

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.142
them to have that
opportunity in their lives.

00:26:49.142 --> 00:26:51.600
And I thought, well, you know,
I'm always preaching at them

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.010
that you got to keep working.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.020
So I'm going to show
them I'm going to work.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.560
I'll try to get better at this
thing that I'm not good at.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.800
And you know, lucky me,
they both play guitar.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.600
My son is actually a really good
guitar player at this point,

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.100
so way better than me.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.376
So when you start young,
there's a real advantage.

00:27:11.376 --> 00:27:14.640
SPEAKER 2: Do you
guys jam together?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.610
DAVID DUCHOVNY: You
know, if I sneak in.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.910
Like, he doesn't want me there.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.990
But you know, but if I
sneak in with a guitar,

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.290
you know, if he's playing.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.170
But he plays-- he loves the
music that I grew up with.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.371
He listens to late
'60s, '70s tunes.

00:27:33.371 --> 00:27:35.370
He's playing "Wish You
Were Here" by Pink Floyd.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.510
And he's in a time
warp that I love,

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.940
and I hope he never gets out.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.967
SPEAKER 2: So in this--

00:27:43.967 --> 00:27:46.050
DAVID DUCHOVNY: So I'm a
big fan of grit, I guess.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.270
I'm a big fan of talent as well.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:48.970
But--

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.746
SPEAKER 2: It's a thesis, grit.

00:27:51.746 --> 00:27:53.370
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I'm
all about the grit.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.560
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.730
So I guess in this album,
I know one of the songs,

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:04.030
"Jericho," is a song kind
of written to your father.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.850
Do you any songs
that you particularly

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.200
hold close to your heart?

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.517
Or you're kind of agnostic?

00:28:10.517 --> 00:28:12.600
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Well, I'm
agnostic with a yearning

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.510
for something greater, sure.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.180
I think we all have to be
joined with something greater

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.110
than ourselves or our egos.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.924
But I think all the songs--

00:28:24.924 --> 00:28:26.590
I was thinking, like,
oh, I'm at Google.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.760
I'm going to say
something really clever.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.780
That all the songs
are, like, and I don't

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.594
know what writing code is.

00:28:32.594 --> 00:28:34.260
But all the songs are
like writing code.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.200
Language is like writing code.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.330
I don't know what
writing code is.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.040
Let me just emphasize that.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.600
But language is a code.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.340
We think of language
as something

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.589
that's opaque and
transparent to our thoughts.

00:28:49.589 --> 00:28:50.130
But it's not.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:57.300
It's an actual code, and it's
slippery, and it's inexact.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.630
And so when I write
songs, I love that fact.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.520
When I speak, I
don't love that fact.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.020
When I try and make
my heart clear,

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.019
my mind clear to somebody,
then it's frustrating

00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:07.650
because words are
always inadequate.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:13.934
But in a song, it can get
much bigger than, you know--

00:29:13.934 --> 00:29:15.600
you're writing about
something, but it's

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.409
coding for something else.

00:29:17.409 --> 00:29:18.450
It's not what code means.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.816
I know-- so forgive me.

00:29:20.816 --> 00:29:22.690
But I just had that
thought coming over here.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:23.773
But what was the question?

00:29:23.773 --> 00:29:27.060
"Jericho" is about
my father, coded.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:27.820
Yeah.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.080
A lot of my songs-- like,
"Half-life" is-- the code is,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.700
you could say, it's divorce.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.200
You could say it's midlife.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.780
You know, there's many
different ways into that song.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.500
And I deliberately am
vague, specifically

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.800
vague enough to make
it both personal to me

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.632
and hopefully universal
to other folks.

00:29:46.632 --> 00:29:48.090
SPEAKER 2: So it's
like any artist.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:49.630
You leave it up to
the interpreter.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:51.690
You put it out there, and then--

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.600
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Well, yeah,
I mean, I think any song--

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.130
I mean, I could sit you down and
I can walk you through a song

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.022
and tell you what I
thought I was writing.

00:30:01.022 --> 00:30:02.730
And that will be
interesting if you said,

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.370
well, actually, I thought
that song was about this.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.954
And hopefully,
your interpretation

00:30:06.954 --> 00:30:08.370
wouldn't be about,
well, something

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.745
happened in David's life and
he did this and he did that,

00:30:10.745 --> 00:30:13.750
but it would be,
like, to your life.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.580
So yes, there's something--
especially, less

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.070
about movies,
television, and novels,

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.810
and more about
music, which to me

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.930
is very much you give
that to other people

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.841
and you let them kind of
make it their own for them.

00:30:28.841 --> 00:30:29.340
You know?

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.310
This song now belongs
to you, and you

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.660
make it mean what you want.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.460
I think, more than
the other art forms,

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.280
songs are really like that.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.890
SPEAKER 2: So before I ask
this final question of you,

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.720
if anyone in the audience
has Q&amp;A questions,

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.500
you can start lining up in the
two microphones on the side

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.727
now.

00:30:48.727 --> 00:30:49.560
No one's getting up.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.157
OK.

00:30:51.157 --> 00:30:51.990
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Wow.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:55.812
SPEAKER 2: So I think a
lot of us who work here--

00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:57.520
DAVID DUCHOVNY: The
band, any of you guys

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.029
want to ask me anything?

00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:01.320
SPEAKER 2: So a lot of us who--

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.740
I think people in general
strive to keep improving, right?

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.490
And like you put out an album,
and now you have a second one.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.020
You have three books--

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.820
or sorry, you have
two books out now.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.552
You have one forthcoming,
"Miss Subways."

00:31:13.552 --> 00:31:14.552
DAVID DUCHOVNY: A third.

00:31:14.552 --> 00:31:16.718
SPEAKER 2: Oh, sorry, a
third one coming out in May,

00:31:16.718 --> 00:31:18.690
"Miss Subways."

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:23.117
How do you approach your work
and just continuing to improve?

00:31:23.117 --> 00:31:25.200
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I think
you just improve by doing.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.140
You know, I think that's how
I learned how to be an actor.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.510
I mean, I was lucky
enough to get a job.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:35.670
I started fairly late for
it, I thought, 27, 27-ish.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.670
I had gone to graduate
school, as you mentioned.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.253
SPEAKER 2: It was a
summer job, right?

00:31:39.253 --> 00:31:40.770
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.630
And it turned into that, yeah.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:47.070
So I really was lucky in that
one of the first jobs I got was

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:51.270
the "X-Files, " and I got to
go to work every day for, like,

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.340
14 hours a day, being an actor.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.600
And after a couple of
years of that, I learned.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.340
But I didn't know.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.240
I thought I knew.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.330
I guess what's blissful is
that if you think you're better

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.041
than you are in the beginning.

00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:07.040
I don't know how you can
teach that to somebody.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.540
But it's, like,
have more confidence

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.819
than you should have.

00:32:10.819 --> 00:32:12.610
And then you go forward
and you try things.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.300
And then, eventually, as
you get actual experience,

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.730
you realize, oh, no, you
actually sucked back then.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.000
But that time has passed,
and now you're OK, actually.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.860
So you don't have to
worry about it so much.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.990
Unless it's my case,
when it plays in reruns,

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:26.490
and you get to watch
how bad it was.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:28.135 --> 00:32:29.010
SPEAKER 2: All right.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.805
We're going to
open up for Q&amp;A. I

00:32:31.805 --> 00:32:36.390
guess we'll start here because
there's more people there.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.830
AUDIENCE: Hey,
David, how are you?

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:38.280
I'm Sarah.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.363
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Hi, Sarah.

00:32:39.363 --> 00:32:40.290
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.900
So you're clearly a
multi-talented artist,

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.450
as we saw you perform today.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:49.350
Curious to know which
musicians, dead or alive,

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:53.280
have inspired you to make your
music or any favorite songs you

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.780
have.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.660
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Well, I mean, it's--

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.400
to say that I'm
inspired would be

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.280
to say that I could
actually, you know,

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.710
do something in the
vein of them on purpose.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:05.460
I can't do that.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.100
I'm more of an
unconscious songwriter,

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.290
because like I said, I'm
not schooled in that way.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:13.620
So if I tried to write a
Beatles song, I couldn't do it.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.230
But certainly I feel
inspired by the Beatles,

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:21.060
or Petty or Bowie or you know,
Sly and the Family Stone.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.981
And I do want to get a little
more funky in my music,

00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:25.480
you know?

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.530
I want a little more--

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:27.100
AUDIENCE: George Clinton-esque?

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:27.933
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Who?

00:33:27.933 --> 00:33:28.737
George Clinton?

00:33:28.737 --> 00:33:29.820
That's a little too funky.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.278
AUDIENCE: That's,
like, super funk.

00:33:31.278 --> 00:33:32.281
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:32.281 --> 00:33:34.530
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Atomic Dog,
yeah, something like that.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:39.960
I mean, really Sly and
the Family Stone, for me--

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.010
even like '70s, like
The Ohio Players,

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.450
you know, stuff like that.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.410
But I don't even know.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.281
We got to talk about
doing shit like that.

00:33:48.281 --> 00:33:48.780
We're ready.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.739
Yeah, we're ready.

00:33:50.739 --> 00:33:52.530
Fleetwood Mac is another
band that I really

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.346
like the sound of.

00:33:54.346 --> 00:33:56.220
You know, The Stones I
love, but I don't know

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.345
how I'm influenced by them.

00:33:57.345 --> 00:33:58.050
But you know.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.360
AUDIENCE: You definitely
have a Petty sound.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:33:59.620
So keep it going.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.953
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Ah, Petty, yeah.

00:34:00.953 --> 00:34:03.480
Yeah, Petty, Petty, Wilco.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.270
Thank you.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.980
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.751
I'm also a native New Yorker.

00:34:09.751 --> 00:34:12.000
I appreciate what you said
about loving it and wanting

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.900
to leave it.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.580
I'm actually leaving
to move to LA,

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.800
and I was wondering if you could
give any advice to a New Yorker

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.530
moving to LA on what to do.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.302
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:22.302 --> 00:34:23.385
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Sunscreen?

00:34:23.385 --> 00:34:28.469
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:29.100
I love LA.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:29.730
I got to say.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.900
And I think people
want to leave LA, too.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.760
I don't know.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.560
Where are you going
to move in LA?

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.139
You don't know?

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:36.960
You don't know where?

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.790
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure,
maybe Santa Monica.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:39.489
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Oh, yeah, sure.

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:40.164
Why not?

00:34:40.164 --> 00:34:43.179
Yeah, no, you've got--
you're fine, you know.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.420
Santa Monica, I love
Santa Monica, Venice.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.580
I love-- if you
come from New York,

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.330
you kind of want to
see the ocean, I feel.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:53.080
And I always liked
to see the ocean.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.600
So that's kind of
where I've lived in LA.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.660
I feel like to see
the end of the world

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.740
at the edge of the world.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.198
I see to see the
edge of the world.

00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:00.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.700
I like seeing no more people.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.337
Just fish.

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:07.170
AUDIENCE: Hi, David.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:07.919
Thanks for coming.

00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:09.660
My name's Tibby.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.970
My question for you is
I think fans of yours,

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.520
we all know you for
your sense of humor.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.830
And I think, even back
in the "X-Files" days,

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.204
we saw you inject humor
into what could otherwise be

00:35:19.204 --> 00:35:20.370
a really dramatic character.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.010
And then you kind of
finally got to explore that

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.950
in "Californication."

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:27.300
So my question is, was starting
out in such a serious character

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.190
in kind of a serious world, was
that kind of almost a struggle

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:35.010
to be able to show that side
of yourself or tap into it?

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.600
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Well, it was more

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.110
a perceptual thing for others.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.290
Because the character was so--

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:45.190
well, he was dry.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.606
But you had to be
paying attention

00:35:46.606 --> 00:35:48.600
if you wanted to think
Mulder was funny.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.700
It was very easy to think
of him as not funny at all.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.440
And it was important
for me, always,

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.750
to inject that, as you
say, into the show.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.360
And it was always
something, even going back

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.650
to the last time we
did it this year.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.810
The fight is always,
you know, me wanting

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.310
to make it funny and real.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:10.790
And the studio saying,
but people are dead.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:18.320
And to me, that was never a
good enough argument, you know?

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.170
To me, the funny is the
cold of it, you know.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.300
So it was more--
but it was more,

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.080
when I was coming
off the show, people

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.460
didn't perceive me that way.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.280
No, other people didn't
perceive me that way.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.169
It's just-- I don't
look funny, I think.

00:36:33.169 --> 00:36:33.710
I don't know.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:37.280
I don't look like I'm going
to be funny or something.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.350
So yeah, I had to struggle
with that a little.

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:44.250
And it was also finding
the right comedy for me.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:48.170
And then when I got off the
"X-Files" the first time,

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:51.610
it was really the heyday
of, like, you know, Ben--

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:55.730
Ben Stiller, and even
going to Jim Carrey,

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.250
Steve Carell, Will Ferrell.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.170
And this is a different
kind of comedy than I do.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:03.800
And so I was kind of
forlorn about all that.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.590
I was, like, you know, I
can't go against those guys

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.600
doing that stuff.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.160
I was looking for more like
'70s style comedy in the movies.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.760
So when I took
"Californication,"

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.230
it was really, like, oh,
that's kind of what I can do.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.130
Articulate in that way,
and not like a manchild,

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:22.130
not like a boy.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:26.870
Like a man in a man's
world, whatever, doing that

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.711
stuff-- so I thought
I could do that.

00:37:29.711 --> 00:37:31.586
AUDIENCE: Definitely,
it was super hilarious.

00:37:31.586 --> 00:37:31.922
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah?

00:37:31.922 --> 00:37:32.421
Thanks.

00:37:32.421 --> 00:37:35.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Corey.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.436
Thank you for coming in.

00:37:38.436 --> 00:37:40.310
You've worked in a lot
of different mediums--

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.645
TV, film, music, writing.

00:37:42.645 --> 00:37:44.270
And they all have
really different ways

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.430
of pulling in your
creative process.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.900
Which do you really prefer?

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.810
What do you think reflects
your work as an artist--

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.000
collaborative work,
or kind of individual,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.794
heads down in your
room alone work?

00:37:55.794 --> 00:37:56.960
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Well, both--

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.730
I mean, I think the novels
represent my most selfish, just

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.350
me, in a room.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.390
You know, I have an
editor, and he edits me.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.180
But it's really just--

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.220
that's just coming from me.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.070
That's not collaborative.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:16.010
Music is very collaborative
with the band.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:18.530
I need it.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.450
Film and television
is, by nature,

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:21.500
extremely collaborative.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.740
And I love that.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.350
A good director hires--

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.100
is like a good
president-- hires people

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.310
who are better than he is
or she is at the things

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.410
that he or she doesn't do.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:37.520
And we see what happens
when that doesn't happen.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.819
Although it's almost
an impossibility

00:38:42.819 --> 00:38:44.360
to think of somebody
who's not better

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.080
than our current president
at-- at anything.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.600
And yet he finds people that are
less better at it than he is.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.729
Interesting.

00:38:54.729 --> 00:38:56.020
So that's what a director does.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.770
So a director is like the
immune system of the film.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:04.266
He keeps all the bad ideas out
and let's all his other people

00:39:04.266 --> 00:39:05.390
play with their good ideas.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.900
So I really enjoy--

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.020
I do like to
collaborate very much.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.704
But there came a time when I
wanted to sit down and just

00:39:11.704 --> 00:39:12.620
write in my own voice.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.476
And that's what the novels
kind of represented.

00:39:15.476 --> 00:39:16.412
SPEAKER 2: All right.

00:39:16.412 --> 00:39:17.078
I'm sorry, guys.

00:39:17.078 --> 00:39:20.780
We don't have time for
any more questions.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.370
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Aw.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:23.862
Yell it out.

00:39:23.862 --> 00:39:25.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:26.980
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Why male models?

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.350
SPEAKER 2: David, do you
and your band have a--

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.457
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I don't
remember which it was.

00:39:31.457 --> 00:39:32.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.550
I can't remember which was
the hand that I modeled.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.670
SPEAKER 2: Oh, yeah.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:39.086
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Left [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:39.086 --> 00:39:40.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.990
It was before this--

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:44.750
Bulova watch catalog.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.600
SPEAKER 2: Do you and your band
have time for one more song?

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.475
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah!

00:39:48.475 --> 00:39:49.330
SPEAKER 2: Cool.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.280
DAVID DUCHOVNY: You asked
if there was a song that

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.390
was meaningful to me.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:58.010
So actually, the last song
that we're going to do also

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.657
involves my father.

00:39:59.657 --> 00:40:01.490
It's called "Stranger
and the Sacred Heart."

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:05.480
And we were touring in
Europe, and we were in Paris.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.150
And I went to this
church called The Sacred

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.360
Heart, which is in the
neighborhood of the hotel I

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:10.985
was staying at.

00:40:10.985 --> 00:40:18.710
And I was told by the
folks there that people--

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.509
the custom there is
to pray for others,

00:40:21.509 --> 00:40:22.550
not to pray for yourself.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:27.260
And actually, to pray
for the world really,

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:31.020
not just Paris, not just French
people, but actually the world.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:34.360
And I thought, I'd
never heard that before.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.280
And I really liked it.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:39.400
So the song, along with
the fact that my father had

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.188
died in Paris a few years
earlier, kind of came together.

00:40:44.188 --> 00:40:49.396
It's called "Stranger
and the Sacred Heart."

00:40:49.396 --> 00:40:52.492
[MUSIC - DAVID DUCHOVNY,
"STRANGER AND THE SACRED

00:40:52.492 --> 00:41:08.320

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.060
Thank you.
