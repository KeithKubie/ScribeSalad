Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast. Ladies and gentlemen, we are here for a historic confrontation. And on today's podcast we'll start with a little comeback. I want to tell you about an event Robert and I did recently. Right here in Wny sees new green space. We built a little boxing ring with ropes and everything. We asked IRA glass, who you're hearing to be our boxing referee, about 250 people showed up and Robert and I decided to go head to head federal once and for all the debate radio versus television, which is superior.

Speaker 2:          00:37          Hmm. So let's get started on in this corner,

Speaker 1:          00:45          Robert, the crusher bro Edge

Speaker 2:          00:49          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:50          I got to wear Silk Luxembourg

Speaker 1:          00:54          in the opposite corner. The one the only Chad Boom Abbott, right

Speaker 2:          01:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:05          and I got to where they're very stylish. Red Boxing trunks with a hook in real boxing. So here's how it went. When you went five rounds, the rules were pretty simple. I play something. Then Robert would play something

Speaker 1:          01:15          thing and then Ira and the audience would judge round. One question topic was, which is better at pictures, radio or television? We'll just jump to the results just to give you a taste of all. Alright. Television is the winner.

Speaker 2:          01:32          Good.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Brown too. Which medium is better at emotions? Is it radio

Speaker 2:          01:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:42          or is it television?

Speaker 2:          01:45          Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:49          still have to do rounds. We were tied and so really just to speed things up here we went three more rounds or not thread. Three various questions and when we got to round five, which was on the question of which is more fun, radio or TV? Well, here's what happened. I declared television in the winter.

Speaker 2:          02:04          No,

Speaker 1:          02:08          what's that riot? Do you want to have a recount? We can do a recap. I want to, I want, I want them to riot.

Speaker 2:          02:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:16          you're familiar with the concept of a sore loser. Radio doesn't have to win. How much more dignity is there to this whole event? We were in a radio station, IRA, we have to wait. We can't wait to hear. We can't win anywhere.

Speaker 2:          02:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:34          all right, I'll take a poll again. No radio

Speaker 2:          02:47          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:47          I suddenly realized why they don't do recounts in elections and television.

Speaker 2:          02:56          You guys are saying

Speaker 1:          02:58          hi. It was a draw.

Speaker 4:          03:00          It was a draw. Everybody won that night. You had no radio. No, I still refused to believe. So then we decided, well, okay so we took off our robes in our glove and then we sat down and say, well let's just put it all together here. Like there are rules for making TV, there are rules for making radio and how are they different? And IRA began

Speaker 1:          03:20          all the rules of what we do on the radio, especially on our show where the stories have narrative motion where there's characters in motion and there's a conflict that announces itself pretty quickly and the people have to be treated. Somebody has to be pretty charming and you can relate to, it's like our show on the radio pretends to be a show where where, where we're documenting everyday life, but when not actually what we're doing is we're getting sort of regular people who are in really, really unusual and interesting situations that would be worth putting on the radio. And the thing that having pictures let us do was to actually eliminate the need for a surprising pot line. And Co let us just have moments that we knew would be dramatic. Like a guy's kid comes home from the army, comes home from Iraq and you know, like we had specific moments we were going out to shoot but they didn't have to surprise in exactly the same way.

Speaker 1:          04:16          And really a lot of the thing is kind of staring at people and in a way that just is just anti radio like it was, is just, is that an entire hour that just been very difficult to do on radio. A lot of what we did on TV, I think you could have done on radio, there's like a hugeness to the radio to the intimacy of the radio. Like when you're in the actual um, credit little hospital room and a not so fancy hospital in Washington state. And it's a real guy and his sort of semi photogenic mom and he's like a little bit of a stiff and she, I dunno, like and then the, and then they performed the scene and you see them really, they're not iconic, weird way. Like, like something about the, the specifics of staring at them and of that room and you recognize kind of the whole, the hospital tray. It just plays really differently. Whereas on radio it would be weirdly a mythic. If you think about that piece, that piece that you played with where it's the dad and the kid, there's something really epic about it. Like it's intimate and it's epic because he like with his deep voice and her and her sort of symbolic like kidness become iconic

Speaker 4:          05:31          Irish talking about a piece which had an unfairly cute daughter up in that. Why don't we just play it for the father with a really deep voice. This was an, I think if we played it in round two, this is from John Biewen at first it's physical like any great love those eyes, those hands, those thighs really.

Speaker 2:          06:03          [inaudible] [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          06:09          Hey Harper, what's a kitty cat? Say the weight of them on your lap. Climbing on your head. Nobody writes pop songs about that. Touch that field.

Speaker 2:          06:26          Sure.

Speaker 4:          06:30          What you're going to [inaudible] I'm going to listen to you, but riding around inside that little body, there's this person over here, budding mind. He'll do anything to touch my craft. So this small body becomes the source of your biggest fears. The child to flesh is vulnerable. So you are too. I do, but my favorite part of that hearing you all look wonderful in our, in your outfits. This is sad. I can't wait to learn what all of you want to be when you grow up. Can I have some milk? How old are you now girl?

Speaker 5:          07:27          Come on. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:35          [inaudible] I'm scared,

Speaker 4:          07:40          but you have to let go. Let her go. Little by little she said that Kayla said something mean about me. She said, dad, it's okay. Was that way too, in that way in which her body was never for you.

Speaker 7:          07:56          Next message. Hi Daddy. It's Harper. Um, we're going to be out like on a Ga. Oh girl. After gay down. Um, just call me on my cell phone. Like if anything happened or anything, I'll call you whenever I come home. Okay, bye.

Speaker 2:          08:15          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          08:19          So girl, how old are you going to be your next birthday? 13. And have you and your mom talked about, you know, the talk? Yeah. Do you think you and I should have the talk? No, no, no. Good. So that was a piece called scared from John [inaudible] and thanks to him and to Harper Bun and to the third coast audio festival. And now back to the event. I think one of the deep differences is when you watch the,

Speaker 8:          08:56          it is an act of staring. So you're, you're in a chair or standing and you're looking across a space at a box with a square, and then the square has some images and you, your options are to look away or to look at it. You also know that between you and [inaudible], there could be lots of business. Someone could come by, a cat could go by, a child could go buy, a dog could go by, or if something could catch your eye and you'd Click it away. So there is a stare in TV in the radio. Often people either clamp something on either ear or if they don't do that and they're just listening to the radio, there is a, um, there is uh, an intimate kind of sharing where if the radio is describing, the person listening starts to paint in voluntarily just because they helplessly picture the words you're saying and the painting in your head, first of all belongs to you.

Speaker 8:          09:57          And it's not a stare. It's actually very unlike a stare. And there's more when you are coauthoring, which is what you're doing, the story you're being told, there is more room in there for that story in a way. But when you stare, you do get to see things that you wouldn't know that you wouldn't find yourself, that you couldn't imagine. But there is a coolness to the stare and a warmness to the radio that just travels. And they were very advantages and disadvantages to both. And I see, I the other, the, the, like I, I'd

Speaker 1:          10:35          see all that and felt all that when we were making TV. Like the, the other thing that always struck me as a huge difference is that to get an emotional moment on TV, like we could make an emotional moment and just like you said, you have people's faces and they communicate so much and communicate just as much as the voice does. Um, but to make an emotional moment on TV, it's almost like we would have to like erect a scaffolding for it to happen and build to the moment and they'd have to be like fast action, fast action, fast action, cutting, cutting, cutting. And then we'd have to slow it down so you could feel the slowness and then there could be slower sorts of emotion and feeling and the music would change it. It was sort of like a much bigger orchestration job, um, in the way it had to be photographed and handled.

Speaker 1:          11:18          Whereas on radio, it has such emotion as the default position like it because it's the thing that it's going to do when it's not even trying to do anything is communicate a lot of feeling and a lot of intimacy. You know, like we, we can send that anybody with a tape recorder and if they can talk to somebody, they'll get that and the sound of the person's voice will carry out this feeling. And, and that seemed to be just in a, just an a a huge difference. And then people were more able to open up on the radio to work with sort of an answer or thing when it isn't like a camera crew on lights and like, you know, we were shooting very pretty. So there's a lot of people and um, versus a bit, by the time we finished a second season, they were, when we started our first season, I thought, well, we'll get the same percentage of people who open up on radio and TV.

Speaker 1:          12:06          But by the time we got to the end of the second season, uh, Lisa and Nancy and the other producers when they really wanted to get down with people, we would film part of the interview and then they would just tape part of the, they just take the person off and they were taped part of the interview just with a tape recorder. Just them. Yeah. And then we would use that part in the part where you see pictures of other stuff and, and yeah. So we totally tricked it out to get the kinds of quotes that we wanted because we weren't getting the quotes we wanted while the camera was rolling. Sometimes. Let me ask you both the questions since you both have done radio and TV, in many cases, the same story on radio and TV. Um, how has the experience of doing radio being or being behind the camera different than being behind the microphone? Cause I have this, I always sort of joke with him. I have this experience every time I see him on TV, it tweaks me. It's weird because I'm like, who is that guy? He's not, he's not the the Robert that I know from the studio cause he's the Robert in the studio and the Robert like in this ring. And I love the fact that we're having this quiet chat in a boxing ring.

Speaker 1:          13:10          He's kind of like this oversize outsized emotional duties. Like, like just huge gestures. But on TV it's all like, he keeps it small. He kind of, he kind of brings it in. And there's something about the scale that it's really interesting to me when you see somebody do both, you know, I mean, do you wonder what I wonder. You always said

Speaker 8:          13:28          yes. He says when they're, you know, he just says it's so little, you're so tight. You're so you learn, here's the thing. The camera goes and looks right at you. And so if you were to give a big Cheshire cat grin, if you were to make a broad gesture in the box, it's just too big. So you just learned somewhere along the line that, um, that you, you do scale it down because you're, you're so big in this virtual space,

Speaker 1:          13:58          but you're bigger and the radio, cause I always say, I tell people like when you're performing on the radio, it's like you're in front of a camera and the camera's always on close up and like use your inside voice, you know, kind of, you, you had to get the desk thing. Well that was just in the first season. I mean, well, the concede of it was we couldn't figure out how to put me on TV. Like, like, where should I be or should I even be, should you ever see me at all? And then it seemed kind of kind of, um, artsy that you would never see me. You know what I mean? My favorite version of the different ways that you would see me would be that I would walk into each story at the end, like Rod Serling and go man in a woman, you know, but I felt like I could perform that too.

Speaker 1:          14:38          Um, but was it a scale thing? Where was it that you needed to feel somehow? No, no. We put, we did the desk cause we just thought like after trying to run a week, we shot all sorts of different things as little tests and, and, and all of them trying to run away from conventions of a host on TV. But truthfully, like everything's been done. If you're a host on TV, like you know your own real desk that's been done, you in a card just talking to the camera, you're walking down the street with the subject. You just like every sort of casual and non casual version has been done. And so we thought, well let's instead of running away from the convention, so let's run towards them. What's, take the corniest convention and let's do the desk and the suit and the mug and like a microphone and let's like have a build one of those desks that only exist on television that doesn't exist in nature.

Speaker 1:          15:20          That's like those shiny desks. And um, and then let's put it outside. Let's just put it somewhere random. We had never, I had never seen the, there's apparently a Monte python thing where they were the anchor man is outside. I didn't know that you see even that had been done. But um, so we would just take it to incredibly, like the idea is like one day it's in a factory for and the next day it's by a nuclear power station and you know, and so that was the idea. It was just let's, let's make something big in photographic, but why, why, why the trouble you said you couldn't figure out how to be on TV because like this American life like to identify it has like weirdly just it's imprinting a kind of intimacy and very many people I know. And it's something weirdly anti intimate about the image that we ended up making with me in it. And in the second season because of that. Instead of shooting it that way, we took, we bought a lot of flip camera for $149 at best buy and we shot all the things of me with that and we just go on the subway and I would just shoot myself talking to the camera and saying my thing. What about [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          16:19          audience? I sent that the the radio audience is a completely different audience in a consistently different mood than the television audience do you think? I mean I do. I different like as in different people or different when there are different people, but commercial television tends to get a slightly older group and radio at least this radio, the Miss American life and radio does this. It gets a bit of a younger audience, but beyond that, I think the radio audience gets the impression that they know, you know you and the TV audience because of the staring, they will respect you. They'll do yo, so you want TV thing that is there, they'll notice you. They don't presume to begin or have a conversation with you. Whereas on the radio, they presume to have a conversation with,

Speaker 1:          17:09          you're saying from your experience being an MPR and being on ABC, you know where we see it actually we sort of see the flip side of that is when we take over Terry Gross a spot, uh, Fridays at three, which we do a couple of times a year, you would not believe the vitriol, the venomous flow of hatred as if we have kidnapped Terry literally kidnapped her and taken and locked her into the closet there. Terry grows, you know, so it's, it's, it's a rerun show. They've heard it already. It

Speaker 8:          17:41          doesn't matter. It's part of their routine on Fridays at three. What do I do? I do her. And who were these two people and what are they

Speaker 1:          17:50          doing? No, no, they don't listen to it. They just like, they bite it. I had to say that the biggest thing I've ever done on TV was just two weeks ago. And that is that I appeared on the Khobar Rapport and I'd been on, I'd been on the daily show, had been on Letterman. I'd been on, um, on, uh, Conan. But there's something about people's relationship to Steve and Kobe are where like complete strangers walk up to me on the street and caught me on the street and like a lot of them and it's like, Hey, saw you on Colbert. They feel like they feel like it was us against him or something. I can name such a like they'll like, like, like they just want me to know like they watch Cole Bear and they were with me, you know, and, and it was a cute because you survived Cobra or with you because they, you're part of the cold beer club both like I survived it. They're like, hey, you did okay sort of with go bear, you know, like very much just like it was like I was in a boxing match with Steven Coe bear and, and they, they appreciated it and, and, and they want to tell me about it like in a way that I've found really Gulf way.

Speaker 8:          18:54          The maths may be our last question is, is, is the glamour question. Um, there has been for years associated with being on TV. There's this sense of, Ooh, wow. Kind of thing. And then radio was sort of a other thing you could do if you were in a car or cutting carrots. And I, I get the sense that that's actually switched a bit. So Steve Cobe bear could almost have, has a relief. I don't know why I say this, it's Steve called Berra who does wonderful sight gags and you know, but there is something about that show even more than the other one that does seem like, I don't know why it seems like the best radio that I hear

Speaker 1:          19:38          people have such a personal relationship with him in a way that, that, I dunno. I mean I feel that way about a handful of shows, you know, I feel that way about, about the draw, you know, I felt that way about Friday night lights, you know, greatest show on television except for the second season, except for the one thing, the second season was a downer. Low water. I mean, I mean, they're good. They're good. I mean, I guess I'm saying like, I, you know, I feel that about other things in television besides Stephen Colbert. I think that's the bond you feel with any show that you really love. You feel like you're,

Speaker 8:          20:07          I was in the subway and I saw an inspector from the wire that Millie mean guy, um, who, um, the Polish guy who wants to buy the, uh, yeah, yeah, I'll try to, I saw of the actor who plays val check and I, I, he was sitting there and I was holding the pole and I thought, I just, I guess I'll honor him by my quiet gaze. I won't say anything, you know, and my heart was beating and everything. I was thinking I was going to tell my wife to get you eyes on this. Uh, and um, but I didn't.

Speaker 2:          20:39          Okay.

Speaker 8:          20:40          If I'd seen Steven Cole bear or if I didn't know you and saw you or you, I think

Speaker 1:          20:47          he says with the state, find it more approachable. I think I'd find, I think I might dare, I might say, oh, hi. Or something like that. Yeah, it's true. Well that's good to, on the radio if you're performing it right, you're exactly human size. Like, like if you're on the radio, if you're doing it correctly, I think you are, there's a one to one scale. Just you said really though that it was myth, mythic and epic too though that moment in that story. Yeah, no, I, you know, that's true. I guess it's a contradiction. [inaudible] I, you know, I think one of the things that, that this American life did was they made true stories feel like fairy tales. Like every, and it has to do with the music. It has to do with the way they're constructed and with the surprise and the characters that you meet, it's, it feels like a, it feels like a fairy tale.

Speaker 1:          21:33          It feels like, like you're entering me on TV and on radio. I mean mostly on the radio. I'm thinking straight, early, early, you know, just that show coming out of everything else that was at that time. Suddenly these characters did seem large. They seemed like, um, sort of epic and huge and, but yet sort of like in the bed, embedded in their breasts, the same sort of desires and fascinations and fears that the rest of us had. So that was new for me to hear that. So I don't know. I mean there the, it gets confusing when you use the techniques of fiction storytelling techniques of movie making with true stories you can invest true reality with a sense of largeness and a sense of sweep that that you would only expect to see like in a movie theater. That's kind of the cool thing about it I think. And then there's the wire. Thank you all for coming. Thanks for coming up.

Speaker 2:          22:33          [inaudible] want to thank Carrie Hellman for helping. Definitely want to think of green space people from making it very cool space

Speaker 3:          22:40          available. Green space means the part of the building at WDC. Yeah, we have live events which is where that just was inaugurated that very week. So I was already logged your roll out. Maybe do one of those and also to the hungry marching band because um, they made a lot of big loud noise. Easy. Yes. Thanks. And also we want to thank the people that help make radio lab possible. That would be number one. This is just Lone Alpha p Sloan Foundation number two, Mr Corporation for public broadcasting and number three Mr National Science. Yes, that a foundation. Then I'm Jad Abumrad I Robert College. Thanks for listening.
