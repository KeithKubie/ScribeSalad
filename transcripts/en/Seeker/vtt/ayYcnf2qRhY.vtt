00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.569
As my favorite comic strip artist once said,
“The surest sign that intelligent life exists

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.710
elsewhere in the universe is that is none
of it has tried to contact us.”

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.130
But as it turns out, we earthlings may be
luckier than we previously thought.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.930
Scientists have new evidence that one element
in particular may be essential to creating

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.720
life, and that it could be pretty scarce in
the rest of the universe.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.119
So, are we really all alone out here on our
blue dot?

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.200
There are a handful of chemical elements that
are the primary building blocks of most life

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.900
on Earth, and some of the big ones are oxygen,
carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.760
Those four are a few of the so-called ‘bulk’
elements that make up our muscles and organs

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.149
and that we need to consume a lot of to stay
alive.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.729
(You may have noticed that breathing is pretty
important).

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.899
But the another element, phosphorus, also
has an essential task: it’s the key additional

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.739
piece that makes up our DNA and RNA (our genetic
makeup inside which the rest of our existence

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.850
is encoded) and our ATP, which is how we store
and use energy.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.579
It’s like if you were a book being written
by hand by a monk who’s looking at instructions

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:02.870
in another book.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.299
Without phosphorus, not only is there no instruction
book, but there’s no monk.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.420
And all the pages are on the floor.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.130
Maybe this wasn’t the best metaphor.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.130
So.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.710
Phosphorus is necessary to create and sustain
almost all life as we know it.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.710
But hold on--let’s back up.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.619
How is it that Earth has these essential elements
in the first place?

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.700
Before the Big Bang, there was nothing.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.460
Then the Big Bang, and there was A LOT of
really hot something, mostly super-light elements

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.219
like hydrogen and helium, which together make
up 99% of the matter in the universe .

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.189
NASA scientists have determined that the other
life-giving elements are created inside the

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.539
core of stars that then become supernovae,
which is when massive, dying stars explode

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.310
and eject their mass out into the universe
in a catastrophic eruption, spitting out all

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.640
kinds of stuff...including the heavier elements
needed for life.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.799
Scientists think that meteorites carrying
phosphorus came from a nearby exploding star

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.719
and plonked down onto Earth at just the right
time to get included in making Earth’s “proto-biomolecules”,

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.530
or the precursors to what we now recognize
as the basic molecules that make up our living

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.530
systems.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.230
The thing is, new evidence indicates that
phosphorus-creating supernovae may be kinda

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.590
rare.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.910
Researchers observing the Crab Nebula, which
is the remnant of a supernova so big and so

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.540
bright it was first noticed by us Earth-dwellers
in the year 1054, have found that it contains

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.440
much less phosphorus than our models have
predicted.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.610
Using telescopes to observe infrared light
readings from the phosphorus and iron traces

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.240
in the Crab Nebula, researchers compared it
to a previously studied supernova remnant,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.300
Cassiopeia A. The Crab Nebula phosphorous
readings are far lower than those for Cass

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.040
A, suggesting that supernovae contents could
vary dramatically.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.090
This means that even if a planet has habitable
qualities similar to Earth’s, they may not

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.790
be near a supernova, and even if they are,
that supernova may be spitting out different

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.790
elements than the ones we were touched by,
meaning life like ours may be even more uncommon

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.790
than we thought.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.150
And we’ve always thought we were pretty
darn lucky.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.060
But I mean, what about other kinds of life?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.670
What if there’s life out there that uses
the elements we know of in vastly different

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.810
ways and doesn’t need DNA because it’s
a life structure we can’t even comprehend?

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.750
Or if there are elements we haven’t even
discovered out there in the universe creating

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.560
life that we have no idea how to picture?

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.570
There’s no scientific evidence for this,
at all, but I’m just saying, it’s cool

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.690
to think about.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.030
Thanks for tuning in and don’t forget to
subscribe to Seeker for more SPACE...Check

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.349
out this video about sending a submarine to
Titan, and.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.860
Fun fact, the neutron star (or ex-supernova)
at the center of the Crab Nebula is as massive

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.790
as our Sun, but is only the size of a small
town.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.530
That’s so dense that a single teaspoon would
weigh a billion tons.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.030
I’m Maren, thanks for watching Seeker.
