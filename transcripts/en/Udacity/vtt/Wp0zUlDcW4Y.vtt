Now, I have talking a little about implication. Let's see how do we

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.320
actually write, implication and logic. So here is a sentence, if animal

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.260
lays eggs and animal flies, it is implication is that the animal is a bird.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.780
In logic we write this using the symbol, arrow symbol, or

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.120
an indication, so if the animal lays eggs and animal flies,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.560
implication animal is a bird. So here is the left hand side of the implication,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.330
here is the left hand side of the implication.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.360
The left hand side of the implication, implies the right hand side
