00:00:00.514 --> 00:00:01.930
MALE SPEAKER: Today
we're thrilled

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.640
to have to turn the page
back to the Stanford

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.120
Department of Management,
Science, and Engineering.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.530
Dr. Kathleen Eisenhardt has
a long history with Google,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.890
from the early days
to the present.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.070
And she in fact wrote
the book on strategy

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.680
as structured chaos.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.720
And so her course is one
of the more popular ones

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.890
in the department.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.000
Hopefully there's some
veterans here in the audience.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.170
And she's here to
talk to us today

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.610
about her new book, which is
the attention to simple rules.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.440
And it gives us the tools
to cope with complexity,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.910
tells us when to
get things done,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.750
and when to change course.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.760
Dr. Eisenhardt is also the
co-director of the Stanford

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.680
Technology Ventures program.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.230
And so if you have any questions
during the presentation,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.840
we have a microphone right here.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.590
And otherwise please join me in
welcoming Dr. Eisenhardt back

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.220
to Google.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.720
Thank you.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.178
KATHY EISENHARDT:
Thanks everybody.

00:00:51.178 --> 00:00:52.120
Thanks for coming.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.920
Anyway, Thanks a lot for
taking the time this afternoon

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.594
to join me.

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:58.010
What I'm going to
be talking about

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.390
is obviously the
book "Simple Rules--

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.190
How to Thrive in
a Complex World."

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.610
I want to start
out by a scenario.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.610
And this is the story of
Sergeant Edward Montoya.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.300
At the time of the story
he's stationed in Mosul.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.270
He's a member of the US Army.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.440
He's in line around Christmas
time getting some dessert.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.760
And as he's standing
there, suddenly somebody

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.850
blows themselves
up, a terrorist.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.110
And there's carnage
throughout the mess hall.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.710
Sergeant Montoya is quick
enough to get under a table.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.350
But when he emerges,
it's a mess.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.190
And he's a medic.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.710
And he has to decide what is
he going to do in this very

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.180
complex, very uncertain time.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.930
Who does he treat?

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.810
Who doesn't he treat?

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.260
Who gets the priority.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.644
And the theme of the day, as
you know, is simple rules.

00:01:46.644 --> 00:01:48.060
And what he actually
falls back on

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.150
is the medical rules of triage--
who Really needs treatment now

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.550
versus who can wait
versus who it's really

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.420
never going to work for.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.740
And the story is the same
for that grandmother looking

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.650
woman, which I'm sure you
all know, Janet Yellen.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.690
Janet Yellen runs the
US economy at least

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.927
in part on simple rules.

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:07.510
Although she may be
changing her rule,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.250
but she has been
usefully pointing out

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.550
that she won't raise interest
rates until unemployment

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.220
is below 5% and inflation
is over 2%, which

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.310
was useful for a long
time for the markets

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.980
to get a sense of stability
and businesses as well.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.520
I think she's started to think
about changing that rule.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.320
Mark Zuckerberg as
well at Facebook,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.490
and crickets-- crickets
has simple rules

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.780
too because even though
their world isn't complex,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.180
their brain isn't either.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.810
So what are simple rules?

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.510
Simple rules are
short-cut strategies

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.440
that save time and effort
by focusing your attention

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.570
and simplifying how you think.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.570
So that's basically
rules of thumb.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.660
You can think of it as that.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.020
Couple key features of
what's a simple rules.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.880
Simple rules are simple,
meaning two, three, four, five,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.670
maybe six.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.120
Secondly, simple rules depend
on the person and the situation.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.760
Your rules aren't
necessarily my rules.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.220
And then finally, simple rules
relate to a defined activity.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.430
They're not platitudes like
always be nice to your mother.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.980
Rather their focused on a
particular process or activity

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.720
that you do.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.380
Let me give you some examples
to bring this down out

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.290
of hyperspace.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.290
The simple rules of Michael
Pollan-- Michael Pollan

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.520
is the UC Berkeley
professor of journalism

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.080
and the author of "Omnivore's
Dilemma," "Botany of Desire,"

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.274
and some other books.

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:29.690
I don't know whether these
rules are on your refrigerator,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.750
but they are on a lot of
people's refrigerators.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.820
And his rules are, eat real
food that your grandmother

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.580
would recognize, number one.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.830
Number two, eat small portions.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.270
Number three, eat mostly plants.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.775
Within that, you
do what you want.

00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:44.650
You have blueberries.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.410
You have kale.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.350
You have squash.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.955
You have the occasional
fish or chicken.

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:51.080
But do what you want to do.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.810
But you have to follow
those three simple rules.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.560
So simple rules.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.970
Second point, simple
rules depend on the person

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.540
and the situation.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.640
So it turns out the
Stanford football team also

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.884
has simple rules for eating.

00:04:02.884 --> 00:04:04.800
But as you might imagine,
they aren't the same

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.790
as middle aged Michael Pollan.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.250
The Stanford
football teams rules

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.140
are, always eat
breakfast, because they're

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.470
college kids who stay
up late, get up late,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.810
and often skip breakfast.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.920
Their second rule
is stay hydrated,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.640
because they're busy
boys, very athletic.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.650
It's easy to get to dehydrated
and not good for you.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.770
And then they're third rule
is eat as much as you want

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.950
and anything you want
as long as you can

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.732
pick it, pluck it, or kill it.

00:04:30.732 --> 00:04:32.570
Now if you think
about those rules,

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.000
there's some similarity
with Michael Pollan--

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.120
keep it nonprocessed food.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.340
But other than that,
20-year-old Stanford guys

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.130
are eating a lot of protein,
and they're eating a lot.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.600
And so there's some overlap
with Michael Pollan,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.420
but it's a different situation
of a 20-year-old football

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.510
player versus a middle aged man.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.340
To make it more
business-y, simple rules

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.750
depend on the person and
the situation-- Indiegogo

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.342
versus Kickstarter.

00:04:58.342 --> 00:05:00.175
At least initially they
had different rules.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.591
In fact I think
they still do have

00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:04.160
different rules, simple rules
for what kind of project

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.260
could be on their site.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.110
The Indiegogo rules
were, anything

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.960
goes as long as it's legal.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.590
You want to fund your European
vacation, your dental work,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.820
your startup, your movie, your
Jamaican bobsled team, whatever

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.580
you want to fund, as
long as it's legal,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.560
you can give it a
try at Indiegogo.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.740
In contrast at
Kickstarter, Kickstarter

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.365
is a little bit more rule bound.

00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:30.990
Basically they want
your product to fit

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.790
into one of 13 categories.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.280
And there are curators
at Kickstarter

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.180
to ensure that that's the case.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.680
Indiegogo takes
almost everything.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.980
Kickstarter kicks out
about 25% of the projects

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.970
that are actually trying
to go on the site.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.112
Why are the
situations different?

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:48.570
I think the difference
in the rules

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.230
is reflected by who the
founders are, at least in part.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.770
The Indiegogo founders
are UC Berkeley folks

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.660
who think that the
internet is for everybody,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.810
and everybody deserves
a shot at a rich uncle

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.810
to give them the
money they need.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.720
It's a very egalitarian
point of view.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.940
In contrast,
Kickstarter is funded--

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.550
it was started at least
in part by a founder who

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.200
saw Kickstarter as a way
to publicly fund the arts.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.319
And art finding is
often a curation model.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.110
So they have much more
of a curation model.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.660
Third point--
simple roles relate

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.052
to a well defined activity.

00:06:23.052 --> 00:06:25.260
Picking crowdfunded projects
in the case of Indiegogo

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.390
and Kickstarter,
or choosing food

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.580
in the case of Stanford
football and Michael Pollan.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.090
So it doesn't apply
to your decision

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.170
to get married, which is
hopefully a one or maybe

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.760
two time decision.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.620
And it doesn't apply to
solving massive problems.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.480
Like there aren't simple rules
for solving world hunger.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.570
It's rather a well
defined activity

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.940
like product development,
acquisition decisions, hiring

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.200
decisions, that sort of thing.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.010
That simple rules 1.0.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.424
Simple rules 2.0 is that there
are different kinds of rules.

00:07:00.424 --> 00:07:03.090
And it turns out that it matters
that there are different kinds,

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.540
because some of them are
harder to learn than others,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.680
and because the harder
to learn ones actually

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.260
tend to have more payoff.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
So I'll tell you a little
bit easier and harder.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.390
Also a more complete
variety of roles

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.104
tends to be more
effective as well.

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:19.520
So I'm not going to tell you
about all the kinds of rules,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.186
but let me tell you
about a couple kinds

00:07:21.186 --> 00:07:23.570
so you get a flavor for it.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.070
First of all there's
boundary rules.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.300
Boundary rules are
rules for picking

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.330
what to do, yes or no, which
alternative should I choose.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.160
So for example, the
Weinstein Company

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.020
has some boundary rules
for movie picking.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.230
The Weinstein Company
did "The Artist,"

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.640
"The King's Speech," back
in the day "Chocolat",

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.634
"Pulp Fiction," whole bunch
of movies over the years.

00:07:43.634 --> 00:07:45.550
And when you think about
the range of movies--

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.800
they did "The Imitation Game."

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.800
They did "Silver
Linings Playbook."

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.895
So what unites those?

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:52.270
Because that's
really quite a lot

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.940
of, at least on the
surface, different kinds

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.850
of thematic content.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.250
And turns out there's
a couple simple rules.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.450
One, a Weinstein movie is always
about a flawed but sympathetic

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.570
main character.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.030
So in this picture, "The
Imitation Game," which

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.890
is Alan Turing, Alan Turing is
portrayed as kind of a jerk,

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.330
but you like him.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.590
I'm told in real life he
actually wasn't a jerk,

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.030
but it worked for the movie
role that he was a jerk,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.360
so they actually made him more
jerk-like than he really was.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.500
Secondly-- or "Silver Linings
Playbook," the protagonist

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.670
in "Silver Linings
Playbook" again

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.200
struggles with
mental illness and is

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.220
annoying in a number of ways,
but you still like that person.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.299
So it's flawed but
sympathetic main character.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.820
"The King's Speech" was
the king of England.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.669
Again, he was a flawed person,
but you tended to like it.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.169
So flawed but sympathetic main
character is the first point.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.900
Second point is
it's always related

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.860
to a basic human condition.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.450
In the case of "The
Imitation Game,"

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.080
it's being gay when being
gay is illegal in England.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.685
"Silver Linings Playbook" is
obviously about mental illness.

00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:57.060
And then there are a couple
of rules that are around cost

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.880
and how much.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.200
Basically there's a cost max,
at which point they share,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.290
and a couple other things.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.850
But those are the basic ones.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.700
There's also a rule
about every move

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.310
should have a beginning, a
middle, and an end, which

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.700
seems kind of obvious.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.900
Although if you think
back to "Pulp Fiction,"

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.210
it actually begins at the end.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.084
So you have to have the
parts, but it doesn't

00:09:15.084 --> 00:09:17.055
have to be in the right order.

00:09:17.055 --> 00:09:18.430
So now you're
saying to yourself,

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.075
wasn't that every adult movie?

00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:21.310
Well actually it's not.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.810
First of all,
"Mission Impossible"

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.390
tends to be constant action
with no story, at least

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.530
my take on it.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.030
So it wouldn't be
a Weinstein movie.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.360
And then if you think of a movie
like "Gone Girl" or "The Bird

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.530
Man," there are no sympathetic
characters in those movies.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.410
Everybody's annoying
in those movies.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.300
And so it wouldn't
fit that bill either.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.020
So within a small
number of rules

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.060
you get a lot of
artistic creativity,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.880
and one of the most also
financially successful

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.647
Hollywood movie studios.

00:09:52.647 --> 00:09:54.230
Now to make it a
company, you probably

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.300
don't know anything
about, this is a company

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.987
called Frontier Dental.

00:09:57.987 --> 00:10:00.320
And their problems-- they're
a relatively small company.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.736
They're an innovative
company that

00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:05.150
does-- their innovations
are around crowns, veneers,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.557
and inlays of teeth.

00:10:07.557 --> 00:10:09.390
And they were trying
to sell their products,

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.790
and they were getting
about a 3% hit rate

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.680
as they call on dentists,
which as you might guess

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.300
was not real effective when
you're a small company.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.050
So they looked over
their experience

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.730
and thought about who
was the ideal dentist.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.480
And they came up with a
couple of simple rules.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.890
One was that they thought
the ideal dentist was

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:34.020
between the ages of 35
and 55-- or 50, 35 and 50,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.304
because established a practice
but not ready to retire.

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:38.720
But the problem
with that rule was

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.100
it's actually hard to
tell how old a dentist is.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.900
So they went to a
different rule which was,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.900
does the dentist have
an innovative website?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.037
So first rule was, they
actually started using,

00:10:48.037 --> 00:10:49.870
does the dentist have
an innovative website.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.620
The second rule was
to look at the finance

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.210
history of the dentist
and did the dentist have

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.670
no more than two finance
charges in a year.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.060
So innovative dentists
who pay their bills,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.600
and went from
essentially a 3% hit rate

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.950
to something like a
67%, 2/3% hit rate

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.570
by just changing to a few
simple rules that really focused

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.380
their sales calls,
and then developing

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.054
a relationship on the dentists
who really likely to buy.

00:11:15.054 --> 00:11:17.220
Let me just say-- I won't
say too much about DARPA--

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.530
but DARPA also has simple
rules about picking projects

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.714
that they work on, as well
as crowdsourcing innovation.

00:11:25.714 --> 00:11:27.880
A couple of their rules on
crowdsourcing competition

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.650
is asking themselves questions.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.300
Do we know who has the solution,
or do we know where to look?

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.830
If the answer's no,
they crowdsource.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.710
They also have
some decision rules

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.130
around the kind of project.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.990
They're typically around
being in Pasteur's quadrant.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.110
That is, commercially relevant
and scientifically hard,

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.021
a place that actually
most people don't play.

00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:51.380
So that's boundary rules.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.630
Let me tell you a little bit
about how two rules-- let

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.860
me see how our time is-- yeah,
how two rules are guiding

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.420
what it is you're going to do.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.670
Let me do a rock band for you.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.890
This is The White Stripes.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.600
The White Stripes produced
"The White Blood Cells" album,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.580
which is one of the massive
albums of the 2000s.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.850
They created that
album in 10 days.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.830
They did 18 songs in 10 days.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.960
How did they do it?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.720
These are not real
rule bound guys,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.420
but they did have a couple
of rules for their album.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.990
No covers, meaning
they didn't do

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.180
anybody else's song, no
guitar solos, no slide guitar,

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.590
no bass.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.770
Within those rules,
creating creative songs.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.345
And I think one of the
surprises, particular

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:39.660
of innovation is it turns
out no rules is actually

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.370
difficult to innovate
with no rules.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.430
In fact rules actually
create constraints

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.020
and make you think harder about
what it is you need to do,

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.840
and give you a place to start.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.230
So where the
creativity is really

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.200
coming in, or a part
of the creativity,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.550
is coming in and choosing
your own rules, which

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.570
is what The White Stripes did.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:01.350
Couple simple rules, a company
you probably know pretty well

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.580
is Airbnb.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.809
Airbnb started, as you may
know the story of Airbnb,

00:13:06.809 --> 00:13:08.350
they stumble around
for quite a while

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.760
trying to figure out how to
make the business model work,

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.970
trying to make Airbnb work.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.892
Finally end up at Y Combinator.

00:13:13.892 --> 00:13:15.850
Y Combinator folks tell
them to go to New York,

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.750
and they kind of figure it out.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.490
And what they figure out, what
becomes a key process for them,

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.711
is hosts.

00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:24.460
And if you think about
the problem, how do

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.730
you have host rules
for people who

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.020
may be hosting in their
apartment, in their Tuscany

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.640
villa, in their tree
house, in their campsite,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.624
in their regular home,
all kinds of places.

00:13:36.624 --> 00:13:38.290
And it turns out, at
least at the start,

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.748
there were a couple
of simple rules

00:13:39.748 --> 00:13:42.470
that gave Airbnb some edge.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.180
And these were the
rules for their hosts.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.060
One was always get
professional photographs.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.150
And professional photographs
gave an Airbnb property

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.460
a slightly better look that,
let's say, HomeAway or VBO.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.097
I forget what the
letters are for that.

00:13:57.097 --> 00:13:58.680
But essentially give
them a little bit

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.450
better look, a little
bit of an edge,

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:05.410
and started to tip
into a positive cycle.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.520
Another rule was
around for hosts,

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.180
always give local tips--
Where's the farmer's market?

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.980
Where's the nearest
subway stop-- stuff

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.290
like that, local things.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.670
And the idea there
was to give it

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.680
more of a personal feel that
would distinguish Airbnb

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.560
from a hotel.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.060
Then the third one was, I think,
kind of an interesting one.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.121
It was always have fresh soap.

00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:28.870
It turns out it's real
obvious that you're

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.650
supposed to vacuum and dust.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.722
But people were often not
freshening up the soap,

00:14:32.722 --> 00:14:34.430
because you just sort
of forget about it.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.550
And yet that has a huge ick
factor for a lot of guests.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.509
And so by just that one little
rule, it reminded oh yeah,

00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:42.550
we got to really cleanup.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.160
And of by the way, fresh soap.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.730
And then finally
another how to rule,

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.117
this is actually some of
the executives at Twitter.

00:14:51.117 --> 00:14:53.200
They were finding they
were spending too much time

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.360
in useless meetings, possibly
something you're familiar with.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.492
But in any event, a
couple of the executives

00:14:59.492 --> 00:15:01.950
came up with some rules, which
we'll see if they're working

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.460
or not, but they're
trying them out.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.380
One is no PowerPoints, because
it takes people too much time

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.090
to make them.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.610
And when people have
PowerPoints they talk too long.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.530
The second thing is, you
can't cancel out of meeting.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.440
Because a meeting usually
is three, four, five people.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.965
And if one person
cancels out, it

00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:20.480
screws up the meeting
for everybody.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.160
So once you've committed
to be at a meeting,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.300
you've got to actually be there.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.966
You can't cancel out
at the last minute.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.480
So those how to tools and
boundary rules are pretty easy

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.270
rules to learn.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.450
People usually get
those pretty fast.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.914
Timing rules are harder.

00:15:36.914 --> 00:15:38.330
And they're really
about, when are

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.840
you going to do something-
deadlines, rhythms, so on.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.290
And what they do is they're
useful for getting things

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.250
done-- once timing
matters obviously--

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.545
but also getting things
going and keeping momentum.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.790
Let me give you a couple rules.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.040
This is actually an
example from Pixar.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.355
Pixar's original
movie was "Toy Story."

00:15:59.355 --> 00:16:02.910
And it took the Pixar
folks about four years

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.970
to develop "Toy Story."

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.820
Well it turns out that if you
can only do a movie every four

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.960
years, it's not really
very commercially viable.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.760
And creative people
really don't want

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.370
only have a product
once every four

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.820
years, at least creative
artists don't want to do that.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.520
And so that was a problem.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.330
And so to maintain
the quality level

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.192
that they wanted, but
the commercial value,

00:16:26.192 --> 00:16:27.650
they had to do
something different.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.770
And so they actually went
to a timing rule, which

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.210
took them several years
to actually implement it,

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.762
but was basically
introduce one movie a year,

00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:36.220
and introduce it
at November, which

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.850
is when the start of the big
holiday season for kids movies

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.820
is.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.000
And so it took them
a while to figure out

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.640
how to essentially divide their
process into year one, year

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.360
two, year three,
year four, and so on.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.380
But essentially they
created a factory of movies

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.796
where they'd be a year one
movie, a year two movie, a year

00:16:51.796 --> 00:16:54.651
three movie, and a year
movie, and roll it out.

00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:56.150
What that did was
obviously let them

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.640
synchronize around November.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.050
It let them synchronize the
processes and the hands off

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.455
among the people.

00:17:01.455 --> 00:17:02.996
Again, it took them
a while to do it.

00:17:02.996 --> 00:17:03.930
And sometimes they miss it.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.346
For example, they
missed it lately

00:17:05.346 --> 00:17:08.900
because they didn't think--
I forget which movie it is,

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.266
but a recent movie was up
to their quality standards,

00:17:11.266 --> 00:17:12.640
so they actually
slipped on that.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.290
They also sometimes will do
us a spring release as well,

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.040
now that they're
a bigger company.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.849
Another example of the timing
rules comes from a company,

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:25.660
you probably don't know in
an industry you probably

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.240
don't know.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.730
But this is a concrete company.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.710
It's a construction company.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:30.700
You may know this.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.150
You may know that cement, which
is an ingredient of concrete,

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.984
is one of the biggest polluting
sources of CO2 in the world.

00:17:37.984 --> 00:17:39.650
I think it's number
two or number three.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.980
It's a massive polluter,
both in the production of it.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.760
And what these guys did
was develop a concrete that

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.740
was less polluting to make,
and also lasted longer

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.910
because you could use
less of it because it

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.060
didn't crack as much, and
you could use less of it.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.650
So it was really an important
environmental product.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.660
Well actually interestingly,
they figured out this product

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.090
by first of all going back
to the ancient Egyptians, who

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.020
were the originators
of concrete,

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.530
and then looking at Romans.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.980
The ancient Romans also
used a lot of concrete.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.170
And they found out that
horse hair and blood

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.040
is particularly useful for
getting better concrete.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.420
So they sort of tried to
think, what's the 21st century

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.920
equivalent of those,
and essentially

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.370
engineering a new concrete.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.410
They went to Las Vegas
with their new concrete

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.430
to some trade show, and a lot
of people around the world

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.972
were very interested
in this product.

00:18:31.972 --> 00:18:34.305
And so they were sort of left
with this problem of well,

00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:36.900
there's hundreds of contractors
who want to work with us.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.560
How do we decide?

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.730
And so they actually came
up with some simple rules

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.760
to figure out how to do that.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.550
One, they wanted no
geographic overlap.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.057
So each person had
their own territory.

00:18:47.057 --> 00:18:48.973
The second one was, how
do we figure out who's

00:18:48.973 --> 00:18:50.374
a good contractor to work with.

00:18:50.374 --> 00:18:51.915
And they came up
with a rule that was

00:18:51.915 --> 00:18:54.040
a lot like the dentist example.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.730
If the contractor has
a laser screed machine,

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.140
we want to work with them.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.140
And I don't know what a
laser screed machine is,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.598
and you probably
don't know either.

00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:03.540
But apparently it
signals that this

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.880
is an innovative, high
quality, and relatively large

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.000
company that's likely
to be a good partner.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.630
And then the third rule
was around the number

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.800
of partners they would get.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.883
They were a small company.

00:19:13.883 --> 00:19:16.450
They felt they could onboard
a partner every three months.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.180
So every three months a new
partner, every three months

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:18.790
a new partner.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.820
Basically they quadrupled
their revenue a year,

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.290
and had a roughly,
they figured, about 80%

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.830
hit rate on successful partners.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.740
Finally just one last kind
of rule is a stopping rule.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.240
These are the hardest
kind of rules to learn.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.785
When do you sell a stock?

00:19:39.785 --> 00:19:41.040
It's easy to buy a stock.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.710
It's really hard to sell one.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.340
It's maybe easy to start
a dating relationship.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.210
It's really hard to end one.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.010
So sort of simple
rules for ending things

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:53.800
turn out to be hard to
do, and yet important--

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.210
in fact, particularly important.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.760
So Primekss, our
concrete guys, they

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.350
also had a simple
rule for stopping.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.060
And that was, if
our partner's not

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.290
using our products
within three months,

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.340
it's time to end
the relationship.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.527
So three month window, our
party uses our product,

00:20:09.527 --> 00:20:11.110
they don't use it,
we're out of there.

00:20:13.964 --> 00:20:16.380
Stopping rules-- I don't know
if you all know Steve Blank.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.920
Steve Blank, he's a sort
of a self-styled guru.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.390
He is involved with what's
known as the lean launchpad,

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.610
the lean startup movement,
that sort of thing.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.750
He teaches at Stanford,
Berkeley, Columbia,

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.890
couple different places.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.140
Anyway, he has some
advice for startups,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.390
or starting up of any business.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.610
His first set of
rules are around

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.550
more how to rules, which are
around talk to 100 people,

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.050
do it outside the
building, and talk

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.740
to face to face
about the product,

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.940
your product, wherever you think
your product's going to be.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.050
But he also has
some importantly,

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.508
and I think maybe
more importantly,

00:20:49.508 --> 00:20:51.140
some stopping rules.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.440
After you've talked
to a bunch of people,

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.920
the stopping rules are
around, do customers

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.470
see that they have a problem?

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.710
Do they see that your product
will solve that problem?

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.800
Will they pay for your product?

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.430
Can you actually
make your product?

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:14.610
If your answer is what-- yes,
all four, then you go ahead.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.710
If it's no to any one,
it's time to stop,

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.610
pivot, go to a new product.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.870
So does the customer
see a problem?

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.610
Will they pay it?

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:23.990
Will they pay you?

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.470
And can you actually do it?

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.942
Finally another stopping rule,
to go to a different genre.

00:21:30.942 --> 00:21:33.150
Maybe many of you have read
the "Into Thin Air" book,

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:37.170
the Jon Krakauer book
on the Everest climb

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.490
that resulted in
the largest tragedy

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.960
on Everest ever, at
least at the time.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.890
This was in 1996.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:48.870
It was 16 clients, two world
class climbers, and a lot

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.140
of very skilled sherpas.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.590
They were trying to
summit Mount Everest.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.260
And the simple rule
of Scott Fischer,

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.720
who was the expedition
leader and the company owner,

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.540
was if you're not on top by
two o'clock, you turn back.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.290
Wherever you are at two
o'clock, turn around.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.247
You're done.

00:22:05.247 --> 00:22:06.330
Well that day they didn't.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.150
That day one of the clients had
tried before, come very close,

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.860
hadn't made it, really
wanted to get there.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.740
Couple of other clients
were pressuring.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.084
And they were up at the top at
4:00 in the afternoon, not two.

00:22:18.084 --> 00:22:20.000
On the way down they
were hit with avalanches,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.690
and eight people died.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.814
So I wouldn't say that
all stopping rules are

00:22:23.814 --> 00:22:25.230
this important,
but certainly this

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.770
was an important
and critical rule.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.700
Simple rule that was,
in the dead zone,

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.530
you could remember it, but
they got tempted and ignore it.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.100
So that's kind of some
ideas around different kinds

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:37.600
of rules.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.730
There are a couple
other kinds of rules,

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.760
but that probably
gives you a flavor

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.240
of different sorts of rules.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.480
Now you're probably wondering,
which is what this is about,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.360
is how do you actually think
about creating simple rules?

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.690
Simple rules-- and by the
way, simple rules for raising

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.160
your kids, for dieting,
for hiring people,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.060
for making acquisitions, for
doing product development.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.079
You can have simple rules
for all sorts of things.

00:23:04.079 --> 00:23:05.870
So I though I'd spend
just a couple minutes

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.030
and talk a little
bit about that.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.416
There are really three steps,
which is obviously here,

00:23:11.416 --> 00:23:13.290
determine the objective,
find the bottleneck,

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.860
craft the rules.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.280
Determine the objective is, what
are you trying to accomplish?

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.500
What do you want
more of or less of?

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.230
Do you want to be
more physically fit?

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.470
Do you want your child
to behave better?

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.069
Do you want to have
better employees?

00:23:29.069 --> 00:23:30.110
Do you want more revenue?

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.344
Do you want lower costs?

00:23:31.344 --> 00:23:33.010
What is it that you're
trying to achieve

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.010
is really the first step.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.130
The second step is
finding the bottleneck.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.160
What's really keeping
you from that?

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.540
And then the third step is
to come up with the rules.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.730
So let me walk you through
a couple of examples

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:48.210
to give you the
idea of what's up.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.450
Let me give you an example
of "House of Cards."

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.460
"House of Cards" I would guess
most of you are familiar with,

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.240
the Netflix show.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.317
The Netflix problem
at the time was

00:24:00.317 --> 00:24:02.650
that content was becoming
enormously expensive for them.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.095
They were basically using
somebody else's content

00:24:04.095 --> 00:24:06.560
and streaming it, and it was
becoming extremely expensive

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.870
to get that content.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.810
And so they decided to go into
their own created content.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.370
And the challenge was not
just to have a good show,

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:22.170
but have a show that would
stand out and be way out there

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:26.420
in terms of press and visibility
and engagement of audiences.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.850
So not another show, not
just a Sopranos quality show,

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.580
but in fact a show that
would create enormous buzz

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.380
so they could stand out from
HBO and from the other creators

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.070
of top quality content.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.640
And so they had to
do something unusual.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.650
And it wasn't going to
be just great writing,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.490
because those other shows
all have great writing--

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:46.330
you know, "Mad Men."

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.740
I mean, there are lots of
shows-- not lots of shows--

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.140
but there are a number of
shows with great writing.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.670
So what do you do if you're
trying to be really different?

00:24:54.670 --> 00:25:00.025
And what they did-- and so
what's different about--

00:25:00.025 --> 00:25:01.150
I'm getting into the story.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.774
Let me step back and
what the point is.

00:25:02.774 --> 00:25:04.860
The point was, for
them, was how do

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.680
we do something striking
unusual that will stand out.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.380
Not just more revenue,
not just lower cost,

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.471
but really stand out.

00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:14.720
I'll tell you a little bit
about then how they did it,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.800
but the key point here is
you're on the objective.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.412
They had great writing.

00:25:20.412 --> 00:25:22.120
And that was certainly
important to them.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.520
But they also decided to
look for different ways

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.464
to really be different
from everyone else.

00:25:28.464 --> 00:25:30.130
And the bottleneck
they chose-- and I'll

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:31.588
talk a little bit
about bottlenecks

00:25:31.588 --> 00:25:35.580
next-- but the bottleneck
they picked on was directing.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.970
In other words, lots of shows
have good content and good

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.428
writing, but they
don't necessarily

00:25:39.428 --> 00:25:41.570
have great, unusually
good directing.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.780
And so the original
director of "House of Cards"

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.520
was David Fincher who did
"The Social Network," "Girl

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.340
with the Dragon Tattoo,"
basically an A-list movie

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.370
director directing
for television.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.360
The second thing that
they did was then

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.990
he was allowed to bring on
board other A-list directors

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:03.305
like Charles McDougall,
Allen Coulter, who

00:26:03.305 --> 00:26:05.430
did "The Sopranos," who
did "The Office," those two

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.930
guys, other top A-list
directors, and then

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.290
just gave them a
couple simple rules.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.120
They all had to do two episodes.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.110
Those two episodes
had to be in a row.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.650
They had to do it
in a 20 day shoot.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.450
They could get their
own day players.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.620
So they couldn't change Kevin
Spacey and Robin Wright.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.460
But they could
change the players

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.410
that were being introduced
in their part of the show.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:33.590
And they had final
cut opportunity.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.430
So they did that.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.971
And then finally
they encouraged them

00:26:35.971 --> 00:26:38.900
but didn't require them to
use a stationary camera.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.640
And what the point
here is that they

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.840
chose a different bottleneck,
which was directing,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.940
and got A-list people to do it.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.640
One of things that makes
"House of Cards" unique

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.840
is the cinematic quality.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.440
And so they created
a differentiator

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.820
around the cinematic quality.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.970
They also created
a differentiator,

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.900
a different way of standing
out, by their programming,

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:02.852
the binge watching.

00:27:02.852 --> 00:27:05.060
They did the binge watching
as I'm sure you all- they

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.244
really originated that.

00:27:06.244 --> 00:27:08.410
The second thing that they
did that you may not know

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.670
was they also bought
"House of Cards"

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.750
episodes for two years, which is
kind of unheard of in the media

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.440
industry.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.580
Most the time there's
a trial and then

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.700
you buy the whole thing.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.590
They bought two years,
what's locked up the content

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.940
at a less expensive price.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.540
Why could Netflix do that by the
way, both buy "House of Cards"

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.720
for two years and
do binge watching?

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.697
Because as they said,
we knew before you

00:27:33.697 --> 00:27:35.780
knew that you were going
to like "House of Cards."

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.360
And we knew before you knew
that you'd binge watch.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.890
And they knew that because they
had it from their own data.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.480
They knew that
Netflix subscribers

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.470
liked David Fincher.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.360
They liked "House of Cards,"
and that they were already

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.810
binge watching.

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.990
And so what was a big
risk for a media company

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.270
was not a big risk for Netflix.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.780
And then the final way they
tried to change the game

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.230
and stand out was in
their choice of talent.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.370
So having Kevin
Spacey on television,

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.930
having an A-list actor on
television, was unusual.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:09.290
And that's characteristic
of both behind the camera

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.710
as well as on camera
stars, which is again

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.350
consistent with what Netflix
often does-- top talent,

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.970
pay top dollar, and let
them do their thing.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.536
So that first example
is about-- actually it's

00:28:22.536 --> 00:28:24.660
about a lot of things, but
it certainly started out

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.300
by being about objectives.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.500
Thought maybe I'd say something
about Google, a little Google

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.050
picture here.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.580
I don't know if you know Shona
Brown, who Shona Brown was.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.670
She was the senior
VP of operations

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.910
when Google went public.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.330
And she was also my PhD student.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:48.180
So I've known Google for
a long time through Shona.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.290
But she, among other
things, ran HR.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.550
And this is about bottlenecks.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.508
Because I told you there's
three steps-- what's

00:28:55.508 --> 00:28:57.850
your objective, what's
your bottleneck,

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:58.780
when are your roles?

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.140
The bottleneck is the
hardest one to figure out.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.360
And that's because it's
hard to tell-- for example,

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.200
let's say you want to
be more physically fit.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.300
Well does that mean you
should improve your diet?

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.450
Does that mean you
should exercise?

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.590
What should you do?

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:13.210
There are lots of things.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.130
Your sales aren't working.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:14.890
Is it your product?

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:15.730
Is it your sales force?

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:16.250
What is it?

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:17.870
What's the bottleneck?

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.170
In the case of
Google, there were

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.930
challenges with a number
of potential rivals, which

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.360
in retrospect don't look so
powerful, but at the time

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.510
did-- Yahoo, Microsoft,
for example-- in search.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.610
And so what was the bottleneck?

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.060
The bottleneck wasn't products.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.380
The bottleneck was
computer science talent.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:41.330
And so Google had
several simple rules

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.090
about getting top
computer science

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:47.960
talent beyond the obvious of
good grades from good schools.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.104
It was around
things like, always

00:29:52.104 --> 00:29:54.270
hire people who are a little
eccentric, because they

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.311
tend to be more creative.

00:29:55.311 --> 00:29:58.440
So look for somebody who's
done something weird.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.220
Look for people who are
referred to by other Googlers,

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.270
because other Googlers will
get what Google is looking for.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.700
And never hire anybody who's
fudged on their resume,

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.649
because we don't want
low integrity people.

00:30:10.649 --> 00:30:13.190
There were some other rules too,
but some fairly simple rules

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:15.420
that were beyond the
obvious of, let's

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.271
hire somebody from Carnegie
Mellon who was smart.

00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:21.270
There were also some rules
around acquisitions--

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.520
because that was the other
way to get computer science

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.950
talent-- and the size
of the acquisition

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.140
and how to integrate it.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.085
So for example, do acquisitions
between 10 and 15 employees.

00:30:31.085 --> 00:30:33.960
You sort of get a
package of people.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.672
So the point is that
bottlenecks are important.

00:30:36.672 --> 00:30:38.380
Bottlenecks were
important here at Google

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.224
around hiring computer
science people.

00:30:40.224 --> 00:30:42.140
Bottlenecks were important
at "House of Cards"

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.830
around creating new bottlenecks
around directing, programming,

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.880
and talent.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880
How do you create rules?

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.090
Well there are a couple
ways to create rules.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.810
What you're typically looking
for is analyzing your own past

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.550
experience, what's worked
for you and what hasn't.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.500
The second thing is getting
expert advice from a book,

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.740
from a consultant.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.260
And then third is
usually something

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.240
about getting some advice
from peers or friends.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.300
So in the book we have an
example about internet dating,

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.840
about how to do
better internet dating

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:20.110
where the guy in the story
uses those three tactics.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.220
But I'll do more of a business
example, which is Zatisi.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:29.020
Zatisi is a food
caterer in Prague.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.360
And they were fine dining,
owned a number of restaurants

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.760
in Prague, and decided
to go into catering

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.110
for Western companies like
Google, like Facebook,

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.680
like Cisco, who wanted to give
their employees better quality

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.600
food.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.490
And so they got contracts
with some of these companies

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:50.400
and started running
cafeterias, company cafeterias.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.710
And they were losing
a ton of money.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:54.876
And so what did they do?

00:31:54.876 --> 00:31:56.500
How are we going to
start making money?

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.530
Everybody loves our food.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:58.988
Everybody's going
to our cafeteria.

00:31:58.988 --> 00:32:00.690
But we're not making
any money on it.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.650
And so what they did is
they started analyzing

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:06.490
their own experience-- and
had the chefs do it, not just

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.260
the bureaucrats, but
the chefs as well,

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.152
the people who were
actually doing it.

00:32:10.152 --> 00:32:12.360
And they started to realize
that what they were doing

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.200
was the chefs were enjoying
doing novel cooking.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.660
And they did probably a thousand
different menus in a year.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:22.790
So it was very creative, but
it was not very standardized.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.790
They also were not
particularly paying attention

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.660
to local sourcing and
seasonal ingredients,

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.710
and they were not doing
some other things.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.430
So they looked over
what they were up to

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.138
and came up with a
couple of simple rules

00:32:32.138 --> 00:32:39.070
about how to manage their
cafeterias more effectively

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.310
and pick their menu
more effectively.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.650
So they decided their
problem-- to go back

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.190
to the steps-- their
objective was more profit.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.960
Their bottleneck was menu
selection they decided.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.890
And their rules
were around things

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:56.130
like, fix the menu by noon
on Wednesday the week before.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.890
Do five dishes every day.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.840
Three have to be best sellers.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.250
Do two dishes every day
that are the same across all

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.470
the cafeterias.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.610
And 90% of your food
should be locally sourced

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.810
or seasonally appropriate.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.130
And within a few months
they raised their revenue.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.088
But more importantly they
doubled their profit,

00:33:14.088 --> 00:33:17.680
and then they started to
be able to scale and grow.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.430
So the example here
is about going back

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.206
to your own experience, seeing
what's working and what's not.

00:33:22.206 --> 00:33:24.080
They didn't particularly
ask outside experts,

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.996
but you certainly could
do that kind of thing,

00:33:25.996 --> 00:33:27.830
and come up with the rules.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.070
So overall that's
the basic idea.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.660
Lead with a little picture
of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.680
The pitch here is, in a
complex, uncertain world,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.980
whether you're Edward Montoya
getting bombed in Iraq,

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.240
or you're trying to run
food service in Prague,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.960
or you're trying to run
product development at Google,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.090
simplicity's the
ultimate sophistication.

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.344
But why do simple rules work?

00:33:50.344 --> 00:33:51.510
They work for three reasons.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:55.365
One is, if you have too many
rules, it's bureaucratic

00:33:55.365 --> 00:33:57.690
and you're kind
of constrained in.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:01.020
And if you have no rules,
it's really too crazy.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.720
You can't get anything done if
there's no rules because you

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.880
can't get any efficiencies.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.331
And so it's that in between.

00:34:06.331 --> 00:34:08.580
I don't know if you all
follow complexity theory, edge

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.429
of chaos.

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.700
Essentially edge of chaos,
complexity theory stuff.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.389
So that's the first
reason is it puts you

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:19.865
between chaos and efficiency.

00:34:19.865 --> 00:34:21.239
Actually I'll give
you an example

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.489
because the pope's in town,
or he's sort of in town.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.580
He's in the country anyway.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.310
One of the great
entrepreneurial success

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.480
stories of the 17th
century is the Jesuits.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.510
And Pope Francis is a Jesuit.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:36.909
And they broke away from what
all the other priestly orders

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:37.409
were doing.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.575
All the other orders would
have these big rule books

00:34:39.575 --> 00:34:41.469
like when you were
supposed to wear slippers,

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:43.679
and which spoon to use,
and when you could talk

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.310
and when you
couldn't, this stuff.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.659
The Jesuits had only
a couple rules--

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:52.000
get out of the monastery, get
out of Europe, save souls,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.130
your priority is education.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.662
And they became, by far,
the most successful order

00:34:56.662 --> 00:34:57.620
in the Catholic Church.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.190
And they run what, 40
schools in India for example?

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.040
So amazingly, entrepreneurial
story of the 16th century.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.180
So simple rules are
very entrepreneurial.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.940
Second reason why they
work is because you

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.870
make better decisions,
partly because you

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.949
save effort and time, which
is the classic rule of thumb.

00:35:16.949 --> 00:35:18.490
But there are also
certain situations

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.380
when you have a
relatively small n

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.240
and when you have
highly correlated data,

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.730
if you're just running
data analytics on it,

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.010
you'll actually overfit.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.792
And so what you're actually
trying to do is not overfit.

00:35:30.792 --> 00:35:32.250
And so you're
actually backing down

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.890
the number of rules that
you could actually create.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.050
So for example,
college students were

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:42.296
asked to use rules to decide
which courses they would take.

00:35:42.296 --> 00:35:43.670
And the students
that were primed

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.200
to have many rules-- like
had to have 10 rules--

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.250
were less satisfied
than the ones that

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.895
just used a simple rule like,
take the courses my friends say

00:35:50.895 --> 00:35:52.627
are good.

00:35:52.627 --> 00:35:54.210
That made them more
happy because what

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.050
happens is if you
have too many rules,

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:59.620
people aren't good at
correctly weighting.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.030
So we tend to, if
you have 10 criteria,

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.034
we overweight things that are
really not important to us.

00:36:05.034 --> 00:36:06.950
And so it's actually
better to cut the number.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:10.686
Plus it fits if you have
issues with overfitting.

00:36:10.686 --> 00:36:12.060
And the other
reason they're good

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.830
is because you can do
them when you're tired.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.079
When you're tired, you're
stressed out, you're hungry,

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:17.880
whatever, you just
have to remember

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.562
one thing, or two things.

00:36:20.562 --> 00:36:22.020
Then the third
reason why they work

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.590
is actually they're better for
coordination in big companies

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.422
or big organizations.

00:36:26.422 --> 00:36:28.130
Because if you have
a whole lot of people

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.140
who have to coordinate,
they're only a few things.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.080
They're easy to communicate.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.170
They're easy to remember.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.140
A lot of people can do them.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.960
So for example, the
original Wikipedia rules

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.140
were, everything has to
have two factual sources.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.680
You can't give your opinion.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.906
And then don't follow
any other rules.

00:36:43.906 --> 00:36:45.530
And those were the
rules that Wikipedia

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:47.580
had when Wikipedia grew.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.660
Now Wikipedia, if you've
tried to post on Wikipedia,

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.260
it's a zillion rules.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.870
And it's basically a bunch of
Wikipedian guys running it,

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:59.530
which is why there's hardly
any women's content on there.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.190
And they can't
breakthrough the rules.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:04.660
AUDIENCE: To what extent
is awareness of biases,

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.170
like implicit and explicit,
how does that factor

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.880
into the creation of rules
when you sit down to make them?

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.255
KATHY EISENHARDT: OK, well
usually when people start out,

00:37:12.255 --> 00:37:13.920
they don't make very good rules.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.820
And I don't know if you all know
heuristics and biases and Danny

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.200
Kahneman, if you've read that
book, "Thinking Fast and Slow."

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.600
It's a negative
take on heuristics.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.734
And it is true that when people
initially come up with rules,

00:37:26.734 --> 00:37:27.900
they often aren't very good.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.470
So we were working with
some Finnish entrepreneurs

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.920
and looking at their
internationalization process.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.425
And they all were starting out
with rules like, always sell

00:37:36.425 --> 00:37:37.690
in the Baltics.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.747
Which was largely, well
we know the Baltics.

00:37:40.747 --> 00:37:41.580
We know the Baltics.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.200
We know Sweden.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.741
In fact they all
went to Sweden first

00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:44.900
because we all know Sweden.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.190
Sweden is also a language
in Finland, and so on.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.580
So people usually come out
with fairly lousy rules.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.910
It's when they start
to think about it

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.790
and improve them that
you get better rules.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.740
So initially they are
kind of bias bound.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.450
But if you work at it you
can get more strategic rules.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.330
And then if you actually
track your progress

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.913
over time, which is what some
of the companies we were working

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:05.810
with did, you can then start to
actually make the rules better

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.191
and more strategic.

00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:09.190
AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking
about my own job here.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.889
I work in sales.

00:38:09.889 --> 00:38:12.180
And I was wondering if--
everything feels a bottleneck.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.471
And I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit more

00:38:14.471 --> 00:38:16.700
about how to identify what
the true bottleneck is,

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.540
if you cold talk about
that process [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.470
KATHY EISENHARDT: Yeah,
that's probably the hardest.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.990
Because if you're in sales,
you're probably saying,

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.330
well is it not selling
because my product's not good,

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:28.030
my sales force isn't good.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.880
There are probably
10 different reasons

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.550
why something isn't working.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.280
That's the one that's probably
the hardest to figure out.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.210
You don't have time to
tackle-- although "House

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.390
of Cards" to some extent
did multiple bottlenecks.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.170
But you don't have
time to tackle one.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:48.344
One of the tricks I have seen is
that if you ask, not people who

00:38:48.344 --> 00:38:50.510
work with you, but maybe
somebody slightly outside--

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.510
somebody in product
development, somebody in HR,

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.450
somebody in some
other part of Google--

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.930
to look at your
function, they may

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.770
be able to come at your function
with a fresher perspective.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:04.640
They may give you lousy
ideas, but I've often

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.204
seen their able to
give you good ideas.

00:39:07.204 --> 00:39:08.870
In fact i was working
with an R&amp;D group,

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:11.460
and they were having
issues around what projects

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.759
should we actually focus on.

00:39:12.759 --> 00:39:15.300
And they realized that if they
asked some other people around

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.387
the company, they'd actually get
really good insight into where

00:39:18.387 --> 00:39:20.220
they were doing well
and where they weren't.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:23.990
So you might try asking friends.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.500
AUDIENCE: If I were
to try to apply

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.270
some of these simple rules
to my own career development

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.424
during this season
of perf, as it were,

00:39:30.424 --> 00:39:31.840
what are some ways
that I might be

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.270
able to apply some
of these rules,

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:37.012
not necessarily
externally, but internally?

00:39:37.012 --> 00:39:39.220
KATHY EISENHARDT: Yeah, I
think what you'd want to do

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.620
is, what are you trying to
achieve with your career.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.530
Do you want to have
a managerial role?

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.250
Would you like more free
time for family and fun?

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.910
Do you want to have
more engagement

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:53.520
in some sort of social mission?

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.780
What is it that you
really want to achieve

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.235
is probably the first step.

00:39:57.235 --> 00:39:58.985
And then secondly,
you'd think about well,

00:39:58.985 --> 00:40:00.680
what's keeping you from that.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.990
Is it because you're
in-- I don't know what

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:04.330
would be keeping you from that.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.670
Is it that you're in
the wrong jobs now,

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.624
you don't work effectively
in some way, or whatever.

00:40:09.624 --> 00:40:11.790
And then you might start
thinking of some rules that

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.192
would help you do that.

00:40:14.192 --> 00:40:15.650
So I would think
hard about what it

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.858
is you're trying to actually
accomplish for yourself,

00:40:17.858 --> 00:40:20.300
and then think about
what's the bottleneck.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.250
And maybe also look back again.

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:25.860
Looking back at your own
experience is very valuable,

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.202
and saying when were you
really jazzed about your job,

00:40:29.202 --> 00:40:30.660
and when were you
saying, you know,

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.060
this isn't really
working for me.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.680
You'd try and decode that.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.680
And as I just said
to this guy in sales,

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.650
maybe ask some
people who know you,

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.450
your friends and family,
or friends here at Google

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.270
who are maybe a little outside
of your work space, who

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.422
can take a bit more
of an objective view

00:40:46.422 --> 00:40:49.326
on what you're good at, what
you're not, what you want.

00:40:49.326 --> 00:40:50.950
Sometimes other people
can surprise you

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.560
in how perceptive
they are about you.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.970
AUDIENCE: Would you ever
correlate simple rules

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:56.740
to goals?

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.406
Because I think there
are certain things

00:40:58.406 --> 00:41:00.550
that you're saying that
sounds like simple--

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.550
KATHY EISENHARDT: Goals.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:05.001
AUDIENCE: --goals in terms of
defining rules and defining

00:41:05.001 --> 00:41:05.500
goals.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.290
And do people, in reading
this, apply it to that as well?

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.524
Or do you find them
distinctly separate?

00:41:12.524 --> 00:41:15.190
KATHY EISENHARDT: One can make a
distinction between objective--

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.044
this is the goal I'm
trying to achieve--

00:41:17.044 --> 00:41:19.460
and then a goal that might be
some behavior, like I'm only

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.360
going to eat plants.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.670
That would be my goal.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.700
Goal is a less precise term.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.760
Nobody ever asked
me that before.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.260
MALE SPEAKER: And I encourage
you all to check out the book.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.740
It is the nerdy business book
of the summer by Bloomberg.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.490
KATHY EISENHARDT: Yeah,
Bloomberg Business

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.490
called it the nerd
book of the summer.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.420
It's been pretty amazing
the kind of results

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.180
that we've been getting by just
getting people to think about,

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.490
what are the two or three
or four things I really

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:52.540
have to do, and focus on those,
and forget all the other stuff.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.310
But simple rules work
because they put you

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:57.287
between efficiency and chaos.

00:41:57.287 --> 00:41:58.870
Efficiency and
flexibility is probably

00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:59.670
a better way to put it.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.503
They work because you
make better decisions,

00:42:01.503 --> 00:42:03.604
and they work because you
can coordinate people.

00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:06.020
Well thanks a lot for spending
a Friday afternoon with me.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.490
And I hope you keep it simple.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:12.140
