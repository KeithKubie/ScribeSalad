this course makes that the program

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370
this course makes that the program
 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.220
this course makes that the program
actually makes is that when we think

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
actually makes is that when we think
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.570
actually makes is that when we think
about manager we have to think about the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580
about manager we have to think about the
 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.060

things we've thought about but what
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.700
things we've thought about but what
about the food well it turns out our

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260
and competitive system and I I thought
 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.140
and competitive system and I I thought
that was interesting I hadn't really

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150
that was interesting I hadn't really
 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.460
that was interesting I hadn't really
thought about it in those terms but it

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470
thought about it in those terms but it
 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.199
thought about it in those terms but it
makes a certain amount of sense the

paying a whole lot of attention that

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:04.780
paying a whole lot of attention that
 

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.630
paying a whole lot of attention that
they're doing it anyway because they

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:06.640
they're doing it anyway because they
 

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.880
they're doing it anyway because they
they're doing it to reduce costs they

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:08.890
they're doing it to reduce costs they
 

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.440
they're doing it to reduce costs they
know if they can create a more efficient

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.450
know if they can create a more efficient
 

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.140
know if they can create a more efficient
plant it's a more profitable plant now

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.150
plant it's a more profitable plant now
 

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.580
plant it's a more profitable plant now
sometimes we don't like the way it

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:14.590
sometimes we don't like the way it
 

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.140
sometimes we don't like the way it
tastes and that's a problem for them

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.150
tastes and that's a problem for them
 

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.210
tastes and that's a problem for them
then they work on the taste issues but

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:18.220
then they work on the taste issues but
 

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.510
then they work on the taste issues but
all of this engineering is going on all

irrigation practice we talked a little

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:27.910
irrigation practice we talked a little
 

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.610
irrigation practice we talked a little
bit about that when we're talking about

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:29.620
bit about that when we're talking about
 

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.010

also if the irrigation system gets open

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:39.700
also if the irrigation system gets open
 

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.790
also if the irrigation system gets open
to contamination from pesticides and

different kinds of use and then you also

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.170
different kinds of use and then you also
 

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.290
different kinds of use and then you also
have this problem of monocultures where

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:10.300
have this problem of monocultures where
 

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.930

the most profitable plant to grow is one
thing but that then leaves you open to

thing but that then leaves you open to
 

00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:19.110
thing but that then leaves you open to
attack from parts of the ecology that

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120
attack from parts of the ecology that
 

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.629

that will become a predator for that
 

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:24.120
that will become a predator for that
particular plant and then you leave

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.130
particular plant and then you leave
 

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.189

New York and as well as a lot of
 

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.610
New York and as well as a lot of
northeastern cities and then there was a

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:02.620
northeastern cities and then there was a
 

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.220

Elam's and suddenly because we had a

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:07.389
Elam's and suddenly because we had a
 

00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:09.389

vary the street trees and the trees that

large-scale production as I said
 

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.270
large-scale production as I said
provides protection from the

can lay off some of the costs on the
 

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.189
can lay off some of the costs on the

efficient transport systems then you're
going to see more and more production of

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:23.310
going to see more and more production of
 

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.340
going to see more and more production of
