00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.235
Every cell in your body

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:16.763
is separated from those around it

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:18.452
by its outermost layer,

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:19.824
its membrane.

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:23.258
A cell membrane must be both sturdy and flexible.

00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:25.662
Imagine a membrane made of metal -

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:27.772
great at keeping the cell's guts inside,

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:31.484
but horrible at letting materials flow in and out.

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:33.236
But a membrane made of fishnet stocking

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:35.794
would go too far in the opposite direction -

00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:37.996
leaky, but easily torn.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.794
So, the ideal membrane falls somewhere in the middle.

00:00:41.794 --> 00:00:43.219
Over the past few centuries,

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.247
we've learned a lot about the way membranes work.

00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:48.698
The tale starts in the late 1800's

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:50.878
when, according to legend,

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:54.288
a German woman named Agnes Pockels was doing dishes.

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.340
Her observation, that not all detergents

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.094
dissolve grease in the same way,

00:00:58.094 --> 00:00:59.499
piqued her curiosity,

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:00.764
so she made careful measurements

00:01:00.764 --> 00:01:02.307
of the size of soapy films

00:01:02.307 --> 00:01:03.474
that formed on the surface

00:01:03.474 --> 00:01:06.227
of a metal tray filled with water.

00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:09.439
Later, in the 1920's, GE scientists

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.909
Irving Langmuir and Katharine Blodgett

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.845
reexamined the problem with a more elaborate contraption

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:16.689
and found that those tiny slicks

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.116
were in fact a single layer of oil molecules.

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:21.801
Each oil molecule has one side

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:24.108
that loves water and floats on the surface,

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:26.354
and one side that loathes water

00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:28.124
and protrudes into the air.

00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:30.839
So what does it have to do with cell membranes?

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:33.838
Well, at the turn of the 20th century,

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:36.608
chemists Charles Overton and Hans Meyer

00:01:36.608 --> 00:01:38.302
demonstrated that the cell membrane

00:01:38.302 --> 00:01:40.262
is composed of substances that,

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:41.035
like oil,

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:42.500
have a water-loving part

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.274
and a water-loathing part.

00:01:44.274 --> 00:01:47.335
We now call these substances lipids.

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:49.752
In 1925, two scientists,

00:01:49.752 --> 00:01:52.129
Evert Gorter and Francois Grendel,

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:54.029
pushed our understanding further.

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:56.211
They designed an experiment meant to test

00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:57.210
whether cell membranes

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.478
are made of only one layer of lipids,

00:01:59.478 --> 00:02:00.514
a monolayer,

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:03.473
or two layers stacked on top of one another,

00:02:03.473 --> 00:02:05.394
called a bilayer.

00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:06.864
Gorter and Grendel drew blood

00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:07.856
from a dog,

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:08.647
a sheep,

00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:09.356
a rabbit,

00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:09.940
a goat,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.771
a guinea pig,

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:12.817
and human volunteers.

00:02:12.817 --> 00:02:14.028
From each of these samples,

00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:15.942
they extracted all the lipids

00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:17.615
from all the red blood cells

00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:19.582
and placed a few drops of this extract

00:02:19.582 --> 00:02:21.375
on a tray of water.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:24.372
True to form, the lipids, like oil,

00:02:24.372 --> 00:02:26.457
spread out into a monolayer,

00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:29.168
whose size Gorter and Grendel could measure.

00:02:29.168 --> 00:02:31.629
If they compared the surface area of that monolayer

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.508
to the surface area to the intact red blood cells,

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:35.813
they'd be able to tell

00:02:35.813 --> 00:02:37.134
whether the red blood cell membrane

00:02:37.134 --> 00:02:39.476
is one or two layers thick.

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:41.890
To understand the design of their experiment,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.266
imagine looking down at a sandwich.

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.810
If you measure the surface area of what you see,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.646
you'll get the dimensions of a single slice of bread

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:51.399
even though there are two slices,

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.151
one stacked perfectly atop the other.

00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:55.636
But, if you open the sandwich

00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:57.989
and place the two slices side by side,

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.135
you get twice the surface area.

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:01.951
The Gorter and Grendel experiment

00:03:01.951 --> 00:03:03.745
is basically the same idea.

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.414
The open sandwich is the monolayer formed

00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:10.248
by extracted cellular lipids spreading out into a sheet.

00:03:10.248 --> 00:03:14.056
The closed sandwich is the intact red blood cell membrane.

00:03:14.056 --> 00:03:16.715
Low and behold, they observed a two-to-one ratio,

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:18.683
proving beyond the shadow of a doubt

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:20.971
that a cell membrane is a bilayer,

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:22.514
which when unstacked,

00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:24.890
yields a monolayer twice its size.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.560
So almost 30 years before the double-helix structure

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.644
of DNA was elucidated,

00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:30.896
a single experiment

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:33.858
involving fancy versions of household materials

00:03:33.858 --> 00:03:35.151
enabled deep insight

00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:38.193
into the basic architecture of the cell.
