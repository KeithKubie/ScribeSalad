00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.394
- [Voiceover] In the last video,
we had completed meiosis I,

00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:06.482
and now we're ready to go into meiosis II.

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:07.527
And you might be wondering,

00:00:07.527 --> 00:00:11.428
"Well, hey, after mitosis, we
went back into our interphase,

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.053
"is there kind of a rest period

00:00:13.053 --> 00:00:15.630
"between our two phases of meiosis?"

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.999
And the answer is, sometimes.

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.926
There can be a rest period

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:22.526
where you have an interphase II,

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:24.477
and that will depend on the type of cell

00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:25.939
and the species and all of that,

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.309
but it is possible,

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:30.049
so I'll actually put that over here.

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:33.018
So we could have an interphase II.

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:35.386
So interphase...

00:00:36.852 --> 00:00:38.803
interphase II,

00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:39.941
which you could kind of view

00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:42.588
as a rest period.

00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:45.769
But then we get into meiosis II,

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.042
which will allow us to
complete all of meiosis.

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.039
So you can imagine meiosis II

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.454
starts with prophase II.

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:54.499
And in prophase II,

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:56.774
now I'm dealing with two cells here,

00:00:56.774 --> 00:00:57.889
so in prophase II,

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:00.304
and I'm gonna do it for both of the cells

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:03.415
that I have after I finished meiosis I,

00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:05.481
so in prophase II,

00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:07.807
so let me...

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:09.722
that's one of the cells.

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:11.742
I'm not gonna have space
to draw it properly,

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:13.182
so let me draw it,

00:01:13.182 --> 00:01:15.086
so let me draw this one first.

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:17.640
So this is one of the cells

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.638
right over here,

00:01:18.638 --> 00:01:22.423
and then this is the other cell

00:01:22.423 --> 00:01:24.187
right over here.

00:01:24.187 --> 00:01:25.952
In prophase II,

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.577
just like in prophase I,

00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:29.528
and just like in prophase in mitosis,

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:31.107
and let me write the phases here,

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:33.312
this is prophase II we're talking about,

00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:37.027
prophase II.

00:01:37.027 --> 00:01:39.883
Your nuclear envelope dissolves again,

00:01:39.883 --> 00:01:44.434
so let me show a dissolving
nuclear envelope.

00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:48.382
So your nuclear envelope dissolves again,

00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:52.352
and your chromosomes

00:01:52.352 --> 00:01:54.256
once again condensing (mumbles)

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:56.392
I guess you could say
into their denser form,

00:01:56.392 --> 00:02:00.850
so it's gonna look like this,

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.917
this, and this.

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:06.446
On this side, it has a
little bit of the magenta

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:08.211
that was from the chromosomal crossover

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.022
back in prophase I,

00:02:10.022 --> 00:02:12.553
and then you have this
character right over here

00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:13.992
that is shorter.

00:02:13.992 --> 00:02:18.172
You have this chromosome,

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:19.356
right over here,

00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:20.981
and it had a little orange section

00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:23.814
from the chromosomal
crossover just like this,

00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:26.972
and then you have the
shorter orange chromosome

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:27.575
just like that,

00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:29.108
so they have condensed,

00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:30.810
and you've actually,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.005
each of these cells now

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:35.628
will have duplicate centrosomes.

00:02:35.628 --> 00:02:37.833
So the centrosomes have replicated

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.488
and they will start

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:44.319
to migrate to opposite ends

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.620
of the cell.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.801
So once again, very strong analogy,

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.330
especially to frankly,
prophase from mitosis.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.909
So now let's keep going.

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.904
We're now ready to go to metaphase II.

00:02:56.904 --> 00:02:58.594
Metaphase II.

00:02:59.737 --> 00:03:03.466
Metaphase II.

00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:06.066
And let me draw my two cells.

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:09.148
This is one of them

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:11.996
and then this is...

00:03:11.996 --> 00:03:13.273
the other.

00:03:13.273 --> 00:03:14.365
Let me draw an arrow here

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:17.148
so you can see that we are entering

00:03:17.148 --> 00:03:18.928
into another phase.

00:03:20.121 --> 00:03:22.347
So we are entering into another phase.

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:23.740
Metaphase II.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.272
And you can just imagine,

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:27.524
it's very similar to what
happens in metaphase in mitosis.

00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:29.312
And actually all of meiosis II

00:03:29.312 --> 00:03:33.027
is very similar to what
happens in mitosis.

00:03:33.027 --> 00:03:34.374
So in metaphase II,

00:03:34.374 --> 00:03:39.374
our centrosomes have
migrated to the poles.

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:41.409
So our centrosomes

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.498
have migrated to the poles.

00:03:44.498 --> 00:03:45.357
And I'm gonna do it twice,

00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:46.285
because I'm now dealing with

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:49.181
two different cells.

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.787
My nuclear membrane is now disappeared.

00:03:52.787 --> 00:03:55.294
And I have my now dense chromosomes

00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:58.104
lining up along the equator here.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:00.797
So this magenta one,

00:04:00.797 --> 00:04:03.816
it'll line up here over here.

00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:05.906
So it might look like that.

00:04:05.906 --> 00:04:07.554
And actually, let me draw
all the magenta ones now

00:04:07.554 --> 00:04:11.199
since I have my magenta color selected.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.359
So this is the longer one in this one.

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.749
And this had a little bit of orange in it.

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.907
Let me, has a little
bit of the orange here,

00:04:19.907 --> 00:04:24.063
and then I had the
shorter orange chromosome.

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:25.781
The shorter orange chromosome on this cell

00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:29.769
had the longer, the
larger orange chromosome.

00:04:30.912 --> 00:04:34.163
So then it had a little bit of pink on it.

00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:37.901
And of course, you have your
microtubules, that are...

00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:39.387
I've been doing that in blue,

00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:41.082
so I'm gonna continue to do it in blue,

00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:45.238
that are pushing the centrosomes apart,

00:04:45.238 --> 00:04:48.331
but are also attaching to the chromosomes

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:51.303
at the kinetochores.

00:04:51.303 --> 00:04:53.439
At the kinetochores.

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.205
So there you go,

00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:55.320
and remember this right over here,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.409
where the two sister chromotids attached,

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.078
those are our centromeres.

00:05:01.078 --> 00:05:04.514
So let me just draw it all out like this.

00:05:04.514 --> 00:05:05.582
So it might go,

00:05:05.582 --> 00:05:07.626
it might be something like that.

00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:10.087
And now we're ready to anaphase II,

00:05:10.087 --> 00:05:11.805
and you can imagine
what's about to happen.

00:05:11.805 --> 00:05:13.918
Things are about to pull apart.

00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:15.474
And once again, this is analogous

00:05:15.474 --> 00:05:18.237
to what happens in anaphase in mitosis,

00:05:18.237 --> 00:05:19.235
so let me...

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.925
So anaphase II.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.435
Anaphase II.

00:05:25.435 --> 00:05:26.897
I'm gonna draw all my cells again,

00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:27.919
this is taking me twice as long

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.404
because I have to do it
for twice as many cells,

00:05:30.404 --> 00:05:32.609
so that's one cell there.

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:35.512
This is another cell here,

00:05:35.512 --> 00:05:38.786
this is, I got a centrosome here,

00:05:38.786 --> 00:05:41.107
centrosome here, centrosome here,

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:42.779
centrosome here,

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:43.638
and then the key here

00:05:43.638 --> 00:05:45.333
is this is why it's like mitosis

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.584
and not like anaphase in meiosis I,

00:05:48.584 --> 00:05:51.277
is instead of, or like in mitosis,

00:05:51.277 --> 00:05:53.669
we're now going to split
the sister chromatids

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.107
so they now become two
daughter chromosomes.

00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:57.918
When they're connected,
they're just together,

00:05:57.918 --> 00:05:59.706
they're viewed as sister chromatids

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:01.145
that make up one chromosome,

00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:04.443
but now they get, now
they're getting pulled apart.

00:06:04.443 --> 00:06:07.415
So this one might get pulled

00:06:07.415 --> 00:06:09.249
in this direction,

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:11.687
and then this one

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:13.219
might get pulled

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:14.032
in this direction.

00:06:14.032 --> 00:06:17.190
It has a little bit of the
magenta right over here

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.673
and then one of the sister chromatids,

00:06:20.673 --> 00:06:22.344
which would now be a daughter chromosome,

00:06:22.344 --> 00:06:24.573
going in upwards in one of them,

00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:26.245
going downwards.

00:06:26.245 --> 00:06:29.908
And let me draw all the microtubules here.

00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:32.886
All the microtubules that are doing,

00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:35.254
that are super involved
in all of this work

00:06:35.254 --> 00:06:37.669
of getting things to the
right sides of cells,

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.968
and this is gonna happen
in this cell as well.

00:06:39.968 --> 00:06:41.988
So in this cell,

00:06:41.988 --> 00:06:44.054
so this one...

00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:47.305
might be going down here,

00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:49.441
and this one

00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:51.415
is moving up here,

00:06:51.415 --> 00:06:53.992
and this one had a little chunk

00:06:53.992 --> 00:06:55.894
of orange on it,

00:06:55.894 --> 00:06:57.613
so let me draw that.

00:06:57.613 --> 00:06:58.936
Little chunk of orange.

00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:00.538
And then once again,

00:07:00.538 --> 00:07:03.325
one of the formerly sister chromatids,

00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:05.600
now daughter chromosomes going up there,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.776
and now going down over here.

00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:10.487
Over here.

00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:13.529
And let me draw the microtubules

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:16.275
that are really...

00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:18.063
well, I've said it multiple times,

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:21.197
super involved in actual
the movement going on.

00:07:21.197 --> 00:07:23.310
They're elongating, they're
these motor proteins

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.398
that are moving the chromosomes along,

00:07:26.398 --> 00:07:28.674
once again, they're
connected at the kinetochores

00:07:28.674 --> 00:07:30.322
right over here.

00:07:30.322 --> 00:07:32.853
Connected at the kinetochores.

00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:34.386
Right over there.

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:36.081
And now we're almost done,

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.169
we're ready to move into telephase II.

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.436
So we're now going to
go into telephase II.

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:48.103
Telephase II.

00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:52.450
Where my two cells are
now becoming four cells,

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.750
so telephase II,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.074
I'm gonna show the cytokinesis
starting to happen.

00:07:58.324 --> 00:08:00.399
So telephase II.

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:05.061
So turning into four cells,

00:08:05.062 --> 00:08:08.661
trying to show the
cytokinesis happening on...

00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:12.678
In this cell up here,
I have this character,

00:08:12.678 --> 00:08:15.519
and has a little bit of
magenta right over here.

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:17.438
That's this right over there

00:08:17.438 --> 00:08:19.628
and then you have the shorter magenta one.

00:08:19.636 --> 00:08:21.166
And actually, they are starting to,

00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:23.302
they're starting to unravel
into their chromatid form,

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:25.160
so maybe I'll draw that a little bit,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.482
and then this one, right over here,

00:08:27.482 --> 00:08:30.732
is starting to unravel
into its chromatid form.

00:08:30.732 --> 00:08:33.867
And so it this that one.

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:36.746
Whoops, wanna do that
in that magenta color.

00:08:36.746 --> 00:08:39.138
Starting to unravel
into its chromatid form,

00:08:39.138 --> 00:08:40.136
I wanna do it over here,

00:08:40.136 --> 00:08:43.131
this one is starting to unravel.

00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:45.155
And so is this one.

00:08:46.196 --> 00:08:48.430
So is...

00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.359
(laughs) I'm having
trouble changing colors.

00:08:52.359 --> 00:08:54.078
And so is that one,

00:08:54.078 --> 00:08:55.076
and then up here,

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.260
this one's starting to unravel,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.328
this one over here,

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.346
and...

00:08:58.907 --> 00:09:01.345
this longer, mostly magenta one

00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:03.368
is also starting to unravel.

00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:05.040
Also starting to unravel.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.198
You start having your nuclear
envelope formed again,

00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:11.513
so your nuclear envelope is forming again.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.714
Nuclear envelope is forming.

00:09:17.346 --> 00:09:20.225
Your microtubules are dissolving.

00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:22.246
Let me draw the centrosomes,

00:09:22.246 --> 00:09:24.005
they're outside of the nuclear envelope.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.564
Outside of the nuclear envelope.

00:09:26.564 --> 00:09:29.652
And of course, you're
finally dividing the cells,

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:30.906
your cytokinesis happens,

00:09:30.906 --> 00:09:33.716
so now you have your four,

00:09:33.716 --> 00:09:35.620
your four cells,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.524
each have a haploid number.

00:09:37.524 --> 00:09:39.056
They each have two chromosomes.

00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:41.610
Remember, you diploid number was four,

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.189
the germ cell had four chromosomes,

00:09:43.189 --> 00:09:46.440
two pairs of homologous chromosomes.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.224
Now each of your resulting gametes,

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:52.430
these are now gametes now,

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.263
these are gametes,

00:09:55.263 --> 00:09:56.331
they have a haploid number.

00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:57.631
But we started with a haploid number

00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:59.651
at the beginning of meiosis II,

00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:01.509
so that's why meiosis II

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:03.738
is often compared to mitosis.

00:10:03.738 --> 00:10:04.690
So let me make this clear.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.174
This right over here is meiosis II

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:10.657
because it preserves the
number of chromosomes,

00:10:10.657 --> 00:10:11.702
just like mitosis.

00:10:11.702 --> 00:10:14.413
So this is meisosis,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.507
meiosis II right over here.

00:10:18.207 --> 00:10:19.614
We started with a haploid number

00:10:19.614 --> 00:10:22.099
and we finished with a haploid number

00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:23.143
just like this,

00:10:23.143 --> 00:10:24.328
and now these gametes

00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:27.392
are ready for some fertilization.

00:10:27.392 --> 00:10:28.577
And it's important to realize now,

00:10:28.577 --> 00:10:30.666
now these each have two chromosomes,

00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:34.196
and these are not homologous chromosomes.

00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:36.935
These are coding for different genes.

00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:38.329
But then they will each of these

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:40.859
have the potential to fuse with,

00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:43.088
if this is a sperm cell,

00:10:43.088 --> 00:10:44.366
then this could fuse with an egg

00:10:44.366 --> 00:10:46.687
and then together they can create

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:48.963
a diploid number of chromosomes.

00:10:48.963 --> 00:10:52.260
It could have the full
complement of homologous pairs.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.258
But that's what these are for,

00:10:53.258 --> 00:10:56.202
these are for sexual reproduction.
