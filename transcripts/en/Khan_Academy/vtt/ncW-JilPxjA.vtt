00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Instructor] We are
told the following table

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.500
shows labor-market data for Country X.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.350
And they tell us how many are employed,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.430
frictionally unemployed,
structurally unemployed,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.000
cyclically unemployed, and
also not in the labor force.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.760
So this first question here
and actually we skipped part a

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.610
because we want all of these
to focus on our labor force,

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.030
so calculate the unemployment
rate in Country X.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.980
Show your work.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.874
So pause this video and see
if you can work through that.

00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:31.720
All right so our unemployment
rate is going to be equal to

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.643
our number unemployed, unemployed,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.630
which is going to be the sum
of the frictionally unemployed,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.860
structurally unemployed,
and cyclically unemployed,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.470
divided by our total labor force.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.680
So our labor force is going to be

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.650
our employed plus unemployed.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.650
So it's going to be
number employed, employed,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.293
plus number unemployed, unemployed.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.740
And we want to express
this as a percentage,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.725
and since they're asking
us to show our work,

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:05.650
we could even put that there, times 100%.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.360
It never hurts to give more
clarity when someone asks you

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.310
to show your work.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.700
And so what's this going to be?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.257
Our number unemployed
is going to be 10,000

00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:17.730
plus 5,000 plus 5,000, actually
let me just write this,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.900
10K plus five K plus five K,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.560
over our employed is 180K,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.778
and then our number unemployed
is going to be plus 10K,

00:01:28.778 --> 00:01:33.778
plus five K plus five K, times 100%,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.160
which is equal to in our
numerator, we have 20,000.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.610
I'll just write it out here.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.803
20,000, our denominator
we have 200,000, 200,000,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.997
times 100%.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.210
And so this is going to
all, this is going to be

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.100
0.10, and then times 100%,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.570
this is going to be equal
to a 10% unemployment rate.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.750
All right now part c,
calculate the labor force

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.720
participation rate in Country X.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.700
Show your work.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.060
So once again, pause the
video and see if you can

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.893
figure that out.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.050
So let's just remind ourselves

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.610
what our labor force participation is.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.610
It is going to be our
labor force, labor force,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.890
we could say number in the labor force,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.630
and then over our total
eligible population.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.163
So you could say number in
or I would say labor force,

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:38.430
labor force, plus not in labor force,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.940
plus the number not in labor force.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.750
And you might say, well when your,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.710
this denominator is the
eligible population,

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.000
who's not eligible?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.960
Well it would be people
who are not of working age,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.530
it might be people who are incarcerated

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.870
or institutionalized in some way,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.500
could be people in the military.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.070
So then and of course we wanna
express this as a percentage,

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.860
so write times 100%,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.320
is equal to,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.510
so our labor force is going
to be all of the employed

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.220
or unemployed people.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.030
So this is going to be, it's
essentially this denominator

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.150
right over here,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.460
so it's going to be 200,000.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.180
That's our labor force.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.020
Divided by our labor
force which is 200,000

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.740
plus the not in the labor force,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.750
so that's 100,000,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.590
and of course times 100%.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.170
And this is going to be
equal to 2/3 times 100%,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.420
and so we could write 66.7,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.427
it would be 66.6 repeating, but 66.7%

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.950
is our labor force participation rate.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.110
Fair enough.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.500
Now part d.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.560
Draw a correctly labeled graph

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.800
of the production possibilities
curve for Country X,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.130
with consumer goods on the horizontal axis

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.190
and capital goods on the vertical axis.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.140
Indicate a point on your graph, labeled Z,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.240
that reflects the current
level of unemployment.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.870
Pause your video and
see if you can do that.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.980
All right now let's do that together.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.980
I'll scroll down a little bit
so I have space to do that.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.980
So they tell us with consumer
goods on the horizontal axis,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.180
so let me do it like that.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.120
So my horizontal axis, I'm
going to have consumer goods,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.120
consumer goods, and then
they say capital goods

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.253
on the vertical axis.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.103
So it might look something like this.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.120
This is capital goods, capital goods,

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.240
on my vertical axis.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.060
And it's production possibilities curve,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.863
and so they typically
look something like this.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.560
Now they say indicate
a point on your graph,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.960
labeled Z, that reflects the
current level of unemployment.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.510
So this is very interesting.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.210
You might say hey it's
a point on my graph,

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.910
maybe I need to put it
on this curve someplace.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.730
And that would not be the case here

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.260
because we have some level
of cyclical unemployment.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.570
You see it right over here.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.869
Cyclical unemployment,
we are producing below

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:16.610
our potential I guess is
one way you could say it.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.070
So that means we would be behind

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.110
the production possibilities curve.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.960
So that point labeled Z,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.850
labeled Z, I'd put it
someplace behind the curve,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.496
and to get credit for this,
anywhere behind the curve

00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:31.050
would suffice, so you
could put it right there,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.370
our point Z.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.840
And since they're asking
us to show our work

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.020
and it's always good to do things properly

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.130
so if they're grading this
on an AP test for example,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.520
you would get points, it's
always good to put a title too.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.680
So you could say production
possibilities curve

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.680
for Country, Country X, and we're done.
