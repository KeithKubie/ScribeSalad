spaces that we need to open here to say

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:28.690
spaces that we need to open here to say
 

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.830
spaces that we need to open here to say
to ourselves that hey it's possible it's

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840

possible to be here to dream
from here to dream about possibilities

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.170
from here to dream about possibilities
 

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.460
from here to dream about possibilities
from here because one of the main

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:41.470
from here because one of the main
 

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.120
from here because one of the main
problems for us down there is that

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:45.130
problems for us down there is that
 

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.400
problems for us down there is that
whenever there's a problem we turn to

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:47.410
whenever there's a problem we turn to
 

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:54.180
whenever there's a problem we turn to

so that's why I talk of ourselves as
 

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.910
so that's why I talk of ourselves as
being in colonial states because

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:05.920
being in colonial states because
 

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.750
being in colonial states because
legitimacy comes from outside but how

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760
legitimacy comes from outside but how
 

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.450
legitimacy comes from outside but how
can we be here and imagine things for

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:12.460
can we be here and imagine things for
 

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.610
can we be here and imagine things for
ourselves you may wonder if that's dance

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620
ourselves you may wonder if that's dance
 

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:22.490

or if that's contemporary African dance

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.500
or if that's contemporary African dance
 

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.740
or if that's contemporary African dance
it was not the most important thing like

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:25.750
it was not the most important thing like
 

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.400
it was not the most important thing like
how do you call ones attempt to carve

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.410
how do you call ones attempt to carve
 

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:33.480
how do you call ones attempt to carve
out spaces of dreams because we need to

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:33.490
out spaces of dreams because we need to
 

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.290
out spaces of dreams because we need to
dream in the middle of a hopeless

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:37.300
dream in the middle of a hopeless
 

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.550
dream in the middle of a hopeless
situation I know that around and inside

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:41.560
situation I know that around and inside
 

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.590

me my heritage is primarily ruins but

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600
me my heritage is primarily ruins but
 

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.960
me my heritage is primarily ruins but
how can I continue doing something there

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:48.970
how can I continue doing something there
 

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.470
how can I continue doing something there
and so the studio kavakos project began

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480
and so the studio kavakos project began
 

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.120
and so the studio kavakos project began
as this space where I can meet people

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.130
as this space where I can meet people
 

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:02.030
as this space where I can meet people
who want to do dance I give workshops

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:02.040
who want to do dance I give workshops
 

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:07.650
who want to do dance I give workshops
and see what will happen but from the

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:07.660
and see what will happen but from the
 

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.570
and see what will happen but from the
very beginning just very clear that I'd

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:09.580
very beginning just very clear that I'd
 

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.470
very beginning just very clear that I'd
known it would not be healthy mentally

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480
known it would not be healthy mentally
 

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.390
known it would not be healthy mentally
healthy for me to be the only one

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400
healthy for me to be the only one
 

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.700
healthy for me to be the only one
teaching there and because i had a

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:17.710
teaching there and because i had a
 

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.420
teaching there and because i had a
network of friends in Europe I started

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:21.430
network of friends in Europe I started
 

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.430
network of friends in Europe I started
inviting them because again we grew up

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440
inviting them because again we grew up
 

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.000
inviting them because again we grew up
you know I grew up in a dictatorship in

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.010
you know I grew up in a dictatorship in
 

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.260
you know I grew up in a dictatorship in
a single ranking system and so there was

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:31.270
a single ranking system and so there was
 

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.490
a single ranking system and so there was
this risk that if I was the only one

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500
this risk that if I was the only one
 

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.580
this risk that if I was the only one
doing this kind of work there yeah I'll

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:38.590
doing this kind of work there yeah I'll
 

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.490
doing this kind of work there yeah I'll
become another Mobutu and that's

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:41.500
become another Mobutu and that's
 

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.250
become another Mobutu and that's
definitely not something that a dream of

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:44.260
definitely not something that a dream of
 

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.610
definitely not something that a dream of
so we started like

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:47.620
so we started like
 

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.490
so we started like
giving workshops and i divide trends and

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:50.500
giving workshops and i divide trends and
 

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.830
giving workshops and i divide trends and
at the same time I was working and

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840
at the same time I was working and
 

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.660
at the same time I was working and
producing work because I didn't want to

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:54.670
producing work because I didn't want to
 

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.230
producing work because I didn't want to
wait either like for 23 years until

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240
wait either like for 23 years until
 

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.750
wait either like for 23 years until
people have got enough training and you

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760
people have got enough training and you
 

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.660
people have got enough training and you
can say they're kind of professionals

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:03.670
can say they're kind of professionals
 

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.450
can say they're kind of professionals
now so we can create professional work

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:06.460
now so we can create professional work
 

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.900
now so we can create professional work
with them so the attention shifted like

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:09.910
with them so the attention shifted like
 

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.230
with them so the attention shifted like
from technical crafts to the quantity of

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240
from technical crafts to the quantity of
 

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.900
from technical crafts to the quantity of
people's presence on stage and the work

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:15.910
people's presence on stage and the work
 

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.630
people's presence on stage and the work
has been really around that and this was

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640
has been really around that and this was
 

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.240
has been really around that and this was
also very important because again when

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:21.250
also very important because again when
 

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.980
also very important because again when
you go up you go up in a dictatorship

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:22.990
you go up you go up in a dictatorship
 

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.190
you go up you go up in a dictatorship
one of the things that you come to

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200
one of the things that you come to
 

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.860
one of the things that you come to
realize is that individuals do not exist

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:28.870
realize is that individuals do not exist
 

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.770
realize is that individuals do not exist
there is only one individual that's the

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:31.780
there is only one individual that's the
 

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.570
there is only one individual that's the
dictator the rest you just have to

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:33.580
dictator the rest you just have to
 

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.060
dictator the rest you just have to
follow and so if there is anything

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:36.070
follow and so if there is anything
 

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.190
follow and so if there is anything
political about the work that I'd like

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200
political about the work that I'd like
 

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.530
political about the work that I'd like
to do is maybe just that to go back to

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:40.540
to do is maybe just that to go back to
 

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.990
to do is maybe just that to go back to
the individual and give that space where

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000
the individual and give that space where
 

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.180
the individual and give that space where
it's like that's why I talk of my own

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:45.190
it's like that's why I talk of my own
 

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.190

the name relates creates a whole web of

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600
the name relates creates a whole web of
 

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.640
the name relates creates a whole web of
relationships it talks about myself in

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:05.650
relationships it talks about myself in
 

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.190
relationships it talks about myself in
relation to a larger picture the family

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200
relation to a larger picture the family
 

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.620
relation to a larger picture the family
but it goes beyond my family it goes to

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:10.630
but it goes beyond my family it goes to
 

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:16.290
but it goes beyond my family it goes to
history for instance was like the 30s we

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:16.300

immediately I'm talking about myself but

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:46.630
immediately I'm talking about myself but
 

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.549
immediately I'm talking about myself but
I'm talking also about history and so

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559
I'm talking also about history and so
 

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:54.620
I'm talking also about history and so

that you're talking about are you going
 

01:19:32.719 --> 01:19:35.620
that you're talking about are you going
to be going into existing buildings or

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:35.630
to be going into existing buildings or
 

01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:38.919

they're both or all of them restructures

01:19:38.919 --> 01:19:38.929

01:19:38.929 --> 01:19:43.239

that you need to build what because the

01:19:43.239 --> 01:19:43.249

country today is not even in a process

01:19:47.290 --> 01:19:47.300
country today is not even in a process
 

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:49.359
country today is not even in a process
of reconstruction we just need to

01:19:49.359 --> 01:19:49.369
of reconstruction we just need to
 

01:19:49.369 --> 01:19:51.759
of reconstruction we just need to
construct everything everything has been

01:19:51.759 --> 01:19:51.769
construct everything everything has been
 

01:19:51.769 --> 01:19:55.239
construct everything everything has been
destroyed so definitely there will be

01:19:55.239 --> 01:19:55.249
destroyed so definitely there will be
 

01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:59.080
destroyed so definitely there will be
new buildings but for now we begin with

01:19:59.080 --> 01:19:59.090
new buildings but for now we begin with
 

01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:01.989
new buildings but for now we begin with
one and in fact like just a first module

01:20:01.989 --> 01:20:01.999
one and in fact like just a first module
 

01:20:01.999 --> 01:20:04.750
one and in fact like just a first module
in that one we cannot fund everything

01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:04.760
in that one we cannot fund everything
 

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.939
in that one we cannot fund everything
anyway because we turn on our own if we

01:20:06.939 --> 01:20:06.949
anyway because we turn on our own if we
 

01:20:06.949 --> 01:20:09.370
anyway because we turn on our own if we
have to find everything to take maybe 15

01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:09.380
have to find everything to take maybe 15
 

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:13.689
have to find everything to take maybe 15
years to complete and so later on we

01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:13.699
years to complete and so later on we
 

01:20:13.699 --> 01:20:17.319
years to complete and so later on we
should move on but definitely it has to

01:20:17.319 --> 01:20:17.329
should move on but definitely it has to
 

01:20:17.329 --> 01:20:20.439
should move on but definitely it has to
be new because there is what can you do

01:20:20.439 --> 01:20:20.449
be new because there is what can you do
 

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:24.189
be new because there is what can you do

find interesting about ramones response
 

01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:23.910
find interesting about ramones response
to those questions is that it's the

01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920
to those questions is that it's the
 

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:29.870

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960
brings forward and so you have this
 

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:39.780

ghosts come up so we need to make as

ghosts come up so we need to make as
 

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:05.709
ghosts come up so we need to make as
much noise as possible

01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:05.719
much noise as possible
 

01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:07.810
much noise as possible
because we don't want to face our ghost

01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:07.820
because we don't want to face our ghost
 

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:13.899
because we don't want to face our ghost
and yet I think that if we can be able

01:23:13.899 --> 01:23:13.909
and yet I think that if we can be able
 

01:23:13.909 --> 01:23:19.569
and yet I think that if we can be able
to look into ourselves and build with

01:23:19.569 --> 01:23:19.579
to look into ourselves and build with
 

01:23:19.579 --> 01:23:22.839
to look into ourselves and build with
our fears that could be a way forward

01:23:22.839 --> 01:23:22.849
our fears that could be a way forward
 

01:23:22.849 --> 01:23:26.589
our fears that could be a way forward
and so the work with Raymond reminds me

01:23:26.589 --> 01:23:26.599
and so the work with Raymond reminds me
 

01:23:26.599 --> 01:23:30.669
and so the work with Raymond reminds me
of the necessity for those spaces for

01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679
of the necessity for those spaces for
 

01:23:30.679 --> 01:23:33.580
of the necessity for those spaces for
silence and for stillness which for a

01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:33.590
silence and for stillness which for a
 

01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:36.640
silence and for stillness which for a
dancer would put some good sound from

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:36.650
dancer would put some good sound from
 

01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:39.330

the onset slag paradoxical how do you

01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:39.340
the onset slag paradoxical how do you
 

01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:42.790
the onset slag paradoxical how do you
aim for stillness when you're a dancer

01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800
aim for stillness when you're a dancer
 

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.810
aim for stillness when you're a dancer
but maybe that's like the ultimate dance

01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:45.820
but maybe that's like the ultimate dance
 

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:49.390
but maybe that's like the ultimate dance
so that's a really at a very intimate

01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:49.400
so that's a really at a very intimate
 

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.779
so that's a really at a very intimate
level but also that can translate in the

01:23:52.779 --> 01:23:52.789
level but also that can translate in the
 

01:23:52.789 --> 01:23:58.600

01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679
problem in Congo that the people would
 

01:29:53.679 --> 01:29:57.030
problem in Congo that the people would
look externally for solving that problem

01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040
look externally for solving that problem
 

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.669
look externally for solving that problem
what it was IMF or World Bank or

01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679
what it was IMF or World Bank or
 

01:29:59.679 --> 01:30:01.560
what it was IMF or World Bank or
something like that I guess my question

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:01.570
something like that I guess my question
 

01:30:01.570 --> 01:30:06.050
something like that I guess my question
is somehow how do you envision

01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:06.060
is somehow how do you envision
 

01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:08.040
is somehow how do you envision
architecture and dance whether

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:08.050
architecture and dance whether
 

01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:10.740
architecture and dance whether
separately or together in parallel that

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:10.750
separately or together in parallel that
 

01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:13.950
separately or together in parallel that
they would take or provide a whether

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:13.960
they would take or provide a whether
 

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.709
they would take or provide a whether
it's a platform or a route where somehow

01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719
it's a platform or a route where somehow
 

01:30:16.719 --> 01:30:18.959
it's a platform or a route where somehow
the people of Congo can kind of

01:30:18.959 --> 01:30:18.969
the people of Congo can kind of
 

01:30:18.969 --> 01:30:23.970
the people of Congo can kind of
internalize and give themselves the

01:30:23.970 --> 01:30:23.980
internalize and give themselves the
 

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:26.669
internalize and give themselves the
power to sort of take on the problems

01:30:26.669 --> 01:30:26.679
power to sort of take on the problems
 

01:30:26.679 --> 01:30:28.560
power to sort of take on the problems
and solve it for themselves and you

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:28.570
and solve it for themselves and you
 

01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:30.359
and solve it for themselves and you
spoke about something about like nation

01:30:30.359 --> 01:30:30.369
spoke about something about like nation
 

01:30:30.369 --> 01:30:32.669
spoke about something about like nation
building a nation is there may be a

01:30:32.669 --> 01:30:32.679
building a nation is there may be a
 

01:30:32.679 --> 01:30:35.520
building a nation is there may be a
nation dance or a nation architecture

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:35.530
nation dance or a nation architecture
 

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:37.879
nation dance or a nation architecture
that needs to be created or is it

01:30:37.879 --> 01:30:37.889
that needs to be created or is it
 

01:30:37.889 --> 01:30:40.470
that needs to be created or is it
providing a safe haven or how do you

01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480
providing a safe haven or how do you
 

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.030
providing a safe haven or how do you
envision what are the roles of

01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.040
envision what are the roles of
 

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.740
envision what are the roles of
architecture and dance and providing

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:43.750
architecture and dance and providing
 

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:48.689
architecture and dance and providing
kind of I guess I'm it I'm assuming for

01:30:48.689 --> 01:30:48.699
kind of I guess I'm it I'm assuming for
 

01:30:48.699 --> 01:30:50.640
kind of I guess I'm it I'm assuming for
taking congo forward to position where

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:50.650
taking congo forward to position where
 

01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:53.939
taking congo forward to position where
they feel that it's we don't need

01:30:53.939 --> 01:30:53.949
they feel that it's we don't need
 

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.609
they feel that it's we don't need
external health kind of thing okay first

01:30:56.609 --> 01:30:56.619
external health kind of thing okay first
 

01:30:56.619 --> 01:31:01.260
external health kind of thing okay first
of all it cannot I'm not imagining this

01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:01.270
of all it cannot I'm not imagining this
 

01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:05.850
of all it cannot I'm not imagining this
at the scale of the country but you're

01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:05.860
at the scale of the country but you're
 

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:09.840
at the scale of the country but you're
talking of smaller scale which is that

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:09.850
talking of smaller scale which is that
 

01:31:09.850 --> 01:31:13.890
talking of smaller scale which is that
of a city and inside that city and this

01:31:13.890 --> 01:31:13.900
of a city and inside that city and this
 

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:17.510
of a city and inside that city and this
is something that like when I look that

01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520
is something that like when I look that
 

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:20.040
is something that like when I look that
the independent the history of

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:20.050
the independent the history of
 

01:31:20.050 --> 01:31:23.490
the independent the history of
independence movements in in Africa in

01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:23.500
independence movements in in Africa in
 

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:28.910
independence movements in in Africa in
general it was not the mass you had a

01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920
general it was not the mass you had a
 

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:31.530
general it was not the mass you had a
handful of people who started to

01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:31.540
handful of people who started to
 

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:34.530
handful of people who started to
understand what was going on and they

01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:34.540
understand what was going on and they
 

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:37.200
understand what was going on and they
could lead out of people to some places

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:37.210
could lead out of people to some places
 

01:31:37.210 --> 01:31:41.850
could lead out of people to some places
so what you're seeing what now today I'm

01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:41.860
so what you're seeing what now today I'm
 

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:44.630
so what you're seeing what now today I'm
hoping that these spaces in Kazan

01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:44.640
hoping that these spaces in Kazan
 

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.760
hoping that these spaces in Kazan
any who provided would be like a space

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:46.770
any who provided would be like a space
 

01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:51.980
any who provided would be like a space
where new ways of thinking oneself as a

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:51.990
where new ways of thinking oneself as a
 

01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:57.830
where new ways of thinking oneself as a
leader could emerge and if you have 23

01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840
leader could emerge and if you have 23
 

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.330
leader could emerge and if you have 23
people who can continue this that's

01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:02.340
people who can continue this that's
 

01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:06.730
people who can continue this that's
already a force but it's a bad scale and

01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:06.740
already a force but it's a bad scale and
 

01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:09.830
already a force but it's a bad scale and
maybe it will take a hundred years to

01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840
maybe it will take a hundred years to
 

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.680
maybe it will take a hundred years to
start thinking but then I'll not be

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:12.690
start thinking but then I'll not be
 

01:32:12.690 --> 01:32:16.490
start thinking but then I'll not be
there to see thank you one last we will

01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500
there to see thank you one last we will
 

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:25.840
there to see thank you one last we will
take one last question from Mabel was

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:25.850
 
 

01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:28.580
 
hello thank you I it was a really

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:28.590
hello thank you I it was a really
 

01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:30.740
hello thank you I it was a really
fantastic panel and I think the things

01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:30.750
fantastic panel and I think the things
 

01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:32.780
fantastic panel and I think the things
that you're sort of bringing forward

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:32.790
that you're sort of bringing forward
 

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:34.850
that you're sort of bringing forward
about the future of the you know the the

01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860
about the future of the you know the the
 

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:36.410
about the future of the you know the the
African city but I think the question of

01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420
African city but I think the question of
 

01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:38.000
African city but I think the question of
the urban in general which isn't just

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:38.010
the urban in general which isn't just
 

01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:39.890
the urban in general which isn't just
African but i think is a global question

01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:39.900
African but i think is a global question
 

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:41.510
African but i think is a global question
and and actually fast and i think you

01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520
and and actually fast and i think you
 

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.980
and and actually fast and i think you
answered the question I was going to ask

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:42.990
answered the question I was going to ask
 

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:44.780
answered the question I was going to ask
you which was about the role of memory

01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:44.790
you which was about the role of memory
 

01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:46.970
you which was about the role of memory
in your project because I do think that

01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:46.980
in your project because I do think that
 

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.680
in your project because I do think that
there is something about the way in

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:48.690
there is something about the way in
 

01:32:48.690 --> 01:32:52.100
there is something about the way in
which history becomes a kind of but you

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:52.110
which history becomes a kind of but you
 

01:32:52.110 --> 01:32:53.840
which history becomes a kind of but you
know sort of a structural ization of

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:53.850
know sort of a structural ization of
 

01:32:53.850 --> 01:32:56.690
know sort of a structural ization of
past pneus by the state so that history

01:32:56.690 --> 01:32:56.700
past pneus by the state so that history
 

01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:58.640
past pneus by the state so that history
does become the grand narrative but I

01:32:58.640 --> 01:32:58.650
does become the grand narrative but I
 

01:32:58.650 --> 01:33:00.410
does become the grand narrative but I
think you beautifully described as just

01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:00.420
think you beautifully described as just
 

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:03.080
think you beautifully described as just
layered up by names and in monumentality

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:03.090
layered up by names and in monumentality
 

01:33:03.090 --> 01:33:05.120
layered up by names and in monumentality
which can also be with for architects

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:05.130
which can also be with for architects
 

01:33:05.130 --> 01:33:06.890
which can also be with for architects
the kind of monumentality of modernism

01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900
the kind of monumentality of modernism
 

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:10.130
the kind of monumentality of modernism
and I'm wondering in what ways does

01:33:10.130 --> 01:33:10.140
and I'm wondering in what ways does
 

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:12.140
and I'm wondering in what ways does
memory begin to operate both within

01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:12.150
memory begin to operate both within
 

01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:15.560
memory begin to operate both within
space and then perhaps between those

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:15.570
space and then perhaps between those
 

01:33:15.570 --> 01:33:18.140
space and then perhaps between those
three points that you mark on the map

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:18.150
three points that you mark on the map
 

01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:20.320
three points that you mark on the map
how do bodies move between those three

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:20.330
how do bodies move between those three
 

01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:22.820
how do bodies move between those three
places how does the city's start to

01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:22.830
places how does the city's start to
 

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:25.430
places how does the city's start to
merge out of the ability to kind of move

01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440
merge out of the ability to kind of move
 

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.080
merge out of the ability to kind of move
between those three X's that then

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:27.090
between those three X's that then
 

01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:29.300
between those three X's that then
perhaps become habit and everyday

01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:29.310
perhaps become habit and everyday
 

01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:31.430
perhaps become habit and everyday
experience and in memory and perhaps

01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440
experience and in memory and perhaps
 

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:40.190
experience and in memory and perhaps
knowledge that then is passed on and

01:33:40.190 --> 01:33:40.200
knowledge that then is passed on and
 

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:48.959
knowledge that then is passed on and
maybe that is that part of the plan

01:33:48.959 --> 01:33:48.969
