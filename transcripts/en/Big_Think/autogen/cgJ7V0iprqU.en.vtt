brains of children versus teenagers

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230
brains of children versus teenagers
 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.200
brains of children versus teenagers
versus adults are different and I think

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210
versus adults are different and I think
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.779
versus adults are different and I think
it's important for us to remember that

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:10.789
it's important for us to remember that
 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.289
it's important for us to remember that
your brain is truly a work in progress

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
your brain is truly a work in progress
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.530
your brain is truly a work in progress
and that when you're a child your

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540
and that when you're a child your
 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.930
and that when you're a child your
ability to learn things is quite

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940
ability to learn things is quite
 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.150
ability to learn things is quite
remarkable and it's there is a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160
remarkable and it's there is a
 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.180
remarkable and it's there is a
plasticity to your brain so that if you

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190
plasticity to your brain so that if you
 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.760
plasticity to your brain so that if you
want to learn to speak Italian you will

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770
want to learn to speak Italian you will
 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.400
want to learn to speak Italian you will
learn to speak Italian at 10:00 or 11:00

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410
learn to speak Italian at 10:00 or 11:00
 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.950
learn to speak Italian at 10:00 or 11:00
with as natural and accent to someone

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
with as natural and accent to someone
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.590
with as natural and accent to someone
who's grown up in Rome and yet if you

learn to speak Italian after the age of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
learn to speak Italian after the age of
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.470
learn to speak Italian after the age of
13 and 14 you can learn the vocabulary

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
13 and 14 you can learn the vocabulary
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.130
13 and 14 you can learn the vocabulary
and you can certainly learn the grammar

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
and you can certainly learn the grammar
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.440
and you can certainly learn the grammar
but your accent won't be nearly as

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
but your accent won't be nearly as
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660
but your accent won't be nearly as
natural especially even if you learn it

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
natural especially even if you learn it
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.810
natural especially even if you learn it
at 40 or 50 where it becomes very trying

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
at 40 or 50 where it becomes very trying
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.160
at 40 or 50 where it becomes very trying
for your brain to learn that new

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
for your brain to learn that new
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.229
for your brain to learn that new
language so essentially what happens is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239
language so essentially what happens is
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.990
language so essentially what happens is
that at 13 your brain essentially says

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
that at 13 your brain essentially says
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.910
that at 13 your brain essentially says
we have to become more efficient it's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
we have to become more efficient it's
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.979
we have to become more efficient it's

or to learn to speak Italian we're going

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
or to learn to speak Italian we're going
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.199
or to learn to speak Italian we're going
to eliminate that and we're going to

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209
to eliminate that and we're going to
 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.620
to eliminate that and we're going to
create structured super highways in our

create structured super highways in our
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.269
create structured super highways in our
brain for learning so in eighth and

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:32.279
brain for learning so in eighth and
 

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.059
brain for learning so in eighth and
ninth grade our subject matter becomes

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069
ninth grade our subject matter becomes
 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.709
ninth grade our subject matter becomes
much more comprehensive we are able to

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719
much more comprehensive we are able to
 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.989
much more comprehensive we are able to
learn so much more that doesn't mean as

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999
learn so much more that doesn't mean as
 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.519
learn so much more that doesn't mean as
I said that you can't learn Italian or

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:40.529
I said that you can't learn Italian or
 

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:42.289
I said that you can't learn Italian or
play golf but it becomes much more of an

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
play golf but it becomes much more of an
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.539
play golf but it becomes much more of an
intellectual or cognitive experience so

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
intellectual or cognitive experience so
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249
intellectual or cognitive experience so

effects of medication on a child versus
 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.740
effects of medication on a child versus
an hour lesson versus adult are very

an hour lesson versus adult are very
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.350
an hour lesson versus adult are very
different and very often children will

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
different and very often children will
 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.140
different and very often children will
need lower doses children will be more

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
need lower doses children will be more
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.140
need lower doses children will be more
sensitive to the medicine then than a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150
sensitive to the medicine then than a
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.950
sensitive to the medicine then than a
