00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.039
President Trump ended TPS, or temporary protected status, for Salvadorans,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.160
who up until now have been able to live and work in the U.S. legally. They got the status in 2001

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.920
after devastating earthquakes hit their country,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.580
but now nearly 200,000 Salvadorans will have to go back to their country by September 2019.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.280
And for some, it could be a matter of life and death.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.080
I'm about to visit Jose, whose health will be in jeopardy if his family has to leave.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.020
Jose is 23. He came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 9.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.080
He's battled leukemia since he was 15, and recently relapsed for the third time.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:50.660
Leukemia was found in my spinal fluid and in my brain, so I relapsed yet again, and I'm gonna do a treatment

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.700
called CAR-T, which will genetically modify my own cells to fight the cancer, and it's a real chance at a cure.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.120
So you're just waiting to go back to the hospital?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.040
It could be any day now?

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.280
Yeah, I'm just waiting for my insurance to approve the treatment

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700
and go back to the hospital and start the treatment.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.840
But that's where the problem lies, when looking at the family's uncertain future. Jose has DACA

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.960
and his parents are under temporary protected status.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.260
He's covered under his mother's private health insurance.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.240
If your mom's TPS status is terminated, your health is in real jeopardy.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.380
Yeah, and there's a lot of kids that are in my situation.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.120
I just think, yeah, my health is in jeopardy.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.180
I would lose my insurance, and I don't know what I would do at that point,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.440
because her insurance is the reason why I'm here today.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.240
I had my bone marrow transplant with her insurance.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.880
She was actually my donor, so my mom has fought really hard for me to be alive.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.040
Jose attends college and works part-time at school,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.500
but he doesn't have enough hours to get health insurance. His mother left El Salvador in

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.440
2001, just after two devastating earthquakes killed 1,200 people and left another 1 million homeless.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.540
His father left in 1996, several years after a 12-year civil war tore the country apart.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.300
During that war, the U.S. assisted a right-wing Salvadoran government

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.400
that used army-backed death squads to kill tens of thousands.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.220
So your parents have benefited from their temporary protection status for a number of years now.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.180
Yeah, my mom has had it for 15 and my dad's had it for 20.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.100
How did they feel?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.140
How did you all feel when you heard that the Trump administration is going to end it?

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.780
It was hard. I think it was hard for them to hear that, and it was also hard for me, the uncertainty.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.800
You hear about my status being discussed and the American public

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.220
really supports it, like 80-90 percent really want something for the the Dreamer kids.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.720
But you never hear anyone talk about temporary protected status. They're an older population.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.620
They came here straight to work. My mom told me, I asked her, "How do you feel?"

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.400
They're like, "We're older, we came here to work. And we're not as marketable as you guys are."

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.180
And it's sad to hear people think about each other as

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.960
marketable or whether you're worthy or not.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.720
Despite the popular support for DACA recipients, Jose still gets his share of online hate.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.100
So when I was in the hospital last time, a lot of interviews that I did came out simultaneously

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.080
while I had to be inpatient. They were listing the hospital I was in

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.520
and people were like, "We need to find out what hospital he's in so we can call ICE."

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:36.060
And it was a real safety concern at that point. And I had to let the hospital know. And they basically erased

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.320
my name, so if anybody called, they wouldn't say that I was at the hospital.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.600
It doesn't matter that I have DACA. It doesn't matter that my parents have

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.680
temporary protection. It doesn't matter that my mom works her ass off to get

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.100
private insurance. All of that goes above their head and the first thing is, "Let's call ICE."

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.680
Jose's grandmother has told him it's not safe to return to their old neighborhood in El Salvador because the U.S.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.860
has deported gang members back to the area.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.520
So the government, in determining that TPS should end,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.020
said, "We look at El Salvador and we've determined that it's safe for folks to go back now."

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.520
What do you say to them?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.100
They pulled out their Peace Corps from El Salvador.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.940
How did that determination come about, that Americans are not safe in El Salvador,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.920
but somehow these other people are?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.680
The U.S. has really meddled within my country and it's

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.920
really a byproduct of the U.S. policies that El Salvador's not a safe place right now.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.880
For me, hearing that my DACA was rescinded, I would be forced to go to a country

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.680
that's homophobic and that would not protect me.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.200
Doesn't protect trans rights. We have no protection under there

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.920
and the homophobia is really strong and people often get killed.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.520
How do you think the Trump administration views someone like you?

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.660
I think the current administration looks at someone like me not well.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.100
They want to use my status as a bargaining chip, like,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.620
"Hey, listen, we'll give you this if you give me $24 billion for a wall."

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.620
I benefit from the Affordable Healthcare Act, and we all know they're trying to repeal it.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.620
I'm a queer man who has a preexisting condition.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.540
I'm an immigrant, I'm undocumented. They hate me.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.820
In addition to battling leukemia right now, there are so many things up in the air in your life.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.160
How do you explain how you even feel?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:33.060
It's odd. I think we, as undocumented immigrants, we just kind of show up. That's what we do.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.360
My parents inflicted a really, really good work ethic.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.960
So when I was going through high school, I finished my high school while doing treatment.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.260
I was puking and reading books and then

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.720
I went back to college two months right after my transplant was done.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.300
So you just go ahead and follow life, and hope for the best.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.140
Hi everyone, it's Dena. Jose's story is

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.340
just one example of so many immigrant families whose future is in limbo.
