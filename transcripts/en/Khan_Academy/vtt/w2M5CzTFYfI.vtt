00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.520
Throughout your
mathematical life,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.034
you will find situations where
you will need to round numbers.

00:00:06.034 --> 00:00:07.450
And you might be
saying, well why?

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.090
What situations might that be?

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.660
Well, these would
be situations where

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.550
you're trying to get
an estimate on things.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.758
Where you're trying to--
maybe you have a measurement

00:00:14.758 --> 00:00:17.721
and you want it to be a little
bit less exact to simplify

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:18.220
things.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.719
Or you don't trust how
exact the measurement is.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.260
So here we're going to actually
think about what rounding is.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.680
And we're going to round each of
these numbers, 36, 34, 35, 26,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.550
and 12.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.650
We're going to round each
of them to the nearest 10.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.750
And I'll give you a
hint of what that means.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.080
That essentially says take
each of these numbers,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.940
and find the multiple of
10 that it is closest to.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.300
So what are multiples of 10?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.750
Well, 10 times 0
is 0, 10 times 1

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.695
is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, so on and so forth.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:50.320
So I encourage you
to pause this video,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.300
and just based on what I just
told you, what is the nearest

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.130
multiple of 10 to
each of these numbers?

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.297
Try to think about that.

00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:58.380
Well, to think about it a
little bit deeper, let's

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.550
actually put a number line here.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.590
I'll put two number
lines over here.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.050
So we've got some
number lines here.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.940
And let's think about
where these points

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.350
would sit on this number line.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.710
So this first number,
36, where does it

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.410
sit on this number line?

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.360
Well, it's between 30 and 40.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.180
And this little blue mark
is 35, it's halfway between.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.440
So 36 is going to be a
little higher than that.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.490
So 36 is going to
be right over here.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.430
And if we zoom in
between 30 and 40.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.170
So if we say that this
is 30, and this is 40,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.650
where is 36 going to be?

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.110
So once again, this is 35.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.870
36 is one notch above that.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.700
So 36 is going to
be right over here.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.190
So if we want to round to the
nearest 10, to the nearest

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.740
multiple of 10, what are
the two possibilities here?

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.230
Well, I could take 36
and I could round up

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.000
to the multiple of 10
above it, which is 40.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.100
So I could round up to
40, or I could round down

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.160
to the multiple of 10
below it, which is 30.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.280
And so I need to figure
out which of these numbers

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.600
is it closer to.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.335
Well, when you just look at
that, even just eyeballing it,

00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:14.960
you can see it.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.830
But you could also say 36
is only four away from 40,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.670
and it's six away from
30, it's closer to 40.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.820
So we are going to round up.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.240
We are going to round up to 40.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.460
This is literally
called rounding up.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.540
Now let's try some of
these other numbers.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.970
What about 34?

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.126
And I encourage you
to pause the video.

00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:35.500
Think about what
number you would

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.040
get if you were to try to
round it up or round it down,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.970
and then which one it
is actually closer to.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.950
Well, 34 is right over
here on this number line,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.220
where we zoom in, 34
is right over here.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.170
And we have two options.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.060
The multiple of
10 above 34-- let

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.920
me do those same colors-- the
multiple of 10 above 34 is 40.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.809
Multiple of 10 below
34, again, is 30.

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.100
Now, which one is it closer to?

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.780
Well it's only four away from
30, and six away from 40,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.750
so it's closer to 30.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.700
So we are going to
round down to 30.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.280
And notice we went to 30.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.863
You might say, hey,
when we rounded it

00:03:22.863 --> 00:03:26.280
up the 10's place increased
from 3 to 4, from 30 to 40.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.020
Maybe when we round
down, the 10's place

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.970
will decrease from
30 to 20, but no, 30

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.210
is the multiple of 10 below 34.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.460
So when you round
down, you just go--

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.060
you keep the multiple of 10,
but the ones place becomes a 0.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.220
Now let's try a really
interesting one.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.165
Let's think about rounding the
number 35 to the nearest 10.

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:49.790
And first, before we
even try to do it,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.090
let's think about
the two options.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.256
Well, we've already seen it.

00:03:52.256 --> 00:03:54.450
35 is sitting right over here.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.760
On this number line, that
is 35, and once again we

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.200
have two options.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.270
35, we can round it up to 40,
or we could round it down to 30.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.430
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about this.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.600
Well this one is a
little bit of a conundrum

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.790
because it's five away
from both elements.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.339
It's five away from 40,
and five away from 30.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.050
So the mathematical
community has

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.380
decided to define
what to do in the case

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.710
where you have a 5
in the ones place.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.690
If you have five or more in the
ones place, you will round up.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.730
This is just a rule.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.850
Five or more in the ones
place, you round up.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.450
So 35, you round up to 40.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.940
Notice, a 6 in the ones
place was five or more.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.320
So if you're rounding to the
nearest 10, you round up to 40.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.091
A 4 in the ones place is not 5
or greater, so we rounded down.

00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:50.590
And so this gives
a pretty good clue

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.120
for these other two numbers.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.230
Let's try-- let's see
what happens with 26.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.350
26, what are the two options?

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.370
What is a multiple
of 10 above 26,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.810
and what is a multiple
of 10 below 26.?

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.460
Well, the multiple
of 10 above 26 is 30,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.400
and the multiple of
10 below 26 is 20.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.030
So if we round up, we go to 30.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.290
If we round down, we go to 20.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.040
Well, if we're rounding
to the nearest 10,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.130
we look at the 10's place.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.980
That's what we're
going to round--

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.890
we're going to round
to the nearest 10--

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.500
but then we look
at the ones place.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.370
The ones place is
going to decide it.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.510
And we see here this
is 5 or greater.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.410
Or you could say this is
greater than or equal to 5.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.460
So we round up.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.580
26 rounded to the nearest
10, we round up to 30.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.060
Now what about 12?

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.480
And I think you're
getting the hang of this.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.750
Well let's think about the
multiple of 10 above 12.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.810
So we could either
round up to 20.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.790
So 12 is sitting
right around here.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.230
We either round up to 20
or we round down to 10.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.430
Well, if we're going to
round to the nearest 10,

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.590
we have to look
at the ones place.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.440
We have to look at the
ones place right over here.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.090
This is less than 5.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.670
Since it's less than
five, we round down,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.670
which makes sense because
it's also closer to 10

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.020
than it is to 20.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.100
So we round down, and
rounding 12 to the nearest 10,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.610
you actually get 10.
