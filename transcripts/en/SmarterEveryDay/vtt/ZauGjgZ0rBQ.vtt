00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.904
[Engines screaming]

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.181
Hey it's me, Destin. We're at an airshow.

00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:09.007
So today I'm going to teach
you about vortex shedding.

00:00:09.032 --> 00:00:12.875
[Music]

00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:16.723
[Engines screaming]

00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:17.844
(Man) YEAH!

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:20.860
(Destin) Fly... flying our airplanes.

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:23.471
[Engine roaring]

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:25.844
(Destin) I can't hear you. Why does
the smoke come out of the airplane?

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.075
(Sadie) To help it go better.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.178
- Makes perfect sense.

00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:32.508
[Engine roaring]

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.750
[Propellers thumping]

00:00:37.563 --> 00:00:38.966
So on a wing...

00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:41.439
You know, in layman's terms,
the Bernoulli principle -

00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:43.990
where flow is high, pressure's low. Got it?

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:45.643
Where flow is high, pressure's low.

00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:49.954
So the air has to travel farther over
the top of the wing than on the bottom,

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.896
so it's flowing faster. So
we have low pressure on top

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:55.693
and high pressure on the bottom.

00:00:55.718 --> 00:00:58.980
So high pressure pushes the airplane up.
That's why the airplane flies.

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:00.864
But something you didn't know:

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:03.796
if you're on the edge here...
if you look at this,

00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:05.407
we've got high pressure and low pressure

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.604
and they try to have a discontinuity here,

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:11.018
So what happens is that high pressure tries
to run around the top of the aircraft,

00:01:11.043 --> 00:01:13.630
and you get what's called a
vortex, or vortex shedding.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:15.837
And you can calculate
the vorticity on that.

00:01:15.862 --> 00:01:17.429
So let's go to the other axis.

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:19.392
Okay, so now we're looking
at the tip of the wing.

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:23.031
So again, you have low pressure
on top, high pressure on bottom.

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:25.018
So that high pressure runs around...

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:29.226
The flow runs around and tries to
roll over so that they can meet,

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:32.438
because nature abhors a vacuum;
it doesn't like discontinuity.

00:01:32.463 --> 00:01:37.919
So what happens is, as it rolls you
get a vortex in this direction here.

00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:44.173
[Engine roars]

00:01:44.198 --> 00:01:46.943
Okay, you can see on this wing
what they've got on the end

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:49.058
is it's kicked up just a little bit.

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:51.148
So you've got the high
pressure here flowing around,

00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:53.482
and you've got the low pressure
here, but it's also swept.

00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:56.780
If you come around at this angle and look,

00:01:56.805 --> 00:01:59.783
you can see that it's swept, and the
whole idea is to control the vortices

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:02.842
as they shed off the end of the vehicle.
So that's it.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.019
You reduce drag by getting
that off of the vehicle

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:07.240
and getting it out and away from you.

00:02:07.764 --> 00:02:10.026
[Birds chirping]

00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:14.504
Can you say hello?
- Hewow.

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.897
It's me and my buddy, and we're on a kayak,

00:02:17.922 --> 00:02:22.778
and we're overlooking a
hot air balloon festival.

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:30.881
Okay, vortex shedding does not
only happen with airplane wings,

00:02:30.906 --> 00:02:33.208
it also happens with things like paddles.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:36.028
If you have a low pressure and a
high pressure side on the paddle,

00:02:36.053 --> 00:02:38.053
You get the discontinuity right on the edge

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.184
[Destin laughs]

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.180
I'm really ruining my canoe
trip with my buddies. [Laughs]

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:48.159
Anyway, you get vortex shedding and
discontinuity on the side, so watch.

00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:52.667
When you watch the paddle here, you'll
see a vortex occur right on the edge.

00:02:52.692 --> 00:02:55.455
You'll notice it happens where it's
rolling from the high pressure side

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.495
to the low pressure side.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.867
(Child) Could you see the flames?
(Other child) Yeah!

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.386
(Destin) I'm going to
show you an example of

00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:17.685
what life is like without asking science
questions of yourself all the time.

00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:20.483
So, Jacob, my friend,

00:03:20.508 --> 00:03:25.246
why do you say that there's a vortex on
the edge of the wing on a fighter jet?

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.742
(Jacob) Because...
- No, you gotta look a the camera!

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:29.474
- Oh! It's the camera.

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:33.438
Because Tom Cruise was cool in Top
Gun when he was the Maverick.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.163
That's before he went crazy and
needed to go do the loops.

00:03:37.188 --> 00:03:38.705
- It has been noted.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.001
If you don't ask scientific
questions of yourself

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:44.115
you'll go through life
thinking Tom Cruise is cool.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.077
[Destin laughs]

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:53.071
(Destin) What's this called?
(Jacob) Vortex shedding.

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:56.215
- How did you know that?
- Because I have smart friends.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.173
- Whatever.

00:03:57.198 --> 00:04:00.514
(Woman) We have a rocket scientist...
(Jacob) I know a rocket scientist.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.105
(Destin) A-10 Warthog.
That's where it's at.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.537
[Engine screaming]

00:04:16.436 --> 00:04:23.610
