00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The second question asked, what is the maximum number of edges in B.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We wrote a constructed graph with a maximum of edges,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and take each node and connect it to everything that we can.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This first node, I can only connect to the three other nodes on the right side.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I can't connect to anything else on the left side or else it wouldn't be a bipartite graph.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The second node also has three edges connecting to other nodes in the right side,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we do the same for the other remaining nodes on the left side,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and we'll look at the nodes on the right side and this first node can't connect to anything else.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The second node can't connect to anything else and the third node can't connect to anything else.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For this graph, we can have 15 edges, and in general a bipartite graph

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
can have a maximum l * r edges--where l is the number of edges in the left group

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and r is the number of edges in the right group.
