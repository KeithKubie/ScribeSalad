00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130
when I look at other textbooks I find
 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.720

Industrial Revolution and also
 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.450
Industrial Revolution and also
industrious revolution to say that well

this is when people became heavily

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860
this is when people became heavily
 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.070
this is when people became heavily
occupied with new businesses and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080
occupied with new businesses and
 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.880
occupied with new businesses and

pertain to that so what what is the

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410
pertain to that so what what is the
 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.930
pertain to that so what what is the
problem here

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940
 
 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:37.870
 
I think part of the problem is that the

I think part of the problem is that the
 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.590
I think part of the problem is that the

and in many parts of Europe are
 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.460
and in many parts of Europe are
post-industrial when the term Industrial

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470
post-industrial when the term Industrial
 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.970

there was a notion that you could define
the world as industrialized or

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530
the world as industrialized or
 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.060
the world as industrialized or
non-industrialized that you we had books

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070
non-industrialized that you we had books
 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.580
non-industrialized that you we had books
that would I remember a book in

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590
that would I remember a book in
 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.490
that would I remember a book in
particular by uh and then shoberg who

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500
particular by uh and then shoberg who
 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.830
particular by uh and then shoberg who
talked about the title of the book was

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840
talked about the title of the book was
 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.890
talked about the title of the book was
the pre industrial city where you would

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900
the pre industrial city where you would
 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.140
the pre industrial city where you would
define what an industrial city was like

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150
define what an industrial city was like
 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.720
define what an industrial city was like
and then you see whether all cities that

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
and then you see whether all cities that
 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.800
and then you see whether all cities that
were not industrial had common features

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810
were not industrial had common features
 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.250
were not industrial had common features
everywhere in the world or you talk

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260
everywhere in the world or you talk
 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.460
everywhere in the world or you talk
about industrializing countries or

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470
about industrializing countries or
 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.910
about industrializing countries or
pre-industrial countries but the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920
pre-industrial countries but the
 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.190
pre-industrial countries but the
assumption always was that to be

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200
assumption always was that to be
 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.140
assumption always was that to be
industrialized to be an industrial

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150

like the United States where
 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.820
like the United States where
manufacturing has fallen dramatically

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830
manufacturing has fallen dramatically
 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.440

industrializing societies well it may be
 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.740

revolutionary so now you have people who

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:44.650
early service of the telephone industry
 

01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:47.620
early service of the telephone industry
you could have it so that if there was a

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:47.630
you could have it so that if there was a
 

01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:50.440
you could have it so that if there was a
news report your phone would ring and

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:50.450
news report your phone would ring and
 

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:52.360
news report your phone would ring and
you'd pick it up and the person in the

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:52.370
you'd pick it up and the person in the
 

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.700
you'd pick it up and the person in the
central would say you know Archduke

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:54.710
central would say you know Archduke
 

01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:56.140

like that but you couldn't talk to

01:08:58.750 --> 01:08:58.760
like that but you couldn't talk to
 

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.090

another telephone you could only talk to

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:01.100
another telephone you could only talk to
 

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.670
another telephone you could only talk to
the central telephone because the switch

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:03.680
the central telephone because the switch
 

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.130
the central telephone because the switch
hadn't been invented

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:05.140
hadn't been invented
 

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.500

that wasn't Bell but without that we

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:24.530
that wasn't Bell but without that we
 

01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:28.300
that wasn't Bell but without that we
don't have a telephone we don't know the

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:28.310

that it generated enormous heat so you

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840
that it generated enormous heat so you

a high temperature environment so you

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:38.630
a high temperature environment so you
 

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:42.630
a high temperature environment so you
could use it to sort railway cars where

the cheap transistor so that you are the
 

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.020
the cheap transistor so that you are the
cheap laser rather so that when you had
