00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.073
- All right, this is
Vandaveon and Mike here.

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:07.341
"The Vandaveon and Mike Show."

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:08.942
We have a little subtitle
for this mug.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.414 line:0%
 
- Almost said colon.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.582 line:0%
 
Colon--pooh!

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:16.917 line:0%
 
Popped your O-ring.

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.852 line:0%
 
[laughter]

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.854 line:0%
 
- He said, "O-ring"!

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.530
We talking about the new
"Van and Mike Show."

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.966
It's called "Van and Mike:
the Ascension."

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.334
- It's a mindset.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.569
- And it's a--what?

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.971
- It's a mindset.
- It is a mindset, man.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.139
- Things have been taking place.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.141
There have been some
seismic shifts and whatnot

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.209
in our career.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.178
- We made it.
- In the upwards way.

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:45.646
- And the crowning achievement

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.915
is that "Key &amp; Peele"
have finally hired us

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.616
on the show
as writers and whatnot.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.752
- "Key &amp; Peele."
- To do the thing

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.086
we were bornt to do.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.121
- I knew they had some sense.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.756
- So, finally,
they hired us up, right?

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:57.391
So we collaborating
with them now.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.226
And I tell you, man,
it was a real good fit,

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.327
because, like, two weeks in,

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.095
they had given us nicknames
and whatnot.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.331
So they was calling us--
what is it, what is it?

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.332
- P.A.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:06.533
- P.A.s, P.A.s, right?

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.802
Which was like a nickname
for...

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.470
"Pen assassins."
- "Pen assassins."

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.206
That's what we feel.
- We pen assassins, man,

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:14.341
'cause we just murdering up
that comedy right now.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.510
- Blip-blip-blip-blip-blip.
- You know, like...

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.911
I be using some ninja pens
up in here.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.912
Soo-swah!

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.080
Soo-sway-sway!

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.315
Swipe!

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:23.150
- Penis style.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.751
- [laughs]
Penis style.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.187
[exhaling sharply]

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:30.324
[laughter]

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:31.358
You got to give it to me!

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:32.359
- Get the fuck
out of here.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.393
- Oh, my God, man.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.262
We had a lot of fun
on the shoot, though.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.396
So, what we gonna do is,

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.665
we had signed these
confidentiality agreements.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.667
It allows us to confide
in the audience,

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.769
the material
that's behind the scenes.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.805
So we can tell you anything
we want about the show

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.440
prior to the show coming out.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.741
So right now,
what you gonna see

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:50.010
is Mike having
a brainstorming session.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.111
- A meeting of minds.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.813
- A meeting of minds,
as you will.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:54.648
So that's what happened
with Mike.

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:57.417
We gonna show you some of this
right now here.

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.554
- Yo, what's up?

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:03.056
- Hi.
- It's me, Mike.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.057
- Who?
I'm sorry.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.359
Have we met before?

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.693
I'm sorry, I don't know
if we've met before.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:07.794
- I'm the new P.A.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.263
- Oh, new P.A.,
hey, how you doing, Mike?

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:11.598
Nice to meet you, man, yeah.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:12.599
You and who?

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.600
- Vandaveon.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.868
- Van--what?
Vandaveon?

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:19.072
- Yeah, we sent some videos
the past couple years.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:22.609
Now we P.A.s, so we could feed
you, like, lines or whatever.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.744
- Oh, yeah, that's okay.

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:25.412
We got the script supervisor
to do that.

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:27.080
- No, really, it's no sweat.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.215
- No, I appreciate it.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:29.550
But the script supervisor,
it's just,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.884
it's her job and stuff.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.819
- I was thinking maybe
in this sketch,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.756
you could like, you know,
when somebody slaps ass,

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.991
like, you could
make a fart sound.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.526
That could, like,
enhance the comedy,

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.961
'cause you already
got asses in there.

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:44.231
- I will...

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:46.300
I will take that
under advisement, yeah.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.101
Can you do me
a favor, actually?

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.804
Could you go--
there are supplements

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:53.440
that are in my trailer,
and they're red.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.676
They're in a bottle
called Omega Krill.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:56.910
- I don't know
nothing about that.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.312
- No, I'm just telling you
where to go.

00:02:58.312 --> 00:02:59.479
- Listen, listen.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.848
In this brainstorming
session,

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:02.349
it sounded like, you know,
there was some,

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.052
what they call in the business,
chuffa, okay?

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.287
You're talking about getting
him krill,

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.590
you know, like, squid pills
and whatnot, right?

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.391
- Well, you break the ice
with an anecdote.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.060
- With an anec--yeah, right,
that's what he did.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.597
But what you did miss in that
interaction particularly

00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:18.832
is all of the scene ideas
that would come out of that,

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:20.267
like "Fart Dick."

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.401
- "Fart Supplements."

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.070
- "Fart Supplements,"
that's a good scene,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.371
where you just take
particular supplements,

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.739
and they just make you fart.

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.874
- "Sigmord Ford."

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.275
- We have a whole scene
called "Sigmoid Freud."

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.544
It's a colon that got a beard.

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:31.979
It smoke a cigar.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.881
- That was--

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.849
- Just like Sigmund Freud!

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.284
Because our shit
is smart, though.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:38.719
- "Urethra Franklin."

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.287
- "Urethra Franklin"?

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:42.356
[laughing]
That's--

00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:43.724
- "Who's Afraid
of Vagina Woolf?"

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:44.825
[laughter]

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.326
- I got to walk it off!

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.095
Hold up a second.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:49.596
Hold up a second.

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.432
I just got to
walk it off a second.

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:54.668
That shit's comedy gold
right there, man.

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:56.103
Do you have anything
you want to say about that?

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:57.237
- When you start
riffing with someone...

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.673
- Yeah.
- You synergize...

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:01.041
- You synergize,
right, right.

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:02.409
- With their brain.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.046
So, in some ways,
half my brain

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:07.915
is now
Keegan Michael Key's brain.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:09.249
- You see,
this is the kind of insight

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.585
that you ain't get on any other
kind of Internet shows.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.320
We gonna move into
another clip right now.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.222
Okay, because of these
confidentiality agreements

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:17.124
we have signed, we're about
to straight up show you

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.226
some, like, straight up
confidential stuff,

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:21.929
behind the scenes,
never-seen-before footage.

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:23.864
And the best part,
it's all completely legal

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:25.265
for us to show it to you.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.900
- This is one
of their better sketches,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.969
I think because we were present.

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.737
- I think it has something to do
with us being in the room.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:32.906
- It's a sequel
to "Slap-Ass."

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:34.241
- "Slap-Ass 1."

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.375
So we gonna go to some footage
right now

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.644
from a scene that's
gonna be in the show.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:38.645
Y'all gonna love it.

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:39.847
It's gonna be informative.

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:43.884
You are now learning
from the masters, Van and Mike.

00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:46.086
- And...action.

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:48.522
- Everybody, I need your
attention right now, okay?

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.390
I know some of you guys
were not here

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.192
when Rafi was here, okay.

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:54.528
We don't want to trigger him
with any slap-ass.

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:56.864
- Good game, man.

00:04:56.864 --> 00:04:59.233
- These dudes need
to stop scooting back.

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:00.400
They should let that dude
get in there

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.569
and get that ass,
is what they should do.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.239
- You should yell that line
when it come up.

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:06.240
- What?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.108
- You should yell that line.

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:09.276
- Good game, man.

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:10.344
- You can slap me.

00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:12.045
You can slap me
in the ass.

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.614
- Shh!

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:14.815
- Who's shushing me?

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.250
- Who's shushing?
- Don't shush us.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.584
- So thank you very much,

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.753
from both me, Van, and Mike.

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:22.356
You want to say
something, Mike?

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:26.059
- What do you say
to people who don't know

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.362
what the inside
of Hollywood looks like?

00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:30.664
- You say, stay tuned,

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.766
because we're going
to educate you, all right?

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:37.938
- You see those two
new guys?

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:39.706
The guy with
the fucking Rick Ross beard?

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:40.707
- Weird.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:41.708
- Well, clearly he's ambitious,

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:42.743
because it's
pretty well groomed,

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:44.178
so that takes
a certain amount of effort.

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:45.179
And the other guy
with the dreads,

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:46.246
with the tiny dreads...

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:47.814
- That guy...

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.349
he was talking
while we were shooting.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.851
- Oh, I know.
