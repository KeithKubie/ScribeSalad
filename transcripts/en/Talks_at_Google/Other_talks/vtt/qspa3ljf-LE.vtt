&gt;&gt; Hello. Welcome. It's my great pleasure
to welcome you to Google tonight for the first

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.910
talk in conjunction with the third exhibition
in our series of "Digital Art at Google".

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.580
I'm standing in tonight for Josh Mittleman
who should have been here tonight but had

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.220
a building emergency at home so he had to
go home. Josh is an engineer here at Google

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.510
who set up this "Digital Art at Google" program
to explore and to encourage collaboration

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.910
between Google and digital artists. So Google's
mission is to organize the world's information

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.489
and make it universally acceptable and useful
and art can be seen as one way to organize

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.719
and access information. And after Google moved
its New York office to Chelsea, Josh looked

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.199
at how Google could reach out to the local
art scene to foster creativity, interaction,

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.839
and innovation. So Josh got in contact with
Nina Colosi who is here tonight and who curates

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.790
The Project Room for New Media and the Streaming
Museum. I invited her to curate this series

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.810
of art exhibitions in the Google offices.
This is the third exhibition that we've had

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.290
here this year. So the current exhibition
is "Ancient Stories with Modern Technology"

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.800
and we're honored tonight to have one of the
show's artist, Paul Miller, also known as

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.890
DJ Spooky. So Paul Miller is a multitalented
artist whose resume I can't possibly do justice

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.960
to. As a media artist he has exhibited all
over the world including the Whitney Biennial,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.390
the Vienna Kunsthalle, and the Venice Architecture
Biennial, and a solo show at Paula Cooper

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.490
Gallery in New York. He's written in many
periodicals including Artforum, the Village

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.220
Voice, and Paper Magazine. He has published
"Rhythm Science", a collection of essays,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.640
and "Sound Unbound" an anthology of essays
on sound art and multimedia. But he is perhaps

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.250
best known for his constructive DJ Spooky
that Subliminal Kid and has recorded extensively

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.990
and collaborated with all manner of musicians
and composers from Pierre Boulez to Yoko Ono.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.989
In this show here at Google, Paul presents
an installation of works inspired by his vision

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.530
for the Vanuatu Pacifica Foundation; an endless
initiative he's asking "Can 21st century technology

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.939
supply, support traditional ecological knowledge
in ways that enrich village life and contemporary

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:29.510
art?" So as one of the artists in this exhibition
and the organizer of the artist talks in the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.390
exhibition series, it's my great pleasure
to introduce Paul Miller. Thank you.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.390
[applause]

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.050
Paul Miller &gt;&gt; First and foremost, I just
want to say thank you so much for coming out

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.749
tonight and I realize it's always something
to create time in New

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:48.519
York. I mean in fact that's one of the issues
that was an inspiration for the Vanuatu project,

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.510
this idea of free time. So what I want to
do today is walk you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.010
all through some of the issues that are kind
of resonant with what I'm thinking about with

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.549
not only contemporary art but looking at digital
media's

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.700
relationship to what we at the Vanuatu Pacifica
Foundation like to call "traditional ecological

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.959
knowledge" (TEK). So one of the things that
I'm really

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.900
thinking about right now as an artist is okay,
in the 21st century how digital media; you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.180
have this idea of a information based economy
and above all you

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.660
have this notion that things are becoming
more and more dematerialized, immaterial and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.510
kind of invisible processes guide most aspects
of the economy, they

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.480
guide most aspects of how we think of this
notion of the archive that kind of guides

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.709
and gives people structure in terms of everything
from language to

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:44.190
digital media to how your jet planes are flown
and so on. So one thing that really, how should

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.969
I put this? Like is a core issue for me as
an artist is this

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:54.260
idea that geography is becoming more and more
abstract so to ground myself as an artist

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.420
many of my projects take place in very remote
places which lead me to

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.870
this idea of Vanuatu and not only looking
at Vanuatu as a specific geographic place

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.000
but as an idea. So what I want to do today
is unpack some of the issues that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.609
are guiding the Vanuatu Pacifica Foundation
and the Tanna Center for the Arts. But I also

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.030
want to sort of unpack some of the issues
that go through my mind

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.549
when I'm think about contemporary art in the
digital economy and looking at this idea of

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.099
oceanic art and it's relationship to how we
look at different forms of

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:29.540
cultural production. So behind me you have
a typical example of architecture from the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.740
Vanuatu region. These are kind of large scale
social structures. The

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.150
architecture is built usually by hand and
above all a lot of the material comes from

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.379
the region. It's very specific to the area
and you have this idea of a

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:50.560
kind of sustainable use of materials in the
region. So bamboo, wood, some forms of steel

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.990
but most of the material is handmade in a
way that reflects local

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.379
economy, local purposes and so as an artist
that kind of intrigues me in a way because

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.370
how do you think, you know, if I need some
air, I go down to Pearl

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.479
Paint on Canal Street or something like that.
If you are in the middle of a jungle in the

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.800
middle of kind of a different region of the
world, where are your

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.120
materials going to come from but the place
that most people would go to, the natural

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.380
state of things around you. So at the Vanuatu
Pacifica Foundation, what

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.510
I want to do is say here we have one foot
in this hyper urbanized, media saturated landscape

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.200
of modern America, modern Europe, modern Asia,
and modern Latin

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.370
America and Africa, and so on but we also
have one foot in this realm that's kind of

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.410
a place of suspended time and Tanna is one
of 83 islands and we're going

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.580
to be setting up the Tanna Center for Arts
on this island. So what I want to do is walk

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.410
you through some of things that drove me to
Vanuatu or took me to

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.289
Vanuatu. Last year I did a project called
Nauru Elegies with a Korean architect named

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.430
Annie K. Kwon. It was a project that was meant
to look a virtual

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:10.099
economies and it's a intriguing place, Nauru.
It's a place with a totally shattered economy.

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.759
It's a tiny island further north then Vanuatu
and in the early

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:21.050
90's as the Soviet Union was collapsing, a
group of Russian bankers in what they now

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.909
call oligarchs became very clever and very
nimble at shifting around billions

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.720
and billions of dollars out of Russia. And
the Ministry of Finances being looted and

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.349
as the Soviet Union was collapsing, hundreds
of billions of dollars

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.310
started to vanish out of Russia and all of
the sudden appear on this small island in

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.289
the middle of the South Pacific. So the Russians
were very clever at

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.351
bypassing the normal codes of conduct that
banks had to have in Switzerland or Monaco

00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:49.330
or Luxembourg or the Cayman Islands or the
Isle of Man and most of those

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.320
are what we call tax havens. So the idea of
a tax haven or data haven in our era is a

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.360
place that's slightly off the grid. So Nauru,
for me, became a very

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.789
compelling place to think about global finance
and I wanted to do this project based on its

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.990
notion of global finance and the virtualization
of banking, which

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.350
if you think about it, your credit card status
and your social security number, even if of

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.129
course we're here at Google, the digitization
of the landscape

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:19.720
that goes into GPS maps, all of that means
that the data self, the second self that theoreticians

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.469
like Arthur Kroker and Marilouise Kroker like
to call them

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:28.840
C Theory, the second self. Your data, you
know, the things that define you to the various

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.840
digital media that we need to interact with.
These kinds of places

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.030
are kind of black holes in the landscape so
Nauru, you have to imagine people being assassinated

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.680
in the streets of Moscow, bankers kind of
running around. The

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.319
paper economy was old school at that point
in the early 90's as the Soviet Union collapsed

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:49.259
like I said earlier; hundreds of billions
of dollars vanishes and

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:54.470
appears in this small island. So as this kept
happening, as the Soviet Union was in a slow

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.759
motion collapse before Boris Yeltsin and so
on. What ends up

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:03.039
happening is Nauru also achieved a kind of
per capita development situation because of

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:06.240
the rise of phosphate prices. Now, this island
is made of millions of

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.569
years of bird guano, bird shit and in the
middle of the South Pacific it's an agricultural

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:14.569
wasteland now because it's been mined to the
core and the whole

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:18.229
island has been stripped bare. So the Russians
on one hand had virtual banking, and then

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:21.389
other colonial powers like Australia and Britain
and so on had stripped

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:26.469
the island. So when I arrived last year the
island was this eerie moonscape and what was

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:29.349
going on is that the Russians had funneled
their money through and

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:34.460
reappeared in places like UBS in Switzerland
or the Bank of New York in New York. To this

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.419
day, people are still being arrested by stuff
that happened in

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:44.200
Nauru. So the New York Times ran a really
wild article called "The Billion Dollar Shack"

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.370
and I'll just pull it up really quick for
you just to give you a

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.370
little background on the

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.450
[pause]

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:03.680
and what ends up going on in this, oops, let's
go back. What ends up happening in this kind

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.610
of island situation is that at

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:12.050
one point there became more corporations on
the island then there were people, and what's

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.070
really fascinating with that to me as an artist
is that

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.371
corporations are considered people but what
happens with this notion of virtual banking

00:09:18.371 --> 00:09:21.050
is that all you need is an address and if
you're looking at Enron, if

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.250
you're looking at the banking crisis of 2008,
people play with geography, they play with

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.290
how many represents certain kind of value.
But to me what's

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:35.850
interesting is that money isn't really a reflection
of value per se. It's about the notions of

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.899
social use of materials and when I say materials
we're looking

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:44.920
at electronic and digital media materials.
So, alright, you're in the middle of the South

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.880
Pacific and you show up on this island where
all these corporations

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.010
that were virtual financial institutions,
what they call shell corporations, had been

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.910
made. And also you're realizing that the island
is stunningly poor and

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.930
that the place is completely strip mined and
bare. And so it's a desert in the middle of

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.200
this beautiful region of the South Pacific
because of the collision of

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.899
the physical infrastructure of the mining
versus the virtual banking that happened from

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:14.510
Moscow straight through. So there's this one
place on the island

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.670
where there was a server that the Russians
used to funnel all the money through and Nauru

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.280
started popping up in all these kind of science
fiction books by

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.380
people like William Gibson, people like Bruce
Sterling or Neal Stephenson because a lot

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.779
of the science fiction had heard about this
island as this bizarre

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:35.690
economic black hole in the global system.
So it became a place where like gangster bankers

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.170
would park their money and then it would disappear,
or if you were a

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.389
major arms dealer and you needed to funnel
a couple of billion dollars to like a warlord

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:45.320
in Angola, you know, the money would go through
Nauru. And right now

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.710
in fact, because of the Iraq war and I'm going
to get back on topic in a second about Vanuatu

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.351
but because of the Iraq War for example you
can get a Nauru

00:10:53.351 --> 00:10:58.240
passport because most of the industrialized
nations have signed what they called anti-mercenary

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.380
laws so if you need to get a citizenship of
a virtual place

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.480
you get a Nauru passport, you then reapply
to Blackwater Security, and the next thing

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.329
you know you're in Iraq so there you go. So
this is an ongoing idea of

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:14.890
a virtual economy and one of the funny things
about money is it's like energy, it never

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.860
really vanishes, it goes someplace. So in
2008 when a lot of the US's

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.410
money sort of went up in smoke because of
all of the derivatives markets, futures markets,

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:28.730
what they call CDO, credit default swaps,
all this kind of virtual

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.339
finance and the Russians had already experienced
something quirkily similar to that in the

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:36.790
beginning of the 90's with the fall of the
Soviet banking system.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:42.519
So, to make a long story short, I'm an artist,
I'm a writer, I'm somewhat interested in music

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:45.020
not just music but music as information. It's
something that

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.880
reflects social values through the prism of
digital media. So the reason I'm having this

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.430
idea of a billion dollar shack in the middle
of the island in the

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:58.880
South Pacific is that this became an ideal
of dystopia. So let me just show you some

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.639
of the ruins of the phosphate corporations.
All of the island is

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:08.600
collapsing right now. It's kind of got all
these kind of warning signs, all the buildings

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.880
are in slow motion collapse, it looks like
a nuclear bomb has gone

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:18.581
off and eerily enough, all of the structures
are just rusted and collapsing and the notion

00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:22.360
of global finance that drove the phosphate
mining and also drove, on the other hand,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.730
the virtual economy, all of that has departed
from the island kind of like locusts or something

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.829
that just came in and took over, put up

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:34.420
all these structures and buildings, and then
just vanished. So that's why people like William

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.820
Gibson and Bruce Sterling, the cyber punk
writers, are very

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:43.240
interested in it. So Annie K. Kwon's architecture
reflected this idea of what she called Hypsographic

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.959
Architecture and if you couldn't find a better
metaphor

00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:49.350
for globalization right now. The island is
actually sinking as well so

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.350
[chuckle]

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:55.019
you have a collapsed economy, a strip mine
place that's been made into an

00:12:55.019 --> 00:12:59.420
eerie ghost island and at the same time the
waters are rising so I was like hey, as an

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:06.079
artist, this is a wild place. Let's go, let's
go to Nauru. So Vanuatu

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:10.769
represents another extreme which is very much
considered what they call a utopian model.

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:13.530
So what I want to do before I get into utopias
is to think about

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:18.139
this idea of what I like to call the "gift
economy". So to invoke that what I'd like

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:20.970
to do is give away a whole bunch of music.
Can I ask if you can just

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:26.520
take some of these and pass them to other
people? Alright. So take one and pass it along

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.790
and if there's not enough, there's plenty
of CD's I brought with me.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:34.860
I'll leave some up here just in case. If you
are in the back and you don't get one, there's

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.149
plenty here. So what I want to do is invoke
this notion of what

00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:43.389
the anthropologist Marcel Mauss liked to call
the "gift economy" because he was studying

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:46.920
American Indians and looking at how certain
cultures came up with

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.839
what they call potlatch and that was the opposite
of the normal capitalist model of scarcity.

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:55.079
In fact, you're supposed to achieve social
status and achieve

00:13:55.079 --> 00:14:00.329
this idea of parody with your peers by giving
away things. So the more you gave in certain

00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:04.680
societies and cultures, the more you achieve
social status. So the

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.759
network economy is a similar thing. If you're
a blogger, if you're someone who accumulates

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:12.450
information, you achieve social status by
creating a value of

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:17.120
information. A very nuanced and very ambiguous
and very interesting way of thinking about

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.319
reconstituting value in a digital economy.
So the "gift economy"

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:26.500
overlaps with the net. Now I hope I'm not
losing you all in this but I'm thinking much

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.600
more about this idea of the network effect
which sometimes - say for

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.699
example one website comes along and just all
of the sudden becomes viral and so big very

00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:38.820
quickly. That's what economists like to call
a network effect.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:44.660
In the arts, say for example Andy Warhol's
brand, created value much more then any specific

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.240
practice because he was branded figure and
the more people heard

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.481
about the work, the more it accumulated value
so the same thing happened with Facebook or

00:14:51.481 --> 00:14:54.560
Google or any of these kind of things. You're
looking at an overlap

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.100
of social systems then becoming quantized
and being able to have metrics to measure

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:05.250
that value and it's about the buzz of something.
So Nauru versus Vanuatu;

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:11.889
utopia versus dystopia; the idea of how we
navigate network systems socially. So in our

00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:14.570
culture in the US, we are now really, really,
really everyone is

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.310
obsessed with social networks right now but
in other cultures we are actually kind of

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.060
catching up to them; a small village where
everyone knows everyone and

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.260
has certain forms of trade and communication;
a different way of thinking about the idea

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.050
of how you accumulate value and social prestige;
these are things

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:34.759
that I was thinking about when I arrived in
Vanuatu. So me and Annie left Nauru, went

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:38.129
to Australia, hung out in Australia for a
moment, and then went to

00:15:38.129 --> 00:15:42.700
Vanuatu. Vanuatu was meant to be the opposite
of Nauru. So when you see this ghost island

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.700
that's got, it's been strip mined. You can
see it's almost like a

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:49.160
cancer cell that's spread through the island
and stripped away all the value and then you

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.990
see all those structures collapsing. Let's
got to Vanuatu and see

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:59.589
something very different. So what I want to
do before I show you more images is invoke

00:15:59.589 --> 00:16:04.079
another situation which is the idea of the
"mix". I've been working

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:09.850
with Apple and Musicsoft Arts and I have the
DJ Spooky iPhone app and iPad app, and with

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.610
Musicsoft Arts we've had over 2 million downloads
of the app and

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.920
it's been one of Apple's top downloads, the
deejay mixer project. So we gave away the

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.290
app, again invoking this notion of the "gift
economy", and what it does

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:28.089
is it turns your iPhone or your laptop or
you know touch screen into a digital mixing

00:16:28.089 --> 00:16:32.350
platform; hopefully you can see all this;
and the idea is that you don't

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.990
have an active relationship to your playlist
right now. If you have iTunes, what the phone

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.170
or the iPad does is it integrates to your
iTunes library and it

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.940
essentially makes you be able to have a deejay
mix platform where you're applying the idea

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.790
of an analog logic of the mix. I don't know
if you can see these

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:53.519
turntables. The turntables become kind of
data streams and you can easily mix, loop,

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:58.670
and layer and again the loop function is really
interesting because in that way you

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.290
can break up all the songs in your iTunes
library as you pull them into your phone or

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:07.640
as you pull them into your iPad. So I'll just
show a quick example.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.069
This is going to be about this idea of the
"mix" versus again that "gift economy", giving

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.539
away things for free. So here we have a free
iPhone app that's

00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:20.760
achieved about 2 million downloads and we're
thinking about that in the middle of the South

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.240
Pacific, right? So what it does is it integrates
your iTunes

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.650
library, pulls in beats and elements, it does
beat analysis on them and then assigns them

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.549
to different mix channels so I'll just show
you that really quick.

00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:37.140
You can see what I'm seeing and I'm going
to do the same thing so I'm just going to

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.200
do this very quick demo. The idea of music
as a social construct, music

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.590
as a kind of a social currency so here we
go.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:18:04.419
[electrical music start playing]

00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:08.320
So you get the idea. It's exactly like turntable
so the whole fun part about

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.919
that is that we wanted to have an intuitive
platform that let people apply the idea of

00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:16.020
deejay technique to digital media, being able
to mix, layer, loop, and

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.770
transform a song is something that's part
of the basic vocabulary of electronic music

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.220
right now. And globally speaking if you go
to Brazil, China, Russia,

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.740
India, most of the developing economies are
based on bootleg economies right now. People

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.270
are literally looking at this idea that value
comes from sharing and

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.540
it's not in a corporate kind of context. I
know I'm saying this here at Google so I'm

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:41.450
sorry about that but bootleg Google, it's
already free, right? So the

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:47.010
fun part about thinking about the South Pacific
was the idea of values here and I had read

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.120
several books, one was Aldous Huxley's "The
Island. It's a great,

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:55.070
it's his last novel and it was his antidote
to "Brave New World" and I'm sure most of

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.700
you have heard "Brave New World" but very
few people have read "The

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:02.000
Island". He wanted to try and think about
a literary antidote to what he was seeing

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.470
with "Brave New World". This idea of a highly
medicated society where no

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:09.870
one has time, everyone is in a highly regulated
and very stratified culture and "The Island"

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.600
was meant to be the antidote for what he had
seen in his own

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.970
vision of the near future. "Brave New World"
is one of my favorite books. "The Island"

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:21.690
as a counterpoint is one of my other favorites.
So what I want to do

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:28.650
is play you a quick, amusing, bizarre DVD
of a TV show called "Meet the Natives" and

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:34.010
it's set in Vanuatu and it's actually set
in Tanna as well. So what

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:38.832
you're going to see here is super appalling
and it's like "The Birth of A Nation" or something.

00:19:38.832 --> 00:19:41.850
I mean, it's a really wild film. So what you're
going to see

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.929
is there's one of the tribes in the island
has what they call a cargo cult and Tanna

00:19:46.929 --> 00:19:51.290
is the center of cargo cults for the region
and I'm going to walk you

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.740
through this but I want to play you the video
first then I'll walk you through it. So what

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.409
you're going to see is this one specific cult
that believes that

00:19:56.409 --> 00:20:01.980
Prince Philip is a god and during World War
II a lot of American troops were stationed

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.610
in Vanuatu and some were British. Vanuatu
is a former British colony; so

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:11.210
in Nauru well, Nauru is an Australian protectorate
now to an extent. Although it's a democracy

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.401
and supposedly independent, they have a deep
economic

00:20:14.401 --> 00:20:20.370
relationship with Australia. So, to make a
long story short, colonies; colonial issues,

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.750
looking at the idea of how World War II transformed
the region; the

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.870
Japanese have occupied certain islands and
executed thousands of people, then the British

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.980
and the Americans set up military bases. They
had huge airlift,

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.451
cargo, and you know, stuff going on so the
indigenous people saw huge B-2 bombers and

00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:41.480
stuff like that flying in and they saw them
drop cargo for the troops.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.480
So after a certain point they felt that these
were huge silver birds in the sky were kind

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.159
of divine kind of entities dropping off material
for the American

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:55.511
troops. So believe it or not on Tanna there's
a cult called John Frum which is they believe

00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:57.711
an African-American soldier is going to come
back to the island

00:20:57.711 --> 00:21:03.330
if they set up enough rituals and enough drum
chants to free the islands from some kind

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.000
of form of oppression. On the other hand,
you have this cult that

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.581
believes Prince Philip is a god so certain
ideas around how an airfield for example,

00:21:13.581 --> 00:21:15.330
I'm just going to give you one example and
then I'm going to play

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:19.190
this, they would make an airfield and put
bamboo airplanes in the middle of the airfield

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.390
to attract the other silver birds to come
down.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:26.150
[laughs] Imagine stuff like that. Imagine
if you, for the first time, had ever seen

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:31.750
a huge B-2 bomber come and drop huge cargo
with parachutes. That must have been super

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.750
wild.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:38.860
So to this day the John Frum cult exists.
It in fact has members in Parliament in Vanuatu

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.940
and the other cults, these are cults in the
same way the early

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:47.020
Greek philosophy was cults. You think about
Plato or Socrates and so on. So let me play

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.049
you this clip and it is eerily bizarre but
I'm going to then

00:21:50.049 --> 00:21:51.370
contextualize it so here we go.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:58.160
[guitar music in video begins playing]

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:07.020
&gt;&gt;Male narrator: Welcome to our tropical island.
It's called Tanna, in the middle of the South

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.020
Pacific.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:15.690
[waterfall sound] Every so often, we get visited
by white men with cameras

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:16.690
[rooster crows]

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:23.140
who come to film our traditional villages.
They are always interested in what we

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:28.419
wear, how we cook, and the things we like
to eat. But one group was different. They

00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:36.480
invited five of us to visit their country
and to live with three of their

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:50.750
native tribes. This is our story of the time
when our great Chief Yalpa, a great chief;

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.940
Chol, our finest doctor; Josen an expert pig
farmer; Albie our greatest counselor; and

00:22:54.940 --> 00:23:00.760
me, Timotousen, who is talking to you now
went to the other side of the planet to make

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760
a film about the strange and exotic land named
England.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.760
[gunshot]

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.760
[sounds of pigs squeeling]

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.760
&gt;&gt;Female: Do you ever eat your pets?

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:12.990
[chanting and yells]
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It was an amazing traveling adventure

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:18.470
as we explored many different aspects of their

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.470
foreign culture.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.470
[club music playing]

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.039
[dogs barking and hunt horn sounded]

00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:23.340
Including their traditional songs.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.340
[chants]

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.340
Their typical foods.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.340
&gt;&gt;Female: Ketchup or brown sauce?

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.890
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And their national customs.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:40.960
&gt;&gt;Male: If you have a pin on bow tie normally
you try and make it a bit different to look

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.680
like you've tied it yourself.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.680
[laughs]

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.560
[guitar music playing in background and movie
ends]

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.700
&gt;&gt;DJ Spooky: So this TV show was called "Meet
the Natives" and it was a popular TV show

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.590
series in England. In the US, I'm sure it

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:03.320
would have caused an uproar. So what they
did was bring this particular cult that worships

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.140
Prince Philip to meet Prince Philip in Windsor
and

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.940
[laughs]

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:13.399
and they had them go through English society
and check out all so they viewed English as

00:24:13.399 --> 00:24:17.600
natives and then the English so these guys
became kind of amateur

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.510
anthropologists. I don't know if you can see
the resolution; they all have cameras and

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.370
they're meant to come to England to document
that native rituals of

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:31.460
the tribal people called the English. So they're
on the other side of the island and we're

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.159
on Tanna and I'd heard about this film so
I was really intrigued

00:24:35.159 --> 00:24:40.029
by thinking about the idea of again a contemporary
art center in the middle of all this swirling,

00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:45.220
strange, kind of very interesting bubbling
of not only

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.020
"The Island" is the embodiment of one of my
favorite science fiction writers phrases.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.940
William Gibson has a great phrase where he
says, "The future is already

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.470
here. It's just unevenly distributed." And
you can see these guys dressed in traditional

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.520
gear in the middle of these skyscrapers in,
you know, downtown

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.020
London and that is the embodiment of this
kind of collage aesthetic. You have all of

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.030
these different versions of how people have
the ideological frameworks of

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:11.419
how they organize information and you have
this social network that value and embody

00:25:11.419 --> 00:25:14.649
these kinds of values but above all you have
different forms of

00:25:14.649 --> 00:25:19.940
technology, social technologies that people
use to construct their sense of aesthetics.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.150
So as an artist, writer, and musician I deejay
all over the world and

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:28.419
I've deejayed in places as remote as Antarctica
and I've just got back from the North Pole

00:25:28.419 --> 00:25:32.130
come to think of it. I've also deejayed in
war zones like Sudan.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.900
I've been to crazy war zones like Moscow too,
you know?

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.900
[laughs]

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:43.059
In fact one time I had a show at the Hotel
National in Moscow and the owner had been

00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:47.640
blackmailing the mayor of Moscow which you
never want to do and there was a huge explosion

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.710
mark in front of the hotel and I was like,
"What happened to the

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:58.309
owner" or "Why is this here?" and my driver
was like, "Hotel owner is dead." So you know

00:25:58.309 --> 00:26:03.780
Russia is kind of Wild West. It's definitely
a fun spot. So I've

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.210
seen a lot and been in a lot of radically
different continents but the glue that holds

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.510
all this together is digital media. I'm a
music producer and I'm an

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:18.279
artist that looks at digital media as a kind
of dematerialized tool. So what I want to

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:22.049
do tonight is when you see this "Meet The
Natives", to me it's

00:26:22.049 --> 00:26:25.990
appalling, it's bizarre, it's paradoxical
much in the same way the D.W. Griffith's "Birth

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.820
of a Nation" had white people in blackface
kind of representing

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.660
this notion of you know, I'm sure the Tea
Party is probably watching it now, right?

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:38.620
But when you think about digital media, globalization,
and all these

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:43.600
issues that face artists in any context anywhere
on the planet. Vanuatu and Tanna specifically

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.470
is a very unique places because it has this
utopian vision of

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.490
something that's a very pristine and beautiful
and remote place. It kind of has this at the

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.960
edge of the known world feel to it and that's
why I went since

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.701
timelessness, sense of being out of the media
kind of maelstrom, and hitting the reset button

00:27:00.701 --> 00:27:04.300
on the idea of creativity. So I took a studio
with me and I

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.510
went to several of the main villages and I
ended up hanging out and I noticed they loved

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.640
radio, and there was only a couple kind of
places on the island

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.080
where people could really hang out and listen
to music in a large show context. So my girlfriend

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.020
Annie, or ex-girlfriend, walked around and
it was interesting

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:28.200
because we kept being looked at. We were very
different and Annie is Korean and I'm African-American

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.309
and us walking around was just kind of novelty
for the

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:34.190
indigenous people. They are like "Who are
these guys?" because usually the quote on

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.510
quote "tourists" that come to Tanna are there
to see this volcano. They

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:42.600
come in for a day and it's usually some beefy
people from Australia who sit and lounge and

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.350
drink at this one resort on the island and
then leave. So they

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:50.340
don't interact, they don't hang out, they
just come see this crazy volcano and leave.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.090
So me and Annie ended up hanging out there.
We were planning on staying

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:57.510
there for one week and we ended up staying
for four weeks. I went swimming every day

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:02.539
and had fresh fish every day. I loved walking
and I walked around. So

00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:06.330
what I want to do is contextualize this, not
only from the view point of why as an artist

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:10.260
I fell in love with this beautiful region
but thinking about in an arts

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:15.660
context. Now, there's a couple of other artists
that are doing really interesting kind of

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:21.010
projects about environmental issues and so
on and one is a project

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:28.049
that Rirkrit Tiravanija is doing and that's
called the Land Project. This is in Thailand

00:28:28.049 --> 00:28:32.070
and what he's doing is reclaiming a series
of fields and setting up

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:39.000
a series of art projects around rice and exchange
and everyone who participates in the project

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.930
gets their share of rice of what they put
in. So it's very

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:46.919
specific to thinking about environmental issues
and indigenous populations but it's done by

00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:50.861
Thai artists in Thailand. So although Rirkrit
lives in New York,

00:28:50.861 --> 00:28:57.580
the project is initiated by someone is indigenous
to that culture. Now what we're going to be

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.590
doing with the Tanna Center for the Arts is
a kind of exchange

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:05.570
mechanism. It's going to be a forum for saying,
"Hey, wait a second. Let's think about this

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:09.640
from the viewpoint of we have something to
learn from these

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:15.919
people". Now there's this group of economists
that have come up with what they call the

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:20.330
New Economic forum or foundation and Vanuatu
has been consistently,

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:25.260
over the last several years, although it's
not this year because they had a whole recreatement

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.140
of criteria of judgment and the economics
of what make it

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:34.760
happy. So what I'm talking about now is production
values, social networks, and stuff like that.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.130
The New Economic Foundation set up this system
for measuring

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.320
happiness. Now, Vanuatu, whenever you think
about this idea of the native, remember I

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.080
was showing you earlier "Meet The Natives"
and the smiling guys from

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.980
Tanna and they're meant to be happy and relaxed
and primitive in the middle of like this complex,

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.130
crazy society called the English or England.
So the West

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.940
always like to think about this idea of the
national state of the other. You know, if

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.090
you look at "Heart of Darkness" or if you
look at certain other books

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:08.570
in the literature of colonialism, going native
and hanging out with the indigenous people,

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.220
guess what, it's still with us. Look at the
movie "Avatar", right?

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.740
The white guy from the complex society goes
to this beautiful tropical planet and becomes

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.641
blue and all of the sudden he likes, "Hey,
forget the corporation.

00:30:19.641 --> 00:30:24.640
I'm going to lead the native people to rebel",
right? It's exactly like Tarzan and so on.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.049
We've seen this one before. So when you think
about "Avatar" and

00:30:29.049 --> 00:30:35.289
the idea of going native and so on, the other,
if you look at the history of philosophy and

00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:37.789
again philosophy of technology here. Rousseau,
Voltaire, you know?

00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:41.830
There's lot of theoreticians that thought
about indigenous people as the pure ones.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.130
The ones who somehow avoided the complex corruption
of our crazy

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:50.059
technological advanced society. So I'm intrigued
with turning that upside down and saying,

00:30:50.059 --> 00:30:54.070
"Wait a second. What would happen if we said
this is a complex

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:58.470
society?" They have problems of their own.
They have a whole situation where we're coming

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:02.220
in as aliens, you know? But the fun part about
it for me as an

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:07.330
artist was that music was the glue. So when
I ended up meeting some of the people from

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.090
the island which is you know people were staring,
they were curious.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.090
They saw an African-American guy and a Korean
woman walking around. First and foremost,

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:18.360
the foreigners never walk. They always are
usually in a car and me

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.669
and Annie walking around and actually swimming.
Nobody was swimming even though there were

00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:24.850
these beautiful, stunningly beautiful coral
reefs. Me and her would

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.490
swim for hours and hours and they were like,
"Who are these foreigners that actually like

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:32.260
to swim", you know? It was, I mean, you'd
walked down a stunningly

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.350
beautiful beach for hours and not bump into
another person which for me is great being

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:40.080
from New York, right? Try doing that on the
E Train or something else.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:46.260
There's always too many people all the time.
So when I think about the complexity of an

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.590
artist leaving New York and going to this
beautiful island, it's not

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:54.260
about Aldous Huxley. It's not about Rousseau
and the idea of that natural state of natural

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.399
man. What I'm saying is that these are complex
societies that I

00:31:57.399 --> 00:32:01.960
have to figure out if I'm going to be participating
in any way, shape, or form in our own culture.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.820
It's a mirror, you know? Sometimes one of
my favorite

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.909
writers is a gentleman by the name of Pico
Iyer. He writes about the philosophy of travel.

00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:13.159
And as a deejay whose deejayed all over the
world and again, in a

00:32:13.159 --> 00:32:17.690
digital media context, I'm really intrigued
at that. So right now I'm at this point where

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:21.309
I feel like the cities that we've built are,
they are poorly

00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:25.799
structured for our modern life. Most American
cities are based on the grid. The logic of

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:29.210
the grid conditions and contextualizes our
sense of space and time.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:34.360
If you look at Detriot from above to Chicago,
New York, Washington D.C., the American logic

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.799
of the grid has made us have a sense of compression
and if you

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:42.030
think about the electronic music that comes
out of the grid, this is something I'm very

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:45.850
intrigued with as well. It's like this notion
of the orthogonal logic

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:51.830
of our time. I'll show a quick example. I'm
working on my next couple of projects based

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:55.169
on Stephen Wolfram who is a really renowned
mathematician. He has this

00:32:55.169 --> 00:33:00.659
book called "Mathematica" that does analysis
of natural forms as algorithmic states. So

00:33:00.659 --> 00:33:04.019
say for example, I'll give you one example
because I know this

00:33:04.019 --> 00:33:09.350
conversation would feel like Vanuatu, Nauru,
economics, happiness, crazy New York, you

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:13.340
know? So I'm trying to think of it as a collage
lecture. So what

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.760
you're seeing behind me are various natural
forms that have a very mathematical, very

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.490
algorithmic kind of context. Say the most
obvious example is this

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.800
snowflake, right? You see a snowflake. They
are hexagon and there's a mathematical equation

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.289
that a gentleman by the name of Johannes Kepler
who was a really

00:33:29.289 --> 00:33:38.850
renowned physicist from the 16th or 17th century,
1642 I believe or something like that. So

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.930
every snowflake is unique because it's precisely
the condition and

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:46.060
context that make it slightly different but
there's a rule based structure under it. So

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:51.270
a snowflake is hexagon which means it has
a unique form but it also

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.250
has a unique relationship to that form each
time it manifests. So if you're ever walking

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.700
through a snowstorm you're actually being
bombarded with unique

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:04.600
instances of weather patterns. Now, considering
we're here at Google, weather patterns are

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.600
some of the most complex things that human
beings have ever tried

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.230
to model. So you need a super computer system
to understand the wind. You need a massive

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.751
computational logic just to understand ocean
currents. So now if you

00:34:16.751 --> 00:34:23.050
apply that model to native beings and economics
we're placed in this context where most of

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.550
modern economics is just a belief system and
we still are trying

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:31.900
to figure this stuff out. There's people like
Milton Friedman, John Maynard Keynes; very

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.370
few people would have been able to understand
the complexity of the

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:41.750
2008 economic crisis and meltdown but you
know at the end of the day when you think

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.750
about economics, it's about how people structure
themselves in

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:49.450
relationship to society. So the reason I brought
up the New Economic Foundation earlier is

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:53.590
that they rated Vanuatu through the Happy
Planet Index and they

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:57.590
were ripping on this from the Tanna point
of view here because I'm fascinated with this

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.790
idea of free time and free space. And as a
New Yorker those are two

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:05.310
very scarce things that we inhabit. I mean,
if you think about the idea that most people

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.990
are running around paying their credit card
bill or having to deal

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.840
with all the different kinds of micro finance,
micro credit you know, we might as well call

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.270
it a plantation system at this point. We are
just all like

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:19.920
micro serfs like Douglas Cooper in his book,
right? So the Happy Planet Index tries to

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.230
understand gross domestic product through
other metrics, through other

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:28.470
ways of measuring productivity. So the GDP,
gross domestic product, is something that

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:32.510
basically is about 19 century models being
applied to a 21st century

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:38.290
economy, they don't work. So the happiness
index, it's kind of a new way of looking at

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:42.460
how people product material value but also
psychological value. If

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.360
there's anything, if you look at the root
word of credit which is something I love to

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.930
point out to economists, it just simply means
credere which is the

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:54.200
Latin term for believe. So Adam Smith had
a great phrase where he said, "All money is

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.571
just a matter of belief." So imagine if you're
on an island and the

00:35:58.571 --> 00:36:03.110
chief of a certain region approaches you which
is a gentleman by the name of Isso Kapum and

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:06.560
his father Jack Kapum. They are walking down
a dirt road like me

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.400
and Annie were doing one time and we ended
up bumping into these two gentleman and we

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.760
got into a long conversation about why are
you here

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.840
[laughs]

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.080
and I majored in philosophy and French literature.
I don't know if anybody out there knows Bowdoin

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.370
College but Bowdoin is one of the Little Ivies.
We are very

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:28.230
competitive with Harvard, you know? But, so,
I was very philosophical about this when I

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.050
meant these two gentleman and I said, "You
know, I have some mix CD's.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:35.700
I keep hearing reggae blasting out of these
cars. Why don't you guys listen to old school

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.300
reggae and not the commercial, kind of crappy
stuff?" It's a long

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.170
story. I work with Trojan Records which is
a legendary Jamaican record label and in London

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.110
a couple of years ago they gave me access
to a huge warehouse of

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:51.700
old 45 vinyl. So I collect like, this is when
Bob Marley was 18 for example and he's singing

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:55.130
great stuff or Lee "Scratch" Perry so I always
carry a couple of

00:36:55.130 --> 00:37:00.070
CD's with me as you guys didn't notice that,
right? So I pulled the "gift economy" on them.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.790
I pull out a mix CD of old school reggae,
give it to them, and

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:07.600
then a couple, like we ended up staying like
a lot longer then we were planning because

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.990
we didn't feel like going back to New York.
A couple of days later

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.570
we started hearing old school reggae coming
from a couple of different places and I realized

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.619
that people had made copies of the mix and
were passing it

00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:21.660
around. What ended up happening is the music
became a kind of fun way of saying this is

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.240
a "gift economy" from a New Yorker to you.
And I noticed that people,

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.430
even to this day, the last time I went back
to Vanuatu I heard some of the mixed I had

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:35.330
made being played around the island so that
was a real interesting

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:40.420
thing, turning upside down the idea of music
and value, music and economy, and saying that

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.470
the gift which people like Lewis Hyde and
Marcel Mauss write about

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:48.770
very eloquently. The gift is what broke the
ice. So I'm telling you guys a story here.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.750
I mean, I could easily, because we're at Google,
I could get into

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.250
hardcore theory speak about the notion of
the metrics of how you measure happiness and

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:58.691
thinking about the notion of how you quantify
this idea of a gift to

00:37:58.691 --> 00:38:03.270
someone else because it creates a relationship
and there's a dynamic logic tree that actually

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:07.530
applies to how people pass information between
people. But

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:11.310
that's the term of the gentleman by the name
of Norbert Wiener, if anybody out there has

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.381
ever heard of cybernetic theory or information
theory and exchange

00:38:13.381 --> 00:38:20.550
mechanisms and so on, so I'll leave that for
another lecture. So when I started my discussion

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.600
about playing you guys "Meet The Natives",
these are people who

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:30.380
are inhabiting a very complex space and culture
and I'm fascinated with that because precisely

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:37.510
in the West we might have actually tried to
catch up to them.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.520
The reason I'm thinking about this as an artist
is not only because we're setting up a contemporary

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.590
art center but the way we're trying to kind
of look at

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:50.560
graphic design. I just did a project called
"Green Patriot" with a gentleman by the name

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:55.180
of Shep Fairey who did the Obama "Hope" poster.
We did this project

00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:00.390
looking at green graphic design and then you
realize if you go to a place like Tanna, they've

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.470
incorporated the idea of sustainability into
the very clothing.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.460
You have people wearing grass skirts and they're
also looking at this idea of sustainability

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.650
but they also have problems of their own.
They have various

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:17.950
medical issues, various issues with like pollution
and composting and so on. So in the US we

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.870
have problems but at the same time these are
issues that we need

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:26.270
to understand through the prism of art and
that's where I think the Vanuatu Project is

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:29.720
really going to be all about this idea of
carbon negative structures,

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:35.180
carbon negative architecture, and above all
carbon negative senses of social space. How

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:40.240
do we create this idea of hitting the reset
button on creativity by

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.360
giving people free space and free time? So
what I'm going to be looking at is bamboo

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.040
architecture as a main motif for the project
and thinking about using

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.340
local materials in the same way, like I was
saying earlier, the indigenous people already

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:57.420
are doing but perhaps bringing a little bit
of our tech may and our

00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:05.010
digital media into collision with theirs.
So Tanna is at a certain kind of crossroads.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:09.540
The oceanic culture, the Melanesian culture
that it comes from is

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.940
under a kind of ebb and flow. People are leaving
the smaller islands and going to the larger

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.350
islands because in the same way that in the
US, and in most

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:20.570
countries of the world, young people are leaving
the countryside and going to the big city.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.340
Now, that kind of brain drain is something
that inspired Jack

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:29.360
Kapum and Isso Kapum to approach us to think
about, "Wait a second, maybe we can do an

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.990
experiment together. Maybe we can figure out
a way to get the young

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:37.020
people on the island to stay." So the music
that I gave them started being copied and

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.150
passed around. People realized that there
was a kind of relationship

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:44.490
between you know, in New York we would just
call it old school, you know? Like old school

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:47.280
reggae and old school hip-hop and when they
were hearing all

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.490
this new digital music coming out of their
cell phones. We were there, for example, when

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.950
the first cell phone network was made on the
island. They realized

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:57.870
they liked some of the older stuff and people
were passing that around so it became part

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:03.040
of the "gift economy". Again, what I was invoking
earlier. So I made

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.790
the logo for the project. I'm a graphic designer
and I'm also thinking about relationships

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.700
to memory. I'm thinking about how sampling
is a kind of "gift

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.560
economy" in it's own right where you're editing
memories and transforming sounds from this

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.070
idea of a shareware culture but what happens
when that becomes

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:24.160
dematerialized? What happens when an artist
says, "Let's hit the reset button". So today

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.720
I stand in front of you working with people
like Islandsfirst.org,

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:37.890
umm, let me just call everything up first.
Umm, and they're our fiscal sponsor for the

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:41.120
Tanna Center for the Arts and the Vanuatu
Pacifica Foundation

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:49.140
precisely because we view this idea of collaboration
and sharing as a basic principle of the foundation.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.480
The idea, Manhattan itself is an island. I
mean,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.870
don't be fooled. We are just a huge, concrete,
super imposition to what had essentially been

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:06.290
a very beautiful place. So island to island,
Manhattan to Tanna; I'm thinking a lot more

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:11.170
about this idea of how free space and free
time can allow artists, writers, musicians

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.110
to actually kind of get a new way of dealing

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:18.490
with not only their own work but saying, "Let's
look at the future here. Let's think about

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:21.630
the next twenty years, the next thirty years."
And when happens

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:26.410
when you're looking at places like Macdowell
Colony or when you're looking at Yaddo Colony.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:30.310
You have to imagine that these are places
that are well funded

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:35.450
and have had a tremendous amount of backing.
The Tanna Center for the Arts and the Vanuatu

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.870
Pacifica Foundation are crowd sourced from
the ground up. We

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:43.180
started everything off from a two starter
campaign and in fact we had, we're just at

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:47.380
the edge of it so if people out there want
to donate, please do. It's

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:51.710
fully tax deductible. But the whole notion
of an outsourced arts center that's turned

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:56.510
into this idea that's upside down. We don't
have the normal patron

00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:01.811
system and we don't need the normal grant
kind of foundational stuff going on. The whole

00:43:01.811 --> 00:43:04.630
notion is that this is going to be a crowd
sourced initiative based

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:09.310
on substantiality in the arts and want to
get people to think about what happens when

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:12.421
you leave your comfort zone. What happens
when you hit the reset button?

00:43:12.421 --> 00:43:16.870
Not only on the creative process in general
but getting people to just say this is something

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:20.000
that should be celebrated. So the foundation
is going to be an

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.030
enabler, a foundation, a platform. We're going
to be inviting artists, writers, composers,

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.381
theoreticians out to the island to hang out
but not just hang out

00:43:28.381 --> 00:43:33.440
like sitting on a beach someplace but to see
how the indigenous population works and above

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.420
all to say this is a dialogue, it's a conversation,
it's a Socratic

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:42.860
situation. I love this idea. It's a long story.
I majored in philosophy and French literature

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.210
and to go back to what I was saying with William
Gibson earlier

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:52.520
is a great phrase where he says, "The future
is already here. It's just unevenly distributed."

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.010
And I'm going to show a quick example of some
of my artwork

00:43:55.010 --> 00:44:03.410
for a second just to give you an idea of why
I enjoy that kind of paradox. When you think

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.850
about digital literacy, one of the first things
that comes to mind

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:14.440
is that digital is a specifically kind of
mathematical formula. In fact, one could argue

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.000
that analog systems are actually far more
complex so the human eye

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.960
and the human ear are complex information
gathering systems. Behind me you have a very

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.510
famous photograph from Georges Melies who
popularized what we like to

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:31.270
call stop motion photography. So this is the
cover of "Scientific American" in 1915. What

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.840
you're seeing is something that human beings
have not been able to

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:39.080
see before. Motion had been cut up and captured
into small fragments so when you hear a digital

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.070
voice coming out your cell phone, your voice
has also been

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:46.240
carved up into small data packets, sent through
a network, and someone else has to then hear

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.120
it but a computer compiles those data packets
and makes it

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:55.540
become a coherent signal. So the human eye
is not digital. We are analog viewers, analog

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.870
listeners. The brain operates with a deep
degree of complexity and

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:04.010
nuance and layers. But I love this photograph
precisely because it's kind of at the edge

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:08.830
of paradox. In 1915, this was a wild new statement
about visuality. So

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:14.650
if we fast forward to 2010, how do we read
these new forms of data? How do we think about

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:18.120
the way human beings structure and exchange
information and

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:22.260
content? By the way, if you can't read that,
which probably most of you are not computers

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:28.400
and you can't, it's the URL for the Vanuatu
Pacifica Foundation.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:33.090
So my QR prints as part of this exhibition
were kind of data packets that I wanted to

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:36.190
set up. If you go up to the prints out in
front of here and you put

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.680
your cell phone up to them, they'll take you
to the Vanuatu Pacifica site, they'll take

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.170
you to the YouTube clips and video channel,
and above all they're

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:48.980
going to be using your cell phone as a portal
into this different world of Tanna time. So

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.460
the Vanuatu Pacifica Foundation is looking
at different forms of

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.270
digital literacy from the viewpoint of ancient
to the future, much in the same way as this

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:59.050
exhibition is. We are saying that, like William
Gibson, the future

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:04.110
is already here, it's just unevenly distributed
but above all as artists, writers, and musicians

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.010
I think we have a responsibility to get people
free space to

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:11.020
re-imagine the near future because - well,
after just coming back from the North Pole

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:17.200
I can tell you it looks pretty grim. I spent
four weeks carrying a

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.870
studio around the North Pole. I don't know
if you can see since it's pretty dark, and

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:23.801
the idea was to give to several of the main
ice fields and do what I

00:46:23.801 --> 00:46:29.400
like to call acoustic portraits of ice; all
of this is on my website by the way. So I

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.680
carried a studio around and this is going
to be a small group of string

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:37.460
quartet works and the year before that I went
to the South Pole. I went to Antarctica for

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:41.230
four weeks and did a serious of acoustic portraits
of ice as well. So

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:46.860
sitting around just kind of literally for
hours and hours walking through huge ice fields,

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.530
I was able to see, regretfully the screens
are a little bit dark

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:55.061
but these are massive, massive ice boulders
that had just shattered off of these huge

00:46:55.061 --> 00:47:00.650
glaciers. Now this is going to be a picture
book, it's my next book and

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:05.560
this is going to be a series of photo portraits
mixed with sort of eco statements and analysis

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.870
of the quantum physics of ice. If anyone out
there knows

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:13.110
Brian Greene, he did a great book called "The
Elegant Universe". He is writing the introduction

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:16.160
of my book about the quantum psychics of ice
because it

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:21.370
exists between solid and liquid and it's a
very interesting format. So, to make a long

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:25.620
story short, I have a very omnivoris appetite
for this idea of music as

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:31.530
information but music refuses to be contained
in the normal way. So above all, say for example,

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:35.470
I'm going to just wrap up with moving from
Vanuatu and Tanna

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:41.380
to this idea of the temples of the Western
Society. I got the Greek government to give

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.790
me the Acropolis for a day for example and
we had a huge happening.

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:50.130
And about 5,000 plus people came to the show
and it was at the Herod Atticus Temple. And

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:53.040
this is hip-hop so you know you got to do
"Yo" kind of a situation

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.040
[laughs]

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.000
so we put a huge bass sound system throughout
the ruins of the Acropolis and that's for

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.960
scale. That's the Herod Atticus Theatre where
we have

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:06.120
projection screens, digital media, high definition
projection and we had about 5,000 people come

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.410
to the show. So I was like, "Hey everybody,
thanks for

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:13.340
coming to the show. I think I'm the first
deejay to play here in 3,000 years. Thanks

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:14.910
for coming out.
[laughter]

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.170
And the whole set from the viewpoint of digital

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:22.140
media that I was sampling a live string quartet.
I had Kronos Quartet play the compositions,

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.360
sampled that, and then played it through various
software and

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.460
digital media. So that's the embodiment of
what I'm talking about. This notion of the

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.280
future is already here, it's just unevenly
distributed. And the Greeks

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:38.600
had a great situation where they're like,
"Well, why do you want to play a KKK film

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.920
at the Acropolis?" It's a perfectly valid
question, right? And I said,

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:47.860
"Well, you guys are Greek. You have comedy,
tragedy." And then they're like, "Oh, we get

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.010
it." You know with Vanuatu one of the things
that makes me chuckle

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:55.180
over the fact that you have this idea of nonlinearity,
nonsense of structured time so we're going

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:58.440
to open a space up to this idea that people
can hang out,

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:03.770
literally the hangout, capital H, capital
O, and the notion here is that we're going

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:06.660
to be asking artists do many residences and
we're going to be asking

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:12.580
them to say, "Hey, look and work and think
about these ideas of indigenous practices",

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.710
and putting it in front of the kind of situation
where people say

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:20.050
digital media doesn't have to be alienated
and divorced from traditional ecological knowledge.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:22.770
In fact, we're going to be using it as a way
of empowering

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:27.160
people to think about the environment, empowering
people to think about other forms of alternative

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.240
energy like bio fuels, like solar power, and
above all

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.303
looking at ocean currents, wind currents,
stuff like that. So the idea here is that

00:49:35.303 --> 00:49:39.620
art doesn't have to be something that's based
in the now. It can be

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:44.260
something that says another world was possible.
So what I want to do with this evening is

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:48.030
hopefully invoke the idea of an art center,
an art space that says

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:52.981
let's think of the future. Let's think about
art as a way of getting people to think about

00:49:52.981 --> 00:49:57.670
and reframe the relationship to their future
because right now, you

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:06.610
know, it looks pretty freaking grim. So I'm
going to just end this with the Kickstarter

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:11.840
campaign and appeal which is to say this is
a crowd source initiative and it's an art

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.090
project based on this idea of a social sculpture.
It's something that says by participating

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:20.370
in it, you become a stakeholder and by becoming
a stakeholder, you become someone who's an

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:25.960
enabler. Someone who says this is a project
that I value and respect and hopefully participate

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.280
in. So over the next couple of months, we
are going to be doing a series of initiatives

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:35.420
based on bamboo architecture, bamboo design.
And in fact we just had a benefit the other

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:43.360
day and we had a group of people who came
up with this idea of the bamboo bicycle studio

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.190
which is what we're going to be trying to
get some of the guys on the island to check

00:50:47.190 --> 00:51:01.410
out as well. Whoops, okay. [pause] And we
had these guys who are master bicycle builders

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:08.030
come to the event and we're offering for anyone
out there who has been intrigued by the whole

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:16.200
notion is you can see about design and sustainability
very easily and you can see these are bicycles

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:22.070
being made by hand and the bamboo is shaped
and molded, and it's also stronger then steel.

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:27.040
If you treat bamboo correctly, it's actually
easy to manipulate. If you go to Hong Kong

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.990
or Singapore or Shanghai, you can see whole
skyscrapers of bamboo next to it. And by training

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:37.020
people to use sustainable materials and local
materials but in a high tech context, you

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:41.440
get people to feel much more empowered. I
think right now in the West people feel like

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:45.900
technology is beyond them and they are just
kind of passive recipients. With the Tanna

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:50.730
Center for the Arts, we're going to be setting
up a context where people who feel very comfortable

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:56.220
digging in and creating new forms of art based
on sustainable materials. Bamboo is one of

00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:01.480
them but we also think about wind power, solar
power, and other initiatives so we have relationships

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:08.801
with Solar One, we have relationships with
Islandsfirst.org and so on. So what I want

00:52:08.801 --> 00:52:16.440
to do, in some terms of wrapping up, is to
say it's a foundation and we have the, think

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.700
about the titles of the people involved. We
have Janna Olson here who is the Vanuatu Pacifica

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:25.000
Foundation Executive Director and Cultural
and Operational Liaison to the Tanna Center

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.260
for the Arts; there's John in the back; so
she's going to be kind of helping guide the

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:34.810
process through and we have Laura Clemens,
the Director of Development and Strategic

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:39.580
Partnerships; she's here. So you guys can
consider yourselves kind of at the beginning

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:45.750
of an initiative that's going to be looking
at technology and traditional ecological knowledge.

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:48.860
We're going to be building bridges between
cultures rather than building boundaries between

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:53.430
cultures. We're going to be looking at the
idea of not only free and open exchange but

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:58.430
the idea of the gift between cultures. It
means love is received rather than the usual

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:04.370
Western model of just rapacity and taking
everything so from Nauru to Vanuatu hopefully

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:09.360
we won't have an island that looks like this.
We'll have an island that looks a little bit

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:17.310
more like, you know, the voice or something
like that of various new forms of material

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:21.700
coming out, The New Economic Foundation. So
if anybody is in town over the next couple

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:27.540
of days, the TED conference is coming up,
TED Brooklyn and I'm on stage, believe it

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:36.740
or not, with Barbara Bush so to me that is
so mind blowing it's science fictional and

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:41.740
we're going to be having a kind of lingering
debate about some of these issues with, about

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:47.310
sustainability in the arts and saying well
everything Bush; it's a long story. Anyway,

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:51.080
if you're around and if this is one event
that you might enjoy, and we have the mailing

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:56.200
list for the Vanuatu Group through DJ Spooky.com.
That's just my website right here and our

00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:00.490
board for the project, we have people as diverse.
Let me just show you a couple of things and

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:05.110
then I'm going to open up the questions. Let's
say for example our initial benefit event

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:10.260
was hosted by Jimmy Wales, the founder of
Wikipedia. We have Majora Carter who is involved

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:15.600
with quite a bit of really amazing ecological
and environmental issues in the South Bronx.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:20.300
We have Catherine Corman who her father is
Roger Corman and a well renowned filmmaker.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:24.820
She is doing a lot of really interesting stuff
around contemporary art. David Adjaye who

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:30.510
is probably one of Africa's premiere architects.
We have Shep Fairey who did the Obama "Hope"

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:35.290
poster and he's a very renowned graphic designer.
Liam Gillick who is probably one of the top

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:39.910
conceptual artists going right now. Roselee
Goldberg who does performer biennials, one

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:45.110
of the top performance arts biennials in the
country right now. We have Bill T. Jones who

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:51.320
also did the "Fela!" kind of dance piece.
We have Mitchell Joachim who is a renowned

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:58.370
ecological activist and designer. We have
Young Jean Lee who is a very amazing theatre

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:03.700
playwright. Joe Melillo who is head of BAM,
Brooklyn Academy of Music. Meredith Monk.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:11.080
Ravi Naidoo who does this sort of incredible
design conference in South Africa called Design

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:16.400
Indaba which focuses on open source initiatives
throughout Africa. We have Bill Moggridge

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.250
who is essentially the inventor of the laptop
as we know it so we have a pretty heavyweight

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:26.540
group of people and if you scroll down a little
more we have good old, a big hero of mine,

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:31.840
Bruce Sterling, who is a science fiction writer.
Jimmy Wales who started Wikipedia, and Yoko

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:40.100
Ono who's just - well, she's Yoko. So we have
a great group of people on the board for the

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:47.250
foundation and you guys are just essentially
witnessing the absolute first, first tiny

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:51.910
baby steps of the kick off of a new, and I'm
hoping very important, cultural foundation.

00:55:51.910 --> 00:56:00.210
So the artwork outside, I did the coffee prints
and I did the QR prints as well. So I guess

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:04.510
with that said and done, think of the place
as a forum for exchange, an open forum about

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:09.500
open issues and I'm hoping that on one level
or another you guys are inspired enough to

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:14.230
donate to the Tanna Center for Arts. You can
do it through Kickstarter, through your Amazon.com

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:19.400
account. It's really easy and it's fully tax
deductible so that's contemporary art as a

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.000
social sculpture. Thank you.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.080
[applause]

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:31.830
&gt;&gt;Male Narrator: Thank you very much for the
whirlwind tour through all kinds of ideas

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:36.400
and an introduction to your project. So we
do have some time for questions. We have to

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:41.770
be out of the building by 7:30 but Paul's
agreed to take some questions and then we

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:43.300
can - we have some time to look around.

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:47.870
&gt;&gt;Paul Miller: I also have copies of my book
as well if anyone wants to take a glance.

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:52.180
[video sound fades out]

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:58.470
&gt;&gt; Male Audience member: So you mentioned
that [inaudible]

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:00.340
&gt;&gt;Paul Miller: Mm-hmm.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:02.840
&gt;&gt; Male Audience member: [inaudible]

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.330
Paul Miller &gt;&gt; Uh huh.

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:07.830
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: [inaudible]

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:14.170
&gt;&gt;Paul Miller: No, I think the value system,
I'll give a quick summary just in case you

00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:17.030
didn't hear him. He was saying I had brought
some mixes with me and then I started hearing

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:22.790
the mixes being copied and passed around.
While we were there, there's a really interesting

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:26.580
telecom company called Digicel and it's a
Jamaican-Irish company

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:28.720
[laughs]

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.540
that specializes in setting up cell phone
networks in remote islands so while we were

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:37.200
there Digicel set up the first network of
cell phones and we started seeing kids dancing

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.280
to ringtones as they would be walking down
a dusty road in the middle of the island with

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.891
a cell phone that the company was very clever
and gave away a lot of cell phones for free

00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:49.910
to get people into the network. Then they
set up these pay per go plans and stuff like

00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:55.140
that so because they essentially have a subsistence
economy. But if you have a beautiful place

00:57:55.140 --> 00:58:00.080
with plenty of fresh fish, you have free bananas,
free kava roots, and free everything that

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:07.570
you can possibly eat, why do you need to work?
That is not a 9 to 5 kind of grind. So they

00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:11.970
were able to pass ringtones around and stuff
like that and people would gather around.

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:16.610
One of my first meetings when I got back to
Vanuatu this year was we had a meeting with

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:22.010
some of the chiefs in this one area near the
center and I pulled out my cellphone and started

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:26.790
showing them not only about this software,
the deejaying with the phone. So I'm talking

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:30.800
like all the kids gathered around and were
watching because my cell phone was iPhone

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:38.910
and they only have the kind of earlier phones
that are basic so they had never seen an iPhone,

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:44.330
you know? So when I talk about mixes and exchange,
I mean the thing for me is always saying that

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:50.750
these are about the positive effects of scalability.
I say the positive because if you have a negative

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:55.240
feedback loop it means certain things are
kind of, it's not a bad term, it's actually

00:58:55.240 --> 00:59:01.340
a reasonably good term but what ends up happening
with feedback mechanisms and so on is either

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:05.200
people take the music and run with it or they
take the music and say, "This is shit. Fuck

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:10.050
this." You know? So that was a positive situation
to me all puns intended, not only just about

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:17.420
positive feedback mechanisms and so on. So
amplification, there's a style of music there

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:23.760
called string band music that's very popular
but it's very resonate with reggae so I think

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:27.720
that's what ended up happening is people have
a bootleg economy already where they're passing

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:34.420
around mixes and there's all sorts of stuff
going on that people trade, you know, without

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:38.750
the norms of money so it's not necessarily
a paper economy and that's what I wanted to

00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:41.700
kind of get into when I was talking about
mixes and exchange.

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:55.140
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: So you were saying earlier
that [inaudible]

00:59:55.140 --> 01:00:08.000
&gt;&gt;Paul Miller: Right. It's the total flip
side of the capitalist economy. I mean, when

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.820
you think about our Western culture. We derive
value from scarcity and there's a really famous

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:20.080
section of "Wealth of Nations" when Adam Smith
says, "Why is a diamond more expensive then

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.720
water?" Water is precious to life when our
bodies are 92% water but why does somebody

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.320
want some weird stone from the ground, you
know? I mean it's like people go to war over

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:33.700
it, like diamonds and rubies. They'll raid
other villages because you know, if you're

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:38.730
in Congo for example but water, which is precious
to everything we know, they're like, "Ugh,

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:44.350
who cares?" you know? So the value of something
and the scarcity can always be, there's an

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:50.180
eerie correlation and I can say the same thing
about cobalt for example in the Congo which

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:54.150
is a very scarce metal and the same thing
is going on in China with what they call rare

01:00:54.150 --> 01:01:00.870
earths. The more rare something is, the more
we assign value to it and I'm giving a tiny

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:06.350
Economics 101 here, but what I'm doing with
the idea of the "gift economy" is saying that

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:10.441
it's about dematerialization of those values
and saying, "Wait a second. Let's think about

01:01:10.441 --> 01:01:15.440
social capital, cultural capital", which a
lot of people in the West are now studying

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.430
rigorously. Pierre Bourdieu, who is a French
cultural theoretician, and there is an economist

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:24.670
named Raj Patel who has a book called "The
Value of Nothing". It's a really great book

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:29.570
and Naomi Wolfe's whole theory of "Shock Doctrine"
and so on. There's a lot of people trying

01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:37.750
to question why scarcity. Why? The big why
with a capital W and I think there's something

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:42.650
to be said for resetting the idea of values
and that's something I'm really interested

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:48.200
in right now. I wouldn't say it's about storming
Wall Street and saying everything needs to

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.340
be torn down because they're doing it themselves
anyway, you know? It's like, you know, the

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.240
market system as we know with what they call
collateralized debt obligations and the futures

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:03.620
market. Those are just what they call quantitative
methods of creating value out of nothing.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:10.990
I mean, the dollar, it's not based on any
specific gold or anything. It's just electronic

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:17.230
values flying around, zeros and ones. So what
happens if our zeros and ones don't match

01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:22.980
the Vanuatuans zeroes and ones, you know?
I think we operate somewhere in the gap between

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.180
those two economies.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:48.830
&gt;&gt;Female audience member: I have a thought
on [inaudible]

01:02:48.830 --> 01:03:03.290
Paul Miller &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. Well, there's links
on our website where we are sort of showing

01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:07.240
people. I wouldn't say that it's a specific,
because there's a lot of different, like if

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.800
you go to Bhutan for example and what they
call happiness commissions where every project,

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.680
literally every project initiated by people
has to be approved by a happiness commission

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.020
to see if it add happiness and value to the
culture

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.670
[laughs from crowd]
That's serious. I couldn't make this up so

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:26.040
you end up with a happiness bureaucracy which
is not very happy. I think any time you standardize

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.780
stuff - imagine being in Bhutan and you're
like, "I need to grow a new field because

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.160
I need to get whatever", and you have to prove
that the new field and the rice and planting

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.310
the rice would make people more happy. The
question you're asking is how do measure.

01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:43.890
The metrics are very ambiguous. I mean, the
metrics of how we quantify the idea of consumerism.

01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:48.510
The western model has always been based on
what they call the rational consumer. If you

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:52.730
put enough bananas on a table, how much will
people pay for that? Now the rational consumer

01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:57.650
will only pay as much as they blah, blah;
everything outside of that is what they call

01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:02.730
an opportunity cost or this or that and the
economic impact of if actually takes all the

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:06.330
bananas and leaves Jill with no bananas, you
know? It's one of those weird Economic 101

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:12.400
kind of things where if you give Jill two
bananas and you have three bananas then the

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:18.760
value is somewhere between those two and three
bananas. So in Vanuatu what I noticed is that

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:25.950
a lot of the issues are around trade and commerce
just for goods that people all have. So if

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:30.060
you have a plot of land with several coconuts
and your neighbor has several coconuts and

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.190
you need some kava, you're like, "Look, alright.
I'll give you a certain amount of coconuts",

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:37.640
or something like that. It's back to old school
but it's very complex and I like that in a

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.250
way, you know?

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:49.630
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: I wanted to pose
a question of [inaudible].

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:52.450
&gt;&gt;Paul Miller: Right. These are, she was saying
she'd read the Wikipedia entry on Vanuatu

01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:58.660
which is exactly eerily precise. Whoever did
the crowd sourcing of the wiki for Vanuatu

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:05.370
is pretty good. You're right. They, like any
other culture, are facing a lot of complex

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:11.310
issues and they're remote so these are things
that are not just part of the core of places

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:17.750
like India or China where overpopulation is
massive and degradation of resources is happening.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:23.040
It's just they're slightly later on the curve.
They are more of the ripple effect of this

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.350
massive hyper urbanization that's been going
on. This is all stuff that they're probably

01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:33.730
going to be facing over the next 20 years
rather than the last 20 years like China and

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:39.020
India. I'm hoping we can use the center as
a place of showing and also learning from

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:43.840
some of their tradition of saying they've
had stability and peace and whatever you want

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:49.160
to call it, that kind of equilibrium, for
hundreds and hundreds of years. Why haven't

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:54.280
they had major genocidal wars? Why haven't
they had in a way all the things that the

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:58.800
West has gone through? One could argue because
there's enough space. If you don't like this

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.980
one tribe, you can go to the next island over
or you know there's plenty of arguments if

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:08.000
you look at the anthropological history, different
cultures in conflict. You're talking about

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.690
overpopulation and that leads to war, leads
to competition for resources, it leads to

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:18.200
a lot of things that usually cause massive
friction, right? So I'm intrigued by the human

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:24.650
dynamics and the idea of social dynamics in
general. We have a lot to learn. We're starting

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:30.940
this foundation based on, it's like I just
feel like I've just leaped into the air and

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:37.570
who's like waiting to see what I would hit.
Luckily a lot of people caught us with the

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:42.540
Kickstarter campaign. But at the end of the
day you're right. It's overpopulation is going

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:47.170
to be a factor down the line. Right now, there's
a lot of open land and people are kind of,

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:52.100
there's land in dispute everywhere because
they still don't have our notions of Western

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:56.660
ideas of sequestering a land and blocking
off and destroying the common. That's what

01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:01.480
happened with a lot of the West. The commons,
if you look at the tragedy of the commons,

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:07.810
that's a very famous term from the late 60's.
There are places like Ireland where the English

01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:12.370
landlords cleared everyone out just for farming
for sheep and then caused this huge starvation

01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:15.921
and all this stuff. Nothing like that has
happened there. They are like, "Hey, we all

01:07:15.921 --> 01:07:24.330
are here. We'll work things out." So there's
a lot of ambiguous negotiation of this social

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:28.250
space of economics but I like what you did.
The fact that you brought up Joseph Beuys

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:33.260
who is a big influence on the project. The
idea of a social sculpture and yeah, Rirkrit

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:40.990
Tiravanija. I always, Tira the Ninja, thank
you and there's a lot of other artists who've

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:45.380
done land projects like Paolo Soleri with
the Arcosanti project and architecture. We're

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:49.960
going to be looking at bamboo as a kind of
core component of the project so all of these

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.830
things are things we're thinking about and
we're going to be learning as we go. I'm not

01:07:52.830 --> 01:08:22.460
walking with any fixed formula. The idea is
to learn and to evolve the project as it goes.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:28.370
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: It's great that
you've gotten to [inaudible] insert and ecological

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.370
context, [inaudible].

01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:32.670
&gt;&gt;Paul Miller: Well, I mean, there's something
to be said about the way the West goes about

01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:39.410
lecturing people and I want to be cautious
about going into another culture and saying

01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:44.280
you should do this and you should do that.
Birth control is always a very touchy topic.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.930
I mean it reaches to the core of how people
live.

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:50.270
&gt;&gt;Female audience member: It's global healthcare.

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:54.850
&gt;&gt;Paul Miller: Yeah, healthcare and so on.
We're not a hospital. I mean, we are going

01:08:54.850 --> 01:09:00.440
to be doing a lot of creative initiatives
but I do want to differentiate us from Doctors

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:09.480
without Borders and stuff like that. I mean,
there's a lot to be said for the medical needs

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.930
of the population as well. In a certain sense,
art, why art at all, you know? The people

01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:20.140
have needs. They need a lot of attention for
other projects and situations. They need roads,

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:25.710
they need infrastructure and so on. In the
face of that art seems like this very fragile

01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:30.580
and tenuous thing for them but at the same
time I think it's ever more important to give

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:35.260
people a sense of a different perspective
on things, a different frame, a different

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:44.180
ideological kind of lens to view things through.
If that is, it's not an either or. It's not

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:48.740
like bread and butter versus culture and butter,
more like having them all. I think one leads

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:53.339
to the other. So I think we have time for
a couple more questions.

01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:59.560
&gt;&gt; Male Narrator: Well, just one quick question
and then we need to start packing up. Anyone?

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:05.610
&gt;&gt;Paul Miller: Well, what I want to do say
is that if you have a secondary follow-up

01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:10.270
question, you can go by the website. It's
DJSpooky.com. There's a button that says "Contact"

01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:14.330
and I'm a hardcore e-mailer and that goes
to our team but I just would love to encourage

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:20.030
everyone to please think about donating to
the cause and it's fully tax deductible. I

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:26.350
mean, $20.00 for your dinner or $30.00 for
your dinner is subway fare or something. So

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:32.400
if you're interested it's through the Kickstarter
campaign and it's a fun and interesting project

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:37.800
you can watch evolve over the next two years,
three years, four years, twenty years. I have

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.101
copies of my book here and I also brought
some stickers that I'm giving away for free,

01:10:41.101 --> 01:10:47.950
stickers for this project called "Copyright
Criminals". I have other freebies if you guys

01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:53.030
are interested but yeah, come on up and check
out the books and stuff like that.

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:54.030
[applause]

01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:59.960
&gt;&gt; Male Narrator: Thank you very much. [inaudible]
Thank you.
