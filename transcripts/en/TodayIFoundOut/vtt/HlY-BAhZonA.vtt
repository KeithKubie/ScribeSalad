00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.460
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.970
In the video today, we're looking at why some
devices have two-prong plugs and others have

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.250
three.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.940
To provide a source of power, electricity
must flow in a circuit.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.300
(Although, you might be surprised to learn
the net velocity of the flow of the electrons

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.449
is actually quite a bit slower than a turtle,
which you can learn all about in this video.)

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.140
In a typical American outlet, the circuit
is comprised of a right vertical slot connected

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.550
to the “hot” wire and a larger left vertical
slot connected to the “neutral” wire.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.730
The plugged in device itself (the load) completes
the circuit, with power flowing through it.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.610
So what’s the third prong needed for then?

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.490
This third prong is the ground.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.870
Both the neutral and the ground are connected
to an earth ground in the main breaker box

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.870
in your home.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.060
The difference between the two is that the
neutral completes a circuit with the hot wire

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.680
and normally carries some amount of current
(which is why it’s insulated), while the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.010
ground does not normally carry any current
whatsoever and is not connected to the circuit

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.309
at all (unless something has gone wrong).

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.930
It simply is used to connect the external
conductive parts of the device to the earth

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.309
and, thus, in normal operation is completely
unnecessary.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.520
This is why you can use a 3-prong to 2-prong
plug adapter to bypass having to use the ground

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.090
line and the device will still work just fine.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.810
So why have both a neutral and a ground when
they both ultimately just tie to the earth

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.979
ground bar in the main breaker box?

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.909
Among a few other benefits, this is primarily
so that if something should go awry with the

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.840
device, like a stray hot or neutral wire coming
into contact with the outer conductive parts

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.340
of the device (for instance, if the insulation
wears away or a wire comes loose), you don’t

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.660
die or get seriously injured if you touch
the device and it’s plugged in.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.799
You see, absent a separate ground in such
a malfunction, once you touched the conductive

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.700
bits of the device, you may become the path
to ground and a surge of electricity would

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.180
flow through you until ultimately tripping
the breaker in your breaker box.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.560
With the separate ground, the electricity
simply surges through that wire until the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.159
breaker is tripped, cutting off power to that
line when the surge is detected.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.380
This not only helps to ensure you don’t
get shocked, but also reduces the chances

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.729
of a fire starting due to the short via making
sure the breaker is tripped immediately after

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.829
the short happens.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.869
So what about the devices that lack this third
ground prong?

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.170
How is this safe?

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.829
They (usually) have at least two layers of
insulation between the conductive components

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.410
of the device and any part of the device you
can touch.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.360
To achieve this cheaply, the outer casing
of these devices are often made entirely of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.560
plastic or some other non-conductive material.
