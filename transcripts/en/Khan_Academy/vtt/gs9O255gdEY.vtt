00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.800
- [Voiceover] Let's explore
the infinite series.

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.134
We're going to start at n equals one,

00:00:06.368 --> 00:00:10.600
and go to infinity of
negative one to the n plus one

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:14.166
over n squared, which is
going to be equal to ...

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.801
Let's see, when n is one,
this is going to be positive.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.167
It's going to be one.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.967
This, you go minus one over two squares,

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:22.200
is minus 1/4

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.200
plus 1/9

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:28.333
minus 1/16

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:30.434
plus 1/25 ...

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.100
I'm actually going to go pretty far ...

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.470
Minus 1/36,

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:37.668
plus 1/49,

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.269
minus 1/64.

00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:42.877
Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:43.434
I'll stop there.

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:45.633
Of course, we keep going on and on and on,

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.105
and it's an alternating
series, plus, minus,

00:00:48.105 --> 00:00:50.666
just keeps going on and
on and on and on forever.

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.366
Now, we know from previous tests,

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.500
in fact, the alternating series test,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.104
that this satisfies the constraints

00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:59.766
of the alternating series test,

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.466
and we're able to show that it converges.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.900
What we're doing now is,
actually trying to estimate

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.533
what things converge to.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.466
We want to estimate
what this value, S, is.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.766
We're going to do that by doing

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.233
a finite number of calculations,

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:18.000
by not having to add this
entire thing together.

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:20.433
Let's estimate it by taking, let's say,

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:22.533
the partial sum of the first four terms.

00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:26.133
Let's take these four
terms right over here.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.933
Let's call that, that's
going to be S sub four.

00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:31.700
Then you're going to have a remainder,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.000
which is going to be everything else.

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:34.570
All of this other stuff,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.133
I don't want even the brackets to end.

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.133
That's going to be your remainder,

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:42.000
the remainder, to get
to your actually sum,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.433
or whatever's left over

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:45.300
when you just take the first four terms.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.269
This is from the fifth term
all the way to infinity.

00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:49.766
We've seen this before.

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:52.466
The actual sum is going to
be equal to this partial sum

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.466
plus this remainder.

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:56.534
Well, we can calculate this.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.033
This is going to be, let's see ...

00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.933
Common denominator here,

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:02.866
see, nine times 16 is 144.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.666
That's going to be 144,

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:10.966
and then that's going
to be 144 minus 36/144,

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:16.666
plus 16/144, minus 9/144.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.700
Let's see, that is 144,
negative 36 plus 16

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.666
is minus 20, so it's
124 minus nine, is 115.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.100
This is all going to be

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.966
equal to 115/144.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:33.469
I didn't even need a
calculator to figure that out.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.666
Plus some remainder.

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:38.333
Plus some remainder.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.200
So, if we could figure out
some bounds on this remainder,

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:47.433
we will figure out the
bounds on our actual sum.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.900
We'll be able to figure out,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.133
"Well, how far is this away
from this right over here?"

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.833
There's two ways to think about it.

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:57.733
Let's look at it.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.567
The first thing I want to see is,

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:03.433
I want to show you that this
remainder right over here

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.866
is definitely going to be positive.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:07.966
I actually encourage
you to pause the video

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:09.966
and see if you can prove to yourself

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:11.900
that this remainder over here

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.600
is definitely going to be positive.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.766
I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.066
Let's write the remainder down.

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:22.300
Actually, I'll just write it ...

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.066
Actually, I'll write it up here.

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:29.503
R sub four is 1/25.

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:32.966
Actually, I don't even have
to write it separately.

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:34.900
I could show you in just right over here

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.533
that this is going to be positive.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.700
How do I show that?

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.066
Well, we just pair ...

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.933
Let's just put some parentheses in here,

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:43.066
and just pair these terms like this.

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:46.000
1/25 minus 1/36.

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.466
1/36th is less than 1/25.

00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:50.400
This one's positive, this one's negative.

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:52.266
So this is positive.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:53.733
Then you have a positive term.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.666
Subtracting from that,
a smaller negative term.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.933
So this is going to be positive.

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:01.233
So, if you just pair all these terms up,

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:02.833
you're just going to have a whole series

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:05.066
of positive terms.

00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:07.900
Just like that, we have established

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.033
that R sub four, or R
four, we could call it,

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:14.733
is going to be greater than zero.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.533
R four is going to be greater than zero.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.833
Now, the other thing I
want to prove is that

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.166
this remainder is going to be

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:28.200
less than the first term
that we haven't calculated,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.400
that the remainder is
going to be less than 1/25.

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:34.100
Once again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.833
and see if you can put
some parentheses here

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:38.501
in a certain way that will convince you

00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.100
that this entire infinite sum here,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.966
this remainder, is going to sum up

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:45.666
to something that's less
than this first term.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.133
Once again, I'm assuming
you've had a go at it,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.400
so let's just write it down.

00:04:51.662 --> 00:04:53.000
I'll do that same pink color.

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:56.433
Our remainder, when we
take the partial sum

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:57.733
of the first four terms,

00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.533
it's 1/25.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.100
The way I'm going to write it,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.101
instead of writing minus 1/36,

00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:04.301
I'm going to write minus,

00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.700
I'm going to put the parentheses now

00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:08.000
around the second and third terms.

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:12.866
This is going to be 1/36 minus 1/49.

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:14.900
Then we're going to have

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.900
minus 1/64 minus ...

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:21.033
Actually, the next terms is going to be

00:05:21.033 --> 00:05:23.933
one over nine squared, 1/81.

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:27.079
Then minus, and we keep going like that,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.200
on and on and on, on
and on and on, forever.

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:31.866
Now, notice what happens.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.000
This, this term right over here

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.600
is positive.

00:05:37.433 --> 00:05:39.900
We have a smaller number

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.533
being subtracted from a larger number.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.466
This term right over here is positive.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.666
We're staring with 1/25,

00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:48.100
and then we're subtracting

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.600
a bunch of positive things from it.

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:55.400
This thing has to be less than 1/25.

00:05:56.367 --> 00:06:01.133
R sub four is going to be less than 1/25.

00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:04.700
Or, we could even write that as R sub four

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.066
is less than 0.04.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.933
0.04, same things as 1/25.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.233
Actually, this logic right over here

00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:18.766
is the basis for the proof of
the alternating series test.

00:06:18.766 --> 00:06:20.402
This should make you feel pretty good,

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:22.367
that, "Hey, look, this
thing is going to be

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:23.969
"greater than zero,"

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.600
and it's increasing, the more
terms that you add to it.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.867
But it's bounded from above.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.133
It's bounded from above at 1/25,

00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:34.367
which is a pretty good sense that hey,

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:35.433
this thing is going to converge.

00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:36.633
But that's not what we're going to

00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:37.967
concern ourselves with here.

00:06:37.967 --> 00:06:39.600
Here, we just care about this range.

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:42.333
The sum is the sum of these two things.

00:06:42.842 --> 00:06:46.700
So the entire sum is going to be

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.700
less than 115/144

00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:55.535
plus the upper bound on R four.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.805
Plus 0.04, and it's
going to be greater than,

00:07:01.368 --> 00:07:04.333
it's going to be greater than,

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.666
it's going to be greater than
our partial sum plus zero,

00:07:09.034 --> 00:07:11.200
because this remainder is
definitely greater than zero.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.110
You could just say,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.000
it's going to be greater
than our partial sum.

00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:16.233
And just like that,

00:07:16.233 --> 00:07:18.867
just doing a calculation that
I was able to do with hand,

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:21.100
we're able to get pretty nice bounds

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.000
around this infinite series.

00:07:23.233 --> 00:07:24.533
Infinite series.

00:07:25.171 --> 00:07:26.634
Let's now get the calculator out,

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:28.533
just to get a little bit
better sense of things.

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:32.933
If we say 115 divided by 144,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.200
that's .79861 repeating.

00:07:37.566 --> 00:07:42.566
This is 0.79861 repeating,

00:07:44.038 --> 00:07:46.066
is less than S,

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.333
which is less than this thing plus .04.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.033
Let me write that down.

00:07:53.448 --> 00:07:58.448
Plus .04 gets us to .83861 repeating,

00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:02.333
83861 repeating.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.400
Actually, I could have
done that in my head.

00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:06.133
I don't know why I
resorted to a calculator.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.403
0.83861 repeating.

00:08:12.788 --> 00:08:13.433
And just like that,

00:08:13.433 --> 00:08:16.633
just a calculation we're
able to do by hand,

00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:17.700
we were able to come up

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.366
with a pretty good approximation for S.

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.900
And the big takeaway from here ...

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.833
We're going to build on this,

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:26.105
but this was really to
give you the intuition

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:27.433
with a very concrete example,

00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:29.900
is when you have an
alternating series like this,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.300
the type of alternating
series that satisfies

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.700
the alternating series test,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.700
where you can write it
as negative one to the n,

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.166
or negative one to the n plus one,

00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:40.766
times a series of positive terms

00:08:40.766 --> 00:08:43.368
that are decreasing and
whose limits go to zeros

00:08:43.368 --> 00:08:44.666
and approaches infinity,

00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:46.833
not only do those things,

00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:48.666
not only do those things converge,

00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:51.303
but you can estimate your error

00:08:51.303 --> 00:08:54.700
based on the first term
that you're not including.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.566
Now, this was one example.

00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:58.100
It's going to be different depending on

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.535
whether the first term
is negative or positive,

00:09:00.566 --> 00:09:01.433
and we're going to have to introduce

00:09:01.433 --> 00:09:03.533
the idea of absolute value
there, the magnitude.

00:09:03.706 --> 00:09:05.500
But the big takeaway here is

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.767
that the magnitude of
your error is going to be

00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:13.767
no more than the magnitude
of the first term

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.733
that you're not including
in your partial sum.
