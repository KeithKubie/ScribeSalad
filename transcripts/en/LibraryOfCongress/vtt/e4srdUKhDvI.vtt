WHAT A GOOD FORTUNE IT WAS FOR 

00:11:13.058 --> 00:11:15.942
ME TO SPEND TIME WITH BOB OVER 
THE LAST YEARS.

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:20.661
DURING A VISIT TO THE LIBRARY, 
MY PARTNER AND I HAD A SMALL 

00:11:21.023 --> 00:11:26.716

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.603
TO THE MOST REMARKABLE AND I AM 
GUESSING UNDOCUMENTED STORY 

00:11:42.815 --> 00:11:49.397
ABOUT THIS COMMISSION.
BOB SAID THAT HE RARELY ACCEPTED

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:54.434
 PORTRAIT COMMISSIONS BUT HE 
MADE AN EXCEPTION FOR 

00:11:54.729 --> 00:12:01.481
VANDERBILT.
HE DID THE PORTRAIT AND IT WAS 

00:12:01.705 --> 00:12:05.052
REALLY QUITE AN EXTRA ORDINARY 
PORTRAIT.

00:12:05.053 --> 00:12:08.480
THE PRESS OF TIME STOPS ME FROM 
ANNOUNCING THE WHOLE STORY.

00:12:08.481 --> 00:12:11.612
BUT I WILL LEAVE A VERY, VERY 
WARM MEMORY OF BOB.

00:12:11.613 --> 00:12:13.613
NOW IT'S

00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:20.813
  MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME THE

[APPLAUSE].
SPEAKER:  GOOD AFTERNOON.

00:12:26.028 --> 00:12:30.576
IT'S AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE FOR
 ME TO BE HERE TODAY.

00:12:30.577 --> 00:12:38.139
I AM PLEASED THAT THE LIBRARY OF
 CONGRESS IS NOW ENTRUSTED WITH 

00:12:40.081 --> 00:12:46.666
THE PRESERVATION AND THE LEAD OF
 THE COLLECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

00:12:47.408 --> 00:12:52.805
IN HIS OWN WORDS, LIFE'S WORK IS
 ABOUT THE WINNING AND THE 

00:12:53.043 --> 00:12:55.663
DIVERSE SOCIAL CONCEIVED IN 
AMERICA.

00:12:55.664 --> 00:13:01.714
POSITIVE AILMENTS, ALCOHOLISM 
AND ADEQUATE COVER, THE 

00:13:02.192 --> 00:13:05.869
IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE.
AND THIS COLLECTION IS SO 

00:13:06.264 --> 00:13:09.219
MARVELOUSLY DOCUMENTS THE 
STRUGGLE TO OVERCOME RACIAL 

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.953
DISCRIMINATION AND LIKE SO MANY 

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:21.329
OTHER AMERICANS, I WAS IN 
BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA IN 1963, 

00:13:21.861 --> 00:13:26.946
WHEN THE POLICE TOOK THE FIRE 
HOSES TO PUSH BACK AFRICAN 

00:13:27.135 --> 00:13:30.565
AMERICANS AND DENIED CIVIL 
RIGHTS.

00:13:30.566 --> 00:13:34.680
AND THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT WAS 
THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO 

00:13:35.524 --> 00:13:39.028
READ THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
AND AS I SAID, THE FIRE HOSES 

00:13:39.424 --> 00:13:41.911
WERE BRUTAL.
THEY RIPPED THE BARK FROM THE 

00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:44.371
TREES.
AND NEVERTHELESS, THE PEOPLE 

00:13:44.664 --> 00:13:49.160
HELD ONTO ONE ANOTHER AND WERE 
ABLE TO RESIST.

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:57.276
AND IMAGES WERE USED TO PROMOTE 
AND DIDN'T THINK ABOUT DR. KING 

00:13:57.413 --> 00:14:05.544
AND THE MESSAGE THAT IT'S NOT IN
 A WORLD BUT COME THROUGH.

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:09.827
I WAS PERSONALLY STRUCK BY HIS 
OWN MESSAGE THAT PHOTOGRAPHY, 

00:14:10.187 --> 00:14:15.021
AND HIS PHOTOGRAPHY WAS NOT ONLY
 QUOTE TELLING THE TRUTH.

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:20.804
BUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
AND IN HIS OWN WORDS, IT WAS A 

00:14:21.158 --> 00:14:24.462
CONSTANT EFFORT, NOT ONLY TO 
DOCUMENT WHAT I WAS SEEING, BUT 

00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:26.719
TO FIGURE OUT

00:14:29.594 --> 00:14:36.845
 HOW TO CHANGE IT.
THE MAN'S CONSTANT EFFORT AND 

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.589
DILIGENCE WHICH IS WHY THE 
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS IS SO PROUD 

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.787
TO PRESERVE HIS WORK AND 
COLLECTION FOR FUTURE 

00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:45.033

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[APPLAUSE].

00:27:53.487 --> 00:27:55.996
SPEAKER:  THAT WAS REMARKABLE.
THANK YOU.

00:27:55.997 --> 00:27:56.730
AND I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF

00:27:56.731 --> 00:28:03.512
 YOU VISIT THE PHOTOGRAPH OR THE
 BOOKS THIS AFTERNOON, I THINK 

00:28:03.513 --> 00:28:08.599
YOU WILL SEE THE WHOLE ALPHABET 
COMING TO LIFE VISUALLY.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.316
WE HAVE THREE OTHER SPEAKERS 
THAT AFTERNOON.

00:28:10.317 --> 00:28:12.787
I'LL ASK IF YOU CAN COME UP ON 
THE STAGE AND EACH

00:28:16.468 --> 00:28:23.058
 TAKE A CHAIR.
BEGINNING WITH JIM ESTRIN.

00:28:23.059 --> 00:28:26.172
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 
ALL OF THE INTRODUCTIONS IN ONE 

00:28:26.454 --> 00:28:28.884
FELL SWEEP.
AND THEN WE CAN SETTLE IN TO 

00:28:29.237 --> 00:28:33.701
HEAR THE TALKS.
SO JIM ESTRIN IS A PHOTOGRAPHER 

00:28:33.844 --> 00:28:37.613
HIMSELF AND BEGAN WORKING WITH 
THE NEW YORK TIMES IN THE 1980s 

00:28:37.902 --> 00:28:40.975
AND HE ALSO FOUNDED THE NEW YORK
 TIMES PHOTOGRAPHY BLOG WHICH IS

00:28:41.497 --> 00:28:47.663
 CALLED "THE LENS" SO WE'RE 
GOING TO GO BACK AND FORTH THIS 

00:28:48.113 --> 00:28:51.706
AFTERNOON.
IN 2014, ACTUALLY EARLIER, BUT 

00:28:51.924 --> 00:28:53.924
THEN IN 2014, INTERVIEWED

00:28:55.948 --> 00:28:59.283
 BOB ADELMAN AT LENGTH AND IT 
WAS PUBLISHED AS A BLOG POST AND

00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:03.129
 IT WAS CALLED PHOTOGRAPHS THAT 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:07.968
JIM IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT US 
ABOUT BOB'S CAREER AND WORK IN 

00:29:08.464 --> 00:29:13.255
RELATION TO AMERICA'S SOCIAL 
JUSTICE AND PHOTOGRAPHY OVERALL.

00:29:13.558 --> 00:29:16.380
VERNA CURTIS WILL SPEAK SECOND.
RETIRED LAST YEAR AS A WONDERFUL

00:29:17.027 --> 00:29:25.600
 CURATOR PHOTOGRAPHY IN PRINTS 
AND PHOTOGRAPH DIVISION HERE AT 

00:29:25.917 --> 00:29:29.926
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
HE NOT ONLY FOUND BOB ADELMAN IN

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:34.392
 WASHINGTON BUT ALSO THROUGH 
HOMETOWN TERRITORY IN MIAMI 

00:29:34.713 --> 00:29:36.713
BEACH FLORIDA.
WITH MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF 

00:29:37.032 --> 00:29:40.178
EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELDS OF BOTH
 ART AND DOCUMENTARY 

00:29:40.383 --> 00:29:45.995
PHOTOGRAPHY, VERNA IS IDEAL TO 
HELP DIG DEEP INTO BOB'S IMAGES 

00:29:45.996 --> 00:29:50.828
AND SHOW HOW THEY FIT WITH OTHER
 COLLECTIONS AT THE LIBRARY OF 

00:29:51.612 --> 00:29:53.646
CONGRESS.
THE THIRD SPEAKER IS ANN 

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:59.197
BEATTIE, AUTHOR OF NOVELS AND 
SHORT STORIES AND I HAVE READ 

00:29:59.457 --> 00:30:05.338
THAT SHE HAS BEEN A PAL OF BOBS.
I WILL MAKE THAT MORE FORMAL, A 

00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:08.610
LONG-TIME FRIEND.
AND ANN IS HERE TODAY AS ONE OF 

00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:15.379
BOB'S CLOSE FRIENDS.
SHE REJECTED BOB'S REQUEST TO 

00:30:15.592 --> 00:30:17.484
PHOTOGRAPH PEOPLE IN HER OWN 
PLACES AND STORIES.

00:30:17.485 --> 00:30:20.714
BUT HAS WRITTEN ABOUT HIS 
AMAZING WORK WITH LOVE AND 

00:30:20.971 --> 00:30:22.971
AFFECTION.
AND

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.070
 JIM, YOU'RE UP.

00:30:33.045 --> 00:30:34.835
SPEAKER:  WHEN I WAS ASKED -- 
EXCUSE ME.

00:30:34.836 --> 00:30:40.062
WHEN I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT 
BOB ADELMAN, MY FIRST THOUGHT 

00:30:40.407 --> 00:30:42.109
WAS I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HIM 
THAT WELL.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:48.878
I HAD MET HIM A FEW TIMES.
AND I HAVE INTERVIEWED HIM 

00:30:49.044 --> 00:30:50.942
TWICE.
BUT THE TOTAL REFLECTION, I 

00:30:50.943 --> 00:30:53.288
REALIZED THAT I DID KNOW HIM 
WELL.

00:30:53.289 --> 00:30:55.431
AND IT WAS MAINLY THROUGH HIS 
PHOTOGRAPHS.

00:30:55.432 --> 00:31:01.894
HIS IMAGES AFFECTED ME AS A 
YOUNG CHILD LOOKING AT THE PAGES

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:07.127
 OF LIFE MAGAZINE.
THEY AFFECTD ME AS A YOUNG 

00:31:07.543 --> 00:31:08.963
PHOTOGRAPHER FORMING MY OWN PATH
 IN THE FIELD.

00:31:08.964 --> 00:31:12.938
AND THEY CONTINUE TO AFFECT ME 
TODAY AS A TESTAMENT TO WHAT 

00:31:13.191 --> 00:31:14.006
COULD HAPPEN WHEN WHEN PEOPLE

00:31:14.007 --> 00:31:21.265
 STAND UP AGAINST INJUSTICE.
BOB'S PHOTOS WERE ALWAYS HONEST 

00:31:21.641 --> 00:31:24.444
AND PASSIONATE.
AS A PHOTOGRAPHER, HE WORE HIS 

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.979
HEART ON HIS SLEEVE.
AND PHOTO THE SIDE OF THE 

00:31:31.192 --> 00:31:33.403
ANGELS.
AS A JOURNALIST, I ALWAYS WANTED

00:31:33.755 --> 00:31:35.755
 MY

00:31:36.874 --> 00:31:38.812
 IMAGES TO AFFECT THE SITUATIONS
 I DOCUMENT.

00:31:38.813 --> 00:31:43.955
AND WHEN I GOT OLDER, BECAME 
MORE HABITIOUS WITH THE DIGITAL 

00:31:45.089 --> 00:31:46.515
REVOLUTION.
AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW 

00:31:46.516 --> 00:31:54.692
SITUATIONS WHERE A PHOTO MAKES A
 DIFFERENCE THAT IS MEASURABLE.

00:31:55.195 --> 00:31:58.718
PHOTOS OF YOUNG CHILDREN THAT 
HELPED CHANGE LABOR LAWS.

00:31:58.719 --> 00:32:08.485
AND PERHAPS EDDIE ADAMS PHOTO OF
 THE EXECUTION HELP GALVANIZED 

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.300
FOR THE VIETNAM WAR.
A FEW PHOTOED S

00:32:13.993 --> 00:32:18.404
  IN MY CAREER DREW ATTENTION.
NOT SO MUCH.

00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:24.820
COVERED MORE FAMINE AND 
INJUSTICE AND THERE WAS STILL AS

00:32:25.778 --> 00:32:28.697
 MUCH FAMILIES IN JUSTICE THAN 
WHEN WE STARTED.

00:32:28.698 --> 00:32:31.796
SO I HAVE COME TO THE 
CONCLUSION, THAT FOR ME IT IS 

00:32:31.797 --> 00:32:36.046
ENOUGH THAT IF I DOCUMENT THOSE 
TERRIBLE THINGS AND PEOPLE SEE 

00:32:36.291 --> 00:32:41.185
THEM, AT LEAST THEY CANNOT SAY 
THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS 

00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:44.602
HAPPENING.
AND CAME WITH THAT.

00:32:44.603 --> 00:32:50.078
MOST OLDER PHOTOGRAPHERS I HAVE 
INTERVIEWED FOR THE LENS BLOG 

00:32:50.729 --> 00:32:55.236
HAVE THE LACK OF AFFECT THAT THE
 PHOTOS HAVE.

00:32:55.237 --> 00:32:58.472
IMAGES WERE SEEN AROUND THE 
WORLD AND SAID TO ME FLAT OUT, 

00:32:59.006 --> 00:33:03.595
HE FEELS HE WASTED HIS LIFE.
AND WHEN I SPOKE WITH BOB 

00:33:05.065 --> 00:33:07.065
ADELMAN, HE SAID OF COURSE 

00:33:07.626 --> 00:33:09.626
PHOTOS CHANGE THINGS.
HE NOTED THAT GARY 

00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:14.763
WILLOWGRAD THE STREET 
PHOTOGRAPHER ONCE SAID THAT 

00:33:14.764 --> 00:33:20.542
FOLKS DON'T CHANGE THINGS.
BOB WHO WAS IN THE 80s AT THE 

00:33:20.776 --> 00:33:22.776
TIME SAID QUOTE THAT'S THE THE  
THE SILLIEST

00:33:23.103 --> 00:33:30.141
 THING HE HAS EVER HEARD.
BOB'S PHOTOS SHOWED CIVIL

00:33:34.616 --> 00:33:36.001
 RIGHTS.
OKAY.

00:33:36.002 --> 00:33:38.002
OKAY.
BOB'S PHOTOS AND THOSE

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:45.699
 OF HIS FELLOW CIVIL RIGHTS 
PHOTOGRAPHERS CLEARLY DID HELP 

00:33:46.055 --> 00:33:48.697
STATUTES.
THEY HELPED CHANGE THOSE LAWS BY

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.248
 EXPOSING THE HIDEOUS NATURE OF 
RACIAL SEGREGATION AND TURNING 

00:33:53.778 --> 00:33:55.778
AMERICAN OPINION

00:33:57.343 --> 00:34:00.872
 AGAINST IT.
HE TOLD MAGAZINE IN 2014, IN THE

00:34:01.591 --> 00:34:05.007
 PROFOUND SENSE WE DON'T REALIZE
 HOW SEGREGATION WAS UGLY

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:11.465
 AND UN-AMERICAN.
THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE THE 

00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:14.967
EVIDENCE.
BOB'S IMAGES WERE BORN OUT OF AN

00:34:14.968 --> 00:34:16.712
 OPTIMISM.
THEY ARE THE BELIEF THAT THE 

00:34:16.713 --> 00:34:21.140
AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE CONFRONTED 
WITH THE SCOPE OF RACIAL 

00:34:21.633 --> 00:34:25.197
INJUSTICES AND WOULD SUPPORT THE
 MOVEMENT'S GOALS.

00:34:25.198 --> 00:34:28.324
IT'S AN OPTIMISM THAT BOB 
CONTINUED TO DISPLAY IN HIS 

00:34:28.672 --> 00:34:30.875
LATER WORK IN COMMUNITIES IN 
NEED.

00:34:30.876 --> 00:34:35.795
AND BOB WAS NOT JUST A 
DOCUMENTARIAN OF THE CIVIL 

00:34:37.104 --> 00:34:39.104
RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
IT WAS A PASSIONATE PARTICIPANT.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:42.540
HE WAS A VOLUNTEER FOR CORE.
THE CONGRESS OF RACIAL

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.330
 EQUALITY.
AND SNICK, THE STUDENT 

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.619
NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING 
COMMITTEE.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.494
HE WON THE TRUST OF MOVING AND 
GAVE HIM A CERTAIN KIND OF 

00:34:57.355 --> 00:35:00.732
ACCESS THAT RESULTED IN KNOWING 
AN INSIDER VIEW OF THE MOVEMENT.

00:35:02.054 --> 00:35:06.699
HIS INTIMATE IMAGES WERE 
INSTRUMENTAL IN PUTTING THE 

00:35:07.459 --> 00:35:11.487
MESSAGE OF EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL 
FORWARD AT THE TIME.

00:35:11.488 --> 00:35:14.041
TODAY THEY'RE USEFUL FOR 
UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITIES 

00:35:14.363 --> 00:35:19.759
OF WHAT MADE THE MOVEMENT TICK 
AND HOW THE LEADERS PRESENTED 

00:35:20.147 --> 00:35:30.033
THEMSELVES PUBLICLY.
HAS TASKED ME WITH TRYING TO 

00:35:30.184 --> 00:35:35.312
LABEL BOB'S PHOTOS IN THE 
PHOTOGRAPHY WORLD IN A 

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:38.334
COMPREHENSIVE MATTER.
AND I THINK WHAT SETS HIM APART 

00:35:38.576 --> 00:35:40.956
IS THE RESPECT THAT BOB HAD FOR 
HIS SUBJECTS.

00:35:40.957 --> 00:35:43.596
MANY OF THE OTHER WHITE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO MADE IMPORTANT

00:35:44.181 --> 00:35:45.972
 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE 
DOCUMENTATION OF THE CIVIL  

00:35:45.973 --> 00:35:47.973
RIGHTS  RIGHTS MOVEMENT, BUT TOO
 MANY OF

00:35:50.874 --> 00:35:56.927
 THEM PORTRAYED THEIR SUBJECTS 
AS SYMBOLS OF OPPRESSION OF 

00:35:56.928 --> 00:36:03.038
HUMAN BEINGS.
SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS FETISHIZED 

00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:06.333
THE BLACK AMERICANS THEY WERE 
PHOTOGRAPHING AND OTHERS FOCUSED

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:10.534
 ON IMAGES OF VIOLENCE AND BLACK
 BODIES BEING VIOLATED.

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:15.411
BUT IN BOB'S IMAGES, THE PEOPLE 
IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 

00:36:16.085 --> 00:36:19.413
WERE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND 
PORTRAYED THE MOST 

00:36:22.824 --> 00:36:26.562
DIGNIFIED WAY WHETHER THEY WERE 
FAMOUS LEADERS OR SOLDIERS.

00:36:26.563 --> 00:36:31.819
HE PORTRAYED EVERYONE WITH EQUAL
 RESPECT THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER.

00:36:31.987 --> 00:36:36.537
AND NOW THIS IS WHAT I NOTICED 
IN HIS IMAGES WHEN I STARTED AS 

00:36:36.538 --> 00:36:40.443
A YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHER AND THIS IS
 WHAT INFLUENCED ME PROFOUNDLY.

00:36:40.803 --> 00:36:45.367
LIKE BOB, I STRIVED TO ENCOUNTER
 ALL PEOPLE IN THE SAME LEVEL.

00:36:45.368 --> 00:36:49.815
AND WHETHER THEY ARE THE RICHEST
 AND MOST POWERFUL PERSON OR THE

00:36:50.165 --> 00:36:54.698
 POOREST AND MOST VULNERABLE.
ENCOUNTER EVERYONE ON YOUR LEVEL

00:36:55.031 --> 00:36:58.839
 AS EQUALS.
THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED FROM BOB'S

00:36:59.211 --> 00:37:01.947
 WORK.
BOB MADE THE CRITICALLY 

00:37:02.695 --> 00:37:08.898
IMPORTANT HISTORIC PHOTOS OF THE
 REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING 

00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:14.016
JUNIOR GIVING HIS I HAVE A DREAM
 SPEECH AT THE MEMORIAL.

00:37:14.017 --> 00:37:18.134
NOT FAR FROM WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
MOST OF THE PRESS WAS STUCK IN A

00:37:18.433 --> 00:37:23.836
 FAR AWAY PIN, BOB WAS ABLE TO 
GET A CLOSE UP PHOTO BECAUSE 

00:37:24.047 --> 00:37:26.567
EVERYONE KNEW HIM AND EVERYONE 
TRUSTED HIM.

00:37:26.568 --> 00:37:31.857
BOB HAD A MASTER'S DEGREE FROM 
COLOMBIA PHILOSOPHY.

00:37:31.858 --> 00:37:35.476
AND TOLD ME SOMETHING I DIDN'T 
KNOW ABOUT DR. KING SINCE BOB 

00:37:36.251 --> 00:37:38.524
HAD SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO 
SPEND TIME WITH HIM.

00:37:38.525 --> 00:37:43.489
AND APPARENTLY BETWEEN JOKES 
THEY DISCUSSED PHILOSOPHY.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:49.386
BOB TOLD ME, AND I QUOTE, HE WAS
 A PERSONALIST IN HIS RELIGIOUS 

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.325
VOCATION.
HE BELIEVED THAT EVERYONE WITH 

00:37:52.715 --> 00:37:56.405
AN ASPECT OF GOD AND THAT REALLY
 SPOKE TO THEM, THEY DESERVE THE

00:37:56.636 --> 00:38:02.424
 ATTENTION AND CONCERN AS IF HE 
WAS DIRECTLY TALKING TO GOD.

00:38:02.425 --> 00:38:08.002
AND WHILE BOB WAS MUCH, MUCH 
LESS CERTAIN TO BE DISTANT OF 

00:38:08.361 --> 00:38:11.509
GOD AND DR. KING, THE APPROACH 
OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE 

00:38:12.433 --> 00:38:17.138
PHOTOGRAPHED ECHOED THAT 
SENTIMENT.

00:38:17.139 --> 00:38:22.770
LOOK AT THE PHOTO OF REVEREND 
JOSEPH CARTER ON HIS FRONT PORCH

00:38:23.255 --> 00:38:30.390
 HOLDING A RIFLE AGAINST A 
POSSIBLE KLU KLUX KLAN AMBUSH 

00:38:31.911 --> 00:38:36.514
AFTER HE WAS THE FIRST BLACK IN 
LOUISIANA PARISH.

00:38:36.515 --> 00:38:38.515
AND BOB WAS THERE LATER WHEN A 
MULTITUDE OF SHOTS WERE

00:38:40.474 --> 00:38:43.945
 FIRED THROUGH THE HOUSE.
THIS WAS JUST ONE OF MANY TIMES 

00:38:45.724 --> 00:38:48.246
WHEN BOB ENCOUNTERED VIOLENCE 
AND GUN SHOTS DURING THE 

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:55.022
STRUGGLE OF CIVIL RIGHTS.
HE TOLD ME, MY INVOLVEMENT WOULD

00:38:55.282 --> 00:38:58.655
 BE VERY DANGEROUS.
BUT I HAD TO THINK WITH MYSELF.

00:38:59.004 --> 00:39:02.662
AND DECIDED THAT THIS WAS 
SOMETHING WORTH RISKING YOUR 

00:39:02.663 --> 00:39:05.360
LIFE FOR.
IN THE LAST INTERVIEW, HE TOLD 

00:39:05.595 --> 00:39:09.619
ME THAT HE HAD FOUND WORKABLE 
ANSWERS IN HIS PHILOSOPHY 

00:39:10.006 --> 00:39:12.745
STUDIES BEFORE TURNING TO 
PHOTOGRAPHY.

00:39:12.746 --> 00:39:15.661
I ASKED HIM WHAT THOSE ANSWERS 
WERE.

00:39:15.662 --> 00:39:19.962
BECAUSE IF YOU NEED A MEANING OF
 LIFE, I WANTED TO KNOW HIM.

00:39:19.963 --> 00:39:23.619
HE SAID THAT IN THE SENSE OF THE
 MIDDLE AGES, HE DIDN'T THINK 

00:39:23.749 --> 00:39:26.281
THAT THERE WAS ANY GREAT FOCUS 
TO LIFE.

00:39:26.282 --> 00:39:30.278
OR THAT THIS WORLD WAS A DRAMA 
OF SALVATION PREPARING US FOR 

00:39:30.582 --> 00:39:35.402
THE NEXT LIFE.
HE DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANY 

00:39:36.361 --> 00:39:39.982
OVER ARCHING PURPOSE TO LIFE BUT
 WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN MEANING 

00:39:40.663 --> 00:39:42.663
THROUGH 

00:39:43.892 --> 00:39:48.255
FAMILY, EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE
 AND VALUES THAT WE CARE DEEPLY 

00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:50.496
ABOUT.
AND HOLDING PROJECTS WOULD 

00:39:50.497 --> 00:39:52.710
REMAIN FAITHFUL TO THE VALUES 
AND THAT WOULD BE AS MUCH 

00:39:54.708 --> 00:39:58.437
PURPOSE AS HE COULD FIND.
AND I QUOTE FOR ME, IF I GOT 

00:39:58.915 --> 00:40:01.881
INVOLVED IN SOMETHING, IT HAD TO
 MEAN SOMETHING AND I HAD TO SEE

00:40:02.063 --> 00:40:05.559
 SOME PURPOSE TO IT AND THAT IT 
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I CARED 

00:40:05.792 --> 00:40:08.717
ABOUT.
SO BOB STUDIED PHILOSOPHY 

00:40:09.174 --> 00:40:11.453
PRIMARILY TO FIND HIS WAY IN THE
 WORLD.

00:40:11.454 --> 00:40:14.715
BUT IT WAS THROUGH PHOTOGRAPHY 
THAT HE DISCOVERED THE MEANING 

00:40:15.512 --> 00:40:18.830
THAT HE WAS SEARCHING FOR.
AND HE SAID I REALIZED I WANTED 

00:40:19.114 --> 00:40:25.315
TO GET INVOLVED IN A WORLD TO 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:40:25.316 --> 00:40:28.003
AND HE HAS.
THANK YOU.

00:40:28.004 --> 00:40:30.004
[APPLAUSE].

00:40:49.261 --> 00:40:55.027
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU HELENA AND 
ALL OF THE LIBRARY STAFF FOR 

00:40:56.391 --> 00:40:59.861
THEIR SUPPORT OF THE ACQUISITION
 AND FOR ORGANIZING THIS LOVELY 

00:41:00.117 --> 00:41:03.607
AND SIGNIFICANT OCCASION.
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO 

00:41:03.608 --> 00:41:06.885
REALLY LOOK AT BOB'S CAREER 
VISUALLY.

00:41:06.886 --> 00:41:13.083
SO THAT'S WHAT I WILL BRING TO 
YOU THIS AFTERNOON.

00:41:13.084 --> 00:41:18.492
IN FACT, YOU MAY BE SEEING HIS 
IMAGES IN MANY PLACES AND NOT 

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.730
EVEN BE

00:41:27.188 --> 00:41:29.188
 AWARE OF IT.

00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:42.958
WHAT IS A POSTER FOR RECENT 

00:41:47.063 --> 00:41:49.476
ACADEMY AWARD FILM, BY WRITER 

00:41:53.761 --> 00:41:56.440
JAMES BALDWIN.
EYES IN BOB'S PHOTOS.

00:41:56.441 --> 00:42:00.526
BOB GOT TO KNOW HIM DURING THE 
CIVIL RIGHT'S MOVEMENT AND 

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.436
PHOTOGRAPHED HIM DURING THE 
PLAY, MR. CHARLIE.

00:42:04.437 --> 00:42:08.005
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN, IT IS IN 
FACT LIKE THE AUTHOR'S EYES.

00:42:08.006 --> 00:42:11.623
IT FILLS INTO THE ESSENCE OF THE
 MAN.

00:42:11.624 --> 00:42:16.560
AND DOES THIS IN A VERY CREATIVE
 WAY.

00:42:16.561 --> 00:42:23.208
COVERED AN UNCOVERED MANUSCRIPT 
OF BALDWIN AND USED THOSE WORDS 

00:42:23.522 --> 00:42:27.385
FOR LIFE AND TIMES AND OFFERING 
AN UNUSUAL AUTHENTICITY.

00:42:27.386 --> 00:42:32.976
THE QUALITY OF AUTHENTICITY ALSO
 DISTINGUISHES BOB'S WORK AND 

00:42:32.977 --> 00:42:34.977
MAKES IT SO VERY APPROPRIATE FOR
 THE 

00:42:38.247 --> 00:42:39.347
LIBRARY'S PHOTOGRAPHIC 
COLLECTIONS.

00:42:39.348 --> 00:42:43.162
BOB CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE
 LIBRARY STAFF ABOUT TEN YEARS 

00:42:43.163 --> 00:42:48.252
AGO WHEN HE ARRIVED TO EXAMINE 
POTENTIALLY FOR A BOOK PROJECT.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:54.939
NEGATIVES MADE BY RALPH ELLERSON
 ARCHIVED IN THE MANUSCRIPTS 

00:42:55.295 --> 00:42:58.918
DIVISION AND RELATIVELY UNKNOWN 
PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK RESIDES IN THE

00:42:59.277 --> 00:43:03.637
 PRINTS AND PHOTOGRAPH DIVISION.
MY COLLEAGUE MET BOB AND 

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:11.957
SUBSEQUENTLY VISITED HIM TO 
ACQUIRE A COLLECTION OF CIVIL 

00:43:12.186 --> 00:43:15.011
RIGHTS PHOTOGRAPHS.
AND THIS ICONIC IMAGE WE ARE 

00:43:17.112 --> 00:43:22.093
LOOKING AT IS DR. KING.
AND WE ORGANIZED THE 

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:24.466
PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPEDITION

00:43:29.221 --> 00:43:32.302
CUMMERATING THE MARCH IN 
WASHINGTON IN JANUARY OF 2013 

00:43:34.229 --> 00:43:38.331
AND THE FOLLOWING JANUARY, THE 
SYMPOSIUM WHO WITNESSED THE 

00:43:38.571 --> 00:43:42.215
MARCH.
AND BOB WAS ONE WHO SPOKE.

00:43:42.216 --> 00:43:46.458
AND WAS INVITED TO GIVE SEVERAL 
LECTURES ABOUT HIS WORK IN THE 

00:43:46.785 --> 00:43:48.837
LIBRARY.
HE WAS ASKED TO TAKE ON A ROLE 

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:54.455
OF PHOTOGRAPHER IN RESIDENTS, IN
 HOPES THAT SOME DAY SUCH 

00:43:54.575 --> 00:43:57.168
POSITION MIGHT OFFICIALLY BE 
DESIGNATED.

00:43:57.169 --> 00:44:03.002
HERE IS AN ENERGIZED BOB WHO HAS
 HIS CIVIL RIGHTS WORK IN THE 

00:44:03.534 --> 00:44:06.326
1960s.
IN THE MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND 

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.998
THAT CAUSE THAT JIM JUST 
MENTIONED.

00:44:09.999 --> 00:44:11.439
HE SAW OTHERS GIVE THEIR LIVES. 
THEIR LIVES.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.031
AND HE FELT THEIR LIVES.
AND HE FELT HE COULD DIE FROM 

00:44:14.353 --> 00:44:17.236
THE SAME CAUSE.
AND SPOKE A CAMERAMAN.

00:44:17.237 --> 00:44:23.154
ONE OF HIS PHOTOGRAPHS WERE ON 
THE COVER OF NEWS WEEK IN THE 

00:44:23.155 --> 00:44:26.578
SPRING OF 1965.
AND WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN HIS 

00:44:27.716 --> 00:44:33.229
MOST FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPH IN 
BIRMINGHAM SPRINGS, 1963.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:37.677
AND HE WAS THERE.
AND HE WITNESSED HOW THE 

00:44:38.039 --> 00:44:41.377
STUDENTS WOULDN'T RUN AWAY AND 
HOLDING ONTO EACH OTHER FOR DEAR

00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:46.555
 LIFE.
BOB'S TEACHER ALEXAY BRADOVICH 

00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:51.030
CLAIMED THIS IMAGE QUOTE FEARED 
ITSELF INTO HIS MEMORY.

00:44:51.031 --> 00:44:56.158
BOB DID NOT HAVE MUCH FORMAL 
TRAINING IN PHOTOGRAPHY AND HIS 

00:44:56.475 --> 00:44:59.075
REAL INTRODUCTION WAS THROUGH 
HIS FATHER WHO WAS A SERIOUS 

00:44:59.461 --> 00:45:02.942
AMATEUR WITH A DARK ROOM AT 
HOME.

00:45:02.943 --> 00:45:09.879
BOB ATTENDED MANHATTAN 
STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL AND WAS 

00:45:10.169 --> 00:45:15.863
IN COLOMBIA AND MASTERED IN 
PHILOSOPHY AND CONTINUED 

00:45:16.167 --> 00:45:20.084
STUDYING IN ARTS.
HE RETURNED TO LAW SCHOOL IN 

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.412
HARVARD AND RETURNED TO NEW YORK
 CITY.

00:45:22.413 --> 00:45:26.186
AND BEGAN TALKING HIS WAY INTO 
PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIOS.

00:45:26.187 --> 00:45:28.187
EVENTUALLY IN 1959, ENROLLED IN 

00:45:31.354 --> 00:45:35.104
BRADOVICH'S FAMOUS DESIGN 
LABORATORY AT THE SCHOOL FOR 

00:45:35.371 --> 00:45:39.209
SOCIAL RESEARCH.
FOR THE ASSIGNMENT TO SHOOT IN 

00:45:39.493 --> 00:45:41.591
TIMES SQUARE, BOB SETTLED ON 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

00:45:41.592 --> 00:45:49.241
HE TOOK A LOOK DOWN UPON A GROUP
 OF SAILERS FROM THE HOTEL 

00:45:49.779 --> 00:45:52.703
AFTER.
AND PHOTOGRAPHED AND RESEARCHED 

00:45:52.944 --> 00:46:01.762
WHAT EDWARD STIFER HAD DONE AND 
PERSEVEING UNTIL HE CAN FIND 

00:46:01.763 --> 00:46:05.181
SOMETHING OF HIS OWN.
THIS IMAGE OF A HARD COOKED EGG.

00:46:05.421 --> 00:46:09.663
BOB BELIEVED THAT BESIDES 
QUALITIES OF DESIGN, HIS 

00:46:11.699 --> 00:46:14.532
ACTIVITIES IN PHOTOGRAPHY NEEDED
 TO HAVE PURPOSE.

00:46:14.533 --> 00:46:19.036
AND THE PURPOSE HE FOUND WAS TO 
FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS, SUPPORT 

00:46:19.488 --> 00:46:23.167
JUSTICE AND HELP MAKE CHANGE IN 
PEOPLES' LIVES FOR THE BETTER.

00:46:23.469 --> 00:46:30.847
AND HE FIRST GOT INVOLVED WITH 
THE BROOKLYN CONGRESS OF RACIAL 

00:46:31.648 --> 00:46:33.560
EQUALITY AND BECAME THEIR 
PHOTOGRAPHER.

00:46:33.561 --> 00:46:37.443
BROOKLYN WAS WHERE THEY BEGAN 
THE FREEDOM RIGHTS.

00:46:37.444 --> 00:46:42.541
AS YOU CAN SEE, PEOPLE HERE WERE
 PICKETING FOR EDUCATION, AS 

00:46:42.542 --> 00:46:46.902
WELL AS THE LIVABLE COMMUNITY 
AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY.

00:46:46.903 --> 00:46:48.903
IT SEEMS

00:46:52.451 --> 00:46:55.252
 THAT BOB WOULD LATER EXPAND 
UPON.

00:46:55.253 --> 00:47:00.626
IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, 
BOB MET MANY GREAT PEOPLE, 

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:06.014
BALDWIN, A BILL THINKER AND 
MICHAEL HARINGTON AND CLOSE HE 

00:47:06.363 --> 00:47:11.548
FELT TO DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING 
JUNIOR THAT BOB ALWAYS REFERRED 

00:47:11.796 --> 00:47:15.978
TO HIM AS DOC.
HE ATTENDED KING'S FUNERAL IN 

00:47:17.212 --> 00:47:23.048
1968 AND TOOK INTIMATE 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE FAMILY WHICH 

00:47:23.299 --> 00:47:28.634
HAVE A PERMANENT PLACE IN IF THE
 HISTORIC SITE IN ATLANTA.

00:47:28.635 --> 00:47:35.072
BOB'S MAGAZINE WORK BEGINNING IN
 1960 OFTEN DOES TELL WITH HIS 

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.058
CIVIL RIGHTS PHOTOGRAPHY WHICH 
SHOWS VOTER DRIVES IN THE SOUTH,

00:47:39.316 --> 00:47:42.259
 OF A MAN REGISTERING IN SOUTH 
CAROLINA.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:47.253
FOR EBONY, HE FOLLOWED THE 
REVEREND JOE CARTER, THE FIRST 

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:51.142
BLACK MAN TO REGISTER AND VOTE 
IN WEST LOUISIANA.

00:47:51.143 --> 00:47:54.233
AND IN FACT, I THINK HE TOLD 
YOU, JIM, THAT THIS WAS THE MOST

00:47:55.073 --> 00:47:57.073
 DANGEROUS SITUATION HE

00:47:58.618 --> 00:48:03.608
 HAD EVER FACED.
AND BOB WAS AWARDED A DEGAN 

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:09.680
HINES FOUNDATION GRANT IN 1964.
AND HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF 

00:48:09.892 --> 00:48:12.472
THAT WORK.
HIS PROPOSAL WAS TO QUOTE 

00:48:12.958 --> 00:48:17.702
CONTINUE HIS WORK ON THE EFFORTS
 OF NEGROS TO ACHIEVE EQUALITY 

00:48:17.703 --> 00:48:23.705
IN AMERICA AND TO BEGIN A STUDY 
OF POVERTY IN THE CONTEXT OF 

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:27.219
CONTEMPORARY AFFLUENCE.
HIS APPLICATION WAS SUPPORTED BY

00:48:29.266 --> 00:48:34.761
 EDWARD STIKEN WHO THOUGHT BOB 
WAS SERIOUS.

00:48:34.762 --> 00:48:37.842
HIS TEACHER POINTED TO BOB'S 
INTEGRITY AND COURAGE.

00:48:37.843 --> 00:48:44.127
AND THE VITALITY AND NECESSITY 
OF THE PROJECT.

00:48:44.128 --> 00:48:50.058
DR. MORMON, TEACHER AND 
BIOGRAPHER CONCURRED THAT BOB 

00:48:50.455 --> 00:48:53.201
WAS QUOTE DEDICATED AND 
SELF-LESS.

00:48:53.202 --> 00:49:00.571
A PERSON OF INTEGRITY AND SHOWS 
PROMISE AS ONE OF THE MOST 

00:49:02.012 --> 00:49:04.885
AFFECTIVE PHOTOGRAPHERS IN THE 
AMERICAN SOCIAL SCENE.

00:49:04.886 --> 00:49:08.810
END QUOTE.
ON ASSIGNMENT, BOB WAS UNAFRAID.

00:49:09.522 --> 00:49:16.818
WITH A GIFT, HIS EDITORIAL WORK 
FOR NEW YORK MAGAZINE WE HAVE 

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.672
HEARD INCLUDED TIMES MAGAZINE, 
AND TOO MANY TO SAY.

00:49:21.673 --> 00:49:22.880
THE ASSIGNMENTS WERE VERY 
VARIED.

00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:27.843
AND THESE ARE FROM A STORY ABOUT
 THE DAILY LIFE OF SOUTH 

00:49:27.844 --> 00:49:32.395
CAROLINA SHERIFF JAY BIRD 
DARNELL.

00:49:32.396 --> 00:49:34.396
AND BOB DOCUMENTED THIS

00:49:38.455 --> 00:49:43.739
 DRUG RAID IN NEW YORK.
HE MET AND PHOTOGRAPHED MANY 

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:46.330
PEOPLE SUCH AS SYDNEY

00:49:47.352 --> 00:49:52.326
 PROPIER, MILES DAVIS, TINA 
TURNER.

00:49:52.327 --> 00:49:56.645
ONE OF THE CROWDS HE MOST 
ENJOYED HANGING OUT WITH WERE 

00:49:57.349 --> 00:50:03.632
THE POP ARTISTS, JAMES 
ROSENHURT, ANDY WARHALL AND 

00:50:03.862 --> 00:50:08.979
OTHERS, BEING REPRESENTED BY ART
 GALLERY.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:15.164
FOR A MAGAZINE ARTICLE, BOB 
CLEVERLY DECIDED TO TAKE ANDY 

00:50:15.165 --> 00:50:17.165
WARHALL GROCERY

00:50:20.373 --> 00:50:23.309
 SHOPPING.
AND STEIN BECAME A CLOSE FRIEND.

00:50:23.557 --> 00:50:28.532
AND BOB COMES THROUGH HERE.
IN THE PORTRAIT IMAGE, 

00:50:28.781 --> 00:50:31.995
POSITIONED AS THE SCULPTURE BASE
 AND HIS OWN REPRESENTATION OF 

00:50:34.594 --> 00:50:43.626
VANCOUSEN'S 1910 SLEEPING NEWS.
BOB WAS A PROLIFIC PRODUCER OF 

00:50:43.891 --> 00:50:48.367
MORE THAN 60 BOOKS AS WELL AS 
MANY BOOKS CONTINUING AFTER HE 

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.663
MOVED FROM NEW YORK TO MIAMI 
BEACH.

00:50:50.664 --> 00:50:58.321
SOME WERE HIS OWN.
OTHERS WERE WITH AND FOR OTHER 

00:50:58.649 --> 00:51:02.105
PEOPLE.
THIS COLLAGE GIVES YOU AN IDEA 

00:51:02.511 --> 00:51:07.094
OF THE RANGE OF THE PROJECTS.
SOME UNUSUAL.

00:51:07.095 --> 00:51:12.786
AND EVEN BODY AS THE BIBLE, THE 
BOOK ABOUT THE UNDER GROUND 

00:51:13.601 --> 00:51:16.702
COMICS IS A FORM OF FOLK ART.
BOB AND THE INFLUENTIAL

00:51:20.415 --> 00:51:22.415
 EDITOR STEVEN HAD DONE

00:51:25.276 --> 00:51:30.028
 IS THE PROJECT ABOUT THE BILL 
OF RIGHTS WITH THE HEAD OF 

00:51:30.029 --> 00:51:35.720
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION 
WHO IS HERE TODAY.

00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:38.590
BOB'S LINE WAS CONCERNED FOR 
EQUALITY AND EDUCATION AND ABOUT

00:51:38.973 --> 00:51:40.973
 POVERTY WHICH

00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:46.939
 ALLUDED PEOPLE FROM THOSE 
AMERICAN VALUES.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:51.203
HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE 
GRAPHIC ART LAYOUT THAT 

00:51:51.433 --> 00:51:52.774
CHARACTERIZES BOB'S BOOK 
PROJECTS.

00:51:52.775 --> 00:51:56.815
AN ASSIGNMENT LOOKING AT 
CHILDREN GROWING UP WITHOUT 

00:51:57.034 --> 00:52:01.485
THEIR FATHERS IN THE 1970S TO A 
SERIES OF SMALL BOOKS FOR AND 

00:52:01.691 --> 00:52:03.849
ABOUT CHILDREN.
SOME ELEVATING PLAY.

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:05.850
AND MANY FINDING A WAY TO

00:52:09.155 --> 00:52:15.708
 IMPROVE READING SKILLS.
DOWN HOME PHOTOGRAPHED FROM 1965

00:52:15.936 --> 00:52:18.970
 TO 1970 AND PUBLISHED IN 1971 
WAS BOB'S FIRST MAJOR BOOK BOOK 

00:52:21.849 --> 00:52:24.691
PROJECT.
IT IS A SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY OF 

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:28.721
PEOPLE LIVING IN CAMDEN, 
ALABAMA.

00:52:28.722 --> 00:52:31.837
BOB CONTINUED PHOTOGRAPHING THE 
SAME PEOPLE FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

00:52:32.077 --> 00:52:36.765
HE INTENDED TO PUBLISH HOME 
AGAIN.

00:52:36.766 --> 00:52:39.502
IT HAD BECAME AN UNFINISHED 
PROJECT.

00:52:39.503 --> 00:52:45.336
TWO OF THE YOUNG FOLKS THAT BOB 
MET IN 1965 ARE SHOWN ON THE 

00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:47.808
BOOK PAGES ON THE LEFT.
AND ON THE RIGHT IS HOW HE FOUND

00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:51.287
 THOSE SAME TWO GIRLS TEN YEARS 
LATER.

00:52:51.288 --> 00:52:55.088
BOB WAS WORKING FOR POSITIVE 
RESULTS FROM THE KIND OF CIVIL 

00:52:55.538 --> 00:52:57.691
RIGHTS ACTIONS HE HAD 
PARTICIPATED IN.

00:52:57.692 --> 00:53:02.504
IN GENERAL, HE IS THE KING 
OBSERVER OF PROCESS.

00:53:02.505 --> 00:53:08.744
THERE WOULD BE MORE OF THIS KIND
 OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

00:53:08.745 --> 00:53:12.717
THE BETTERMENT OF AMERICA WAS 
BOB'S FOCUS.

00:53:12.718 --> 00:53:19.814
THE NEXT AMERICA IN 1974 WAS A 
PROJECT THAT BOB DID WITH 

00:53:20.165 --> 00:53:23.981
MICHAEL HARINGTON THAT HE HAD 
MET THROUGH WORK IN CORE.

00:53:23.982 --> 00:53:26.692
HAD AN IMPACT ON THE KENNEDY 
ADMINISTRATION.

00:53:26.693 --> 00:53:30.920
THIS TIME, HE AND BOB WOULD 
UPDATE THAT BOOK WITH THE 

00:53:35.067 --> 00:53:36.968
DECLINE AND RISE OF THE UNITED 
STATES.

00:53:36.969 --> 00:53:40.273
BOB WAS ALWAYS SHOWING AMERICA 
HOW HE SAW IT.

00:53:40.274 --> 00:53:44.679
AND THEN ATTEMPTING TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT MAKING LIFE IN 

00:53:54.987 --> 00:53:58.053
AMERICA BETTER.
HE WAS PUTTING HIS PHOTOGRAPHS 

00:53:54.987 --> 00:53:55.208
TO USE FOR SOCIAL CAUSES AND HOW
 THE OTHER HALF STILL LIVES WAS 

00:53:55.209 --> 00:54:00.008
A PETITION FOR CARTER TO PAY 
ATTENTION TO THE SOUTH BRONX 

00:54:00.247 --> 00:54:05.846
UNDER THE SCOPES FOUNDATION.
THE LIBRARY BORROWED A COPY OF 

00:54:06.207 --> 00:54:08.963
THESE PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE RECENT
 EXPEDITION HIGHLIGHTING THE 

00:54:10.202 --> 00:54:13.759
BREAKING JOURNALISM OF JACOB 
REESE.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:21.223
"HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES" GAVE 
THOUGHT TO THE U.S. 1880s.

00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:26.720
YOU CAN SEE THAT BOB WAS ALL 
ABOUT AMERICA.

00:54:26.721 --> 00:54:29.902
A GLANCE AT THE GREAT AMERICAN 
PAST TIME.

00:54:29.903 --> 00:54:36.978
BOB'S STUDY OF THE PITTSBURGH 
PIRATES FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF 

00:54:37.313 --> 00:54:41.894
ROBERTO CLEMENTE KILLED IN A 
PLANE CRASH IN 1972.

00:54:41.895 --> 00:54:46.152
IT FEATURED THE ALL STAR PLAYER 
AND LEFT STARTLED DURING THE 

00:54:46.495 --> 00:54:49.763
1973 SEASON.
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT BOB GOT 

00:54:52.099 --> 00:54:57.871
INTO THE GAME HIMSELF.
BOB'S OWN INVOLVEMENT IN THINGS 

00:55:00.243 --> 00:55:06.361
IS MOST CLEARLY SEEN WHICH 
EXAMINED OBESITY.

00:55:06.362 --> 00:55:09.368
AND WOULD DO PHOTOGRAPHS ON THIS
 SUBJECT FOR THE CHOIR AND THE 

00:55:09.864 --> 00:55:14.261
SUNDAY TIMES IN 1979 TO 80.
HE TOOK ON AN EXPERIMENTAL DIET 

00:55:14.984 --> 00:55:18.323
HIMSELF.
HE EXERCISED AND UNDER DOCTOR'S 

00:55:18.695 --> 00:55:23.220
CARE, LOST 100 POUND IN A YEAR.

00:55:27.197 --> 00:55:30.518
HE WAS NEVER MORE PROUD OF 
ANYTHING THAN THIS GROUP OF 

00:55:30.759 --> 00:55:36.239
PHOTOGRAPHS HE MADE OF HIMSELF.
AS YOU CAN SEE, BOB

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:45.095
 LIKED TO OBSERVE PROCESS.
HE FOLLOWS HOW ARTISTS WORK.

00:55:45.096 --> 00:55:47.719
WITH CLOSE FRIEND, STEIN, HE WAS
 ALL SET.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:57.279
THE ARTIST SUPPLIED COLOR, 
OUTLINE, FOR AN ICONIC 

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:59.950
OVAL 

00:56:01.669 --> 00:56:06.337
OFFICE AND WAS DELIGHTED.
PRODUCED IN 1990, IS THE UNIQUE 

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:11.855
INDIVIDUAL BIOGRAPHY OF THE 
SHORT STORY RAYMOND CARTER.

00:56:11.856 --> 00:56:16.567
CARTER'S LETTERS AND POEMS 
PROVIDE THE TEXT AND BOB'S 

00:56:16.838 --> 00:56:22.304
PHOTOGRAPHS HELP MATCH THE 
GRITTY WORDS WITH THE BLUE

00:56:26.288 --> 00:56:31.770
  COLLAR TOWNS IN THE NORTHWEST.
DIVISIONS OF LIBERTY FROM THE 

00:56:32.226 --> 00:56:36.953
EARLY 1990s DERIVE WHAT BOB 
STOOD FOR, IN THE BODY OF THE 

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.947
PHOTOGRAPHS THAT HE LEFT US.
MADE OF AMERICAN CHILDREN IN THE

00:56:40.465 --> 00:56:42.465
 SOUTHWEST.
OR THE WOMEN'S MARCH IN NEW YORK

00:56:43.719 --> 00:56:47.131
 CITY.
A PROTESTOR HAD AN ANTI-VIETNAM 

00:56:47.942 --> 00:56:49.942
WAR RALLY.
A FAMILY

00:56:52.966 --> 00:56:57.277
 SUPPORTING GAY RIGHTS.
ONE OF BOB'S MOST POPULAR IMAGES

00:56:57.402 --> 00:57:02.613
 IS THIS ONE TAKEN AT THE 
PEOPLE'S WALL IN THE IBM

00:57:06.488 --> 00:57:13.781
 PAVILLION IN QUEENS IN 1964.
IT'S A STATEMENT ABOUT RACE AND 

00:57:13.999 --> 00:57:18.577
CLASS IN AMERICA.
ACTUALLY THIS IMAGE -- I SHOULD 

00:57:19.242 --> 00:57:22.106
SAY BOB'S DELIGHT IN TECHNOLOGY 
AND HUMANITY.

00:57:22.107 --> 00:57:27.505
HE HAS MANIPULATED HIS CAMERA, 
WHEREAS TO FLATTEN THE SEATING 

00:57:27.725 --> 00:57:30.735
FOR A RIDE.
IT WAS ACTUALLY ON AN INCLINE.

00:57:30.978 --> 00:57:37.821
THE PEOPLE APPEAR WEARY OR 
EXCITED AS THEY ARE ABOUT TO BE 

00:57:37.938 --> 00:57:42.381
SUCKED UP INTO A MULTI SCREEN 
THEATER DESIGNED BY

00:57:45.482 --> 00:57:49.842
 CHARLES WILLIAMS IN ORDER TO 
VIEW A FILM ABOUT DESIGN IN THE 

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:54.495
TECHNOLOGICAL AGE.
BOB'S CAREER, WHAT RALPH 

00:57:55.837 --> 00:58:00.905
ELLERSON SAID ABOUT HIS WORK.
QUOTE IT MOVES INTO THE RARE 

00:58:01.237 --> 00:58:05.585
SMEAR WITH THE TECHNICAL ABILITY
 AND SOCIAL VISION COMBINED TO 

00:58:07.207 --> 00:58:11.556
CREATE A WORK OF ART.
AND HIS ARCHIVES NOW JOINED 

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:15.738
FORCES WITH THE LIBRARY OF 
CONGRESS'S GREAT COLLECTIONS 

00:58:16.083 --> 00:58:20.487
WHICH PRESERVE THE CONTRIBUTIONS
 TO OUR SOCIETY OF ELLERSON, 

00:58:20.623 --> 00:58:23.687
LEADERS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS 
MOVEMENTS AND THE DESIGNERS.

00:58:23.688 --> 00:58:29.072
AMONG SO MANY OTHER AMERICAN 
CREATORS, HIS WORK WILL CONTINUE

00:58:29.438 --> 00:58:39.080
 TO HAVE A PLACE IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY ALONGSIDE HERE.

00:58:39.081 --> 00:58:45.371
WE CAN JUST IMAGINE THAT THE 
EVER SMILING SERIOUS DEVILISH 

00:58:46.817 --> 00:58:48.817
BOB WOULD BE JOYFUL NOW.

00:58:52.378 --> 00:58:54.539
[APPLAUSE [APPLAUSE].

00:59:12.189 --> 00:59:14.519
SPEAKER:  THAT WAS A REALLY 
WONDERFUL TALK.

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:19.264
I HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE SO LONG
 THAT I FORGOT THAT I HAD A 

00:59:20.004 --> 00:59:20.656
THIRD.
YEAH.

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:28.024
WELL, BOB AND I MET IN NEW YORK 
CITY, I BELIEVE IN 1981.

00:59:28.025 --> 00:59:33.102
I WAS LIVING THERE WITH MY DOG.
AND I DIDN'T KNOW BOB'S WORK.

00:59:34.163 --> 00:59:36.163
BUT I

00:59:37.532 --> 00:59:41.358
 CERTAINLY DID GET TO KNOW BOB 
AND HIS WORK VERY WELL INDEED.

00:59:41.528 --> 00:59:45.701
BUT HE CAME TO PHOTOGRAPH ME FOR
 THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE THAT 

00:59:45.927 --> 00:59:48.585
FOLDED OVER THE WEEKEND.
SO IT WAS A WONDERFUL COVER 

00:59:48.811 --> 00:59:50.422
SHOT.
I CAN STILL SEE IT.

00:59:50.423 --> 00:59:56.039
I COULD HAVE BROUGHT IT TODAY.
BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I 

00:59:57.105 --> 01:00:00.340
LOST TRACK OF.
BUT THAT IS REALLY HOW WE GOT TO

01:00:00.341 --> 01:00:03.048
 BE FRIENDS AND AFTER NEW YORK 
CITY, WHEN OUR LIVES WENT 

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:06.089
DIFFERENT PLACES, WE WERE NEVER 
OUT OF TOUCH.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:07.454
WE DID SOMETIMES STILL WORK 
TOGETHER.

01:00:07.455 --> 01:00:10.738
WHEN I FIRST MET BOB, WE WORKED 
A BIT MORE.

01:00:10.739 --> 01:00:17.628
HE WAS ALWAYS KIND ENOUGH TO 
HAVE ME, YOU KNOW, A SUDDEN EE

01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:27.231
EEPIPHONY AND I KNOW YOU SHOULD 
DO THIS WITH ME.

01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:30.344
AND AGAIN.
AND I MARRIED MY HUSBAND AND 

01:00:30.557 --> 01:00:33.065
BECAME THE UNOFFICIAL DRIVER FOR
 ALL OF THESE EVENTS.

01:00:33.066 --> 01:00:37.818
AND BOB WAS THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND
 I WAS THE WRITER.

01:00:37.819 --> 01:00:41.136
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY 
INTERESTED ME ABOUT BOB, WAS 

01:00:41.366 --> 01:00:45.039
YEAH, I WAS A WRITER AND YOU  
CAN'T BE THAT WITHOUT HAVING 

01:00:45.899 --> 01:00:47.899
SOMEWHAT OF A VISUAL SENSE OF 
THE WORLD EVEN IF YOUR TOOLS ARE

01:00:49.113 --> 01:00:52.536
 WORDS.
BUT IF BOB AND I DID THE SAME  

01:00:48.223 --> 01:00:50.223
THING IN

01:00:51.403 --> 01:00:55.366
 AN EVENING, AND IT WAS JUST THE
 MOST ORDINARY KIND OF THING, 

01:00:55.367 --> 01:00:59.728
GOING TO A DINER AND GETTING A 
BITE TO EAT OR SOMETHING, I 

01:00:59.729 --> 01:01:06.281
WOULD SOMETIMES SAY TO HIM, WOW,
 DID YOU SEE THAT SORT OF 

01:01:10.129 --> 01:01:15.625
CHERUB UP THERE ABOVE THE 
COATING?

01:01:15.626 --> 01:01:18.296
YEAH, I SAW IT BY YOUR BACK 
SHOULDER.

01:01:18.297 --> 01:01:22.361
I SAW IT WHEN I WALKED IN AND 
ANOTHER ONE ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.823
AND HE WOULD SAY TO ME, DID YOU 
HEAR THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE 

01:01:26.146 --> 01:01:28.421
PEOPLE WHO ARE BREAKING UP?
AND I WOULD SAY NO.

01:01:28.422 --> 01:01:30.810
AND HE WOULD NARRATE ALL OF THAT
 FOR ME, TOO.

01:01:30.811 --> 01:01:35.677
AND SO, IT DOES MAKE SENSE IN A 
WAY BECAUSE HE WAS VERY MUCH 

01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:41.366
KNOWN AND HUGELY TALENTED AS A 
DOCUMENTARY PHOTOGRAPHER.

01:01:41.367 --> 01:01:44.667
BUT HIS INTEREST WASN'T WATCHING
 THINGS ELAPSE IN TIME.

01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:50.526
THIS IS REALLY ANECDOTAL BUT YOU
 WOULD GET NO RESPONSE.

01:01:50.527 --> 01:01:52.539
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE HE WAS 
HOLDING THE CARDS CLOSE TO US.

01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:57.439
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY 
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT, IN SOME 

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.022
WAY, TAKE AWAY FROM IT AS A 
POTENTIAL IMAGE OR WHAT IT WAS 

01:02:02.307 --> 01:02:05.648
TO HIM.
WRITERS KNOW IT, TOO.

01:02:05.649 --> 01:02:11.993
IT'S RIGHT AWAY.
WRITERS DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE 

01:02:12.894 --> 01:02:16.340
TO PARAPHRASE THEIR WORK.
IS THAT ALL I WROTE?

01:02:16.341 --> 01:02:18.633
BUT GIVING THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE
 PLOT.

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:22.060
I AM JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW 
MANY OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE, ONE

01:02:22.225 --> 01:02:25.632
 WAY OR ANOTHER, PROFESSIONALLY 
OR PERSONALLY, HOW MANY OF YOU 

01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:29.984
HERE ACTUALLY KNEW BOB?
OH, LIKE LOTS OF PEOPLE.

01:02:29.985 --> 01:02:32.891
YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.
WELL, IT IS A BIG GROUP.

01:02:32.892 --> 01:02:35.322
BUT THAT IS VERY INTERESTING.
I THINK THE THING THAT YOU KNOW,

01:02:35.604 --> 01:02:41.351
 I WOULD SAY TO SOMEBODY WHO  
DIDN'T KNOW BOB DIDN'T KNOW BOB 

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:35.990
WAS

01:02:39.334 --> 01:02:44.411
 WHAT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IN THE
 WORK ANYWAY BUT I THINK SHOULD 

01:02:44.412 --> 01:02:47.615
BE REMARKED UPON, AND THAT IS 
HOW REALLY HARD HE WORKED.

01:02:47.616 --> 01:02:51.462
IF MY HUSBAND AND I WERE 
VISITING BOB AND I WENT UP TO GO

01:02:51.696 --> 01:02:55.774
 TO THE BATHROOM AT 4:00 IN THE 
MORNING, THE COMPUTER SCREEN WAS

01:02:56.082 --> 01:02:59.007
 GOING AND HE WAS SENDING 
SOMETHING SOMEWHERE AND HE WAS 

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.307
UP AT NIGHT AND THAT WAS JUST 
AROUND THE HOUSE.

01:03:01.308 --> 01:03:04.031
THAT WAS JUST WITH KEEPING UP 
WITH A LOT OF THE WORK THAT HE 

01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:07.296
HAD TO DO WITH HIS WONDERFUL 
ASSISTANT.

01:03:07.297 --> 01:03:13.049
BUT UM, YOU KNOW, JUST THE SHEAR
 VIGOR AND THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY 

01:03:13.746 --> 01:03:17.373
THAT BOB EXTENDED WAS ABSOLUTELY
 AMAZING.

01:03:17.374 --> 01:03:21.744
HE CERTAINLY COULD HAVE SAID 
PLEASE COME TO MY STUDIO FOR ME 

01:03:21.974 --> 01:03:24.863
TO MAKE A PORTRAIT OF YOU, DR. 
KING.

01:03:24.864 --> 01:03:27.584
NO KIDDING.
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAMOUS YOU

01:03:27.898 --> 01:03:30.091
 WERE.
THAT IS PERHAPS WHAT A LOT OF 

01:03:30.265 --> 01:03:32.461
PHOTOGRAPHERS DO.
DO WELL AND GET WHAT THEY WANT 

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:35.018
OUT OF THOSE THINGS.
BUT BOB ALWAYS WANTED CHANCE TO 

01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:39.386
BE THE THING THAT INTERVENED AND
 THAT IS NOT SO LIKELY TO HAPPEN

01:03:39.613 --> 01:03:40.010
  IF YOU

01:03:40.011 --> 01:03:42.686
 ARE SET UP IN YOUR STUDIO.
SOMEWHAT.

01:03:42.687 --> 01:03:46.938
BUT CERTAINLY NOT LIKE BEING IN 
BIRMINGHAM.

01:03:46.939 --> 01:03:50.509
THAT IS JUST A VERY DIFFERENT 
MATTER AND I THINK IT WAS ALWAYS

01:03:50.712 --> 01:03:56.155
 THAT REFLECTIVE NEED THAT BOB 
HAD TO BE SURPRISED.

01:03:56.156 --> 01:03:57.591
WHETHER FOR THE BETTER OR FOR 
WORSE.

01:03:57.592 --> 01:04:00.220
IT REALLY THE GOT HIM LIKE OUT 
ON THE STREET SO MANY TIMES WHEN

01:04:00.496 --> 01:04:03.547
 HE WASN'T JUST DOING THE THINGS
 THAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO TO 

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:06.056
FOLLOW THROUGH ON, YOU KNOW, THE
 THINGS THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN IN 

01:04:06.057 --> 01:04:09.317
THE SCENE OR REGISTERED IN OUR 
MINDS AT THE MOMENT.

01:04:09.318 --> 01:04:12.604
SO HE WAS REALLY, AMONG MANY 
HARD WORKING PEOPLE I HAVE I 

01:04:12.825 --> 01:04:16.214
KNOW, I'M SURE WE ALL HAVE, HE 
WAS REALLY ONE OF THE MOST HARD 

01:04:16.577 --> 01:04:22.302
WORKING AND ALWAYS WITH SUCH A 
SENSE OF GENEROSITY AND 

01:04:23.074 --> 01:04:27.547
SINCERITY ABOUT HIM, TOO.
HE OF COURSE HAD HIS OWN COSMOS 

01:04:27.672 --> 01:04:31.003
AND WE TALKED TO EACH OTHER IN 
SHORTHAND OR JUST WENT LIKE THAT

01:04:31.402 --> 01:04:34.699
 TO THE OTHER BECAUSE WE WERE SO
 SICK OF EACH OTHER'S DIFFERING 

01:04:34.947 --> 01:04:38.360
OPINIONS.
BUT IF YOU HEARD ABOUT SAMANTHA,

01:04:38.763 --> 01:04:42.143
 DAUGHTER SAMANTHA OR JOHN, 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE JOHN.

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:47.418
IF YOU HEARD ABOUT IOWA, YOU 
KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT IT WAS.

01:04:47.594 --> 01:04:50.977
THESE PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS IN THE 
BACK OF BOB'S MIND, THOUGH.

01:04:50.978 --> 01:04:55.375
AND I THINK THAT IS THE THING 
THAT IS TRUE FOR VISUAL ARTISTS.

01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:01.385
YOU KNOW, THEY REALLY DO WANT TO
 THINK OF THEMSELVES TOO AND 

01:05:02.706 --> 01:05:08.685
CONTEXTUALIZE BY THE PEERS AND 
WE SPOKE ABOUT BRADOVICH AND 

01:05:08.984 --> 01:05:10.392
THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT THING FOR 
BOB, TOO.

01:05:10.393 --> 01:05:15.492
AND I WANT TO SAY, IT SEEMS TO 
ME, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THIS 

01:05:15.493 --> 01:05:19.065
WILL RING A BELL OR NOT FOR 
THOSE WHO KNOW HIM, IT TOOK ME A

01:05:19.337 --> 01:05:23.261
 LONG TIME TO REALIZE THE SIMPLE
 TRUTH ABOUT BOB.

01:05:23.262 --> 01:05:27.306
HE WAS ONE OF THE THOSE GUYS 
THAT ALWAYS KEPT YOU WAITING.

01:05:28.284 --> 01:05:32.373
HE CAN WEAR TEN WRIST WATCHES 
AND A STOPWATCH AROUND HIS NECK,

01:05:32.724 --> 01:05:35.904
 HE WAS ALWAYS LATE.
HE WAS NEVER ON TIME.

01:05:35.905 --> 01:05:39.442
HE CAN'T GET OUT OF THE HOUSE 
ONTIME.

01:05:39.443 --> 01:05:43.875
IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO 
REALIZE THAT PROFESSIONALLY HE 

01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:50.424
WAS UP FOR ANYTHING.
A METEOR IS COMING DOWN IN THE 

01:05:50.582 --> 01:05:55.681
MIDDLE OF THE PROTEST MARCH, HOW
 CAN I PHOTOGRAPH THAT?

01:05:55.682 --> 01:05:57.906
PERSONALLY SPEAKING I THINK THE 
WAY THAT HE TRIED TO KEEP A 

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.763
HANDLE ON THINGS, YOU KNOW, A 
VERY STERN KIND OF GRIP THAT HE 

01:06:01.985 --> 01:06:05.358
HAD, WAS THAT HE WOULD NOT BE 
MADE TO CONFORM TO THE CLOCK.

01:06:06.242 --> 01:06:11.634
HE WOULD NOT BE MADE TO GET 
GOING, EVEN IF HE MIGHT MISS 

01:06:11.854 --> 01:06:14.704
WHAT HE NEEDED TO GET TO.
HE HATED TRANSITION.

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:19.690
I JUST REALIZED THAT VERY 
RECENTLY THAT HE WOULD DO ALMOST

01:06:19.904 --> 01:06:24.898
 ANYTHING INCLUDE LOOK BAD, GET 
YELLED AT BECAUSE HE SIMPLY DID 

01:06:25.313 --> 01:06:27.175
NOT WANT TO TOLERATE 
TRANSITIONS.

01:06:27.176 --> 01:06:31.449
I DON'T JUST SAY THAT 
ANECDOTALLY BUT MAYBE THE THINGS

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.516
 THAT WE ALL DO AND NOT AWARE 
OF.

01:06:33.517 --> 01:06:36.789
AND MAYBE NOT QUITE AS EASY TO 
DISCERN ABOUT BOB.

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:39.879
BUT WE ALL HAVE THESE THINGS 
THAT WE DO TO GIVE US A LITTLE 

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.121
HANDLE ON THE WORLD AND TO FEEL 
LIKE YEAH, THINGS ARE ALWAYS 

01:06:45.189 --> 01:06:47.562
COMPLICATED.
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE AND WE HAVE 

01:06:47.756 --> 01:06:50.169
TO WATCH OURSELVES.
WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL.

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:52.160
AND HE WAS ALL OF THE THINGS IN 
HIS WORK.

01:06:52.161 --> 01:06:55.456
AND WHEN HE GOT THERE, YOU 
COULDN'T PRY HIM OUT.

01:06:55.457 --> 01:06:57.457
BUT TO GET BOB OUT THE FRONT 
FRONT  FRONT DOOR, IF YOU

01:06:58.584 --> 01:06:59.347
 HAD BETTER HAD BETTER LUCK THAN

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:04.563
 I DID, CHEERS TO YOU.
HE WAS REALLY WELL WITH THAT.

01:07:04.702 --> 01:07:07.653
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO
 SAY THAT TRANSCENDS AS BEING 

01:07:07.816 --> 01:07:11.955
JUST AN ANECDOTE, I WAS THINKING
 WHAT WILL I SAY?

01:07:11.956 --> 01:07:17.264
I DID SPEND SO MUCH TIME WITH 
HIM UNDER SO MANY DIFFERENT 

01:07:17.498 --> 01:07:19.636
CIRCUMSTANCES.
BUT ONE TIME I WAS THE WRITER 

01:07:21.051 --> 01:07:24.779
AND BOB WAS THE PHOTOGRAPHER OF 
COURSE AND WE WENT OUT TO 

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:29.797
PHOTOGRAPH, YOU KNOW THE 
PAINTING AMERICAN DOLPHIN.

01:07:29.798 --> 01:07:33.281
AND WE WENT OUT TO IOWA.
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:36.255
I WAS THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
IT BEING PAINTED OR SOMETHING 

01:07:36.524 --> 01:07:39.942
LIKE THAT.
BUT IT WAS SOME IMPRESSIVE 

01:07:40.146 --> 01:07:41.298
OCCASION AND WERE DOCUMENTING 
THIS.

01:07:41.299 --> 01:07:43.899
AND WE WENT OUT THERE.
AND BOB DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE

01:07:44.125 --> 01:07:48.469
 VERY AMUSING TO HAVE THE REAL 
HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND AND THEN

01:07:48.676 --> 01:07:53.165
 A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE HOUSE AND 
HE NEEDED SOMEBODY TO HOLD THIS 

01:07:53.505 --> 01:07:57.683
PHOTOGRAPH OF THE HOUSE FOR HIM 
NOT AT STREET LEVEL.

01:07:57.684 --> 01:07:59.675
THAT IS NOT WHAT HE WANTED AT 
ALL.

01:07:59.676 --> 01:08:05.205
HE WANTED IT FROM UP HIGH.
BUT WE WERE IN ELDON, IOWA ABOUT

01:08:06.313 --> 01:08:09.117
 AS FLAT AS THIS FLOOR.
NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER.

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:13.632
AND BOB SAYS, COME ON.
CLIMBS UP ON THE HUGE RENTAL CAR

01:08:13.832 --> 01:08:17.455
 WITH THE HUGE TRIPOD AND 
CAMERAS AND EVERYTHING.

01:08:17.456 --> 01:08:19.422
AND STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE CAR.

01:08:19.423 --> 01:08:24.075
AND SAID COME UP THERE.
SO GREAT.

01:08:24.076 --> 01:08:29.526
I'M STANDING UP THERE ON TOP OF 
THE CAR AND HE HAS GOT ME 

01:08:30.426 --> 01:08:33.811
HOLDING A PHOTOGRAPH THAT HE HAD
 ALREADY TAKEN AND HE SAID PUT 

01:08:34.175 --> 01:08:37.324
YOUR FINGERS LIKE THIS.
AND I AM REALLY HOLDING IT OUT 

01:08:38.371 --> 01:08:44.374
AS MUCH AS I CAN.
AND BOB HAS GONE DOWN ON THE 

01:08:44.530 --> 01:08:48.337
CAR.
AND HE AND THE TRIPOD, LUCKILY 

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:51.055
IF IT COMES FROM BEHIND, IT GOES
 LIKE THIS.

01:08:51.056 --> 01:08:55.426
AND I'M LIKE BOB, BOB.
STANDING UP THERE, TOO.

01:08:55.427 --> 01:09:02.562
THAT'S NOT MY ANECDOTE BUT 
ANOTHER DAY WITH BOB.

01:09:02.563 --> 01:09:05.874
HOWEVER, I WAS LEAVING IOWA TWO 
DAYS BEFORE BOB.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:09.846
AND HE WAS LIKE THE LIFE CREW 
CAN GIVE ME A RIDE TO THE 

01:09:10.019 --> 01:09:12.019
AIRPORT.
BUT YOU JUST RETURN THE RENTAL 

01:09:12.153 --> 01:09:14.452
CAR.
BOB, WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY?

01:09:14.453 --> 01:09:18.339
OH, IT'S THE RENTAL CAR.
YOU KNOW, IT'S A RENTAL CAR, YOU

01:09:20.402 --> 01:09:24.210
 JUST DO YOUR BEST.
BUT I NEED MY LIFE HERE.

01:09:24.211 --> 01:09:27.571
I DRIVE THE CAR IN.
AND HE SAID OH, NO, THEY'RE NOT 

01:09:27.791 --> 01:09:30.570
EVEN GOING TO NOTICE.
THEY LOOK AT THE ODOMETER

01:09:30.571 --> 01:09:32.518
ODOMETER ANDODOMETER AND THEY

01:09:32.519 --> 01:09:35.772
 LOOK AT IF YOU LEAVE ANYTHING 
IN THE TRUNK.

01:09:35.773 --> 01:09:40.415
HE COULD BE SO CONVINCING THAT 
SOMETIMES I REALLY WANTED TO 

01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:43.784
BELIEVE IT.
AND PEOPLE LOOK AS THE CAR IS 

01:09:44.337 --> 01:09:47.468
COMING INTO THE LOT.
AND IT'S LIKE THE CAR COMES INTO

01:09:47.698 --> 01:09:52.142
 THE LOT.
AND IT'S LIKE THIS.

01:09:52.143 --> 01:09:54.588
AND WHAT HAPPENS?
AND I SAID WHAT HAPPENED WITH 

01:09:54.796 --> 01:09:56.796
THAT.
[LAUGHTER].

01:10:00.012 --> 01:10:06.867
AND HE SAID, THE ROOF.
AND I WENT -- I SAID I DON'T 

01:10:07.165 --> 01:10:08.793
KNOW.
AND HE  SAID, SAID, YOU WANT TO

01:10:08.794 --> 01:10:10.939
 TAKE A GUESS.
AND I SAID A 

01:10:16.241 --> 01:10:19.507
METEOR.
AND THEN OF COURSE IT ALL TURNED

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:22.836
 OUT ALL RIGHT, LEAST FOR ME.
BOB WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S 

01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:25.919
WORKING FOR THE MAGAZINE.
MAGAZINE.

01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:27.642
THEY UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THESE 
SORT OF SETBACKS ON ASSIGNMENT.

01:10:27.785 --> 01:10:29.700
AND YOU JUST DO THE BEST YOU 
CAN.

01:10:29.701 --> 01:10:33.450
SO HE WAS REALLY AN ARTIST.
HE WAS NOT JUST OUT THERE.

01:10:33.451 --> 01:10:36.258
BELIEVE ME, HE WAS REALLY DOING 
THE BEST HE COULD.

01:10:36.259 --> 01:10:41.960
AND HAVE SEEN SUCH ABSOLUTELY 
AMAZING THINGS TODAY.

01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:46.128
AND JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH 
ONE VERY BRIEF QUOTE THAT 

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.941
BECAUSE BOB WAS SO MODEST AND IF
 ANYONE COMPLIMENTED HIM OR 

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:52.815
ANYTHING LIKE THAT, YOU WOULD 
NEVER HEAR ABOUT IT.

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:56.409
BUT IN THE FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPH OF 
BIRMINGHAM WITH THE FIRE 

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.219
HYDRANTS AND THE PEOPLE AND SO 
FORTH, WHAT BOB SAID ABOUT THAT 

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.027
DAY WAS THAT THERE WAS AS MUCH 
WATER BEHIND THE CAMERAS AS 

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.739
THERE WAS IN FRONT OF IT.
AND IT'S JUST AN AMAZING 

01:11:07.947 --> 01:11:10.713
PHOTOGRAPH.
AND HE HUNG IN THERE, TOO, TO 

01:11:10.816 --> 01:11:14.400
GET THAT.
AND IT WASN'T LIKE HE STANDS 

01:11:14.722 --> 01:11:16.329
THERE AND DIDN'T SEE THAT HE WAS
 THERE.

01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:18.540
VERY BRAVE PERSON.
AND HE GOT THAT WONDERFUL 

01:11:18.877 --> 01:11:21.326
PHOTOGRAPH AND WHICH I DIDN'T 
KNOW UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY, HE 

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:26.714
PRINTED IT UP FAIRLY QUICKLY AND
 GAVE IT TO DR. MARTIN LUTHER 

01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:29.765
KING AND SAID ABOUT THAT 
PHOTOGRAPH, I AM STARTLED THAT I

01:11:30.164 --> 01:11:35.452
 HAVE SO MUCH PAIN AND BEAUTY.
AND WHEN YOU SAY IT DOESN'T DO 

01:11:35.616 --> 01:11:38.989
ANY SOCIAL GOOD OR DOES IT NOT.
I'M SURE FROM TIME TO TIME, IF 

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:43.421
NOT CONSTANTLY TORTURED BY THIS,
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AN ARTIST 

01:11:43.612 --> 01:11:47.173
TO BE TORTURED BY THAT.
WHAT I DO, DOES IT REALLY 

01:11:47.549 --> 01:11:50.893
MATTER.
BUT I THINK IT WAS CERTAIN 

01:11:51.266 --> 01:11:56.216
COMMENTS LIKE THAT THAT WERE 
TREMENDOUSLY ENCOURAGING TO BOB 

01:11:56.414 --> 01:11:57.826
AND RIGHT ON.
THANK YOU.

01:11:57.827 --> 01:11:59.827
[APPLAUSE].

01:12:06.215 --> 01:12:08.973
SPEAKER:  ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE SOME TIME FOR QUESTION, 

01:12:09.144 --> 01:12:12.823
ANSWER, OR IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
HAVE A MIC AND ADD A MEMORY OF 

01:12:13.175 --> 01:12:19.579
BOB TO OUR WEB CAST, WE WOULD BE
 VERY PLEASED TO HEAR FROM YOU.

01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:24.618
AS IT COMES AROUND, I WOULD LIKE
 TO ACKNOWLEDGE SAM RAY.

01:12:24.619 --> 01:12:28.412
PLEASE STAND UP.
THIS IS BOB ADELMAN'S DAUGHTER.

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:31.713
[APPLAUSE].
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE SISTERS 

01:12:32.233 --> 01:12:33.677
AND GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHER 
FAMILY MEMBERS.

01:12:33.678 --> 01:12:40.118
WOULD YOU MIND STANDING BRIEFLY?
DURING THE RECEPTION, YOU WILL 

01:12:40.324 --> 01:12:45.541
KNOW WHO IS WHO.
[APPLAUSE].

01:12:45.542 --> 01:12:50.143
AND A BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF 
PHOTOGRAPHS IS BROUGHT TO US BY 

01:12:50.296 --> 01:12:52.296
STEVEN WATT.

01:12:56.954 --> 01:12:59.589
[APPLAUSE].
AND DOES ANYONE HAVE A QUESTION?

01:12:59.904 --> 01:13:03.654
EITHER FOR THE PANELIST OR 
STEVEN OR FAMILY MEMBERS?

01:13:03.655 --> 01:13:09.168
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW
 ABOUT MR. ADELMAN?

01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:12.113
SPEAKER:  I WANT TO SHARE A 
BRIEF STORY.

01:13:12.114 --> 01:13:14.840
SPEAKER:  PLEASE WAIT FOR THE 
HAND MIC AND THAT WAY CAN BE FOR

01:13:15.212 --> 01:13:17.212
 EVERYONE TO HEAR US. 
SPEAKER:  MY NAME IS RICHARD 

01:13:18.576 --> 01:13:21.558
MILLNER.
I MET BOB ON A TALK SHOW.

01:13:21.559 --> 01:13:25.034
WE WERE BOTH SPEAKING ABOUT 
BOOKS WE HAD JUST WRITTEN THAT 

01:13:25.163 --> 01:13:28.728
CAME OUT.
IT WAS IN 1971.

01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:30.729
I HAD

01:13:33.759 --> 01:13:36.856
 DONE A BOOK ON BLACK PIMPS AND 
THEIR WOMEN.

01:13:36.857 --> 01:13:43.527
IT WAS CALLED SECRET PLAYERS.
AND BOB HAD DONE A BOOK CALLED 

01:13:44.121 --> 01:13:46.648
GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE WHICH WAS A
 BEST SELLER.

01:13:46.649 --> 01:13:49.357
AND BOB'S BOOK SOLD MUCH BETTER 
THAN MINE.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:54.406
FIRST OF ALL, MINE WAS MORE 
ACADEMIC AND SECONDLY, IT HAD NO

01:13:55.145 --> 01:13:59.191
 PICTURES.
AND WHEN I SUGGESTED TO THE

01:14:03.173 --> 01:14:08.052
  PUBLISHER BROWN THAT WE SHOULD
 HAVE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS, EVERYONE

01:14:08.053 --> 01:14:12.245
 TOLD US IT'S ABSOLUTELY 
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO A PHOTO ON 

01:14:12.394 --> 01:14:15.848
BLACK PIMPS AND THE WOMEN AND IT
 WAS A SECRET WORLD.

01:14:15.849 --> 01:14:18.280
AND YOU DIDN'T GET INTO THAT 
WORLD.

01:14:18.281 --> 01:14:21.542
WELL, OF COURSE ONE MAN DID GET 
INTO THAT WORLD.

01:14:21.543 --> 01:14:25.969
BOB, AND HE DID A FANTASTIC 
PHOTO ESSAY OF A MAN CALLED 

01:14:27.599 --> 01:14:37.541
SOKEY AND HIS WOMEN.
AND UM, IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND 

01:14:38.255 --> 01:14:43.905
INTIMATE LOOK.
AND THE WORLD, BOB AND I WERE 

01:14:47.433 --> 01:14:54.184
BOTH SORT OF UM -- NOT ONLY TO 
UNDERSTAND ACROSS THE RACIAL 

01:14:54.399 --> 01:14:56.399
DIVIDE, THE FINE FINE PEOPLE

01:14:58.665 --> 01:15:00.275
 LIKE  DR. KING, DR. KING, BUT

01:15:00.276 --> 01:15:04.699
 ALSO THE ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE 
THE ONES YOU SEE IN THE MARCHES.

01:15:05.031 --> 01:15:10.913
AND EVEN MAYBE THE BAD PEOPLE, 
BECAUSE A ROUNDED VIEW

01:15:14.162 --> 01:15:19.329
 OF HUMAN BEINGS, TO BOB AND MY 
SENSIBILITIES REQUIRED THAT.

01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:24.731
WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL, 
MY FELLOW GRADUATE SCHOOLS HAD 

01:15:24.877 --> 01:15:28.049
STUDENTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
 AND VILLAGES AND EVERYTHING.

01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:31.812
AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING DOWN THE BLOCK.

01:15:31.813 --> 01:15:35.695
AND THEY COULDN'T SPEAK THE 
LANGUAGE, WHICH IS NOW BY THE 

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:39.143
WAY INCORPORATED INTO AMERICAN 
ENGLISH.

01:15:39.144 --> 01:15:45.147
WHAT IS A BITCH?
A HOE.

01:15:45.148 --> 01:15:47.365
AT THE TIME IT WAS BLACK HUSTLER
 LANGUAGE.

01:15:47.366 --> 01:15:52.316
AND BOB AND SUSAN HALL WROTE A 
DICTIONARY OF IT IN THE BOOK.

01:15:52.583 --> 01:15:55.840
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 
PLEASED ME SO MUCH WAS THAT WHEN

01:15:56.244 --> 01:15:59.579
 I WAS DOING MINE, I HAD 
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA IF I WAS 

01:15:59.773 --> 01:16:01.773
GETTING IT RIGHT.
AND THE PEOPLE I WAS 

01:16:02.944 --> 01:16:06.117
INTERVIEWING, GIVING ME 
INFORMATION THAT HAD A BROADER 

01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:08.943
CONTEXT.
AND BOB HAD THE SAME CONCERNS.

01:16:09.158 --> 01:16:11.158
AND WHEN WE MET AND COMPARED 

01:16:14.605 --> 01:16:20.243
NOTES AND WE FOUND THAT TWO 
COMPLETELY OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE

01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:22.932
 COUNTRY FOUND 

01:16:28.435 --> 01:16:31.519
SOCIOLOGICALLY AND 
HUMANISTICALLY, WE REVIEWED EACH

01:16:31.854 --> 01:16:34.896
 OTHER.
AND WE APPEARED ON A TALK SHOW.

01:16:35.266 --> 01:16:37.859
SPEAKER:  THAT'S WONDERFUL.
ANOTHER ASPECT OF INTEREST IN 

01:16:38.757 --> 01:16:40.506
PEOPLE FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS AND 
LIVES.

01:16:40.507 --> 01:16:41.533
SPEAKER:  YEAH.
YEAH.

01:16:41.534 --> 01:16:43.888
SPEAKER:  I WOULD ASK IF THERE 
IS ANOTHER QUESTION?

01:16:43.889 --> 01:16:49.162
SPEAKER:  IF I MAY I WANT TO 
TELL YOU ONE OTHER STORY.

01:16:49.163 --> 01:16:53.037
YEARS LATER, I KEPT UP WITH BOB 
VERY CLOSELY OVER THE YEARS, AND

01:16:53.996 --> 01:16:58.181
 ONE DAY I WAS DOING A STORY ON 
THE CIRCUS FOR ESQUIRE, WHICH 

01:16:58.606 --> 01:17:02.148
NEVER GOT PUBLISHED FOR VARIOUS 
REASONS.

01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:07.777
BUT NOW THE CIRCUS IS CLOSING, 
I'M GOING TO TRY IT AGAIN.

01:17:07.778 --> 01:17:09.778
BECAUSE I INTERVIEWED

01:17:11.566 --> 01:17:16.129
 WILLIAMS, THE GREATEST ANIMAL 
TRAINER IN THE WORLD WHO HAD 

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:18.628
TIGERS AND ELEPHANTS AND 
EVERYTHING ELSE.

01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:21.139
AND AT LAST, I GOT ACCESS

01:17:24.866 --> 01:17:28.497
 TO THE CIRCUS THROUGH ESQUIRE 
ON THE LAST DAY.

01:17:28.498 --> 01:17:33.077
AND WHEN I WAS OWN THERE, I SAID
 TO BOB, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME 

01:17:33.273 --> 01:17:35.188
DOWN WITH ME FOR THE LAST DAY 
AND PHOTOGRAPH?

01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:38.791
HE SAID I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO A 
CIRCUS STORY.

01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:40.274
SURE.
I WILL BE THERE.

01:17:40.275 --> 01:17:46.800
AND HE SHOWED UP AND THE 
RINGLING CIRCUS WAS AT MADISON 

01:17:47.292 --> 01:17:52.957
SQUARE GARDEN AND AS WE WALKED 
IN, A PARADE OF ELEPHANTS COME 

01:17:53.125 --> 01:17:57.620
IN, RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.
AND BOB GOES UP TO THE ELEPHANTS

01:17:57.826 --> 01:18:02.419
 AND STARTS PUNCHING THE 
ELEPHANTS IN THE ASS.

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:06.188
BOB, YOU ARE PUNCHING THE 
ELEPHANTS.

01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:07.560
HE IS TRYING TO GET A STORY.
AND HE CAN BE VERY, VERY  VERY 

01:18:07.561 --> 01:18:09.561
AGGRESSIVE. VERY AGGRESSIVE.
AND NOTHING STOOD IN HIS WAY.

01:18:11.044 --> 01:18:19.018
WHEN WE GOT INTO THE CENTER 
RING, HAD THE TRAINED TIGERS AND

01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:23.437
 THEY CAME UP TO US, AND THEY 
SAID TO BOB.

01:18:23.438 --> 01:18:26.362
NOW, WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU 
PHOTOGRAPH FROM IN HERE WHICH WE

01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:30.021
 NEVER DO.
AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE 

01:18:30.212 --> 01:18:33.745
THING.
DO NOT GO RIGHT UP TO THE CAGE 

01:18:34.035 --> 01:18:37.175
AND PUT YOUR LIMBS THROUGH THE 
BARS.

01:18:37.176 --> 01:18:40.318
BECAUSE THE TIGERS WOULD -- YOU 
COULD GET KILLED THAT WAY.

01:18:40.319 --> 01:18:43.813
STAND BACK AND YOU KNOW, DO WHAT
 YOU CAN WITH YOUR LONG LENSES, 

01:18:43.996 --> 01:18:46.830
AND SO ON.
SO WE DO THAT FOR A FEW MINUTES.

01:18:47.053 --> 01:18:49.388
AND BOB TURNED TO ME AND SAID 
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

01:18:49.389 --> 01:18:50.738
I'M NOT PHOTOGRAPHING THIS FROM 
BACK HERE.

01:18:50.739 --> 01:18:54.072
THE BARS ARE IN THE WAY.
AND WITHOUT HESITATION, HE WENT 

01:18:54.409 --> 01:19:00.555
RIGHT UP TO THE TIGER CAGE AND 
STUCK HIS LIMBS THROUGH THE BARS

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.089
 AND PUT HIS CHEEK RIGHT NEXT TO
 IT.

01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:07.671
AND I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT 
BOB, WHEN HE WAS LOOKING THROUGH

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:12.187
 A CAMERA LENS, HE DISAPPEARED 
TO HIMSELF.

01:19:12.188 --> 01:19:14.188
HE WAS THE CAMERA.
HE COULDN'T GET GET 

01:19:15.701 --> 01:19:18.765
HURT.
THAT'S HOW HE DID THE MARCHES 

01:19:20.329 --> 01:19:23.969
WITH THE WATER AND EVERYTHING 
ELSE AND THE DOGS.

01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:27.620
HE DIDN'T FEEL PERSONAL DANGER.
HE WAS HIS CAMERA.

01:19:27.621 --> 01:19:32.800
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERED.
NOW I'M GOING TO GET EMOTIONAL.

01:19:33.008 --> 01:19:36.735
SO HE GOT THE PICTURES.
I STILL HAVE THEM SOMEWHERE.

01:19:36.736 --> 01:19:42.252
THEY WERE NEVER PUBLISHED.
SPEAKER:  I THINK YOU MAY HAVE 

01:19:42.941 --> 01:19:47.367
GIVEN US A PERFECT STORY LINE.
SPEAKER:  WELL THEN LET ME END 

01:19:47.368 --> 01:19:50.612
IT THERE.
AND LET ME SAY ONE OTHER THING.

01:19:50.993 --> 01:19:56.780
BOB HAD A REPUTATION, AND COULD 
BE VERY ROUGH AND COULD BE VERY 

01:20:02.192 --> 01:20:05.782
DISPUTATIOUS AND WE HAD OUR 
DISAGREEMENTS AND I THINK TO ME 

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:12.324
PERSONALLY, AND MANY IN THIS 
ROOM, HE WAS THE KINDEST, MOST 

01:20:12.566 --> 01:20:17.349
GENEROUS PERSON WHO EXTENDED HIS
 HANDS TO AN UNKNOWN

01:20:20.413 --> 01:20:22.413
 WRITER AND

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:28.511
 TREATED ME GREAT LIKE ANYBODY 
ELSE.

01:20:28.512 --> 01:20:32.186
SPEAKER:  THAT IS FOR ALL OF US 
TODAY.

01:20:32.187 --> 01:20:34.407
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

01:20:34.408 --> 01:20:36.408
[APPLAUSE].

01:20:39.888 --> 01:20:44.664
AND WE THINK WE HAVE COME TO A 
GREAT END, AND WE WILL INVITE 

01:20:44.877 --> 01:20:52.098
YOU TO THE RECEPTION FOOD AND WE
 LAY OUT MANY OF THE BOOKS AND 

01:20:52.328 --> 01:20:58.627
PHOTOGRAPHS THAT BOB HAS 
PRODUCED AND AFTER YOU HAVE 

01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:01.209
ENJOYED, THERE ARE PHOTOGRAPHS 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.

01:21:01.512 --> 01:21:02.572
PLEASE HAVE WONDERFUL 
CONVERSATION.
