00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.070
We're speaking today with Heidi
Shierholz, the chief economist

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.810
at the US Department of Labor.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.630
Heidi follows the job trends
and occupational opportunities

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.690
around the country.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.160
And so this is a
good opportunity

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.650
to discuss where some
of the good jobs are.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.470
So Heidi, thank you
for joining us today.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.178
It's my pleasure.

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:24.140
I wonder if you could
start by telling

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.200
us what do you see as
some of the good job

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.800
opportunities for young people
entering the labor force today?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200
I think it's important
to know that there

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.060
are a lot of good
jobs being created.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.660
There are a lot of
good opportunities.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.790
And if you look, our
Bureau of Labor Statistics

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.520
does these employment
projections,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.160
where you can look and
see what kind of jobs

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.770
are growing strongly
for the next 10 years,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.360
what kind of wages
will those jobs have.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.447
And there's some
trends that come out

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:52.530
of that, that you can see.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.970
So some of the
fastest growing jobs

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.140
are jobs in the health
sector, particularly nurses--

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.820
really strong wages and
really strong job growth.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.680
We also see good job
growth in the tech sector,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.660
so software engineering,
software development,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.200
those kinds of jobs
are growing quickly.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.600
You also see projected
growth in some jobs

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.230
in professional and
business services

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.550
like accountant jobs
and auditing jobs,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.200
sort of those old standbys.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.930
We're going to always need
them, and they're really

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.210
decent paying jobs.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570
So that's at the high
end of the labor force.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.242
How about at the middle
tier of the labor force.

00:01:29.242 --> 00:01:30.200
What's happening there?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.580
One of the phenomenons
that we're seeing there

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.860
is there's this
big group of people

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.630
who are hitting retirement
age, the baby boomers.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.020
And as that continues
to happen, there's

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.550
going to be a lot of
job turnover in some

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.800
of these really good
middle class jobs

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.460
like carpenter jobs, electrician
jobs, utility workers, welders.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.200
Those kinds of jobs
that historically people

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.230
got a lot of training
in those kind of jobs

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.620
through their unions and
apprenticeship programs.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.790
As we have this
group of people that

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.280
was trained in that way
hitting retirement age,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.380
we have to really
figure out how we're

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.940
going to refill those jobs.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.440
One of the things the
Department of Labor is doing

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.760
is really doing everything we
can to support apprenticeship

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.900
programs so they can
help train up people

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.900
to get into those jobs,
because those are really

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.380
good middle class jobs that
are going to be very in demand

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.790
going forward.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.690
Well that's great,
because apprenticeships

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.820
have such a positive
record, so rebuilding those

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.630
is so critical to our economy
and the future workforce.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.130
Research shows apprenticeship
has the highest rate of return

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.780
as far as investment in workers,
what pays off for the economy,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.950
for their future earnings.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.390
So it's a really good
route for our country

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.460
to invest in and for people to
take advantage of as they're

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.500
thinking about what
their careers are going

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.640
to look like going forward.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.610
And what about at
the lower end of

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.270
the occupational distribution?

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.920
The projections show
that we are expected

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.970
to add a lot of jobs
that, at this point,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.770
are low wage jobs: home
health aides, food prep

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.110
workers in restaurants and bars,
child care workers, janitors,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.530
maids and housekeeping cleaners.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.140
So some of these
lower end jobs are

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.050
projected to see strong
growth going forward.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.680
So I think that's a really
important segment of the labor

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.080
market to think about.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.320
And that's where
policy can come in

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.190
to help make sure that
those are better jobs.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.440
So things like making sure we
have a decent minimum wage--

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.950
increasing the minimum wage.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.270
Making sure people have
overtime protections.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.430
Making sure that
people have paid leave.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.470
The president just
announced initiatives

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.430
to bolster paid leave
in the United States.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.390
Those kinds of policies
can help ensure

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.480
that we have high
quality jobs for people

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.220
at all levels of
education and training.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.530
Certainly important
that we really

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.640
help to improve
those low wage jobs

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.750
and provide career opportunities
for growth, and so on.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.720
What else would you
say that young people

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.700
need to do to prepare for
the good jobs of the future?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.080
Thinking about investments in
your own training and education

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.990
over the course of your
career is a really smart idea.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.910
One of the things
people should be

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.620
doing is asking their employers
for what opportunities there

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.920
are for advancement,
asking your union

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.510
what can you do to help support
these kind of career ladders,

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.540
looking into things like joint
union and management programs

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.520
that support these
kind of career ladders.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.650
For example, there's
programs that

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.130
will help people go from a
nursing assistant, to an LPN,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.580
to a registered nurse.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.620
And if you can
think of supporting

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.120
those kinds of
trajectories, you can really

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.230
carve out a career
that really let's

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.190
you punch the ticket
to the middle class.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.520
I think that's good advice.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.200
Young people have
lots of opportunities

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.770
and they have to
create new ones along

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.789
with the partnership of
the Department of Labor,

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.830
and good employers, and
good labor organizations.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.210
So thank you very much.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.520
It's been my pleasure.
