00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.470
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Thank you
everyone for joining us.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.220
I'm Carla Hayden, Librarian
of Congress and I'm here

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.320
in our beautiful main reading room
for a very special announcement.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.000
Tonight I'm going to share with
you the names of the authors

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.740
who will appear on the
main stage of the Library

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.600 position:56%
of Congress National Book Festival
on September 2nd and I am announcing

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.090
that for the first time, all

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.570
of the main stage author
presentations will be accessible

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.510
to you on Facebook Live.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.250
[applause]

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.740
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And of course
joining me is Ron Charles,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.050
Book Editor of the Washington Post

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.140
and now the National Book
Festival is made possible

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.480
by generous supporters

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.570
and the Washington Post has been
a charter sponsor and a supporter

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.500
of the festival since its
very first year in 2001.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.900
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's been
a pleasure to be here.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.280
Now, the festival has been the
highlight of my year every year.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.010
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Oh good
because you know the authors.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.310
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I do.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.610
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And you
know them intimately.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.730
And I thought that it would be fun
to talk with you about the line

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.430 position:56%
up as we announce it and to get some
of your thoughts about the authors.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.730
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's
great to be here.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.390
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: So before
we get started though,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.250
I just want to mention that we're
so grateful for the sponsors

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.940
of this event who make
it possible each year.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.950
And first, I'd just like to
thank our National Book Festival

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.650
co-chairman, Mr. David Rubenstein,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.530
without whom the festival
would not be possible.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.370
And I'd also like to thank
our charter sponsors,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.820
the Institute of Museum
and Library Services

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.080
and the Library's James
Madison Council

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.350
and the Washington
Post and Wells Fargo.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.330
And our patron sponsor, the
National Endowment for the Arts

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.060
and many other contributors
and friends.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.930 position:56%
So, without further ado, here we go.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.680
The first author who will be on
the main stage and live streamed

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.180
from the festival is one of
our most revered historians,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.510
David McCullough.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.320
[applause]

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.870
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: The winner
of two Pulitzer prizes

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.990
and the Presidential Medal of
Freedom and his latest book is,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.710
The American Spirit: Who We
Are and What We Stand For.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.110
And Ron I know you have
thoughts on Mr. McCullough.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.690
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's just great
to have David McCullough here

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.060
because he is one of our
country's greatest historians

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.930
and certainly one of our most
beloved historians in book

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.220
after book like Truman
and John Adams.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.410
He's been able to present the
past in a way that's accessible

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.630
and illuminating and gives us
all a sense of where we are.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.240
It's one thing to be able
to do research in a way

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.840
that David McCullough does,
but it's another thing to do it

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.870
in such a fundamental and ancient
way as to tell a captivating story.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.840
You know, to involve
people in that history.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.160
And as you know, he's a
great champion of libraries.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.460
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Yes.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.830
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And in
this particular library,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.110
I heard him speak here
a few years ago.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.680
He delivered one of the most
impassioned and moving defenses

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.910
of why we need to support
our libraries.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.630
It was a personal testimony to
what the library means to him

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.010
and his research and for anyone who
wants to learn about our country.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.270
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: He's one of my
favorites as you can imagine.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.640 position:56%
He has used the Library of Congress'
resources for many many years

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.650
and he is a great supporter.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.840
And now the next author.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.270
Now this is the wildly
popular Diana Gabaldon.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.630
Did I say it correctly?

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.930
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Very close.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Ok, you correct me.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.530
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Diana Gabaldon.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.580
I'm so excited she's coming back.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.970
I met her at this festival
about ten years ago.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.230
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And her
newest book is Seven Stones

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.130
to Stand or Fall stories.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.450
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes, now when I met
her ten years ago she was popular,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.750
very, very popular.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.780
But now she is so much
more wildly popular

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.730 position:56%
because of her Outlanders series and
the TV show based on that series.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.810
She's a fantastic speaker.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.860 position:56%
She's very funny and she has this
fascinating backstory too, you know.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.390
She has a PhD in ecology.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.850
Yeah and she's a computer scientist
and she just decided on a whim once

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.390
that she would see what it was
like to write a historical novel.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.030
She was inspired by Dr. Who
and so she just sat down

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.280
and started doing research and then
from that came all of the novels

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.570
and the beloved characters that we
know from the Outlanders series.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.350
This story about a
woman who goes back

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.110
to 18th century Scotland
and falls in love.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.410
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Oh wow.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.950
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Since meeting
her in Washington here years ago,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.150
she started to review for
the Washington Post a couple

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.660
of times a year and she
is always a delight.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.960
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Well,
I'm going to practice

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.090
and make sure I pronounce
her name correctly.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.390
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: She won't mind.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.200
She'd love to meet you.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.320
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Well, the third
author in our exciting line

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.600
up is J. D. Vance who has written
a powerful account of growing

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.130
up in a poor rust belt town and
it's entitled: Hillbilly Elegy.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.990
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Everybody I know in
Washington and across the country,

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.840
is talking about this memoir.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.460
As you say, it's a
remarkable story about growing

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.460
up in a poor rust belt
town in a broken family,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.620
pretty dramatically broken family.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.300
But, J. D. Vance managed to
graduate from high school,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.950
to join the Marines and
then go to Yale law school

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.390
and then become a venture
capitalist.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.740
And last year he published this
memoir about his life that gives us

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.730
such an insight into a huge segment
of the white underclass that most

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.910
of us don't have access to.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.030
And in addition to being
a really stunning story,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.330
it offers a unique insight into the
political revolution that we saw

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.400
in last year's presidential
election.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.190
And it raises some difficult
questions about what we can do

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.520
or even how we should
help these people who are

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.040
such a major part of America.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: I've heard so many
people talk about this book in terms

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.150
of policy and what's
been going on lately.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.720
So, this book is really
on the best-seller list

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.150
and also in lots of discussions.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.330
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And you know
after each author speaks,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.630
people can ask questions.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.930
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Yes.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.230
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And that's going

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.530
to be the most provocative
parts of this presentation.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.540
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: I can't wait
because the next notable appearing

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.430
on the main stage is
the best-selling,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.340
The World is Flat author,
Tom Friedman

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.930
and his latest book is Thank You
for Being Late: An Optimist's Guide

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.590
for Thriving in the
Age of Accelerations.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.510 position:56%
And I think we all are feeling that.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.350
[applause]

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.650
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Tom Friedman,

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.010
the New York Times columnist
has been explaining the world

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.430
to all of us for years.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.230
He's won three Pulitzer prizes
and in books like The Lexus

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.170
and the Olive Tree and as
you said, The World is Flat,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.780
he's shown himself to
be an illuminating guide

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.930
to our rapidly changing world and
his new book takes on that subject

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.700
that is change and
acceleration as its very subject,

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.050
Thank You for Being Late.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.860
It's what he calls an
Optimist's Guide for Thriving

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.280
in the Age of Acceleration.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.170
When everything seems so
chaotic and we're all writing off

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.070
in so many directions at
once, Friedman has a way

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.530
of showing us how things
are connected.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.980
And in this book, he shows us
how technology, globalization,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.460
and climate change are all
accelerating from basic forces

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.000
that he explains and shows
how those forces will continue

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.070
to change our community
and our politics.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.260
It sounds really wide
ranging and it is.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.990
But, rather than feeling
overwhelmed, what Friedman does

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.410
so well is help you get a sense

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.730
of how you can live a more
thoughtful life amid all

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.110
of this change.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.790
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: I'm hoping
to find some answers in there

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.860
and to talk with him about it.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.200
And then, I'm really
thrilled to announce the name

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.680
of our next main stage author,
former Secretary of State,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.510
Condoleezza Rice who has written.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.100
[applause]

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.650
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: a
comprehensive history

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.110
of America's struggle toward
democracy in her book, Democracy:

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.570
The Long Road to Freedom.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.380 position:56%
And I think that thoughtful
approach to this road that we're all

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.040
on together is going
to be something.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.340
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Getting guests

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.150 position:56%
like Condoleezza Rice is what the
National Book Festival is all about.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.610
Here is a woman who has
established so many firsts

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.650
for women and African Americans.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.950
She is a remarkable person.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.430
She was Secretary of State, she
was National Security Advisor.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.730
She's been in the middle of some

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.500
of the most fundamental
geo-political changes

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.340
of our lifetime, certainly.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.640
And she's a professor.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.940
Time Magazine named her as one

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.570
of the world's most hundred
influential people four times.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.000
And her new book, oh she
also holds the record

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.840
for having traveled the most number
of miles as Secretary of State.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.880 position:56%
And her new book, Democracy: Stories
from the Long Road to Freedom,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.930 position:56%
she lays out in clear and convincing
ways why promoting democracy is

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.010
still so crucial for the United
States and that is an argument

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.040
that has become pretty
essential to our country

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.820 position:56%
after the new presidential election.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.850
So, that is a debate she's
right in the middle of,

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.410
we're all talking a lot about.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.660
And I think it's pretty fantastic
that we're going to have her here,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.040
hear from her book, and
then ask her questions.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.030
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: That's the
thing about the Book Festival

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.400
and this opportunity to
interact with authors

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.340
that you might not get a chance to
see any other time and to be part.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:23.350 position:56%
And our final author on the National
Book Festival's main stage is a

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.020
perennial on the New York Times
best-seller list and someone

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.770
that it's very interesting that
we'll get a chance to meet him

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.080
and see him and that's
David Baldacci.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.730
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: He is amazing.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.530
He's written as you know...

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:46.190
[applause]

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.810
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: more
than thirty best sellers,

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.940
more than a hundred
million copies in print.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.920
And did you know that he
once imagined and wrote

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.560
about a murder here at the library?

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.860
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Oh no.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.160
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.130
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: I think that
things happened around here.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.540
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah, he killed
off the head of Rare Books

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.450
and Special Collections
in one of his books.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.220
Anyhow, David goes
back here a long ways.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.020
He was born and raised in Virginia.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.930
As a teenager, he delivered
newspapers,

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.720
which are things people used to
find in the yards every morning.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.330
After law school, he practiced
law here in Washington,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.620
DC and then about twenty years
ago, he wrote his first novel.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.750
He sold it, everything changed.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.000
Clint Eastwood made a movie about
it and sense then as you said,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.150
he's been on the best-seller
list pretty much all the time.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.910 position:56%
He's got this ingenious imagination,
so much so that certain members

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.660
of our government have
interviewed him

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.580
about how terrorists might attack
the United States so they can plan

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.460
and thwart those attacks.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.620
But, here's a really
wonderful thing about him,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.630
he and his wife Michelle
are changing people's lives

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.930
in the most profound way.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.210
They have a charity called
The Wish You Well foundation

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.960
that encourages family and adult
literacy all across the country

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.030
and because hunger is
so tied to illiteracy,

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.870
their organization also works
to cure hunger in America too.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.150
He is a really, really great
guy, a real hero of mine.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.570
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Right and
to be able to make that tie

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.980
and let people know about the
tie between hunger and illiteracy

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.150
and the need to solve both at
the same time is significant.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.450
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It is.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: This is going to be
an exciting year, especially for all

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.650
of the fans of the authors
who are watching tonight

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.950
