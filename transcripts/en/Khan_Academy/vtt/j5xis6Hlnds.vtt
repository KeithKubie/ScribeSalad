00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.500
Perform a dilation on
the coordinate plane.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.300
The dilation should be
centered at 9, negative 9,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.780
and have a scale factor of 3.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.180
So we get our dilation tool out.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.400
We'll center it-- actually, so
it's already actually centered

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.222
at 9, negative 9.

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:14.680
We could put this
wherever we want,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.490
but let's center it
at 9, negative 9.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.880
And we want to
scale this up by 3.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.960
So one way to think about it
is, pick any of these points

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.210
right over here, and they're
going to have to get 3 times

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.520
further away from our
center of dilation.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.047
So for example, this
point C-- actually

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:36.130
let's think about these
points where they actually

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.960
want us to fill something in.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.600
So point A right over here, it
is at the point 4, negative 3.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.810
So in the x direction,
it is 5 less than 9.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.770
We want it to be 3
times further than 9.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.700
So we want it to
be 15 less than 9.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.840
So we want the x-coordinate of
A, 9 minus 15 is negative 6.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.730
We want it to go to negative 6.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.300
And likewise, we want its
y-coordinate to be 3 times

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.020
further.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.380
So right now, let's
see, it is at negative 3

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.450
relative to negative 9, so it
is 6 more on the y direction.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.570
We want it to be 18 more.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.740
18 more than negative
9 would be positive 9.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.360
So point A should map
to negative 6 comma 9.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.120
And that should give
us enough information

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.160
to just make sure that we are
dilating up by a factor of 3.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.900
So let's see.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.950
Let's dilate up
by a factor of 3.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.850
So we want to get the image of
point A to the point negative 6

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.920
comma 9.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.882
So we are there.

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:45.790
There we go.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.336
We have dilated it up.

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:48.710
And then we could
even look where

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.000
the point that corresponds
to E has mapped to.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.330
And you can look at each
direction, it's 3 times

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.830
further.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.460
E is now at negative
6 comma negative 3.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.820
The images of point A
and E are 3 times as far

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.690
as the original points.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.220
3 times far apart, I should
say, as the original points.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.544
And they're 3 times further
from our center of dilation

00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:21.210
right over here.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.680
You see, for example, point
E has the x-coordinate of 4,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.860
which is 5 less.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.710
Now it is at
negative 6, which is

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.370
15 less than our
center of dilation.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.600
And the same thing true,
its y-coordinate is 2 more.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.340
And now after we mapped
it, its y-coordinate

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.670
is 6 more than our
center of dilation.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.470
Got it right.
