00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
what happens with the postmodernist as

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860
what happens with the postmodernist as
 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.379
what happens with the postmodernist as
they say oh there's an infinite number

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389
they say oh there's an infinite number
 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.930
they say oh there's an infinite number
of interpretations and then the human

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940
of interpretations and then the human
 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.110
of interpretations and then the human
part of them goes okay well what am I

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120
part of them goes okay well what am I
 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.690
part of them goes okay well what am I
supposed to do next then since there's

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
supposed to do next then since there's
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.910
supposed to do next then since there's
an infinite number of choices and the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920
an infinite number of choices and the
 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.530
an infinite number of choices and the
postmodernist says well my theory can't

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
postmodernist says well my theory can't
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.120
postmodernist says well my theory can't
account for that and then they say well

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
account for that and then they say well
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.220
account for that and then they say well
back to Marxism and so that's why I

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
back to Marxism and so that's why I
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.840
back to Marxism and so that's why I
think there's this unholy alliance

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
think there's this unholy alliance
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.250
think there's this unholy alliance
between the post modernists and the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260
between the post modernists and the
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.109
between the post modernists and the
neo-marxists is because post-modernism

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
neo-marxists is because post-modernism
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.990
neo-marxists is because post-modernism
is a is a dead end from the perspective

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
is a is a dead end from the perspective
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.700
is a is a dead end from the perspective
of applicable wisdom it leaves you

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
of applicable wisdom it leaves you
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.460
of applicable wisdom it leaves you
bereft and nihilistic and that's not

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
bereft and nihilistic and that's not
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.110
bereft and nihilistic and that's not
good because people can't exist without

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
good because people can't exist without
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.540
good because people can't exist without
a purpose and so they sneak the Marxism

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
a purpose and so they sneak the Marxism
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.299
a purpose and so they sneak the Marxism
through the back door and and jump into

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
through the back door and and jump into
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.950
through the back door and and jump into
this power landscape for the reasons

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960
this power landscape for the reasons
 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660
this power landscape for the reasons
that we discussed earlier you really

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
that we discussed earlier you really
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.979
that we discussed earlier you really
think that it's because of an infinite

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
think that it's because of an infinite
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.660
think that it's because of an infinite
number of possibilities interpretating

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
number of possibilities interpretating
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.860
number of possibilities interpretating
things because I've always felt that it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
things because I've always felt that it
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810
things because I've always felt that it
was really just a response to capitalism

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
was really just a response to capitalism
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150
was really just a response to capitalism
they feel that capitalism is a very

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
they feel that capitalism is a very
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.340
they feel that capitalism is a very
negative aspect of our culture and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
negative aspect of our culture and
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.959
negative aspect of our culture and
society and that there's got to be some

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
society and that there's got to be some
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.850
society and that there's got to be some
sort of an alternative Marxism is a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
sort of an alternative Marxism is a
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.920
sort of an alternative Marxism is a
clearly defined alternative that other

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
clearly defined alternative that other
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.479
clearly defined alternative that other
people have subscribed to in the past

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
people have subscribed to in the past
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849
people have subscribed to in the past
you could point to it it's a structure

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859
you could point to it it's a structure
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.280
you could point to it it's a structure
that's already already set up and it's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
that's already already set up and it's
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710
that's already already set up and it's
romanticized and I think they adopt it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
romanticized and I think they adopt it
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.789
romanticized and I think they adopt it
for that reason because it has a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
for that reason because it has a
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560
for that reason because it has a
socialist aspects attached to it and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
socialist aspects attached to it and
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660
socialist aspects attached to it and
they looked at socialism as it's some

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
they looked at socialism as it's some
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.690
they looked at socialism as it's some
sort of a thing that regards equality

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
sort of a thing that regards equality
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.370
sort of a thing that regards equality
and you know it's some sort of an

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
and you know it's some sort of an
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.850
and you know it's some sort of an
egalitarian approach well it's okay so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
egalitarian approach well it's okay so
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249
egalitarian approach well it's okay so
we'd have to take two things apart we'd

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
we'd have to take two things apart we'd
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.980
we'd have to take two things apart we'd
have to take Marxism slouch neo-marxist

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
have to take Marxism slouch neo-marxist
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.410
have to take Marxism slouch neo-marxist
Marxism and post-modernism apart so we

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
Marxism and post-modernism apart so we
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330
Marxism and post-modernism apart so we
could do that historically and I would

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
could do that historically and I would
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.420
could do that historically and I would
say that although there is a reason for

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
say that although there is a reason for
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.370
say that although there is a reason for
post-modernism which is the reason we

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
post-modernism which is the reason we
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050
post-modernism which is the reason we
just discussed that the the landscape

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
just discussed that the the landscape
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420
just discussed that the the landscape
the infinite landscape of interpretation

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
the infinite landscape of interpretation
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.969
the infinite landscape of interpretation
problem it's a real problem if you look

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
problem it's a real problem if you look
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.380
problem it's a real problem if you look
at it historically post-modernism

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
at it historically post-modernism
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.670
at it historically post-modernism
actually grew out of Marxism and so what

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680
actually grew out of Marxism and so what
 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.100
actually grew out of Marxism and so what
what happened is that the Marxists laid

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
what happened is that the Marxists laid
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.280
what happened is that the Marxists laid
out their their their theory about the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
out their their their theory about the
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.130
out their their their theory about the
human social environment being composed

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
human social environment being composed
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.170
human social environment being composed
of a power struggle between the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
of a power struggle between the
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.670
of a power struggle between the
privileged and the underprivileged right

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
privileged and the underprivileged right
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.590
privileged and the underprivileged right
the rich and the poor and in its initial

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
the rich and the poor and in its initial
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.230
the rich and the poor and in its initial
phases and that's a story that's

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
phases and that's a story that's
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.389
phases and that's a story that's
partially true and it's got a lot of

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
partially true and it's got a lot of
 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.639
partially true and it's got a lot of
motive power like the motive power is

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
motive power like the motive power is
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.260
motive power like the motive power is
the romantic motive power that you just

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
the romantic motive power that you just
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.910
the romantic motive power that you just
described I get to be on the side of the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
described I get to be on the side of the
 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.710
described I get to be on the side of the
oppressed I get to be a war or for

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
oppressed I get to be a war or for
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.800
oppressed I get to be a war or for
what's right

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
what's right
 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.420
what's right
there's the resentment element which is

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
there's the resentment element which is
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.280
there's the resentment element which is
that son-of-a-bitch has more than me so

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
that son-of-a-bitch has more than me so
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.839
that son-of-a-bitch has more than me so
let's cut them off at the knees which

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849
let's cut them off at the knees which
 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.880
let's cut them off at the knees which
manifested itself brutally in the Soviet

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890
manifested itself brutally in the Soviet
 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.699
manifested itself brutally in the Soviet
Union and then there's the ideological

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
Union and then there's the ideological
 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.080
Union and then there's the ideological
totality issue which gives people a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
totality issue which gives people a
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.000
totality issue which gives people a
sense of security that took a vicious

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
sense of security that took a vicious
 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.970
sense of security that took a vicious
hit by the late 1960s because the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
hit by the late 1960s because the
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.770
hit by the late 1960s because the
murderous nosov Marxism had been clearly

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
murderous nosov Marxism had been clearly
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.930
murderous nosov Marxism had been clearly
laid out as a doctrine and that opened

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940
laid out as a doctrine and that opened
 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.020
laid out as a doctrine and that opened
the door to this move by by mostly

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
the door to this move by by mostly
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.020
the door to this move by by mostly
French intellectuals to to develop the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030
French intellectuals to to develop the
 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.640
French intellectuals to to develop the
postmodern philosophy which has these

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
postmodern philosophy which has these
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.280
postmodern philosophy which has these
advantages which we described but but

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290
advantages which we described but but
 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.370
advantages which we described but but
also to use that as a screening tactic

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380
also to use that as a screening tactic
 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.289
also to use that as a screening tactic
for allowing Marxism to transform into

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299
for allowing Marxism to transform into
 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.930
for allowing Marxism to transform into
identity politics and so it like it's

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940
identity politics and so it like it's
 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.910
identity politics and so it like it's
hard to disentangle all the motivations

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920
hard to disentangle all the motivations
 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.170
hard to disentangle all the motivations
that are going on in there but there's

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180
that are going on in there but there's
 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.320
that are going on in there but there's
something about it that's that's truly

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330
something about it that's that's truly
 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.970
something about it that's that's truly
intellectually pathological because you

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980
intellectually pathological because you
 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.860
intellectually pathological because you
don't get to be a postmodernist and a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870
don't get to be a postmodernist and a
 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.650
don't get to be a postmodernist and a
Marxist you actually technically cannot

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660
Marxist you actually technically cannot
 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.570
Marxist you actually technically cannot
be both of those things at the same time

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580
be both of those things at the same time
 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.820
be both of those things at the same time
and the fact that most people are both

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830
and the fact that most people are both
 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.910
and the fact that most people are both
of those things at the same time raises

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
of those things at the same time raises
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.009
of those things at the same time raises
the specter of just exactly what their

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019
the specter of just exactly what their
 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.020
the specter of just exactly what their
motivation is and then I would say it's
