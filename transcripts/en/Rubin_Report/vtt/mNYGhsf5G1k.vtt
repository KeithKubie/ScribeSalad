00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
[inaudible] joining me today is the man that I have dubbed the Willy Wonka of

2
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.510
politics.
It even says so on the back of his book right here.

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.690
Michael Malice.
Welcome back to the Ruben report.
Get to be back again.
Dave,

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.910
we have a lot to do,
my friend.
Uh,

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.440
now most of it obviously is going to have to deal with your choice of wardrobe

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.030
at general persona and being,
you've really done it this time.

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.340
If I read this jacket,
pendant,

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.010
this is the actually the same thing that Johnny Depp War,

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.130
but it's a w for him and that's an m and now it's an m for Michael.

10
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:39.390
Although if you flipped it upside down,

11
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:43.500
it would be a w for William or Willy Wonka.
There you go.
Uh,

12
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.780
that's actually the,
the one that I didn't see that one.
It's not that either one.

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.290
What it is,
it is the better one.
Yeah.

14
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.960
So you're going to tell me the Charlie and the chocolate factory with Johnny

15
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.780
Depp is better than Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory with gene wilder.

16
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.230
And I'm not trying to be a contrarian and I'm trying to block it.

17
00:00:57.231 --> 00:01:01.920
If it's much better.
I haven't seen it,
but there's no way it's better.
Well,

18
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.770
it's pretty good.
I'm telling you how could it possibly be better?

19
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:07.380
You're telling me he was better.
He was better than gene wilder.

20
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.600
That's what you're telling me.
I'm in a position to make this call,

21
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.580
I suppose at some level because of the great honor that I've bestowed upon you

22
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:17.250
by calling and either Willy Wonka go out,
but I just,
I mean,

23
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:20.170
I just don't think anything could possibly be better than gene wilder as Willy

24
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.080
Wonka.
Watch it and tweet out the answer.

25
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.900
This is a really disturbing start to this thing.
Okay,
so let's do this.

26
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.591
So first off,

27
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:31.230
I'm going to do this interview completely in a different way than I've ever done

28
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.960
before,
which is that you may notice I have no notes here.

29
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.890
Now my policy is that when it's a good interview,
I don't have to look down once,

30
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.140
but I thought,
you're so bananas.

31
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.070
Your political theories are so out there.

32
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.670
I thought I'm just going to sit down and completely see what happens.

33
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.420
I am literally not going to write down one thing beforehand.
Uh,

34
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.910
so the reason that I call you the Willy Wonka of politics,

35
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.540
he's not just because of your,
uh,
high fashion style.
Yeah.
Uh,

36
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.590
but you actually do strike me as a unique political thinker,

37
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.330
which is pretty freaking rare these days.
That's a huge compliment.
Thank you.

38
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.740
That's all I have for you.
Okay.
Good shot.
Let's got to know.
All right.
So,
but,

39
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.510
but you really do.
And even the way you tweet,
the way you use trolling,
um,

40
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.830
you know,
you're,
you're out there,
political thoughts,
all of those things.
I mean,

41
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:27.180
the way you present yourself,
it's all like just this really bizarre package.

42
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:29.210
So for people that didn't see our first interview,

43
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.810
just give me Michael Malice one o one.

44
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:33.040
Let's just get the history out of the way and then we'll,

45
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.510
then we'll go into the new right.
And the topics of the day,
the Glib answer,

46
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:39.600
he sees the ball.
You hate to love.
Uh,
the longer answer is,

47
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:43.230
my background is with North Korea was my last book with your reader.

48
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.670
The New Right happen as a consequence of so many of my friends who were in to a

49
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:52.640
trolls who are anarchists fell down these rabbit holes of what they were,

50
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.590
what was called at the time and he and reaction and later became like the

51
00:02:55.591 --> 00:03:00.130
outright and dark enlightenment.
So I watched the scene from build up from

52
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.060
<v 1>the ground floor and then to have it culminate to some extent in the Trump</v>

53
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:06.820
presidency and contemporary cultural wars.

54
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.990
I had a bird's eye view so I knew someone was going to have to write a book

55
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.690
about the subculture.
And I also knew that you know,

56
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:16.630
any reporter is not going to be able to understand the scene cause at the very

57
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.520
least they're going to be an outsider secondary,

58
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:20.470
they're going to have their own prejudices.

59
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:24.310
So since my job had been to make North Korea,
you know,
before I started,

60
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.150
when North Korea work,

61
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.020
the idea was they're crazy and crazy means I don't understand you.
It does.

62
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:30.860
It can mean,
I don't understand your can mean that your random,

63
00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:33.220
but now everyone understands North Korea is not crazy.

64
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:36.370
They have a very coherent logical approach to their evil dictatorship.

65
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.760
And the same thing with this scene.
Everyone would like to dismiss it.
Jump ever.

66
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.970
Just loved everybody in.
They're all nuts.
They're all Nazis.

67
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.900
And it'd be really convenient if you could paint everyone with the same brush.

68
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.230
They'd be a lot less efficacious.
A,
it'll be a lot easier to dismiss.

69
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:54.700
But that's not the way it is.
And people understand that any subculture,
even the,

70
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.890
you know for the Republicans,
they think,
oh the less the same,

71
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.800
the Hillary Clinton hate the Bernie people,
they really hate them.

72
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.400
So there's a lot of different groups in what I call the new right.

73
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.890
And often though they're United in what they regard as their oppositions possess

74
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.360
for progressivism between them,
they do not have much agreement.

75
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.280
<v 0>Okay.
So with that as the backdrop to all of this,</v>

76
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:18.840
and this also explains why when buzzfeed and Huff Po and vox and the rest of

77
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:23.020
them are writing about you guys,
whatever that collective things here,

78
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.750
they always get it all sort of wrong because as you said,
they're not part of it.

79
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:29.940
So they just look at the,
Oh,
they must be racist.

80
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.750
<v 1>Well,
they also have an agenda.
Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.330
So racist means that which is against progressivism.

82
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:36.700
And I have a list in the books of things that have been called racist,

83
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:39.290
which includes moving into minority neighborhoods and moving out am I never did

84
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.250
in our neighborhoods.
Noticing races and not noticing races.

85
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:46.860
Milk a certain time of dinosaurs.
I mean picnics.
Wait,

86
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.560
what type of dinosaurs?
Racist.
Uh,
there was the,
in Jurassic Park,

87
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.860
one of the dinosaurs was called racist.
Uh,

88
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.580
I'm not sure exactly why I didn't follow up meeting through the article.
Yeah.

89
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.690
So I dunno.
Um,
and possibly a,
um,
um,

90
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.660
what's that?
What's his name?
Fred Flintstones.
Pet.
Oh,
Dino.
Yeah,

91
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:09.010
he's a bit of a white supremacist.
Just,
just [inaudible].
It's unfortunate.
Um,

92
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.630
so I thought someone has to write this book.
And also it's a dark space.

93
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.910
So I wanted to have people be able to explore it in an interesting way and in a

94
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:19.744
nonthreatening way.

95
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.820
So for people that know nothing about this and the couple groups that you just

97
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:27.700
mentioned,
they are dark and light and mint,
the troll community,

98
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:31.810
all of this stuff.
Can you just kind of break down all of it?
How did this start?

99
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.690
How did you even start caring about it?
Were you part of it?

100
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.390
What the Hell is going on?
I was on,
cause even for me,

101
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:39.760
and I have some basic understanding of this stuff,

102
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.980
I'm actually not totally clear on all the sort of markers and where everybody is

103
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:45.814
online and all that.

104
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.640
<v 1>So it starts,
I grounded in,
uh,</v>

105
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.970
1992 when Pat Buchanan who is regarded as a paleo conservative,

106
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.720
we teamed up with Marie Rothbart who was regarded as a Paleo Libertarian.

107
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.430
So between those two men,

108
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.360
you basically have everything that is happening today within this scene.

109
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:06.590
Meaning nationalism,
a trolling,
flirting with racism,

110
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.670
um,
you know,
contempt for authority,
skepticism toward the establishment.

111
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.440
The two of them had many disagreements and at what point,
you know,

112
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.770
Pat Buchanan and turned on Murray Rothbard and later he asked Murray Rothbard's,

113
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.590
um,
executor for forgiveness,
literally,
um,

114
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.190
getting on his knees and asked me for forgiveness.
I broke that news in the book.

115
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.790
And that has come down to contemporary terms where the Internet with social

116
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:32.810
media allows,
and this is both a positive and a negative,
is back in the day,

117
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:35.810
if you were that one person in your town with these rude fringe views,

118
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:36.644
you're the freak.

119
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.520
But now that one person with their weird fringe views in that town can talk to

120
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:43.880
the other person with the rouge printer using the other town or in Denmark or in

121
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:47.060
Asia,
or can put on a purple jacket and show up at the Rubin report.

122
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.680
It's all very busy.
They can't pull it off.
Um,
uh,
you have to earn this jacket.

123
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.340
So,

124
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.340
but now they have a community and discussion and they can develop an ideology.

125
00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:01.760
So what I saw happening as a result of hanging out with the trolls is people

126
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.870
falling into this group called what was called at the time near reaction or the

127
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:09.690
dark enlightenment.
And it was things like we need to return to monarchy.
Uh,

128
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.330
America is this decadent Weimer Republic that's on the verge of destruction and

129
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.850
where was this happening on the Internet?
So I'll need to know.
I know,

130
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:17.690
but like where,

131
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.540
what do you mean w forums chat exactly for him through all these blogs.
You know,

132
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.500
it's very HP Lovecraft things you're not supposed to know.
It's especially,

133
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.010
it was,
it was blogs,
uh,
not really Twitter at the time and Facebook groups.

134
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:35.450
Those are the big ones back then.
So this would have been about like 2013,

135
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.910
2012.
Okay.
So now some of this stuff starts bubbling up,
right?

136
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:45.911
And you start seeing these communities that sort of don't really align but have

137
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.820
some weird touchpoints.
And what do you make of those touch and,
well,

138
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:53.720
what I knew from my,
you know,
I'm a big pop culture person obviously,

139
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.910
and I knew how culture develops,

140
00:07:55.911 --> 00:08:00.800
which is it starts at the fringe with the Weirdos and then the edgy people,

141
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:03.680
the cool people like,
hey,
have you heard about this thing?

142
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.250
Then it becomes more mainstream and then like kind of the nerds get it.

143
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.370
Then the corporations appropriated and kind of tone it down,
right?

144
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.520
So all of the intellectual momentum I saw on the right was a result of this

145
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:19.640
stuff.
These are the people talking ideas,
both nefariously and positively.

146
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.510
These are the ones asking the big questions and basically the radical questions.

147
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.060
And one of the big differences between conservatives than you,

148
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:30.080
right is this conservatives take what is given and this isn't a slight against

149
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:34.160
conservatives and regarded as all right,
basically what we have,
how do we fix it?

150
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.590
Then you write often has a more radical approach.

151
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:39.650
Meaning just because something exists doesn't mean it can't be destroyed

152
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:41.660
completely and started from scratch.

153
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:44.840
So these are two different approaches and we see it regarding the press.

154
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:47.840
I got into an argument with Sean Davis who writes for the federalists.

155
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.620
And his whole point is that,
you know,
the media,
they're all there.

156
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:54.380
They're all dumb.
And my point is none of these people are very,
very bright.

157
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:57.210
And if they're all making the same mistake in the same exact way,

158
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.630
that is not a function as to petty stupid people are all going to agree this is

159
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:04.470
a function of something more nefarious.
So that,
so it's not a bug,
it's a feature.

160
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.510
Correct.
Because they're,

161
00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:08.580
they do have a certain specific agenda and everyone has a certain specific

162
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:12.940
agenda.
So this is a big separation between conserves and you're right,
is this a,

163
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.210
uh,
you know,
part of society salvageable or is it inherently,
uh,

164
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.380
impure and,
and beyond redemption?

165
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.780
<v 0>So when Trump was being elected ahead,
Eric Weinstein sitting in that seat,</v>

166
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.670
and what I said to him was,

167
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.510
what most people seem to want is a panther in a China shop.

168
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.370
We know something's wrong with the system,

169
00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:32.780
but we don't want to blow up the system.

170
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.840
We want a panther to walk in there and knock something off with its tail.

171
00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:37.580
And Bang one thing off with the Ted,

172
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.380
but then closed the door behind it and we'll,
you know,

173
00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:41.300
a couple things we'll have broken,
but we'll be okay.

174
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.000
But there's no such metaphor as a,
a panther to try and copy.

175
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.000
It's a bull in a China shop,
but you just can't get it.

176
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.080
I sense that a lot of what you're talking about is these people want the bull

177
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.600
<v 1>in the chain.
No,
these people want a bomb in a touch on the shop.</v>

178
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.730
They want the China shop to be destroyed.

179
00:09:56.731 --> 00:10:01.731
And the phrase China shop is pretty apps here because it's talking about foreign

180
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:05.520
influence in America and that's China's not their big villain specifically.

181
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.550
But basically the idea like this store needs to be torn down.

182
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.850
We're not breaking some dishes this we're way past the point of breaking stuff,

183
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.590
<v 0>but they want to blow up the whole store to [inaudible].</v>

184
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.910
It's not just about breaking the China that's in the store.

185
00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:20.660
They actually want the entire structure and to change

186
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.970
<v 1>and salted the earth.
Yeah.
To make sure nothing can be built there again.</v>

187
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.400
<v 0>But so,
so where,
where do you fall on that?</v>

188
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.210
Because I sense there is this weird thing of there's this weird thing on both

189
00:10:31.211 --> 00:10:31.841
the left and the right,

190
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:35.080
the left seems to really want to destroy the whole thing too in a weird way.

191
00:10:35.081 --> 00:10:35.680
But then you're,

192
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.170
you're talking about people on the new right that want to destroy the whole

193
00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:40.210
thing.
They wanted to destroy it for different reasons.

194
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.800
But what do you think the left wants to destroy?

195
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.120
The left wants to destroy capitalism and they want to destroy the basic way our

196
00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:48.190
democracy has functioned and things like that.
Yeah.

197
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.450
<v 1>Uh,
I don't,
I don't know that they want to destroy capitalists.</v>

198
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:55.010
And what should they think of it as something that can milk and harness?
Um,

199
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.050
Bernie,
even Bernie,
you know,
has said,
you know,

200
00:10:57.051 --> 00:10:59.510
vaguely positive things to say about capitalism,
but,

201
00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:01.190
and I don't know that they would ever admit.

202
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.880
<v 0>Well,
I think it's a slow,
it's a slow slope to get there.</v>

203
00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:06.510
You don't just come out with day one and say you want to destroy capitalism.

204
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.440
You just keep right.
But undermining it over election after.

205
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.430
<v 1>I agree with you,
but what I'm saying is then you write is saying,
yes,</v>

206
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.520
we want to destroy this chapter for this book is called the case against

207
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:16.210
democracy.

208
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.410
So in the scene there is a huge question of how is it that democracy is

209
00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:23.230
inherently good,
let alone inherently legitimate.

210
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.730
So lay out a case.
Sure.
So the base,
the,
you know,

211
00:11:27.731 --> 00:11:31.120
people say that communism works in theory,
not in practice,
right?

212
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.160
Well that doesn't mean anything because everything works in theory.
You know,

213
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.360
theory means he practices how you figure out something actually works.

214
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.060
Democracy is one of the few things that doesn't even work in theory.

215
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.980
And here's why.
If you have with,

216
00:11:41.981 --> 00:11:43.750
they talk about voter turnout being a good thing,

217
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.410
well at what point does it become legitimate?
If 70% of people vote,

218
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.000
they can speak for the 30% who don't vote.
What if it's 40% vote in 60%?

219
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.490
Don't at what point it that you can say,

220
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.170
this group of the population can dominate this other group,
uh,
who haven't voted.

221
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:02.560
That's one example.
But even more technical terms,
the purest,

222
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.980
I use an example from this book called the Machiavellians,
the purest,
uh,

223
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:09.250
exemplar of democracies.
The town hall,
you have a bunch of people,

224
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.820
everyone's there to kind of speak their mind,
put their point of view across.

225
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.060
Even in the town hall,
you're going to have to have limits on time.

226
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.030
You're gonna have an agenda,
what issues we're going to discuss.

227
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.570
So even in the most democratic system a moment,

228
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.600
you're going to have an elite setting the rules and boundaries.

229
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:28.540
So one of the ideas behind the new right is this theory of this old school

230
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:30.820
theory a hundred years ago called the circulation.
The elites,

231
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.780
meaning Hillary Clinton will always have more in common with George W.
Bush,

232
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.050
then she will have with the janitor,
and you can't get rid of an elite.

233
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:40.120
So much is replace it with another elite

234
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.920
<v 0>[inaudible].
So this is a little bit of the way game of Thrones ended,
sort of.</v>

235
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.240
<v 1>I,
I,
I'm not,
I'm not</v>

236
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.240
<v 0>right.
Okay.
Okay.</v>

237
00:12:47.241 --> 00:12:49.640
There's a funny moment at the end where they're trying to figure out how to rule

238
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.030
and in the future,
and one of the guys says,
well,
what about democracy?

239
00:12:53.031 --> 00:12:55.140
Let the people vote.
And then there's a moment where you're like,
oh,

240
00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:57.160
where are they going to end with democracy?
And then everyone laughs.
Yeah.

241
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.620
<v 1>Well isn't there was another new right moment early on because didn't some</v>

242
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.030
person hold up like a PCP,

243
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:05.390
a piece of paper that says you promised them they basically ripped in left.

244
00:13:05.391 --> 00:13:05.870
Right?

245
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.050
So this idea that the constitution is somehow going to start working and save us

246
00:13:09.051 --> 00:13:10.730
is another thing that they're very skeptical of.

247
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.280
<v 0>So what,
what are you politically,
if you had to give yourself</v>

248
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.070
<v 1>I am label.
Sure.
I'm an anarchist or that adjectives.</v>

249
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.010
<v 0>An anarchist without adjective.
Yes,
sir.
Explain the adjective part of me.</v>

250
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.260
<v 1>There's different schools of anarchism.
Yeah.
Um,
and I am more,
uh,</v>

251
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.410
there's an arco capitalism this and [inaudible] and Arco.
Communism.

252
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.360
I like it all.
My point is essentially is that government is not legitimate.

253
00:13:36.361 --> 00:13:40.050
It cannot be made legitimate.
And you have to start with that recognition.
Now,

254
00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:43.200
some people think,
okay,
if you take away government,
everyone's going to be equal.

255
00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:45.270
You're going to have wage equality.
Some people think,
okay,

256
00:13:45.271 --> 00:13:47.550
it's going to be hyper capitalistic.
Sure.

257
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.210
I'm a lot more comfortable defending anarchy than I am defending capitalism or

258
00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:52.110
communism or cynical.
Yeah.

259
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.983
<v 0>Awesome.</v>

260
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:58.180
So I think most people here anarchist and they just think,

261
00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:02.630
well I mean I say this all the time,
it's just you want to end up in Mad Max.

262
00:14:02.631 --> 00:14:04.880
You just want sort of warring factions,

263
00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:09.881
constantly trying to take each other out and that there is no sort of social

264
00:14:09.981 --> 00:14:10.761
cohesion.

265
00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:15.110
There's no way to build big projects and things like that because we don't have

266
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.380
something that sort of bringing us all together that the government kind of

267
00:14:18.381 --> 00:14:20.330
sucky.
I mean a lot of people think this is kind of Sucky,

268
00:14:20.331 --> 00:14:21.230
but it's the best we got.

269
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.250
<v 1>It's the best criticism [inaudible] are actually descriptions of the status quo.</v>

270
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.710
Meaning what you're describing is the status quo.

271
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:32.020
You have governments who are trying to take each other out.
China has,
you know,

272
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.250
hacked our systems.
Russia,
you know,
is interfering in our election.

273
00:14:35.251 --> 00:14:39.720
So other right now nations have a state of anarchy with regard to each other to

274
00:14:39.721 --> 00:14:41.200
some extent.
Um,

275
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.430
what Anik is and would do it provide more security because you wouldn't have to

276
00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:45.810
have a government monopoly.
Uh,

277
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.920
the idea that you need the government to kind of build a big project is really

278
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.740
not necessarily true.
Uh,

279
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:54.920
and if anything the government is probably the biggest hindrance towards people

280
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:57.740
working together because they have to run things through some bureaucrat who has

281
00:14:57.741 --> 00:14:58.670
no accountability.

282
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.700
<v 0>Okay.
But wait,
want,
I want to back up before we go to down that road.</v>

283
00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:06.090
So just break down in a couple of these other groups that were sort of in this

284
00:15:06.091 --> 00:15:07.230
trolling community.

285
00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:10.230
And can you just explain like free for someone of a certain age that really

286
00:15:10.231 --> 00:15:10.830
doesn't even under,

287
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.850
that's not on Twitter and then not on four Chan or wherever the hell is going on

288
00:15:14.851 --> 00:15:19.050
or discord.
Sure.
Like what is actually going on with the trolls?

289
00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:20.470
Like what is the goal of the,

290
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.930
<v 1>the older people actually know trolling quite well.</v>

291
00:15:22.931 --> 00:15:25.930
Cause the example I use in the book,
the first trial was Andy Kaufman.

292
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.740
So Andy Kaufman,
right?
He was the great troll of all gray trial of all time.

293
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.910
He was on taxi as Laca,
which is not what he's proud of stuff.

294
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.660
And he would do things like,
he had this character called Tony Clifton,

295
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.260
who was basically,
it's like old lounge singer and a pink salmon blazer.

296
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.770
And he'd come down and sing terribly and just be rate the audience.
And,

297
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.460
and one most trolling moment is he had this,
he was performing,

298
00:15:48.461 --> 00:15:50.500
I think in Atlantic city.
And he says,
oh,
well,
you know,

299
00:15:50.501 --> 00:15:53.170
my wife died a few years ago.
And when I look at my daughter's eyes,

300
00:15:53.171 --> 00:15:54.700
I see my wife come on out here,
honey.

301
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.290
And she sits on his lap and they sing and her voice cracks any slaps her across

302
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.230
the face.
And it goes with all you're doing,

303
00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:03.760
or I'm part of the audience is booing.
And he goes,
oh,
don't go.

304
00:16:03.761 --> 00:16:06.580
You're just making her cry more.
Well,
not only was in his daughter,

305
00:16:06.581 --> 00:16:08.110
it wasn't even a child who is an actress.

306
00:16:08.111 --> 00:16:11.650
So trolling correctly is forcing a party,

307
00:16:11.651 --> 00:16:14.530
exploiting a party's weaknesses in order to turn them into an unwitting

308
00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:17.170
performer.
So other examples of this,
there was a little kid,

309
00:16:17.171 --> 00:16:18.070
it's a little autistic kid,

310
00:16:18.071 --> 00:16:22.570
was on the late show in the UK or Ireland and they asked him,
Hey,

311
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.690
what do you want to do Huey Huey,
what do you want to do when you grow up?

312
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.370
And he goes,
um,
I want to fly planes into buildings.
And the guy goes,
what?

313
00:16:30.371 --> 00:16:33.310
He goes,
I want to fly planes,
the skyscrapers.
And he's like,
okay,

314
00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:34.540
if you can't do that,
what would you want to do?

315
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.220
I'll move to Iraq and be a terrorist.

316
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.320
Now it's this little 10 year old boy and the host now doesn't know what to do.

317
00:16:41.321 --> 00:16:43.510
I think he's put on the spot that is trolling.

318
00:16:43.511 --> 00:16:47.710
Now trolling is often used on the internet to be like being a jerk.
That's not,

319
00:16:47.711 --> 00:16:49.090
to me a definition of trolling.

320
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:52.180
There's plenty of words for that and just go into the cell and saying,
you know,

321
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.830
you're this or you're that.
That's not clever.
Trolling is an art.
So troll.
Okay,

322
00:16:56.831 --> 00:16:59.590
so how is it the Trump understood this?

323
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.560
Do you think that's because this is where people say,
well,
he's just an idiot.

324
00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:03.230
He just says whatever.

325
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.830
<v 0>Free lunch.
There's no filter that [inaudible] and it's like,</v>

326
00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:09.550
if that really is the truth,
if that really is the truth,

327
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.290
then everyone else must be hyper idiots.
You know what I mean?
I just

328
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.330
<v 1>can't accept plausible truth,
which perhaps,</v>

329
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.510
let me give a great example of Trump trolling.
Okay.
Again,
trolling,

330
00:17:18.511 --> 00:17:21.540
meaning you're forcing someone to become a performer by exploiting their

331
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.230
weaknesses,

332
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.320
which it seems like now all the media has become all with his enemies,

333
00:17:25.321 --> 00:17:28.440
have become,
can get them to take any position on any,
here's the perfect example.

334
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:33.120
Yeah.
For one year he's yelling at Elizabeth Warren,
take a DNA test,

335
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.090
take a DNA test,
take a DNA test.
She takes it in secret,

336
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.190
doesn't even test for native American blood.

337
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:43.020
It says she's at most 100024th she releases it and she goes,
Huh,

338
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.470
Mr President?
I took the test and you know what?
He goes,
who cares?
Yeah.

339
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:51.750
So now she's made a fool of,
he is not at all engaging with her and she's left.

340
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:55.590
You can even hear the curb,
your enthusiasm,
music playing as she talks,

341
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.070
and this moment has become a broken woman as a consequence of his clouding her

342
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:02.850
so thoroughly.
What is it about him that you think made him understand this?

343
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:07.851
How did this guy understand this psychological trick or whatever you want to

344
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:11.360
scenarios,
right?
Scott Adams,
who I know you've had on risk,

345
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.860
describes the Lucky Hitler phenomenon,
right?

346
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.640
That somehow it's just he always manages to say that what he needs to to upset

347
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:18.180
people.

348
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.690
The other scenario is like there's some kind of rain man thing going on that he

349
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:23.010
just sees people's weaknesses.

350
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:26.820
He knows exactly what to say and despite him themselves,
they lose their minds.

351
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.430
Another example of this was I think it was pixelated,
both.

352
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:33.590
There's some Twitter account and they made this fakes a screenshot from Michael

353
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.470
Wolfe's book fire and fury about how Trump watches TV all the time.

354
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:40.830
And the staff at the White House made something called the guerrilla channel.

355
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.190
And he talks to the gorillas on TV and he says,
oh,
that goodwill is good.

356
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.800
And people are,
and it was clearly a joke.
It was meant to be a joke.

357
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.950
People repeated this like,
oh my gosh,
Trump is so dumb.

358
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.690
He talks to television like,
wait a minute,

359
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.400
you can think he's as dumb as you want.

360
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.550
You're telling me this man who is 70 who's had a TV show,

361
00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.390
doesn't understand that you can't talk to gorillas on a screen.

362
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.410
But that is the level that he's driven them to.
So it's hilarious to watch.

363
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.860
And it's beautiful from the [inaudible] perspective because he's diligent

364
00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:10.830
organizing the political process and the presidency.

365
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.270
So the reverence that people have for the presidency has deadly consequences

366
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:17.310
because it allows them to get away with things like war.

367
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:21.330
And if you think the guy in the Oval Office is a clown and that clown is getting

368
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:25.440
ready to send your kids overseas to possibly die or possibly kill people,

369
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.250
you're going to be a lot more skeptical.
God,
there's a lock there.

370
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.930
So you think it's the whole book worth.

371
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.200
If only if only someone would write a book about this sort of thing.

372
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:36.870
There's a lot there.
So you think in an odd way,

373
00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:41.610
his behavior is delegitimizing the presidency,

374
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:44.880
let's say the office of the presidency or more broadly government in general.

375
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.290
And you ultimately view that as a good thing because you don't think that really

376
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:51.420
has legitimate power to begin with.
Right.

377
00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:55.980
One of the big views of the Murray Rothbard school is that the two political

378
00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:58.440
parties are literally rival gangs.

379
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.340
And just like a gangster has the nice rings and the suits,
they wear their suits,

380
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:07.050
they go to the Senate.
But these are at base murderers who are plotting,
you know,

381
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:09.330
fighting with each other.
But it's in fighting.
Um,

382
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:13.590
so anytime the mask is dropped and you realize these people aren't stealing your

383
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:17.760
money,
they're trying to control your lives,
they're causing massive,
you know,

384
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.490
harm around the world often.
Uh,
that's a good thing.

385
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.120
What's the ratio element that comes out of all of this?

386
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.230
It's because for as much as I get a lot of this and I like a lot of the
trolling,

387
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.740
the good natured stuff that's really getting the,

388
00:20:30.741 --> 00:20:34.010
the people that I don't like to flip their lids.
Like I love all that stuff.

389
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.440
And then there's this other piece of it that,

390
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:41.750
that strikes me as it's hard to tell it or they just intentionally inflammatory.

391
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.640
Do they really believe this?
What kind of power do these people have?

392
00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:49.450
Are they coordinating all of that?
Yes.
Jared Taylor is the head race realist,

393
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:52.720
right?
These are the people who you racism as the most important issue,

394
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:55.600
the outright,
and I interviewed him for the,
for the book.

395
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:58.180
I went to his house and you know,

396
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:01.150
even he was confused and there's this great moment,

397
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:02.650
he's got this very weird accent.
He goes,

398
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.850
are you telling me these people really believe this Hitler stuff?

399
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.560
Like he couldn't wrap it and I go,
yeah.
And he goes,

400
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.800
the idea in this day and age that Hitlerism would be a model for America is

401
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:19.150
simply fantastic.
And I go,
you mean crazy,
right?
He goes,
Oh yes,

402
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:22.240
thank you for the clarification.
So even in that group though,

403
00:21:22.241 --> 00:21:25.310
they're the racists,
but he is your approach.

404
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.490
You then you have the people who are full blown.
Yes.

405
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.460
<v 0>Well what does that mean?</v>

406
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:33.350
So there are the racist meaning there are just people who just full blown
racism.

407
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.610
They just actually racist.

408
00:21:34.611 --> 00:21:37.670
They want people based on the color is going to have different laws or not be in

409
00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:38.420
this country.
You are

410
00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.100
<v 1>correct.
And they say if you're not,</v>

411
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:44.240
if you don't see that as the most important issue,
you're blind.

412
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.050
So I,
you know,
had to engage with that,
writing this book.

413
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.120
Then they're the ones who are,
everything's about the Jews,
the Jews,
the Jews,
you,

414
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.300
I was,
I was in Charlottesville.
I saw everything happening.

415
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.990
I couldn't go to all the events because my contact was told don't bring the Jew

416
00:21:56.991 --> 00:22:01.940
to the party.
I was not wearing the blazer.
Uh,
but uh,

417
00:22:01.941 --> 00:22:06.941
so there is this whole subculture and they disagree with themselves and it was

418
00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:12.260
important for me to engage with them and express what their point of view is and

419
00:22:12.261 --> 00:22:13.400
show how they're wrong.

420
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.120
Because what happens is when you drive people to the margin,

421
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.610
it's like telling an,
especially when deal with young males,

422
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.690
it's like when you tell kids if you smoke the principal,

423
00:22:23.691 --> 00:22:27.200
your parents and everyone's going to get upset and then you can't get a pall

424
00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:29.420
mall fast enough.
So that the same thing here,

425
00:22:29.421 --> 00:22:33.590
it's like if you talk to these people and say certain things people you hate are

426
00:22:33.591 --> 00:22:35.810
gonna get upset,
it's like,
sign me up.

427
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.860
So the point I make in this book is you take one red pill,
not the whole bottle.

428
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.910
Because once they realized that the corporate press is often dishonest and has

429
00:22:43.911 --> 00:22:46.130
an agenda,
they fall down this rabbit hole.

430
00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:48.090
And unless someone grabs him by the collar and said,
yeah,

431
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:52.490
you don't have to go all the way,
uh,
we,
we can stop right here.
Uh,

432
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.570
there are often lost.

433
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.360
<v 0>So this is,</v>

434
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.110
you would argue then the reason why sensoring these people in suspending people

435
00:22:58.111 --> 00:23:01.260
on Twitter and booting people off Facebook and the rest of it is actually the

436
00:23:01.261 --> 00:23:04.560
worst possible thing that you could do.
I don't know if you become,

437
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.423
you just feeding it,

438
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.980
<v 1>I don't know if it's the worst,</v>

439
00:23:06.981 --> 00:23:11.950
but if they're going to say there is an elite agenda designed to drive us

440
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.980
underground and keep the truth from coming out,
now they have evidence.
Look,

441
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.850
we're being blocked.
They don't want to hear the truth.
So that is a,

442
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.300
and the fact that David Duke,
for example,
is still on Twitter,

443
00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:27.170
is very curious to me.
And again,
with the Internet and technology.

444
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.820
<v 0>So,
wait,
what do you think that's about then?</v>

445
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.990
<v 1>Well,
I think David Duke is a very useful foil for the left,
uh,</v>

446
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.280
because when he endorses people at Keith Ellison or Johana Mar,
it's crickets,

447
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.530
right?
But when he says something positive about somebody else,
like,
oh my God,

448
00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.310
David do about Trump.
Yeah.

449
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.010
I don't think he likes Trump too much cause Trump all Trump the kids married

450
00:23:43.011 --> 00:23:46.580
except for one marriage Jews.
So,
you know,
I,
I it's,
it's uh,

451
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.380
he's not that fond of the president.
Uh,
everything's about Israel.
David Duke.
Um,

452
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.020
and I told him once on Twitter.
So that was a fun moment.
You took out the Duke,

453
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.200
like I don't know if I,
I know I did.
He's still there and that's the problem.

454
00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:00.080
Like why is David Duke there while people like Laura Loomer art?

455
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.100
I think that is very odd,
uh,
um,
a situation.

456
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.480
<v 0>And you would say that really is just because of the power dynamic within</v>

457
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.480
Twitter or,
or within something bigger than,

458
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.410
<v 1>I can't speak to why I'm not in the side.
Jack's mind Jack Dorsey's mind.
Yeah.</v>

459
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.920
I do think there's something here that's not adding up and I think the more

460
00:24:17.921 --> 00:24:20.260
transparency the better.
Uh,

461
00:24:20.261 --> 00:24:22.480
and I think Jack and some level would agree with that.
Yeah.

462
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.600
What's your position on what to do with the tech companies at this point?

463
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.210
Related to all of this in the censorship and everything.

464
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.240
I think the solution is going to be just like back in the day we had cupid and

465
00:24:33.671 --> 00:24:37.660
now you have Tinder and and,
and all these other sites and they separate out.

466
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.770
You're going,
there's no reason everyone has to be in one site.
So the more,

467
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:46.780
if Twitter wants to say we're a site for progressive ideas,
they have that right?

468
00:24:46.781 --> 00:24:48.160
And,
and that's perfectly fine.

469
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.030
They're going to lose a huge market share because when you drive out fringe

470
00:24:52.031 --> 00:24:54.010
ideas,
whether evil,
fringe,

471
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.900
you're also going to be driving out the good fringe idea.

472
00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:57.040
That's where innovation happens.

473
00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.310
So if you're going to have this bourgeois middle of the road,

474
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:05.410
I don't want weirdness,
uh,
you're going to lose the interesting people also.

475
00:25:05.411 --> 00:25:07.090
So this is a very big double edged.

476
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.200
<v 0>So then why hasn't this problem been fixed?</v>

477
00:25:09.201 --> 00:25:12.470
There's enough people frustrated with it all over the political map.

478
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.940
Good old classical liberals are just as frustrated as perhaps more nefarious

479
00:25:16.941 --> 00:25:18.920
characters and nobody has solved

480
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.180
<v 1>this.
But your frustration might be a feature because they say,
look,</v>

481
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:26.030
we're obviously doing things right.
We've got Dave Ruben upset.
So if there,
uh,

482
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.580
if we live in a culture that's heavily dominated by the progressive ideology,

483
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.940
so for them,
if they are getting certain people upset,
they can say,
hey,

484
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:34.990
we're doing our job.
Right.

485
00:25:34.991 --> 00:25:38.230
The euphemism they currently use as the quality of the conversation.
Right.

486
00:25:38.231 --> 00:25:41.110
So yeah,
I mean this is the most Orwellian thing ever.

487
00:25:41.111 --> 00:25:44.720
Like you are going to be judging quality.
So it's,
it's,
it's a very,
it's very,

488
00:25:44.721 --> 00:25:46.390
and which is a very different thing from free speech,

489
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:51.430
which is messy and ugly and,
and,
and you know,
often reprehensible.
[inaudible].

490
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.290
<v 0>How do you think that the new right then is supposed to,</v>

491
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.220
I know you don't like boundaries and you don't like gate keeping in any of those

492
00:25:59.221 --> 00:26:01.000
things,
but how do you think it anything,

493
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.430
<v 1>I like gates.
I'm a,
I'm,
I'm not an inclusionist person.</v>

494
00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.730
I'm very much for freedom of association.
If I didn't want to talk to someone,

495
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.290
I'm not I black people liberally,

496
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.230
<v 0>but how,
but all right,
so,
but you know,</v>

497
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:15.800
in a wider group outside of just what's happening in your mind and your

498
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.380
interactions with people,

499
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.910
how do you think that this new sort of group of people that are all over the map

500
00:26:21.911 --> 00:26:26.260
politically,
right?
Um,
how do they,
how do they keep the fringe people,

501
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.110
the truly bad people out of the way?
This seems to be the biggest

502
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.410
<v 1>yes.
That nobody's solving.
Uh,
the Pr,</v>

503
00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.870
I don't think you can because technology has made,

504
00:26:34.871 --> 00:26:38.170
it used to be you had three networks,
right?
ABC,
NBC,
CBS,

505
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.440
and between the three of them,
you get the news.
Then drudge came along.

506
00:26:41.441 --> 00:26:44.820
I talking about in the book and the networks,
like he's a lot legitimate.

507
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:46.020
He's not legitimate.
He's not legitimate.

508
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.870
He breaks one of the biggest stories of all Todd Monica Lewinsky.

509
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.520
They didn't know what to do.
He still,

510
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.400
he's not legitimate and illegitimate is like,
he broke news.

511
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.440
Who are you to say he's now Jim.
And so this,

512
00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:59.640
this orthodox idea of legitimacy has no inherent meaning other than tribalism,

513
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:02.790
right?
So once you have technology and thanks to Twitter,
Facebook,
whatever,

514
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:06.030
everyone has their own Mike and there are more and more mikes being built every

515
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:06.810
day.

516
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.710
I don't see how you're going to be able to put that genie back in the bottle so

517
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.270
you just have to let it be.
Then you'd say there's just no option.

518
00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:20.340
It's just is correct and you have to engage with bad ideas if you want to

519
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:23.700
diffuse them because you're not thanks to technology,

520
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.850
you're not going to be able to censor anyone.
Let me give you another example.

521
00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:29.940
I have this in the book.
Let's suppose this is like 1990 right?

522
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.910
And you're having an argument censoring books and one guy like we need to censor

523
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.540
books like mine,
calm has bad consequence.
Someone else like,
no,

524
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:40.980
you need to hear free speech.
I come from 2019 teleport back in time and I say,

525
00:27:40.981 --> 00:27:45.930
look,
someday you're going to be able to copy a book infinitely at no cost.

526
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.190
You press one button,

527
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.190
you send it anywhere on earth at the speed of light for free.

528
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.530
I would sound like a lunatic,
but that is the status quo.
Oh,

529
00:27:52.531 --> 00:27:55.790
and also you could use a magic word.
No,
but orange and reader to password.
Oh,

530
00:27:55.791 --> 00:27:57.810
okay.
Crazy person.
That's the status quo.

531
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.660
And technology is only going to increase more and more and more to empower the

532
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:03.480
individual at the expense of big conglomerates.

533
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:06.270
It becomes cheaper and cheaper to make your voice heard.
Back in the day.

534
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:08.550
You'd have to be like,
if you don't like it,
make your own network.

535
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.090
Well you did on now.
Now it's going to be,
I mean I've,

536
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.780
except we're still using their pipes.
I'm still dependent on,

537
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.750
at least for the moment on,
correct.
There's tech,

538
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.300
there's a great book called the goal.
And the point of this book is,

539
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:24.090
what's a goal there was to go for business and he says to make money.

540
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:29.300
So how you do this is you look at the pipeline from conception to production and

541
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:31.230
you look at what's slowing up your profits.

542
00:28:31.231 --> 00:28:32.970
So maybe you don't have enough shipping boxes,

543
00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.470
maybe you're not producing enough bottles,

544
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:36.330
maybe you have too much warehouse inventory.

545
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.500
So you've got gotta have more marketing.

546
00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:40.710
Maybe youtube is not sending your videos out to your subscribers,
right?

547
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.910
So you look at what the issue is,
the bottleneck,
you fix that.

548
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.180
Once that's fixed,
there's to be another worst thing and you fix that.

549
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.010
So Twitter in many ways is a rear guard movement right now because people are

550
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:55.790
realizing it's paypal and it's the banks that,

551
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.900
and it's the fact that there's domain registrars,

552
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.690
those are the next three that people are going to build alternatives to.

553
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.330
Cause that's where the banks are shutting down accounts right now.

554
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.800
And that's what's being underreported.

555
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.590
So Twitter is kind of a little bit of a distraction because you'll always be

556
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:11.370
able to make some rival to Twitter,
banking and paypal.

557
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:12.900
That's what something people have to look at now.

558
00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.290
And do you think the right people are looking at it,
uh,

559
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.140
I think in your world or are people looking at it?

560
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.910
I don't think this is an ideological thing.

561
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:25.170
I think it's just some entrepreneur who sees a market opportunity to be like,

562
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:28.890
paypal is being arbitrary and I can compete with them on some level.

563
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.430
All it takes is that one guy and then the battle was won and then it's going to

564
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:34.740
be another battle.
It's a as some situation.

565
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.180
So what are some of the policies of the new,
if the new right becomes,

566
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:43.710
takes over the conservative movement or take,
so let's try the consent decree.

567
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:45.610
The enemy,
right?
So whatever that is,

568
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:47.350
that whether they burn the thing down or where they,

569
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.000
whether they infiltrate it or whatever,

570
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.120
the people that care about these ideas broadly that you're talking about,

571
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.280
what does it actually look like politically?

572
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:56.620
Like what are the things that they would be fighting for police?

573
00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:01.630
And this is what's hilarious is you have a group who's United only by their

574
00:30:01.811 --> 00:30:04.600
oppositions.
Progressivism.
What do you want to do?

575
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.710
They have no even close to unanimity.
Someone UN,

576
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.660
military juntas like just martial law.
Some like me,
not for me.
Not For me.

577
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:18.220
Okay.
Thank you.
All right,
good.
Uh,
someone,
a complete liberty meaning anarchy.

578
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:23.350
Uh,
somewhat.
Um,
a restriction of the right to vote.
Uh,

579
00:30:23.351 --> 00:30:24.700
some want to accelerate,

580
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.970
they want more leftism cause they think if you accelerate and amplify the system

581
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:31.480
is going to collapse because the inherent contradictions and leftism so you have

582
00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:36.481
no consensus whatsoever about what the next steps and same thing with like for

583
00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:39.370
example,
they think people think,
oh everyone in this group likes Trump.

584
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.630
Some of them are loath Trump completely and,

585
00:30:42.631 --> 00:30:45.400
and unabashedly and culture who I've talked about in this book,

586
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.580
she's come out very hard against him and I think she called him a moron or

587
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:51.820
something like that.
What do you make of her related to Trump?

588
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.190
It was like she was huge pro Trump,
but then he's not,
you know,

589
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.490
he's not building the wall fast enough for her or a couple of the other things.

590
00:30:57.491 --> 00:31:01.100
It's like,
so you still also some real politic involved.
Yeah.

591
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.950
Culture used to be a real troll.
Right.

592
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:05.920
She knew how to say the exact right things to upset people.

593
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.480
Now she's gotten much more serious and ideological in her later books.

594
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.180
It's interesting to see her relationship with Trump.
I mean,

595
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:16.720
she said at one point she thought America was like 90%,
no chance.

596
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:21.000
Now it's maybe 40% because of Trump's election.
Uh,
she's very 90% are trans.

597
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.360
What that America's done,
we're done.

598
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.540
She thought it was like we're over 90% chance.
And then she was like,
okay,

599
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:28.720
maybe it's 40% that were done because Trump got elected.
Um,

600
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.590
I can't really speak for her,
but she is a very kind of a interesting character.

601
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.240
And I discuss your ideas at length cause her book,

602
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:39.241
Adios America was probably the most influential book of the 2016 Election Cycle.

603
00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:43.420
That's the book where Trump got the idea of they're sending the rapists.
Uh,

604
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.830
who do you find you can debate with on the other side of this?
So I get you can,

605
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.280
you can be around people on the right that you disagree on a lot of these

606
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:54.160
different things and you don't come out of the racist camp and all that stuff.

607
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.300
You find that there are some good actors on the left that you can engage with.

608
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.980
Oh,
I a lot.
Uh,
people like,
uh,
Glenn Greenwald,
Michael Tracy,

609
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:07.690
Jimmy door.
Um,
I actually don't debate cause I'm not interested in persuasion.

610
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:09.130
I'm just there to have fun.
Uh,

611
00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:12.550
and I think debating is often a waste of time and it's always a waste of time.

612
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.310
I mean the cost benefits.
So I don't really do,

613
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.470
I've had a few people on my show who are,
you know,
pretty far left.

614
00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:21.850
No Mickey constant was on a,
I also,
you'd like debating with conservatives.
Um,

615
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.740
cause I really disagree with them and since I'm coming at them from this center

616
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.340
line on that conservatism is separatism.

617
00:32:27.341 --> 00:32:30.460
Is progressivism driving the speed limit?
So,
uh,

618
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.800
one of the things I discuss in this book is National Review.

619
00:32:32.801 --> 00:32:37.430
My favorite Paleontology magazine in the late nineties,
they had this,
uh,

620
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:42.110
uh,
editorial comparing the fight for gay rights to a theoretical Pfeiffer

621
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:43.460
necrophilia and saying,

622
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:46.040
what's the difference between fighting for two men to have sex with each other

623
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.080
as opposed to having sex with a corpse?

624
00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:50.270
And it was just a very disturbing article.

625
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.030
But now the conservative case for gay marriage.

626
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.770
So what principals are there that would have you say that then and have you say

627
00:32:57.771 --> 00:33:02.540
this now.
So it's disturbing then.
And the a hypocrisy is disturbing,
uh,

628
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:03.403
to this day as well.

629
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.130
<v 0>So you're,
you're more,
you care more about the hypocrisy of it,
not the,</v>

630
00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:08.510
you don't care about gay marriage.

631
00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.550
<v 1>Well,
I,
I mean I care about both.
I mean,
if you're going to have a principal,</v>

632
00:33:11.551 --> 00:33:14.580
I would have more respect for someone to be like gay marriage is wrong because

633
00:33:14.581 --> 00:33:15.081
of the Bible,
blah,

634
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:20.081
Blah Blah and stick to that as opposed to I'm anti gay then cause I'm a phony

635
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.100
and now Mancy gay now cause I'm a phony.
You're,

636
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.790
you're bringing nothing to the table.

637
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:28.150
<v 0>Yeah.
But I mean you protect you specifically.
You don't care.
I do.</v>

638
00:33:28.151 --> 00:33:30.980
I wouldn't want,
I don't care.
I'm glad that you're married to that too.

639
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.020
Well that's what I meant.
I mean,
you don't care.
Uh,
see,

640
00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:38.500
I mean Karen and negative sense.
Oh of course.
No,
no.
Yeah,
no,
absolutely.

641
00:33:38.501 --> 00:33:42.330
Please Mary.
Whatever you want.
Yeah.
Mary a corpse.
And we'll know.
Well,

642
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.460
you do have limits only if they're good to like only if they're good,

643
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.870
then you can marry a quarter.
Yeah.
Um,

644
00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:51.430
how crazy do you think things are going to get as we roll into 2020 because I

645
00:33:51.431 --> 00:33:53.140
think we're still as crazy as possible

646
00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:55.160
<v 1>fully.
And here's something that I,</v>

647
00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.660
I've called that once I say no one can really kind of deny it.

648
00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.430
A historically the president or the nominee hasn't really engaged with the other

649
00:34:03.431 --> 00:34:06.190
party's primary process.
For the first time in history,

650
00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:11.490
a sitting president is going to be live tweeting the debates and the primary of

651
00:34:11.831 --> 00:34:15.310
the other team.
And not only that,
it's not like he's gonna accommodate like,
Oh,

652
00:34:15.311 --> 00:34:19.780
I disagree with his economic plan.
He's loving nukes in his Trump Ian style.

653
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.080
And none of these 23 candidates are good to know what to do.

654
00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:25.660
And none of their advisors who are getting paid a lot of money,

655
00:34:25.661 --> 00:34:28.300
social media experts are going to have know what to do.
There's no blueprint.

656
00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.080
And the question becomes,
is it a badge of honor that Trump is clowning me?

657
00:34:32.081 --> 00:34:35.890
Does that make me the strong candidate?
Do I ignore him?
Am I above the fray?

658
00:34:35.891 --> 00:34:38.320
Like historical people used to do like,
oh my opponent,
you know,

659
00:34:38.321 --> 00:34:42.220
that kind of stuff.
So this is going to be absolutely hilarious.

660
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.420
And you want that hilarity.
The more chaos,
the better politically.
Yeah.

661
00:34:46.421 --> 00:34:48.940
I don't want people to be able to get together and impose their will.

662
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.240
<v 0>So what if you were one of the 23?
What would you do</v>

663
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.610
as someone that knows how to play the trolling game that knows how to,
you know,

664
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.060
throw the bombs back,
let's say,
what would you do?
Oh,
Trump.

665
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:07.070
So you're onstage trumps,
you know,
do it is Twitter thing.
You get off stage,

666
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:07.940
you see what's going on,

667
00:35:07.941 --> 00:35:11.030
what would you do or what would you tell if you were an advisor to one of these

668
00:35:11.031 --> 00:35:12.260
people,
what would you do?
Oh,
well,
I,

669
00:35:12.261 --> 00:35:14.610
I know you don't want to give away all your have designed,

670
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:15.463
I would never advise it.

671
00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:20.620
<v 1>In all seriousness.
A,
what I would do is if you look at when he was,
uh,</v>

672
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.730
a comedy central roast,
and they ask them beforehand,
they said,

673
00:35:23.731 --> 00:35:25.950
what jokes can you make and can you make?

674
00:35:25.951 --> 00:35:30.210
The only thing he wasn't comfortable being joked about was that he's not as rich

675
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:33.270
as he wanted as he claims he is.
So since that's his line,

676
00:35:33.271 --> 00:35:35.160
I would hit him with that line as much as possible.

677
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.690
But at the same time it's hard to someone who is that,
you know,

678
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:44.200
Hiroshima in a China shop.
I mean he's,
he's,
he's like,
it is,
but I don't,

679
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.940
Justin Amash got him pretty good I think over the weekend with coming out in

680
00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:51.420
favor of impeachment.
I think that really ruffled this and others were on the,

681
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.760
oh no,
you know what it is.
This is what I would hit him with.

682
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:58.620
I would say you bragged during the campaign that you had hired the best and

683
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:02.400
smartest people.
How come all these people are resigning,
you know,
and,

684
00:36:02.401 --> 00:36:05.880
and hit him with that.
His big core competency,
alleged core competency.

685
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.040
How competent do you think he is or isn't a,

686
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.570
I actually forgetting the tactic,
the trolling tactic,

687
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.210
Twitter as competent as being president,
but as being frozen.

688
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.040
It's hard to tell because there's,

689
00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.460
I've that theory that probably isn't that crazy that when you'd become president

690
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:21.780
they sit you down and they're like,
all right,

691
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:23.670
this is what you can do and this is what you can't do.

692
00:36:23.671 --> 00:36:25.980
The fact that Obama was droning everyone all the time,

693
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.240
it seems like it's out of his,
you know,
peacenik background or it could be that,

694
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:33.000
you know,
he was a closet,
you know,
Hawk the whole time.
We don't know.

695
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.240
I don't think any of us really know what it's like to be president.

696
00:36:36.241 --> 00:36:41.241
The fact that he hasn't gotten a lot of his big promises through is kind of a

697
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:42.330
big deal.

698
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:47.310
The fact that he has taken on unprecedented opposition and his head is still,

699
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.370
you know,
being held hide.
His approval ratings are still relatively high.

700
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.990
I mean that's a bit of an accomplishment.

701
00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:56.040
So since you wrote a book on North Korea.
Yeah.
And there's been a little,

702
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:59.420
I think last time I had you on,
maybe they were in the beginnings of some shows,

703
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.360
discussions.
Where are we at with North Korea right now?
I am.

704
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:07.800
So North Korea has this a secret weapon which causes everyone on earth to have

705
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:08.634
amnesia.

706
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.180
And what happens is North Korea goes through these cycles as night follows day,

707
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.970
which is there'll be warmongers,
we're going to nuke America,

708
00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:19.410
we're going to kill everyone,
blah,
blah.
And then six months later we want peace.

709
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:21.060
Please work with us,
please work with us.

710
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.720
And they've just gone back to the war cycle and everyone's like,
oh my God,

711
00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:27.840
we've never heard this for North Korea had PR sentence president Trump to death.

712
00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:28.440
Uh,

713
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.740
they were threatening to new Guam and Alaska and even previously that they were

714
00:37:31.741 --> 00:37:36.440
thrown into new Boston.
So it's,
this is how they,
this is their song.
Terrible.
Oh,

715
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.600
come on now.
It's um,

716
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.500
so this is where they are right now.
I am very hopeful.

717
00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:48.480
The thing I'm very happy with with president Trump is that North Korea is now on

718
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:52.800
the front pages because we need to engage with this most evil country.

719
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.790
And I was on Fox and friends first or a while ago and they said,

720
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:59.520
what is your big concern with the summit?

721
00:37:59.521 --> 00:38:01.830
And I said the continuing slavery of the North Korean people.

722
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.010
So that whenever you're looking at this issue,
always ask,
in my view,

723
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:10.160
what does this mean for these 20 million hostages who are being kept enslaved by

724
00:38:10.201 --> 00:38:14.940
this evil government that starved it's population on purpose during the 90s and

725
00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:17.340
killed one to 2 million people.
That's is not funny.

726
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:21.360
So do you think that Trump is sort of the perfect person for this,

727
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:25.530
that as North Korea vacillates back and forth with all this rhetoric that Trump

728
00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:26.880
can actually match them at that?

729
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:30.720
And that might be the thing that kind of allows a detente.

730
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.850
I don't know about perfect,
but I,

731
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.990
you have to have hope for these people especially,
I mean not to sound whatever.

732
00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:40.570
Once you've been there and you've seen people there.

733
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.240
Everyone I met in North Korea is still there.

734
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.050
Like every single person I saw on the street,
every kid,
every grandma.

735
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.060
And it messes with your head because this is what,
2012 they come up.

736
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:53.350
Your life has changed since 22 I'll think of much mine has and none of theirs

737
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:55.420
has.
I still see my guide,
you know,

738
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:58.480
pictures of her on Instagram and she's still trapped and she like a million are

739
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:01.870
there,
but she's still trapped in that prison with those gilded bars.

740
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:04.240
So it's very disturbing.

741
00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.790
<v 0>How does an anarchist care about foreign policy?</v>

742
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.140
<v 1>Well,
because this,
the governments,
the governments,
the enemy,</v>

743
00:39:10.141 --> 00:39:13.830
this is the most evil government on earth.
This is a pretty uh,
easy syllogism.

744
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:15.090
Okay,

745
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:16.920
<v 0>interesting.
You don't really think about that though.</v>

746
00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:21.921
I mean generally when people think of a more libertarian view of the world,

747
00:39:22.171 --> 00:39:24.300
it's like,
no,
just let everybody do whatever the hell

748
00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:25.510
<v 1>they want.
Well,</v>

749
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:27.310
I'm not going to let the government do whatever the hell they wanted these

750
00:39:27.311 --> 00:39:30.220
people.
Yeah,
I mean,
and that's the other thing,
like we have it.
So,

751
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.850
even though it's not your government,
these are human beings and you know,

752
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:35.860
being born in the Soviet Union,
being Jewish,

753
00:39:35.861 --> 00:39:38.830
these were two chances my family could have been sent to concentration camp.

754
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.800
So the fact that we have concentration camps right now,

755
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:44.110
that you could see them on Google earth,
you know what,
not at high school,

756
00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:46.510
I always talk about how the Holocaust happened,
how the hell has happened.

757
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:50.440
Something similar happened in the 90s in North Korea against its own population.

758
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:53.860
So this is something that maybe other people don't care.

759
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:57.400
But for me it's kind of like there,
but for the grace of God,
go I,

760
00:39:57.401 --> 00:39:58.990
and when I met the guy that I had,

761
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.490
she had the same haircut my mom had in like 1982 which is a cutting edge in

762
00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:06.700
North Korea,
but it's just looking at like a sliding doors thing and it's like,

763
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:08.740
holy crap,
I could have been born here.

764
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.710
And instead of sitting here in my Willy Wonka costume,
you know,

765
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.120
who knows what would've happened to me.

766
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:19.250
<v 0>What do you think's going to happen to the traditional conservatives?
Oh God,</v>

767
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.480
I is it absolutely over because they can't withstand what's coming on both

768
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.060
<v 1>sides at this point.
I don't see how they come back because I don't,</v>

769
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:31.660
they didn't bring that much to the table to begin with as opposed to like give

770
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.980
socking to the left and now Trump is talking to the left more than anyone else

771
00:40:35.981 --> 00:40:38.430
has.
I'm going to be talking to Ben domination,
you know,

772
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:39.580
not that long from the federalists.

773
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:44.530
And I'm very curious to hear his take on this book and this thesis because it

774
00:40:44.531 --> 00:40:47.410
could because he's someone that is more of a traditional hardcore,

775
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:51.190
pure conservative.
Yeah.
Mutual respect.
I like him a lot.
Um,

776
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.800
but I don't see how they regain,
uh,

777
00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.460
this party especially because if one of the big issues with conservatism and

778
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.230
maybe republicanism is young people,

779
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:04.710
young people are going to be drawn to humor and edginess and memes and they're

780
00:41:04.901 --> 00:41:09.100
not going to be drawn to kind of like a,
Hey,
remember Reagan,
you know,

781
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.170
Reagan's great,
he ended the Cold War,

782
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.410
but this is not going to be a selling point for your movement.
And also the,

783
00:41:14.411 --> 00:41:17.500
I think young people are also drawn to aggression,
um,

784
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:20.950
and kind of flipping over tables and that's what the new right does offer them.

785
00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.610
<v 0>Are there political leaders outside of however much Trump is involved in this?</v>

786
00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:28.160
Are there some other people that you like?
I know that's the weird thing.

787
00:41:28.161 --> 00:41:31.430
It's like you don't want a political leader per se because you don't want to be

788
00:41:31.431 --> 00:41:34.070
personally who I like.
Yeah.
Well or that you think can

789
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.450
<v 1>sort of grab some of these pieces and do something good in your estimation.</v>

790
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.970
Uh,
I can't,
I,
I'm sure there are.

791
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.440
Telsey Gabbert I like anyone who brings more of the antiwar message.

792
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:47.930
Uh,
funny you wrote a book called the New Right,

793
00:41:47.931 --> 00:41:51.140
and you're picking a candidate who was running as a democrat.
Sure.

794
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.660
Anti War Democrat,
but I,
interesting.

795
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.720
I would love it if there was a complete consensus in Washington that war is a

796
00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:03.500
last resort and an absolute nightmare.
That is my goal.
So I just like,

797
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:06.830
we agree that slavery is a nonstarter.
The like,
sure,

798
00:42:06.831 --> 00:42:08.780
I'll get the argument that maybe we have to go to war,

799
00:42:08.781 --> 00:42:11.240
but the fact that we can be so glib about it and be like,
oh yeah,

800
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:13.430
we're just gonna [inaudible] here's another example.

801
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:16.220
Do you think that we've crossed a little bit of a threshold when it comes to
war?

802
00:42:16.221 --> 00:42:19.070
I mean,
I feel like the mistakes of Iraq and nobody knows why the hell we're in

803
00:42:19.071 --> 00:42:22.490
Afghanistan still Trump is not beating wardrobes.
You know,
there's,

804
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:26.270
there's stuff about,
there's always this over the top rhetoric related to Iran,

805
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.620
but I,
I don't sense,
this is a guy that wants to just say,

806
00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.940
I think he's actually very against the blog,

807
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:35.810
these nation building and the blood lust of the establishment,
which I include.

808
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:38.540
The corporate press cannot be overstated.
Uh,

809
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.500
when 2016 Trump's the nominee,
we heard it every single day.

810
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.350
He's crazy.
He's going to give us to world war three.

811
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.560
He's going to get pissed off at a tweet from China and press the nuclear button.

812
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.880
Remember,
we heard this all the time.

813
00:42:49.881 --> 00:42:52.250
Carly fury and I got asked this the second debate.
The first question,

814
00:42:52.251 --> 00:42:56.220
do you trust president Trump with his finger on the nuclear button and now,
uh,

815
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.920
China has hacked our systems.

816
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:02.090
Russia has tried to interfere with our elections and the press is constantly

817
00:43:02.091 --> 00:43:04.520
saying,
do something about it.
Do something about,
do something.

818
00:43:04.521 --> 00:43:05.660
I'd do something about Venezuela.

819
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:10.400
So the fact that he's not getting us into world war three is not being used as a

820
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:14.090
slight against him by the same people who regarded that as a problem when he was

821
00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:18.620
a nominee.
It's horrific.
And this has been a long time coming.

822
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.130
How much does it since uh,
the,
we talked about yellow journalism in high school.

823
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:25.310
I remember,
uh,
the Spanish American war and then they pretend they went away.

824
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:29.060
It didn't go away.
The same press wants,
if it bleeds,
it leads.

825
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.070
They can't wait to get us into another engagement.
It's,

826
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.480
it's disgraceful what happened.
What has to happen with the press then?

827
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.830
And I mean this in terms of cable news,
mainstream news,
Network News,

828
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:41.810
I mean this vox Huffpo sure.

829
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.610
The battle is the battle is won when the average corporate journalist is

830
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:50.180
regarded with the exact same way as the average tobacco executive.

831
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.300
They have a job.
Uh,
they're promoting their product.

832
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.890
Their product is cancerous and deadly.
They're often bright people.

833
00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:01.460
They're often good people,
but be aware of what it is that they're selling you.

834
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.960
So how do we find some people to trust in the mix of all of this in this big

835
00:44:05.961 --> 00:44:10.400
mess?
Uh,
trust,
trust,
but verify.
I mean,
I'll use the Reagan.

836
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.820
I mean trust is,
I'm not interested in trusting people initially in,

837
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:18.440
in a trusting ideas and creating mechanisms that people can't enforce their

838
00:44:18.441 --> 00:44:22.430
wills.
The trust won't be necessary.
Like I don't need to trust like Ebay,
right?

839
00:44:22.431 --> 00:44:26.550
I don't need to trust that other guy is going to be a honorable because they're,

840
00:44:26.551 --> 00:44:29.000
they're different systems.
I can get my money refunded,
so and so forth.

841
00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:32.940
So there's no reason for me to have a political trust because systemically he's

842
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:34.380
going to betray me at some point or another.

843
00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.870
<v 0>God,
there's a lot here at malice.
Thank you.</v>

844
00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.050
Take me somewhere else altogether.

845
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.120
<v 1>W what do you mean?
Where else do you want to go in this conversation right now?</v>

846
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:46.480
Oh,
well I got,
I mean,
I've got a million things rattling here.

847
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:50.410
[inaudible] your humerus.
Yeah.
Doesn't it bother you?
I,

848
00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.400
one of the things I defend in this book is dark humor.

849
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:56.870
And here's the let's tie back to North Korea.
Yeah.
I knew a refugee and he said,

850
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.690
so when people say that's not funny,
right?
Uh,

851
00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:01.670
it's this puritanism HL Mencken said,

852
00:45:01.671 --> 00:45:04.550
puritanism is the idea that someone somewhere is happy.
Right?

853
00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:08.120
I knew this refugee North Korean refugee and he went to high school here and

854
00:45:08.121 --> 00:45:09.680
he's talking to his friends and they go,
hey,

855
00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:12.200
remember when we were kids we had Pokemon?
And he goes,
yeah,

856
00:45:12.201 --> 00:45:14.420
except instead of Pokemon and watch my dad's starved to death.

857
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:19.200
Now are you going to tell him that's not appropriate?
Right,
right.
Are you,

858
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.310
do you know what it's like to,
what is his coping mechanisms?

859
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.610
Do you know what it's like to watch someone's hungry,
starve to death,

860
00:45:25.611 --> 00:45:28.460
and it's your own dad?
We can never wrap our heads around this.

861
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:31.430
So for you to tell him that kind of joke is not appropriate.

862
00:45:31.431 --> 00:45:32.570
How dare you buying McFarland?

863
00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.270
A great comedian was roasting Jim Norton and she said,

864
00:45:35.271 --> 00:45:38.180
your show is so and listen to bubble.
I'd rather hear my daughter drown.

865
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:42.230
Now that's very dark,
but are you telling me she doesn't love her daughter?

866
00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:43.700
Are you telling me she doesn't know how to tell a joke?

867
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
So the metaphor I use when people say a certain subject is not appropriate for

868
00:45:49.251 --> 00:45:53.270
humor.
I say it's like flour Flou F l o U R is flower food.

869
00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:57.170
Well no one eats flour,
but everyone eats it when it's processed and baked.
Right?

870
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.960
So same thing with jokes then.
This darker the subject,

871
00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.530
the harder it is to make it palatable.
And I've examples of,
you know,

872
00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:06.600
they made me cut one joke,
but I have examples of all sorts of,
you know,

873
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.170
subjects that are supposed to be off limits.

874
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.100
And maybe you personally don't find it funny if someone's been assaulted and

875
00:46:13.101 --> 00:46:16.310
they're like,
you know,
these kinds of jokes set me off.
That's there.

876
00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.360
But the idea that no one,
yeah,
she'd find that funny,
isn't it?
Yeah.

877
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:23.620
<v 0>Well it's also stealing something that's very human is that we use humorous</v>

878
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:28.780
comedy is tragedy plus time.
We use humor to be able to look back on the past.

879
00:46:28.781 --> 00:46:32.080
I mean if Mel Brooks couldn't of made fun of Hitler,

880
00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:35.710
couldn't of made fun of the Holocaust,
that was,
that was actually healing for,

881
00:46:35.711 --> 00:46:38.650
I'm sure for him personally,
but for millions of other people,

882
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:43.570
<v 1>but the establishment which gets by on legitimacy and quality conversation,</v>

883
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.540
it cannot abide that court jester laughing at them

884
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:50.460
<v 0>is,
do you think that's why they took out the AOC parody on on Twitter because it</v>

885
00:46:50.461 --> 00:46:52.000
was really freaking good.
Okay.

886
00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.900
<v 1>They took out a lot of parody accounts and it's strange.</v>

887
00:46:54.901 --> 00:46:58.860
All those Trump parody accounts are still up and the pair and sign live,

888
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.320
which is their right and their great do it make the,

889
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:02.760
you should be making on the president,

890
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:06.660
but you're not saying it's great Ruo but why not?
Sure.
Pretty crappy.

891
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.590
I haven't watched it in a way.

892
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.370
<v 0>Yeah.
No,
I mean,
I haven't watched it in 15 years,</v>

893
00:47:09.371 --> 00:47:11.130
but every time I see a ten second clip,
it's like,

894
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.580
<v 1>it's basically,
it's basically as good as the gene wilder Willy Wonka movie.</v>

895
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:19.080
So that's a call back,
my friend.
Yeah,
I understood it was a call back.

896
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:21.980
<v 0>The most ludicrous thing I've ever heard in my entire life.</v>

897
00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.730
Someone who I love your outside the box thinking and yet

898
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:31.930
<v 1>it's bizarre.
The point is,
uh,
humor is,
if it's this,</v>

899
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.260
it's a Jewish thing.
It's this Jewish thing of laughing to keep from crying.

900
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:38.050
And it's a very waspy thing,
you know,
it's like,
ah,
you know,

901
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:39.880
you don't make the kind of jokes there table.

902
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:44.320
And just because something isn't for someone doesn't mean it's not for no one.

903
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.730
And one of the elements of the evangelical left is the idea of universalism.

904
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:52.720
Everything has to be inclusive,
everything has to be for everyone.

905
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:57.070
And my answer is no,
not everything has to be for everyone.
And that's okay.

906
00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.830
Not everyone is welcomed my house,
not everyone's gonna enjoy this book.

907
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.080
And you know what?
If you don't think I'm interesting or funny or smart,

908
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.040
I wish you nothing but goodwill,
this a big world,
go live your best life.

909
00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:11.070
Do you think that it doesn't make sense or does it deeply that they're obsessed

910
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:12.400
with our differences?

911
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:15.520
They're obsessed with our skin color differences in our sexuality and our gender

912
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:16.001
difference.
That does.

913
00:48:16.001 --> 00:48:19.090
I mean that is the entire thrust of everything that they're giving us.

914
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:23.050
And yet they're also the ones that want us to be exactly the same.
Uh,

915
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.960
well I is that because,
is that a feature or a bug?
Actually,

916
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.240
I don't know if it's a feature or a bug.

917
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:30.790
It certainly works for them to some extent because what,
you know,

918
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.120
kind of evangelical and,

919
00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.100
and gives people is a sense of certainty and it also gives them a sense of being

920
00:48:36.101 --> 00:48:40.240
saved.
Right?
So once I recognize the pervasiveness of wreck of racism,

921
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.510
I've Kinda been initiated into the mysteries of this faith.
And therefore,

922
00:48:43.511 --> 00:48:44.440
since I'm inherently good,

923
00:48:44.441 --> 00:48:48.040
now I'm in a position to condemn heretics and centers and if necessary,

924
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:50.350
wipe them off the face of the earth.
So they,

925
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.130
they want us to be the same in terms of being saved,

926
00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.940
but they don't want us to be necessarily saving in terms of a literalist.

927
00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.800
I don't know that I've ever heard you talk about this specifically,

928
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:03.010
but how much of what you think is going on with the evangelical left,

929
00:49:03.011 --> 00:49:07.330
as you just described them,
is just a disconnect from faith?
Oh,

930
00:49:07.331 --> 00:49:09.790
I think it's a degeneration of the Social Gospel.

931
00:49:09.791 --> 00:49:13.210
So I traced this so conservatives,
you know when I talk to them,
they're like,
oh,

932
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:17.620
they admit that the left controls culture and media and Hollywood and things and

933
00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:20.470
things like that,
and you say,
well,
how did this happen?
And they're like,

934
00:49:20.471 --> 00:49:22.990
we have to have our own version and go,
how did this happen?
They're like,
oh,

935
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:24.490
it used to be,
I'm like,
when?

936
00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:28.240
When it was the 1930s when literal communists were running Hollywood,

937
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:31.420
when Woodrow Wilson is playing birth of a nation at the White House,

938
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:35.260
FDR has so many Democrats that they have to sit on the republican side of the

939
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:37.180
seats in Congress.
It makes no sense.

940
00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:38.980
Other than that you're saying it's not that they lost control,

941
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:41.980
they never had control.
Correct.
It's always been,

942
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:46.960
and there's a reason because leftism lends itself to innovation and creativity

943
00:49:46.961 --> 00:49:50.110
because one of the aspects of leftism is liking what's new,

944
00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.030
liking what's innovative,
this psychological thing.

945
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:54.850
And there's nothing wrong with being conservative saying I don't like new stuff.

946
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:57.040
I like things to saying that's if that's fine for you,

947
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:00.790
but that's going to be a huge disadvantage when you're trying to attract people

948
00:50:00.791 --> 00:50:03.940
who are artistically minded because they're going to be drawn to those who are

949
00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.500
maybe not overly openly minded.
Right,
because it sounds good.
I'm for progress.

950
00:50:08.501 --> 00:50:12.590
Everyone's for progress,
but it depends what you're progressing to.
Correct.
Right.

951
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.940
Is the rub.
So how conservatives,

952
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.540
how low the left controls culture and built it is one of the big themes of this

953
00:50:19.541 --> 00:50:23.110
book and I think filling in a big hole on the right because conservatives really

954
00:50:23.111 --> 00:50:25.380
don't know.
And here's another example,
concerns.
You remember our,

955
00:50:25.381 --> 00:50:27.590
sure back in the nineties Jon Stewart,
you know,

956
00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.690
what are the 2000 excuse me was running the show.

957
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:34.520
And the answer was let's have a conservative daily show.
That's not creativity,

958
00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:37.790
that's just mirroring what someone else has built as opposed to people like I

959
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:39.800
would say like rush Limbaugh and Roger Ailes,

960
00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:42.500
rush Limbaugh invented basically talk radio made or what it was.

961
00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.310
Roger Ailes was told,
we want you to compete with CNN.
He goes,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

962
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:47.900
I'm going to destroy CNN.

963
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:52.370
And CNN was all news and he made it this news entertainment opinion thing and

964
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:53.520
then CNN followed suit.

965
00:50:53.521 --> 00:50:56.690
So those are two examples of the right actually creating something,

966
00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.620
a kind of city generis you think we ever get to something that feels a little

967
00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:02.690
more stable.
Again,

968
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:06.620
I don't work at right now I think stability politically means oppression.

969
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.420
And I think the stability of like,

970
00:51:08.421 --> 00:51:11.870
let's suppose the fifties and this is one thing that I'm hopeful with social

971
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:13.820
media,
they were entire schools of thought.

972
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:17.090
They were made invisible because they were threatening to the social order and

973
00:51:17.091 --> 00:51:20.900
now they have to pick people off one by one instead of entire schools of
thought.

974
00:51:20.901 --> 00:51:24.290
And that is progress in a good way.
What if you were picked off?

975
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.940
I'm too charming and I know I,
I mean I,
I can be Glib suck.
It would suck.

976
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:30.620
I mean what would you do?

977
00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:34.040
I mean because I know what a lot of people are thinking.
It's like,
you know,

978
00:51:34.041 --> 00:51:37.280
we've seen enough of the names that we've mentioned throughout this shirt get

979
00:51:37.281 --> 00:51:39.140
picked off and get suspended and get banned.

980
00:51:39.141 --> 00:51:42.410
It's not that there are best buddies or anything,

981
00:51:42.411 --> 00:51:46.580
but there were everyone's sort of in the same sort of circles at some level.

982
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:49.670
Uh,
again,
coming from that Soviet background,

983
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.550
I know that idea of like it could be you tomorrow,
it's not.

984
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.700
It's always at random cause that way you keep everyone's scared to dive into

985
00:51:55.701 --> 00:51:56.534
that a little bit more.
Sure.

986
00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.470
So one of the techniques that the Soviets did is it wouldn't be like the worst

987
00:52:00.471 --> 00:52:04.460
people who would get kicked off like a barrier said,
find me the man.

988
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:05.294
I'll find you the crime.

989
00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:08.480
So style and I do not think we're in a Stalinist society.

990
00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:10.610
I'm just using this as a metaphor,
a very loose metaphor.

991
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:13.850
I just really want that to be clear cause I,
we got a ways to go before that.

992
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:17.630
But the,
the principal to keep a population kind of submissive is,

993
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.160
it's not always the loud mouth.

994
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.970
You pick the housewife or you pick this grandma and then everyone knows you

995
00:52:22.971 --> 00:52:23.804
could be next.

996
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:27.060
So you only got to take out like three people and that 100 are going up

997
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.190
basically fall in line.

998
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:33.340
And because Twitter's rules are ambiguous and it's seemingly at random and they

999
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:34.730
don't even give warning,

1000
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:37.880
they could've sat down that AOC account and said these three tweets are

1001
00:52:37.881 --> 00:52:42.800
offensive.
Delete them.
Yeah.
There.
So even though he did nothing wrong by the,

1002
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.110
by the rules that they supposedly put out there,

1003
00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:48.080
I mean he labeled it as a parody account.
That's the main thing.
Sure.

1004
00:52:48.081 --> 00:52:50.240
And many people have more than one account and very,

1005
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.880
and also if you're want to be,
have this kind of public square,
you know,

1006
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.680
political conversation.
Once someone is a certain level of stature who are,

1007
00:52:57.681 --> 00:52:58.910
you know,
kind of an influencer,

1008
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.360
it might be that Jack has to talk to them personally or there has to be three

1009
00:53:02.361 --> 00:53:04.340
checks before their band.
Or You could have warnings.

1010
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:09.200
I mean there's a lot of systems for keeping people who are part of this thriving

1011
00:53:09.201 --> 00:53:12.410
conversation in place,
but that's not what they want and that's their right.

1012
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:14.060
But this is something that people should recognize.

1013
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:18.880
So you would say that the tech companies basically want to keep us all in semi

1014
00:53:18.881 --> 00:53:21.860
darkness all the time because that's the easiest way to,

1015
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:23.240
I don't know if it's easy,

1016
00:53:23.241 --> 00:53:26.530
but it seems to be effective for them in of cause then you have self censorship.

1017
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:29.010
Right.
Because you know,
I had this tweet,

1018
00:53:29.011 --> 00:53:32.460
I don't even remember what it was and I was scared to put it up because I'm like

1019
00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:37.410
at any moment that eye of Sauron can fall on me and on booted.
Yeah.

1020
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.620
And I'm sure you know this feeling very well.
So that's with your youtube stuff?

1021
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:41.371
No,

1022
00:53:41.371 --> 00:53:46.260
I know it extremely well and it's like if I'm even remotely close to where the

1023
00:53:46.261 --> 00:53:50.070
cliff is,
man,
things have shifted in a seriously dangerous way.

1024
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.250
There will be a certain amount of people that don't want me talking to you.

1025
00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:55.320
There are certain amount of people that didn't want to be talking to,

1026
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.830
to Cernovich,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
And I have to figure out who is who.

1027
00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:00.990
I think it's okay to talk about.
Let's talk about that in the book.

1028
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:05.991
How is it okay for Barbara Walters to sit down with like Kadafi who murdered so

1029
00:54:06.451 --> 00:54:09.510
many people?
Uh,
Diane Sawyer with Charles Manson,

1030
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:14.400
I mean with a swastika on his forehead that telling me the Diane Sawyer didn't

1031
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:18.570
endorse all the views of Charles Manson because that seems to be what they say

1032
00:54:18.571 --> 00:54:21.400
about if I sit down with somebody I must endorse older boy.
It's amazing.

1033
00:54:21.401 --> 00:54:24.150
And when they're like,
oh,
he follows this person on Twitter,

1034
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:27.400
it's like everyone follows the precedent and he's the for it.

1035
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.540
Like when CNN places video his speech,
does that mean they're,

1036
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:34.470
they're endorsing it.
So it's a very weird situation.
But again,

1037
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:37.650
because they're legitimate,
you're unorthodox.
You're not legitimate.

1038
00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:41.270
You don't have the same rights in a sense that they do.
Well,

1039
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.870
we talk about it right before we started,
but you saw the way media,
uh,

1040
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.330
media matters went after me cause I was going to have mayor Pete on and

1041
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:51.100
immediately went ahead of him though.
Yeah.
Well,
so that's the thing.
Yeah.
Well,

1042
00:54:51.101 --> 00:54:55.110
can you take that away?
I mean you,
you know exactly how it works.
Like they can't,

1043
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:57.870
like when Donald Trump Jr,
uh,

1044
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:02.820
took a tweet of mine and put on Instagram and for days I was sending people off.

1045
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.790
Basically it was like,
well,
they can't get a Trump so they're going to get at me.

1046
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:09.360
So if they can,
so you don't give a crap about media matters,
I'm sure.

1047
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:12.330
But they can sure get to Pete because they'll have his ear and it worked

1048
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.600
apparently.
I mean,
think how sad and depressing that is.
Forget,

1049
00:55:15.601 --> 00:55:19.080
forget mayor Pete coming in here and doing the show.
It's actually irrelevant.

1050
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:21.840
I would like to have talk to the guy,
but that strikes me is irrelevant.

1051
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:27.080
It's more that either he or his handlers are willing to bow to the mob that he,

1052
00:55:27.951 --> 00:55:30.930
he,
you know,
his people basically agree to do an interview.

1053
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.080
And then because media matters Huffpo and box,

1054
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.870
which the latter two are supposed to be places of journalism,

1055
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.330
they are leveraging,
uh,

1056
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.660
or trying to influence a political candidate from talking to,

1057
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:46.740
the only reason a mayor of Indiana town is in the running for the presidency is

1058
00:55:46.741 --> 00:55:50.190
because of Huffpo media matters.
And Vox,
the I,
the idea of this,

1059
00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:52.920
a platform for even Senate beggars belief.

1060
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.670
So of course he's going to cow tow to the people who put them in the position.

1061
00:55:56.671 --> 00:55:59.760
He has this guy's known natural constituencies like 37 years old.

1062
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:04.740
We've got a big battle ahead of us.
Yeah.

1063
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:08.730
And the important thing is,
uh,

1064
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.900
to have fun and enjoy life because we're still free and we're still blessed in

1065
00:56:12.901 --> 00:56:14.790
this country.
And this is one that things I do disagree with,

1066
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:16.110
with many POCs than you.
Right.

1067
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:19.470
These people think America's ruined were destroyed.
There's no hope.

1068
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:20.730
And it makes me very,

1069
00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:24.160
very sad because you go online and then you find more creative people doing

1070
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:27.700
awesome things,
then you can count.
Yeah.
And we definitely focus,

1071
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.500
seemingly we focus on the negative more,

1072
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:32.050
but that is one of the things that when I see you on Twitter and I'm like,

1073
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:35.410
you are actually having fun with this and there is a need.

1074
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:40.240
This endless political politicy politicization.
Yes.
Did I say that?
Yes,
you did.

1075
00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:44.160
Yeah.
Of everything.
It's making people crazy and depressed.
Uh,

1076
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.890
one of the things I really hate about the left and a certain kind of the left is

1077
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:51.130
the idea that the personal is the political.
And to me,

1078
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:55.450
if I disagree with someone politically that this would have any ramification on

1079
00:56:55.451 --> 00:56:58.660
our friendship is so profoundly disturbing.

1080
00:56:58.661 --> 00:57:01.090
I can't even begin the like if God forbid,

1081
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:04.300
some of my family dies and I have to look at my phone and be like,

1082
00:57:04.301 --> 00:57:06.940
well I can't call this person because they're a Bernie person.

1083
00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.570
What kind of human twisted,
twisted place.

1084
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.020
And even people who are like regular Christians don't think in these terms.
Like,

1085
00:57:14.021 --> 00:57:15.660
I have good friends.
I'm staying with a couple there.

1086
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.850
They're all solid Christians.
If my mom,
something happened,
my family,

1087
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:22.660
one of theirs,
I mean,
you're Jewish.
This would never even enter their heads.

1088
00:57:22.661 --> 00:57:25.240
And not even in a million years.
But it's like,
oh,
you're a Trump voter.

1089
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:28.840
You're a Hillary voter.
I can't,
you know,
whatever.
With you,
this is very,

1090
00:57:28.841 --> 00:57:31.030
very tribal and disturbing to me.

1091
00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:35.650
Have you figured out any ways to deprogram some of these people?
Yes.

1092
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.150
A humor.
Um,
I think it's,
I think once you,

1093
00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:45.220
I encourage people to see the absurdity of their position and also it's tell

1094
00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:46.780
them you can let go.

1095
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.560
You don't have to be so ideological all the time.

1096
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:55.330
Life is wonderful.
Enjoy your life and you shouldn't be depressed.
Let's suppose,

1097
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:56.440
let's suppose Mike Pence,

1098
00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.390
if you're gay and Mike Prince is precedent that might suck for you.
But come on,

1099
00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:05.680
go to what you go.
Do we whoa,
go to hamburger Mary's.
Have Fun.
I mean,

1100
00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:08.860
this is not really a reflection of your life because there will always be a

1101
00:58:08.861 --> 00:58:12.040
precedent that you hate.
So focus as much as you can.

1102
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:16.480
And this isn't to be shocking.
Message on living your life to the fullest.

1103
00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:21.260
That's it,
man.
Yeah.
I don't need to ask you anything else.
That's it.

1104
00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:25.670
I think let's get people,
regardless of where the politics fall on any of this,

1105
00:58:25.671 --> 00:58:29.090
it's like,
let's get people to realize it's still pretty good and,

1106
00:58:29.091 --> 00:58:33.260
and don't get too caught up in all the literacy and just when I'm trolling

1107
00:58:33.261 --> 00:58:36.410
someone,
just retweet it and sit back and laugh.
Don't on my trolls.

1108
00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.610
Where do you get this jacket?
Uh,
I mean,
I know Beluga made it

1109
00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.190
follow the Willy Wonka of politics.

1110
00:58:46.191 --> 00:58:49.130
Michael Malice on the Twitter at Michael Malice.

1111
