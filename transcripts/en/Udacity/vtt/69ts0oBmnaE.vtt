00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.760
&gt;&gt; We'll be using GitHub to download the files we need for

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.880
our resume and once we're finished to host it.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; If you don't already have a GitHub account,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.340
you can find the link in the instructor's notes to get one.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.830
You'll see a few options, but don't worry,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.010
you don't need anything fancier than a free account for this class.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.580
This is where we can find all the files that we'll need for this project.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.900
Let's go ahead and take a look at them.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.100
Hey, James.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.080
What text editor do you like using?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.000
&gt;&gt; Emax.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.960
But to keep it simple, let's say, Sublime Text.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.460
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.650
In this course, we'll be using Sublime Text but

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.259
feel free to use whatever text editor you'd like.
