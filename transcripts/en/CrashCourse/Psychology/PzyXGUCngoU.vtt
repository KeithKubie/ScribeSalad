00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.960
So far in our exploration of how the mind grows,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.960
we've talked about a lot of different philosophies and models and ways of looking at things.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.160
But here's a surprisingly useful tool for understanding developmental psychology:

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.000
The Breakfast Club. This video, by the way, will contain Breakfast Club spoilers.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.700
That classic 80s movie about a band of teenagers 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.420
stuck in detention one fateful Saturday morning.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.980
Do they do Saturday detentions anymore?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.240
That was never a "thing" at my school.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.540
That was crazy, the idea that kids would come in on a weekend for detention.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.740
You got the hoodlum, the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the so-called basketcase,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.660
And at first, they're all salty and standoffish with each other.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.140
Because you know, let's face it, American high schools are sort of a breeding ground for that kind of thing.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.300
But as the day progresses, they start to open up and share things

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.180
and have a little fun by way of a dance montage.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.040
And at some point they each kind of crack, revealing something very important

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.760
 about adolescence in the process, which is -

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.140
The struggle between the need to stand out, and the need to belong.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.960
All these kids feel tremendous pressure to maintain their image in their particular group

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.440
in part because there's just some security in belonging to a group,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.700
even if that group gets picked on by another group.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.340
And so they wear the corresponding diamond earrings,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.620
combat boots, lettermans jackets, and spectacles, and act how their roles dictate.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.620
But the thing is, none of those kids are satisfied with their outward identities.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.840
Instead, they're all stuck in the classic teenage struggle,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.340
one that German psychoanalyst Erik Erikson -

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.340
yes, his name is actually Erik Erikson -

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.600
called the crisis between identity and role confusion.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.820
In other words, their newly-forming identities were at odds 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.260
with other people's expectations of what roles they should play, hence the confusion.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.720
The past couple weeks, we've been talking about childhood as 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.600
a crucial period of growth, learning, and change, and it definitely is,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.280
but anyone who's ever seen a John Hughes movie knows 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.780
that there's way more to growing up than just that.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780
And I got some news for you -

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.620
from adolescence into adulthood and into old age,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.000
the drama of your personal psychological development never ceases.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.580
Never! So get used to it.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:06.100
[INTRO]

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.020
Today, most psychologists view our psychological development as a lifelong process

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.240
from infant, to adolescent, to adult,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.080
 to card-carrying senior citizen, people keep right on changing.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.020
Just as Piaget gave us a helpful framework for thinking about early development,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.900
other scholars have given us ideas about how we develop 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.180
through the rest of our lives, particularly Erik Erikson.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.120
Like many others, Erikson believed our personalities develop in a predetermined order,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.200
which he outlined in an eight-stage model.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.280
And each stage, from infancy to old age, is defined by

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.380
its own predominant issue or crisis.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.440
If it freaks you out to think that you will always be dealing with a crisis 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.280
at every stage of your life, we can just call them "issues."

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.660
Since we already talked a lot about early childhood development,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.060
I'm gonna skip ahead to the teenage meat of it.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.740
But you can consult this table to learn about the rest.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.460
Erikson defined the adolescent years, or "Stage 5,"

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.400
as starting in our teens, and extending for some as far as our early twenties.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.940
And as The Breakfast Club so artfully depicted,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.460
its main crisis is the one of identity vs. role confusion.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.320
Teen years are marked by lots of physical changes

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.080
in the body and brain and sex hormones, along with growing independence, 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.580
but also a real need to belong to something.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.500
This often angsty time is when teens reexamine their identities, 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.980
figuring out how to both blend in and how to stand out,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.140
often by trying on different roles.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.320
Maybe they're experimenting with punk rock,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.680
or hockey, or theater, or ancient philosophy.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.980
Maybe sophomore year they're preppy. Junior year they've got green hair.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.300
Hopefully a person comes out of this stage with a reintegrated sense of self,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.380
but this stage can be particularly confusing as I'm sure anybody watching this video can attest to.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.880
But of course, that's not the last crisis - sorry, "issue."

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.360
Erikson believed that young adulthood, which in his view,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.600
started in a person's 20s and ended as late as the early 40s,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.440
was marked by another struggle, one between intimacy and isolation.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.960
By this stage in life, most of us have begun exploring intimate relationships,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.420
whether that's with a steady sweetheart, or just an active OkCupid profile.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.580
A good relationship here can lead to feelings of safety and caring and commitment,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.220
while a lack of intimacy can lead to loneliness and isolation and depression.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.300
Recently, a number of psychologists have begun to refer to the first few years of this stage as 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.060
emerging adulthood, and some suggest that it warrants its own classification

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.080
distinct from adolescence or full adulthood.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.820
And at least in modern western culture, many people in this stage

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.640
do feel like they're stuck in a sort of in-between time.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.480
They know that they've pulled through all that high school stuff, but they're still pretty tied to their families.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.540
In 2011, the U.S. Census found that 65% of people under 24 still live with their parents.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.360
Just a reminder of how things like economic factors can weigh on development.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.520
For Erikson, after young adulthood came the middle adulthood of our 40s to 60s.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.800
This stage, Stage 7, highlights our tendency toward either generativity or stagnation.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.320
By now, many people have established jobs or careers or perhaps families of their own.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.260
We better understand the bigger picture of life and contribute to society

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.400
 through productive, or generative, activities

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.820
like work, community involvement, raising kids, paying taxes, all that grown-up stuff.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.340
The lack of those things, an overall boredom or absence of purpose,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.560
can make Stage 7-ers feel stagnant and unproductive,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.100
hence the often cliched, but really real and potentially painful, mid-life crisis.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.640
And finally, at the end, comes Stage 8.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.780
In our late adulthood, from 65 and up, we often struggle with integrity vs. despair.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.000
Maybe you've hung out with a grandparent or some other senior and heard them contemplating 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.040
their lives and accomplishments and reminiscing about how cheap a milkshake used to be.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.520
Well, if their overall vibe is positive,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.740
they've probably developed a sense of integrity and completeness,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.100
meaning they're pretty satisfied with a life well lived.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.680
The flip side of that is looking back on life and feeling guilt and regret, and that kind of

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.240
retrospective disappointment can ruin old age with depression and feelings of hopelessness.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.040
Again, Erikson's model isn't really a perfect contemporary one,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.320
but it gave us an early idea of conflict and growth over our whole lives.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.940
His ideas have been developed further and even challenged by other scholars,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.200
but like Piaget, he remains a crucial figure to know in Western psychology.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.920
So Erikson tackled our progressive psychosocial development,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.540
but what exactly happens to our bodies and brains after we hit adulthood

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.740
and keep racking up the birthday cake candles?

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.900
It's hard to generalize these stages of adulthood because 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.880
we don't really hit yearly milestones like we did when we were kids,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.120
and adult lifestyles can vary a whole lot. I mean, in a lot of ways,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.140
70-year-old Mick Jagger's still living a younger lifestyle than a lot of 20-somethings I know.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.620
But despite all our differences, many of our life courses do have some similarities --

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.980
physically, cognitively, and socially.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.960
First, there are, yes, physical changes:

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.180
the slow decline of reaction time, muscle tone, and strength,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.580
cardiac output, sex hormone production, 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.040
and sharpness of senses like hearing and sight.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.360
For most of us, bifocals are inevitable, and perhaps hearing aids as well.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.780
None of this is to say that a jacked 50-year-old couldn't beat a lazy 20-year-old on a 100-meter dash,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.080
because, of course, how well you take care of your body counts for a lot.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.360
But still, you can't stop, let alone reverse the process of aging.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.140
The good news is our intelligence remains pretty stable throughout adulthood.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.860
Although some people might feel that their wits get a bit fuzzy with age,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.740
research suggests that while one kind of intelligence decreases after adolescence,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.660
another kind keeps increasing throughout your lifetime.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.400
Psychologists Raymond Cattell and John Horn were the first to develop the concepts of

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.040
fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting that

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.980
intelligence itself is made up of different abilities that work together.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.600
Fluid intelligence deals with your ability to solve problems 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.420
independent of your personal experience and education.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.000
It's typically associated with thinking both quickly and abstractly,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.400
like teasing out the logic of a puzzle, rather than

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.020
remembering how to find the cosine of an angle.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.300
So relatively inexperienced teens often show high fluid intelligence.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.280
The bummer is it peaks in adolescence, 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.240
then typically starts its slow decline in the 30s...

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.280
So I'm experiencing that now...

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.360
Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is just what it sounds like:

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.420
knowledge that's based on facts, solidified by past experiences and prior learning.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.420
This type of experiential intelligence gets stronger with age,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.280
as we continue to take in new knowledge and understanding,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.180
and it's part of why grandmas are so good at crossword puzzles!

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.380
Both fluid and crystallized intelligence are equally important on any given day,

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.040
and ideally, they work together to get the job of thinking done.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.720
So in the end, some of our thinking gets rusty with age, but some of it keeps getting better.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.900
Of course, there are exceptions.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.940
While most people who live into their 90s are still pretty sharp, 

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.660
some will experience a substantial loss of brain cells and suffer serious consequences.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.560
Brain tumors, small strokes, or continued alcohol dependence 

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.900
can all progressively damage the brain, increasing the risk of dementia.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.640
Dementia isn't a specific disease, but rather a set of symptoms related to 

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.460
impaired thinking, memory loss, confusion, and potential changes in personality

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.580
that become severe enough to interfere with regular functioning.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.380
Alzheimer's disease is a form of progressive, irreversible dementia.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.760
First, memory declines, then reasoning, and then eventually basic physiological functions

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.420
as vital brain neurons continue to deteriorate.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.880
It strikes about 3% of the world's population before age 75,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.480
although from there, the rate roughly doubles every five years.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.560
But again, not all dementia is related to Alzheimer's disease, nor is it as extreme.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.680
And while the risk of dementia certainly increases in older adults,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.580
it's important to remember that it is not part of normal, healthy aging.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.500
Some memory changes are normal, but most memories should remain intact.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.240
In the end, we still have a lot to learn about the aging process.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.720
As our lifespans continue to get longer, we might need to

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.720
 tweak what we think we know about its effects on human psychology.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.980
In some ways, you might say that this is psychology's next frontier.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.900
By the time we figure out what that looks like, the cast of The Breakfast Club might just be 

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.760
 ready for a reunion... and they'd better make a movie about it.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.260
Today, your developing brain learned about 

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:33.120
Erikson's eight stages of progressive psychosocial development and their accompanying issues.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.180
You also learned about emerging adulthood,

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.860
the differences between fluid and crystalline intelligence,

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.980
and some facts about dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.300
