I thought we could start by maybe going

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
I thought we could start by maybe going
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.260
I thought we could start by maybe going
through a little bit of the history of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
through a little bit of the history of
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.170
through a little bit of the history of
how the navigation drawer emerged as a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
how the navigation drawer emerged as a
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.920
how the navigation drawer emerged as a
pattern and kind of going back I think

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
pattern and kind of going back I think
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.510
pattern and kind of going back I think
kind of the first app that a lot of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
kind of the first app that a lot of
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640
kind of the first app that a lot of
people experienced the navigation drawer

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
people experienced the navigation drawer
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380
people experienced the navigation drawer
and on Android and certainly the first

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
and on Android and certainly the first
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.630

Google app they would have seen it in it

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
Google app they would have seen it in it
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120
Google app they would have seen it in it
was YouTube now that drawer that we saw

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
was YouTube now that drawer that we saw
 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.760
was YouTube now that drawer that we saw
saw at that time is different in a lot

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
saw at that time is different in a lot
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.100
saw at that time is different in a lot
of key ways from the drawer pattern that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
of key ways from the drawer pattern that
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.850
of key ways from the drawer pattern that
we discussed last month at i/o but it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
we discussed last month at i/o but it
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830
we discussed last month at i/o but it
was still had a lot of the same original

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
was still had a lot of the same original
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920
was still had a lot of the same original

objectives you know to bring content to
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.740
objectives you know to bring content to
the forefront to get navigation out of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
the forefront to get navigation out of
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.960
the forefront to get navigation out of
the way and have it only use screen real

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
the way and have it only use screen real
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.399
the way and have it only use screen real
estate when the user was kind of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
estate when the user was kind of
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.420
estate when the user was kind of
actively trying to change locations so

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
actively trying to change locations so
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.080
actively trying to change locations so
when we on the design team see a need

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
when we on the design team see a need
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.359
when we on the design team see a need
like that we kind of have this natural

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
like that we kind of have this natural
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940
like that we kind of have this natural
instinct to want to turn it into a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
instinct to want to turn it into a
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.889
instinct to want to turn it into a
pattern that other applications can make

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
pattern that other applications can make
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899
pattern that other applications can make
use of because we often see that that

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
use of because we often see that that
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.530
use of because we often see that that
need is not specific to a given

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540
need is not specific to a given
 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.510
need is not specific to a given
application or service but it's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
application or service but it's
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.709
application or service but it's
something that would be a benefit to a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
something that would be a benefit to a
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.230
something that would be a benefit to a
larger audience so the first step that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
larger audience so the first step that
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.800
larger audience so the first step that
we do is we look at a pattern like that

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810
we do is we look at a pattern like that
 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.690
we do is we look at a pattern like that
particularly on Android is we like to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
particularly on Android is we like to
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.090
particularly on Android is we like to
think about how that works from

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
think about how that works from
 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.930
think about how that works from
a navigation standpoint Android as you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
a navigation standpoint Android as you
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.990
a navigation standpoint Android as you
know is special in its use of both the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
know is special in its use of both the
 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.600
know is special in its use of both the
back button and an up affordance in the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610
back button and an up affordance in the
 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.900
back button and an up affordance in the
very commonly used action bar pattern

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910
very commonly used action bar pattern
 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.230
very commonly used action bar pattern
and as we are looking at the navigation

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240
and as we are looking at the navigation
 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.120
and as we are looking at the navigation
drawer there are a lot of different ways

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130
drawer there are a lot of different ways
 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.220
drawer there are a lot of different ways
we could have elected to have it behave

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
we could have elected to have it behave
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.780
we could have elected to have it behave
in terms of its interaction with those

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
in terms of its interaction with those
 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.610
in terms of its interaction with those
two controls you know could have been

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
two controls you know could have been
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.280
two controls you know could have been
that the drawer always presented itself

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290
that the drawer always presented itself
 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.230
that the drawer always presented itself
the minute you launched an application

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240
the minute you launched an application
 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.360
the minute you launched an application
and was kind of a logically a screen

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
and was kind of a logically a screen
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.300
and was kind of a logically a screen
sitting above the other screens well or

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
sitting above the other screens well or
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.770
sitting above the other screens well or
it could have been something that was

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
it could have been something that was
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.380
it could have been something that was
invoked by one of the in for dances but

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
invoked by one of the in for dances but
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.820
invoked by one of the in for dances but
not the other you know that up would

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830
not the other you know that up would
 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.640
not the other you know that up would
trigger it but not back or you could

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
trigger it but not back or you could
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.410
trigger it but not back or you could
even have other interactions with back

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
even have other interactions with back
 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.510
even have other interactions with back
we're making multiple selections or

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520
we're making multiple selections or
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.610
we're making multiple selections or
sequential selections from the drawer to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
sequential selections from the drawer to
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.880
sequential selections from the drawer to
build up a continuous back state in the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
build up a continuous back state in the
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.440
build up a continuous back state in the
end we went with kind of a pretty

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450
end we went with kind of a pretty
 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.270
end we went with kind of a pretty
straightforward model and that the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
straightforward model and that the
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.280
straightforward model and that the
drawer is invoked off the action bars up

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290
drawer is invoked off the action bars up
 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.890
drawer is invoked off the action bars up
affordance in an altered form and

affordance in an altered form and
 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.750
affordance in an altered form and
doesn't relate to the back button except

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
doesn't relate to the back button except
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.510
doesn't relate to the back button except
for closing it but we like to start with

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520
for closing it but we like to start with
 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.370
for closing it but we like to start with
these broad explorations so what you're

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380
these broad explorations so what you're
 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.140
these broad explorations so what you're
seeing on the screen here are some of

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
seeing on the screen here are some of
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.630
seeing on the screen here are some of
really the earliest wireframing work we

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640
really the earliest wireframing work we
 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.910
really the earliest wireframing work we
did around this drawer pattern in

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920
did around this drawer pattern in
 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.490
did around this drawer pattern in
defining it after we consider the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500
defining it after we consider the
 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.030
defining it after we consider the
interaction we like to look at kind of

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040
interaction we like to look at kind of
 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.210
interaction we like to look at kind of
what the the visual storytelling we're

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
what the the visual storytelling we're
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.280
what the the visual storytelling we're
going to do with these elements could be

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290
going to do with these elements could be
 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.080
going to do with these elements could be
and with the drawer we had a lot of

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090
and with the drawer we had a lot of
 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.670
and with the drawer we had a lot of
different options even just thinking

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680
different options even just thinking
 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.730
different options even just thinking
about you know what that trigger

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740
about you know what that trigger
 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.590
about you know what that trigger
mechanism would look like to let the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600
mechanism would look like to let the
 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.660
mechanism would look like to let the
user would know that there was a drawer

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670
user would know that there was a drawer
 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.210
user would know that there was a drawer
there YouTube first introduced that they

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220
there YouTube first introduced that they
 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.950
there YouTube first introduced that they
didn't have any kind of distinct graphic

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960
didn't have any kind of distinct graphic
 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.540
didn't have any kind of distinct graphic
they just relied on the existing left

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550
they just relied on the existing left
 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.150
they just relied on the existing left
arrow but we thought about well what if

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160
arrow but we thought about well what if
 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.120
arrow but we thought about well what if
we did a special icon or a glyph to

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130
we did a special icon or a glyph to
 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.980
we did a special icon or a glyph to
decorate the application icon and that

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990
decorate the application icon and that
 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.930
decorate the application icon and that
would denote there's a drawer you know

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940
would denote there's a drawer you know
 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.310
would denote there's a drawer you know
something like the three vertical lines

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320
something like the three vertical lines
 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.500
something like the three vertical lines
that we've come to affectionately know

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510
that we've come to affectionately know
 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.010
that we've come to affectionately know
as the hamburger internally here but

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020
as the hamburger internally here but
 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.300
as the hamburger internally here but
there were other options it could have

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310
there were other options it could have
 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.190
there were other options it could have
been that we used a right arrow to

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
been that we used a right arrow to
 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.300
been that we used a right arrow to
indicate this kind of something was

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310
indicate this kind of something was
 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.000
indicate this kind of something was

action bar flavors so that I could

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080
action bar flavors so that I could
 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.589
action bar flavors so that I could

dismiss a selection state again we try

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990
dismiss a selection state again we try
 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.080
dismiss a selection state again we try
to look at a range of options we always

to look at a range of options we always
 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.959
to look at a range of options we always
try to think about many contexts of use

can touch it to open it but we also put
 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.770
can touch it to open it but we also put
a lot of thought into what the gestural

this should be so we have the edge swipe

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669
this should be so we have the edge swipe
 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.559
this should be so we have the edge swipe

the navigation drawer is really you know
a new way of switching top levels inside

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870
a new way of switching top levels inside
 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.350
a new way of switching top levels inside
of your app there have been already

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360
of your app there have been already
 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.170
of your app there have been already
established patterns in Android such as

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180
established patterns in Android such as
 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.170
established patterns in Android such as
the six pack for example the spinner or

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180
the six pack for example the spinner or
 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.240
the six pack for example the spinner or
the fixed tabs that US developers are

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250
the fixed tabs that US developers are
 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.899
the fixed tabs that US developers are
probably very familiar with that serve a

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909
probably very familiar with that serve a
 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.510
probably very familiar with that serve a
similar purpose let's look at that

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520
similar purpose let's look at that
 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.510
similar purpose let's look at that
really quick basically what they do is

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520
really quick basically what they do is
 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.329
really quick basically what they do is
they allow you to switch between the top

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:13.339
they allow you to switch between the top
 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:14.980
they allow you to switch between the top
levels so if you look at a you know

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990
levels so if you look at a you know
 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.519
levels so if you look at a you know
really you know boiled-down diagram of

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:18.529
really you know boiled-down diagram of
 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:22.059
really you know boiled-down diagram of
an app the top level is basically the

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069
an app the top level is basically the
 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:24.579
an app the top level is basically the
screens that represent the different

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:24.589
screens that represent the different
 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:26.890
screens that represent the different
facets of your app and they sort of have

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900
facets of your app and they sort of have
 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.969
facets of your app and they sort of have
the function to represent the major use

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979
the function to represent the major use
 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.189
the function to represent the major use
cases of your app and sort of guide you

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199
cases of your app and sort of guide you
 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.400
cases of your app and sort of guide you
down

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410
down
 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.570
down
through the connecting screens down to

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580
through the connecting screens down to
 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.649
through the connecting screens down to
the consumption level what you can see

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659
the consumption level what you can see
 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.520
the consumption level what you can see
is that what those patterns have in

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530
is that what those patterns have in
 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.589
is that what those patterns have in
common is that they only represent

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599
common is that they only represent
 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:52.159
common is that they only represent
themselves at the top level so be it the

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169
themselves at the top level so be it the
 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.200
themselves at the top level so be it the
six-pack or be the the taps that they

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210
six-pack or be the the taps that they
 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.869
six-pack or be the the taps that they
all rely on a piece of user interface or

00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879
all rely on a piece of user interface or
 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.089
all rely on a piece of user interface or
a piece of chrome that lives in

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099
a piece of chrome that lives in
 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:03.860
a piece of chrome that lives in
particular at the top level once you

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870
particular at the top level once you
 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.070
particular at the top level once you
navigate away from that you know that

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080
navigate away from that you know that
 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.260
navigate away from that you know that
that switching opportunity goes away

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270
that switching opportunity goes away
 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.390
that switching opportunity goes away
from you and if you want to switch back

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400
from you and if you want to switch back
 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.670
from you and if you want to switch back
to a different facet you actually have

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680
to a different facet you actually have
 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.790
to a different facet you actually have
to navigate up to the top level and that

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800
to navigate up to the top level and that
 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.890
to navigate up to the top level and that
is actually one of the key differences

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900
is actually one of the key differences
 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.330
is actually one of the key differences
to the navigation drawer so if you look

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340
to the navigation drawer so if you look
 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.999
to the navigation drawer so if you look
here for example the navigation drawer

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:26.009
here for example the navigation drawer
 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.550
here for example the navigation drawer
does include all the top levels though

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560
does include all the top levels though
 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.969
does include all the top levels though
at the very minimum but it now also can

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979
at the very minimum but it now also can
 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:35.240
at the very minimum but it now also can
include screens at the lower levels

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250
include screens at the lower levels
 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.580
include screens at the lower levels
so basically we're thinking about those

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:37.590
so basically we're thinking about those
 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.240
so basically we're thinking about those
as navigation hubs basically places that

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.250
as navigation hubs basically places that
 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.170
as navigation hubs basically places that
users would want to often frequently

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180
users would want to often frequently
 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.020
users would want to often frequently
visit often or use as a jump off point

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.030
visit often or use as a jump off point
 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:56.209
visit often or use as a jump off point
to other places in the application so if

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:56.219
to other places in the application so if
 

00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:59.570
to other places in the application so if
you wanted to look at you know when to

00:07:59.570 --> 00:07:59.580
you wanted to look at you know when to
 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.850
you wanted to look at you know when to
use the navigation drawer as opposed to

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860
use the navigation drawer as opposed to
 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.219
use the navigation drawer as opposed to
the other patterns that we talked about

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:04.229
the other patterns that we talked about
 

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:08.200
the other patterns that we talked about
earlier here are some some helpful

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.210
earlier here are some some helpful
 

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.969
earlier here are some some helpful
statements or helpful guides that can

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:10.979
statements or helpful guides that can
 

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:14.480
statements or helpful guides that can
help you make this decision you know one

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:14.490
help you make this decision you know one
 

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.879
help you make this decision you know one
of those could be more than three top

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:16.889
of those could be more than three top
 

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:19.189
of those could be more than three top
levels so the navigation drawer is

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199
levels so the navigation drawer is
 

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:21.379
levels so the navigation drawer is
particularly good at you know showing

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:21.389
particularly good at you know showing
 

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:25.010
particularly good at you know showing
more content exposing more content than

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020
more content exposing more content than
 

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.559
more content exposing more content than
the other top level switching mechanisms

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:29.569
the other top level switching mechanisms
 

00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:32.740
the other top level switching mechanisms
if you have more than three top levels

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:32.750
if you have more than three top levels
 

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.930
if you have more than three top levels
navigation drawer becomes a possible

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940
navigation drawer becomes a possible
 

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.370
navigation drawer becomes a possible
choice if you have less than you know

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:39.380
choice if you have less than you know
 

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.230
choice if you have less than you know
you can also look at other top level

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.240
you can also look at other top level
 

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.390
you can also look at other top level
switching mechanisms such as taps for

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:43.400
switching mechanisms such as taps for
 

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.140
switching mechanisms such as taps for
example that are you know very good at

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.150
example that are you know very good at
 

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.240
example that are you know very good at
exposing the different facets of your

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.250
exposing the different facets of your
 

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.780
exposing the different facets of your
app you know within one view also if you

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:52.790
app you know within one view also if you
 

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.710
app you know within one view also if you
have deep navigation hierarchies the

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720
have deep navigation hierarchies the
 

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.180
have deep navigation hierarchies the
navigation drawer is a good choice and

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:58.190
navigation drawer is a good choice and
 

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.230
navigation drawer is a good choice and
here's the reason why we've seen that as

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240
here's the reason why we've seen that as
 

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.600
here's the reason why we've seen that as
you navigate away from the top level

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:04.610
you navigate away from the top level
 

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.450
you navigate away from the top level
usually in an app that uses the

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:07.460
usually in an app that uses the
 

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.800
usually in an app that uses the
traditional top level switching

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:08.810
traditional top level switching
 

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.610
traditional top level switching
mechanisms you would have to do some

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:11.620
mechanisms you would have to do some
 

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.320
mechanisms you would have to do some
considerable navigation effort to get

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:14.330
considerable navigation effort to get
 

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.210
considerable navigation effort to get
back to the top level and then switch

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:16.220
back to the top level and then switch
 

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:21.000
back to the top level and then switch
over to a different facet of um the

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.010
over to a different facet of um the
 

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.800
over to a different facet of um the
navigation drawer helps you here in that

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:23.810
navigation drawer helps you here in that
 

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.810
navigation drawer helps you here in that
it is available from anywhere in the app

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:25.820
it is available from anywhere in the app
 

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.720
it is available from anywhere in the app
and you can just through you know site

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:28.730
and you can just through you know site
 

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.060
and you can just through you know site
swiping gesture bring it on screen and

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.070
swiping gesture bring it on screen and
 

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.450
swiping gesture bring it on screen and
navigate freely to pretty much anywhere

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:34.460
navigate freely to pretty much anywhere
 

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.690
navigate freely to pretty much anywhere
in the app also if you are your

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.700
in the app also if you are your
 

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.810
in the app also if you are your
navigation hubs are at deeper levels the

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:42.820
navigation hubs are at deeper levels the
 

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.130
navigation hubs are at deeper levels the
navigation drawer is a good choice so

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:45.140
navigation drawer is a good choice so
 

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.550
navigation drawer is a good choice so
for example if you know one of your

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560
for example if you know one of your
 

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.250
for example if you know one of your
facets basically has navigation hubs at

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:51.260
facets basically has navigation hubs at
 

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.210
facets basically has navigation hubs at
different levels it makes sense to

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:54.220
different levels it makes sense to
 

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.700
different levels it makes sense to
include them in the navigation drawer in

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:57.710
include them in the navigation drawer in
 

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.760
include them in the navigation drawer in
order to jump quickly into those deeper

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:00.770
order to jump quickly into those deeper
 

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.240
order to jump quickly into those deeper
levels if you have a need for cross

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.250
levels if you have a need for cross
 

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.150
levels if you have a need for cross
navigation meaning that you want to

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160
navigation meaning that you want to
 

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.580
navigation meaning that you want to
quickly jump from one facet maybe at a

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:09.590
quickly jump from one facet maybe at a
 

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.130
quickly jump from one facet maybe at a
deeper level to another facet that also

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.140
deeper level to another facet that also
 

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.040
deeper level to another facet that also
has a deeper level navigation drawer

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.050
has a deeper level navigation drawer
 

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.590
has a deeper level navigation drawer
allows you to do that by including those

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600
allows you to do that by including those
 

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.290
allows you to do that by including those
deeper navigation targets inside of the

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:20.300
deeper navigation targets inside of the
 

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.180
deeper navigation targets inside of the
drawer since your navigation drawer has

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:25.190
drawer since your navigation drawer has
 

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:31.000
drawer since your navigation drawer has
more content the navigation drawer gives

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.010
more content the navigation drawer gives
 

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.610
more content the navigation drawer gives
you also options to structure your

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:33.620
you also options to structure your
 

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.810
you also options to structure your
content data so you can for example as

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:37.820
content data so you can for example as
 

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.240
content data so you can for example as
we can see here you can add headers

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.250
we can see here you can add headers
 

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.480
we can see here you can add headers
dividers and icons in order to you know

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:43.490
dividers and icons in order to you know
 

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.970
dividers and icons in order to you know
group certain areas of functionality

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:45.980
group certain areas of functionality
 

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.920
group certain areas of functionality
better we also introduced collapsible

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:50.930
better we also introduced collapsible
 

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:51.620
better we also introduced collapsible
items

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:51.630
items
 

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.470
items
those are another means of structuring

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480
those are another means of structuring
 

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.470
those are another means of structuring
your content by you know adding sub

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480
your content by you know adding sub
 

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.930
your content by you know adding sub
ordinate items typically content items

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:01.940
ordinate items typically content items
 

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:10.879
ordinate items typically content items
to you know top-level items maybe a

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:10.889
to you know top-level items maybe a
 

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:13.100
to you know top-level items maybe a
couple of notes to you know some

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.110
couple of notes to you know some
 

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.910
couple of notes to you know some
interaction details one other thing

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920
interaction details one other thing
 

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.569
interaction details one other thing
about the navigation drawer is that it

00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579
about the navigation drawer is that it
 

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:23.960
about the navigation drawer is that it
does not have a lot of representation on

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:23.970
does not have a lot of representation on
 

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.519
does not have a lot of representation on
the screen so if you look at an app that

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:28.529
the screen so if you look at an app that
 

00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:30.350
the screen so if you look at an app that
has a navigation drawer the defining

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360
has a navigation drawer the defining
 

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.449
has a navigation drawer the defining
characteristic is really the navigation

00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459
characteristic is really the navigation
 

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:36.530
characteristic is really the navigation
draw icon in the top left so in order

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540
draw icon in the top left so in order
 

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.889
draw icon in the top left so in order
for people to understand how navigation

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899
for people to understand how navigation
 

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.930
for people to understand how navigation
works in that particular app and that a

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940
works in that particular app and that a
 

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.220
works in that particular app and that a
navigation drawer is actually present we

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:46.230
navigation drawer is actually present we
 

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.079
navigation drawer is actually present we
wanted to make sure that you know as

00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:48.089
wanted to make sure that you know as
 

00:11:48.089 --> 00:11:50.629
wanted to make sure that you know as
people launch an application for the

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639
people launch an application for the
 

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:53.900
people launch an application for the
first time that they are sort of

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:53.910
first time that they are sort of
 

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.269
first time that they are sort of
confronted with the navigation drawer

00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279
confronted with the navigation drawer
 

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:58.490
confronted with the navigation drawer
and sort of see what options they have

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.500
and sort of see what options they have
 

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.579
and sort of see what options they have
what sort of the top level activities

00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:01.589
what sort of the top level activities
 

00:12:01.589 --> 00:12:05.150
what sort of the top level activities
are that they can take advantage on of

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160
are that they can take advantage on of
 

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.600
are that they can take advantage on of
in your app so upon first launch open

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:08.610
in your app so upon first launch open
 

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.389
in your app so upon first launch open
the navigation drawer people then can

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399
the navigation drawer people then can
 

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:13.730
the navigation drawer people then can
you know navigate freely from there in

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740
you know navigate freely from there in
 

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.009
you know navigate freely from there in
your app or just simply dismiss the

00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019
your app or just simply dismiss the
 

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:19.160
your app or just simply dismiss the
navigation drawer and get to the main

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.170
navigation drawer and get to the main
 

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.610
navigation drawer and get to the main
content that way once they're beyond

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620
content that way once they're beyond
 

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.410
content that way once they're beyond
that point once they have actually

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.420
that point once they have actually
 

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.389
that point once they have actually
opened the navigation drawer manually

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399
opened the navigation drawer manually
 

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:27.949
opened the navigation drawer manually
for the first time you know on

00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959
for the first time you know on
 

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:30.259
for the first time you know on
subsequent launches then you know don't

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:30.269
subsequent launches then you know don't
 

00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:32.300
subsequent launches then you know don't
show the navigation drawer and launch

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.310
show the navigation drawer and launch
 

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.300
show the navigation drawer and launch
anymore so in that that way you make

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:35.310
anymore so in that that way you make
 

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.519
anymore so in that that way you make
sure that people know that there is a

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:37.529
sure that people know that there is a
 

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:39.980
sure that people know that there is a
navigation drawer how to interact with

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:39.990
navigation drawer how to interact with
 

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.009
navigation drawer how to interact with
it well I have favorite things I want to

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:43.019
it well I have favorite things I want to
 

00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:45.199
it well I have favorite things I want to
point out about that was that basically

00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:45.209
point out about that was that basically
 

00:12:45.209 --> 00:12:48.019
point out about that was that basically
you know you get the ability to to tell

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:48.029
you know you get the ability to to tell
 

00:12:48.029 --> 00:12:49.999
you know you get the ability to to tell
the user about the gesture and about the

00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:50.009
the user about the gesture and about the
 

00:12:50.009 --> 00:12:52.189
the user about the gesture and about the
physical space within which the

00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:52.199
physical space within which the
 

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:54.259
physical space within which the
navigation drawer interacts right so if

00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:54.269
navigation drawer interacts right so if
 

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:56.319
navigation drawer interacts right so if
you initially show the navigation jar

00:12:56.319 --> 00:12:56.329
you initially show the navigation jar
 

00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:58.850
you initially show the navigation jar
and then you kind of you know they'd be

00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860
and then you kind of you know they'd be
 

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.650
and then you kind of you know they'd be
hided by either touching outside it's

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660
hided by either touching outside it's
 

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.960
hided by either touching outside it's
the content area or

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:01.970
the content area or
 

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.220
the content area or
touching the up affordance or anything

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:03.230
touching the up affordance or anything
 

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.860
touching the up affordance or anything
like that they basically you know the

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:05.870
like that they basically you know the
 

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.480
like that they basically you know the
navigation drawer immediately slides to

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:07.490
navigation drawer immediately slides to
 

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.819
navigation drawer immediately slides to
the left and it kind of hints that if

00:13:09.819 --> 00:13:09.829
the left and it kind of hints that if
 

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:11.530
the left and it kind of hints that if
you pull out from the left you'll

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:11.540
you pull out from the left you'll
 

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.389
you pull out from the left you'll
actually see it again so it almost hit

00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399
actually see it again so it almost hit
 

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:16.119
actually see it again so it almost hit
hints at the gestures involved with that

00:13:16.119 --> 00:13:16.129
hints at the gestures involved with that
 

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.800
hints at the gestures involved with that
kind of initial impression that you get

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:17.810
kind of initial impression that you get
 

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.290
kind of initial impression that you get
yeah in that sense it's a really

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:20.300
yeah in that sense it's a really
 

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.139
yeah in that sense it's a really
important learning step right to get you

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:23.149
important learning step right to get you
 

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:25.210
important learning step right to get you
familiar with what the app is really all

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:25.220
familiar with what the app is really all
 

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.720
familiar with what the app is really all
about and also how the navigation drawer

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:28.730
about and also how the navigation drawer
 

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.619
about and also how the navigation drawer
actually works and functions then the

00:13:32.619 --> 00:13:32.629
actually works and functions then the
 

00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:36.699
actually works and functions then the
second thing I wanted to point out is to

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:36.709
second thing I wanted to point out is to
 

00:13:36.709 --> 00:13:38.679
second thing I wanted to point out is to
give the user a peek and that is really

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:38.689
give the user a peek and that is really
 

00:13:38.689 --> 00:13:40.900
give the user a peek and that is really
to make the navigation drawer more

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:40.910
to make the navigation drawer more
 

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.499
to make the navigation drawer more
detectable and also more tangible if you

00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:44.509
detectable and also more tangible if you
 

00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:48.280
detectable and also more tangible if you
use the the library that we provide for

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:48.290
use the the library that we provide for
 

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.379
use the the library that we provide for
implementing the navigation drawer you

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:50.389
implementing the navigation drawer you
 

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:51.939
implementing the navigation drawer you
don't really need to worry about this

00:13:51.939 --> 00:13:51.949
don't really need to worry about this
 

00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:54.220
don't really need to worry about this
because that's already automatically

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:54.230
because that's already automatically
 

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.259
because that's already automatically
taken care of and you get this for free

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:56.269
taken care of and you get this for free
 

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:59.590
taken care of and you get this for free
but you know what it really does if as

00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600
but you know what it really does if as
 

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.790
but you know what it really does if as
users explore applications with their

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800
users explore applications with their
 

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.490
users explore applications with their
fingers and then maybe accidentally

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:06.500
fingers and then maybe accidentally
 

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.410
fingers and then maybe accidentally
touch on the left edge of the screen

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:08.420
touch on the left edge of the screen
 

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.840
touch on the left edge of the screen
then you know you're draw peeks in a

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:10.850
then you know you're draw peeks in a
 

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.990
then you know you're draw peeks in a
little bit and sort of gives you a good

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000
little bit and sort of gives you a good
 

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.749
little bit and sort of gives you a good
affordance of good feedback that you can

00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759
affordance of good feedback that you can
 

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:20.470
affordance of good feedback that you can
drag the navigation draw out from the

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480
drag the navigation draw out from the
 

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.929
drag the navigation draw out from the
left on to the rest of the screen

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:24.939
 
 

00:14:24.939 --> 00:14:27.639
 
finally we often get the question well

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:27.649
finally we often get the question well
 

00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:30.790
finally we often get the question well
if I use the navigation drawer should I

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800
if I use the navigation drawer should I
 

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.199
if I use the navigation drawer should I
have as a navigation drawer icon at all

00:14:34.199 --> 00:14:34.209
have as a navigation drawer icon at all
 

00:14:34.209 --> 00:14:36.490
have as a navigation drawer icon at all
levels of my app should it be

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:36.500
levels of my app should it be
 

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.579
levels of my app should it be
represented on all screens and the

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:39.589
represented on all screens and the
 

00:14:39.589 --> 00:14:41.829
represented on all screens and the
answer is really no only only those

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839
answer is really no only only those
 

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.170
answer is really no only only those
screens that are represented in the

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:44.180
screens that are represented in the
 

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.329
screens that are represented in the
navigation drawer should actually have a

00:14:46.329 --> 00:14:46.339
navigation drawer should actually have a
 

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:48.759
navigation drawer should actually have a
navigation drawer image all other

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:48.769
navigation drawer image all other
 

00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:51.730
navigation drawer image all other
screens have the traditional up caret

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:51.740
screens have the traditional up caret
 

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.619
screens have the traditional up caret
and the reason for that is really as we

00:14:56.619 --> 00:14:56.629
and the reason for that is really as we
 

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.869
and the reason for that is really as we
were developing this we sort of

00:14:58.869 --> 00:14:58.879
were developing this we sort of
 

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:01.900
were developing this we sort of
entertained the idea of having access to

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:01.910
entertained the idea of having access to
 

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.790
entertained the idea of having access to
the navigation drawer via the

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800
the navigation drawer via the
 

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.579
the navigation drawer via the
application icon throughout but it

00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:06.589
application icon throughout but it
 

00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:10.660
application icon throughout but it
really felt like it creates a separate

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:10.670
really felt like it creates a separate
 

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.330
really felt like it creates a separate
brand of

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:13.340
brand of
 

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.680
brand of
applications with a different navigation

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:15.690
applications with a different navigation
 

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.610
applications with a different navigation
model that is not consistent with other

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:18.620
model that is not consistent with other
 

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.470
model that is not consistent with other
Android applications that sort of sit

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480
Android applications that sort of sit
 

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.260
Android applications that sort of sit
both side by side with navigation drawer

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:24.270
both side by side with navigation drawer
 

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:29.390
both side by side with navigation drawer
applications so in that sense we four

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:29.400
applications so in that sense we four
 

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.140
applications so in that sense we four
screens that are not typical jump off

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:33.150
screens that are not typical jump off
 

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.100
screens that are not typical jump off
points or are not you know high value

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.110
points or are not you know high value
 

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.050
points or are not you know high value
navigation targets we keep the up

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:41.060
navigation targets we keep the up
 

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.160
navigation targets we keep the up
affordance there intact

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:45.170
affordance there intact
 

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.230
affordance there intact
so just to interject there so on those

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240
so just to interject there so on those
 

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.370
so just to interject there so on those
other screens where you have the other

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380
other screens where you have the other
 

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.770
other screens where you have the other
ones it's still accessible via this kind

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:51.780
ones it's still accessible via this kind
 

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.390
ones it's still accessible via this kind
of the bezel swipe the edge swipe right

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:53.400
of the bezel swipe the edge swipe right
 

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.130
of the bezel swipe the edge swipe right
oh yeah absolutely in that way it's kind

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:55.140
oh yeah absolutely in that way it's kind
 

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.050
oh yeah absolutely in that way it's kind
of like an accelerator like a keyboard

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.060
of like an accelerator like a keyboard
 

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.640
of like an accelerator like a keyboard
shortcut so the power users who know

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:58.650
shortcut so the power users who know
 

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.440
shortcut so the power users who know
about it like you know you have this

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:00.450
about it like you know you have this
 

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.000
about it like you know you have this
method of easily putting up the

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.010
method of easily putting up the
 

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.670
method of easily putting up the
navigation from anywhere everyone while

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680
navigation from anywhere everyone while
 

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.740
navigation from anywhere everyone while
still retaining the familiar navigation

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:06.750
still retaining the familiar navigation
 

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.270
still retaining the familiar navigation
kind of hierarchical navigation with

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:08.280
kind of hierarchical navigation with
 

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.820
kind of hierarchical navigation with
yeah right exactly it's good that you

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:10.830
yeah right exactly it's good that you
 

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.650
yeah right exactly it's good that you
mentioned that so the navigation drawer

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660
mentioned that so the navigation drawer
 

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.410
mentioned that so the navigation drawer
is accessible or should be accessible

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420
is accessible or should be accessible
 

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.280
is accessible or should be accessible
from from all levels and the navigation

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.290
from from all levels and the navigation
 

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.460
from from all levels and the navigation
drawer images is really sort of this the

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:22.470
drawer images is really sort of this the
 

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.350
drawer images is really sort of this the
short little reminder that you know the

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360
short little reminder that you know the
 

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.160
short little reminder that you know the
navigation drawer or they get at a place

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.170
navigation drawer or they get at a place
 

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.710
navigation drawer or they get at a place
where navigating away with the

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720
where navigating away with the
 

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.970
where navigating away with the
navigation drawer is a likely option

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:36.980
navigation drawer is a likely option
 

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.730
navigation drawer is a likely option
yeah it's also kind of if you have an

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740
yeah it's also kind of if you have an
 

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.250
yeah it's also kind of if you have an
application that just used the up

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:43.260
application that just used the up
 

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.130
application that just used the up
affordance at that topmost screen that

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.140

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.230
affordance at that topmost screen that
left pointing caret would go away and

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240
left pointing caret would go away and
 

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.030
left pointing caret would go away and
that was kind of an indication to the

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040
that was kind of an indication to the
 

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.590
that was kind of an indication to the
user that you are at a special place

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600
user that you are at a special place
 

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.810
user that you are at a special place
here at the kind of logical top of the

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:53.820
here at the kind of logical top of the
 

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.300
here at the kind of logical top of the
application the presence of the three

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:56.310
application the presence of the three
 

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.270
application the presence of the three
line drawer indicator does much the same

00:16:59.270 --> 00:16:59.280
line drawer indicator does much the same
 

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.590
line drawer indicator does much the same
thing now you're getting a slightly

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600
thing now you're getting a slightly
 

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.750
thing now you're getting a slightly
different look at what the action bar is

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:02.760
different look at what the action bar is
 

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.460
different look at what the action bar is
and again it's just kind of reinforcing

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:04.470
and again it's just kind of reinforcing
 

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.590
and again it's just kind of reinforcing
your you're at the home of the app

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600
your you're at the home of the app
 

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.930
your you're at the home of the app
you're at this logical place from which

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:08.940
you're at this logical place from which
 

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.890
you're at this logical place from which
you can go to lots of different

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900
you can go to lots of different
 

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.600
you can go to lots of different
destinations and you can use the drawer

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:11.610
destinations and you can use the drawer
 

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.549
destinations and you can use the drawer
to accomplish that

00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559
 
 

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:16.319
 
so now I just like to run through a few

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:16.329
so now I just like to run through a few
 

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.059
so now I just like to run through a few
examples and we can talk about some of

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:18.069
examples and we can talk about some of
 

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.069
examples and we can talk about some of
the different uses of the drawer and I

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079
the different uses of the drawer and I
 

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.120
the different uses of the drawer and I
thought I would just go through a number

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.130
thought I would just go through a number
 

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.620
thought I would just go through a number
of the Google Apps that have been

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:22.630
of the Google Apps that have been
 

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.419
of the Google Apps that have been
recently released that make use of the

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:24.429
recently released that make use of the
 

00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:28.319
recently released that make use of the
drawer and the first one is Gmail which

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:28.329
drawer and the first one is Gmail which
 

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.390
drawer and the first one is Gmail which
probably many people are well-acquainted

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400
probably many people are well-acquainted
 

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.880
probably many people are well-acquainted
with in the latest version of Gmail

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:32.890
with in the latest version of Gmail
 

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.680
with in the latest version of Gmail
we've introduced the drawer and the

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:34.690
we've introduced the drawer and the
 

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.400
we've introduced the drawer and the
drawers used kind of for two different

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:37.410
drawers used kind of for two different
 

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.770
drawers used kind of for two different
capabilities the most expected one is

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:40.780
capabilities the most expected one is
 

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.950
capabilities the most expected one is
that it's used to move between my inbox

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960
that it's used to move between my inbox
 

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.010
that it's used to move between my inbox
and other supporting labels so doing the

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.020
and other supporting labels so doing the
 

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.049
and other supporting labels so doing the
same kind of navigation that was

00:17:49.049 --> 00:17:49.059
same kind of navigation that was
 

00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:51.419
same kind of navigation that was
previously available from a spinner in

00:17:51.419 --> 00:17:51.429
previously available from a spinner in
 

00:17:51.429 --> 00:17:54.030
previously available from a spinner in
the primary action bar um it's also

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.040
the primary action bar um it's also
 

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.040
the primary action bar um it's also
accommodating the ability to switch

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:56.050
accommodating the ability to switch
 

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.710
accommodating the ability to switch
between accounts and so kind of at the

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720
between accounts and so kind of at the
 

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.630
between accounts and so kind of at the
top of the drawer you see the radio

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640
top of the drawer you see the radio
 

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.630
top of the drawer you see the radio
button for the currently active account

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640
button for the currently active account
 

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.280
button for the currently active account
and we would just kind of introduce more

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:05.290
and we would just kind of introduce more
 

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.690
and we would just kind of introduce more
and more of those if there were more

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:06.700
and more of those if there were more
 

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.260
and more of those if there were more
accounts present using the drawer as an

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:10.270
accounts present using the drawer as an
 

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.570
accounts present using the drawer as an
account switching mechanism is something

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:12.580
account switching mechanism is something
 

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.980
account switching mechanism is something
that's used by a couple of the Google

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:13.990
that's used by a couple of the Google
 

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.710
that's used by a couple of the Google
Apps and you'll notice in Google Drive

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720
Apps and you'll notice in Google Drive
 

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.350
Apps and you'll notice in Google Drive
for instance they also support this they

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360
for instance they also support this they
 

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.590
for instance they also support this they
use a spinner within the drawer in that

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600
use a spinner within the drawer in that
 

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.480
use a spinner within the drawer in that
case because the perception is that

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:24.490
case because the perception is that
 

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.460
case because the perception is that
account switching is a less frequently

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:26.470
account switching is a less frequently
 

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.430
account switching is a less frequently
required task for drive users whereas

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440
required task for drive users whereas
 

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.320
required task for drive users whereas
for Gmail we have this stronger

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:31.330
for Gmail we have this stronger
 

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.820
for Gmail we have this stronger
presumption of if you have these two

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:32.830
presumption of if you have these two
 

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.740
presumption of if you have these two
Google accounts and you're likely

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:34.750
Google accounts and you're likely
 

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.540
Google accounts and you're likely
checking mail in both of those accounts

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:36.550
checking mail in both of those accounts
 

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.370
checking mail in both of those accounts
so rather than having a two touch

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:38.380
so rather than having a two touch
 

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.470
so rather than having a two touch
operation of touch on spinner to open

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480
operation of touch on spinner to open
 

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.230
operation of touch on spinner to open
touch on account to transition we want

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240
touch on account to transition we want
 

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.840
touch on account to transition we want
to expand those account options directly

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:45.850
to expand those account options directly
 

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.400
to expand those account options directly
into the drawer so we use the radio

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:47.410
into the drawer so we use the radio
 

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.830
into the drawer so we use the radio
button approach there the drawer also

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840
button approach there the drawer also
 

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.740
button approach there the drawer also
makes use of kind of additional content

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:52.750
makes use of kind of additional content
 

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.419
makes use of kind of additional content
for the item so you're seeing counts of

00:18:54.419 --> 00:18:54.429
for the item so you're seeing counts of
 

00:18:54.429 --> 00:18:56.790
for the item so you're seeing counts of
unread items for each of the selected

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:56.800
unread items for each of the selected
 

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.030
unread items for each of the selected
labels again more kind of metadata that

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:00.040
labels again more kind of metadata that
 

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.280
labels again more kind of metadata that
helps guide a user to which destination

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.290
helps guide a user to which destination
 

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.100
helps guide a user to which destination
they may wish to go to the other thing

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.110
they may wish to go to the other thing
 

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.780
they may wish to go to the other thing
that's good to note about the way the

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:06.790
that's good to note about the way the
 

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.910
that's good to note about the way the
Gmail uses the the drawer is the way

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:08.920
Gmail uses the the drawer is the way
 

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.740
Gmail uses the the drawer is the way
that the action bar transforms when the

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:10.750
that the action bar transforms when the
 

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.890
that the action bar transforms when the
drawer is open so in its kind of natural

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:13.900
drawer is open so in its kind of natural
 

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.270
drawer is open so in its kind of natural
state when you're looking at the inbox

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280
state when you're looking at the inbox
 

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.850
state when you're looking at the inbox
you have actions for compose or for

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:17.860
you have actions for compose or for
 

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.799
you have actions for compose or for
search and those are operations that

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:19.809
search and those are operations that
 

00:19:19.809 --> 00:19:22.200
search and those are operations that
relate specifically to that account that

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.210
relate specifically to that account that
 

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:23.970
relate specifically to that account that
you have present you're going to be

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:23.980
you have present you're going to be
 

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.430
you have present you're going to be
generating a new email from that account

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440
generating a new email from that account
 

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.190
generating a new email from that account
be searching the content of that account

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200
be searching the content of that account
 

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.810
be searching the content of that account
because the drawer covers content that

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:30.820
because the drawer covers content that
 

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.850
because the drawer covers content that
could be from multiple accounts when we

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:32.860
could be from multiple accounts when we
 

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.529
could be from multiple accounts when we
open that Bo's actions are suppressed

00:19:34.529 --> 00:19:34.539
open that Bo's actions are suppressed
 

00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:36.029
open that Bo's actions are suppressed
and they just you know disappear from

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039
and they just you know disappear from
 

00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:37.889
and they just you know disappear from
the action bar we always want the

00:19:37.889 --> 00:19:37.899
the action bar we always want the
 

00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:40.080
the action bar we always want the
actions that you show with in the action

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.090
actions that you show with in the action
 

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.480
actions that you show with in the action
bar when the drawer is open to relate to

bar when the drawer is open to relate to
 

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.310
bar when the drawer is open to relate to
the entire application context so we

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320
the entire application context so we
 

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.690
the entire application context so we
just kind of removed those that have a

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:45.700
just kind of removed those that have a
 

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.470
just kind of removed those that have a
tighter focus or tighter scope so that

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480
tighter focus or tighter scope so that
 

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.230
tighter focus or tighter scope so that
one quick question I guess so here in

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240
one quick question I guess so here in
 

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.869
one quick question I guess so here in
Gmail we see the use of standard hallo

00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:54.879
Gmail we see the use of standard hallo
 

00:19:54.879 --> 00:19:57.570
Gmail we see the use of standard hallo
list headers to indicate different kind

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:57.580
list headers to indicate different kind

of segments or different sections of
 

00:19:59.259 --> 00:20:01.080
of segments or different sections of
labels and then above that you obviously

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.090
labels and then above that you obviously
 

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.869
labels and then above that you obviously
have the account types or the accounts

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:03.879
have the account types or the accounts
 

00:20:03.879 --> 00:20:05.669
have the account types or the accounts
to choose from whereas you guys also

00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679
to choose from whereas you guys also
 

00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:08.850
to choose from whereas you guys also
talked about the the option to have

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:08.860
talked about the the option to have
 

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.529
talked about the the option to have
collapsible items you talked a little

00:20:10.529 --> 00:20:10.539
collapsible items you talked a little
 

00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:12.149

in a navigation drawer right do you have

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360
in a navigation drawer right do you have

in a navigation drawer right do you have
any kind of guidelines about where where

any kind of guidelines about where where
 

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.900
any kind of guidelines about where where
you might stop yeah I mean I think the

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:45.910
you might stop yeah I mean I think the
 

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.700
you might stop yeah I mean I think the
strongest guideline is that you don't

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:47.710
strongest guideline is that you don't
 

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.330
strongest guideline is that you don't
want to kind of try to replicate all the

inside of the drawer now if you find

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:56.470
inside of the drawer now if you find
 

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.380
inside of the drawer now if you find
that you have a lot of targets but they

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:58.390
that you have a lot of targets but they
 

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.510
that you have a lot of targets but they
have a very predictable ordering to them

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520
have a very predictable ordering to them
 

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.360
have a very predictable ordering to them
so you know you may have a user who uses

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:03.370
so you know you may have a user who uses
 

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.680
so you know you may have a user who uses
you know dozens of labels in Gmail

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:06.690
you know dozens of labels in Gmail
 

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.360
you know dozens of labels in Gmail
that's still a fairly suitable usage

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.370
that's still a fairly suitable usage
 

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.370
that's still a fairly suitable usage
because again it's highly predictable

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:11.380

to express Reach is is is kind of pretty
 

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.400

tight it's really just a label and

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:20.410
tight it's really just a label and
 

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.960
tight it's really just a label and

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.790
account for other situations where you
have more content where it's dynamic

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:26.800
have more content where it's dynamic
 

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.430

where that's changing on a more regular

where that's changing on a more regular
 

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.490
where that's changing on a more regular
basis those are the kind of things that

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:32.500
basis those are the kind of things that
 

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.600
basis those are the kind of things that
I think work less well as navigation and

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:36.610
I think work less well as navigation and

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.910
and
obviously then you know your your list

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:51.920
obviously then you know your your list
 

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.310
obviously then you know your your list
of different sections in the app you

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320
of different sections in the app you
 

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.390
of different sections in the app you
know sure it gets trimmed down to

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400
know sure it gets trimmed down to
 

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.250
know sure it gets trimmed down to
something smaller and more manageable

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:57.260
something smaller and more manageable
 

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.930
something smaller and more manageable
but we're definitely even the feedback

00:23:58.930 --> 00:23:58.940
but we're definitely even the feedback
 

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.730
but we're definitely even the feedback
that maybe this is multiple apps or

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:00.740
that maybe this is multiple apps or
 

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.560
that maybe this is multiple apps or
maybe you know you should trim out some

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:02.570
maybe you know you should trim out some
 

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.880
maybe you know you should trim out some
of the functionality nothing on the on

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:06.890
of the functionality nothing on the on
 

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.900
of the functionality nothing on the on
the lower end we talked about you know

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:10.910
the lower end we talked about you know
 

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.710
the lower end we talked about you know
three top levels you know as a starting

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720
three top levels you know as a starting
 

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.620
three top levels you know as a starting
point of four top levels I should say as

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:17.630
point of four top levels I should say as
 

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.780
point of four top levels I should say as
the starting point for using the

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:21.790
the starting point for using the
 

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.390
the starting point for using the
navigation drawer you want to make sure

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:25.400
navigation drawer you want to make sure
 

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.970
navigation drawer you want to make sure
that the navigation drawer is not under

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:27.980
that the navigation drawer is not under
 

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.170
that the navigation drawer is not under
populated so if you for example imagine

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:32.180
populated so if you for example imagine
 

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.600
populated so if you for example imagine
you know navigation drawer only having

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:34.610
you know navigation drawer only having
 

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.900
you know navigation drawer only having
two items three items it feels you know

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:37.910
two items three items it feels you know
 

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.570
two items three items it feels you know
too much white space it feels you know

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:40.580
too much white space it feels you know
 

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.520
too much white space it feels you know
too under populated and there are other

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:42.530
too under populated and there are other
 

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.310
too under populated and there are other
top level switching mechanisms that you

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320
top level switching mechanisms that you
 

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.980
top level switching mechanisms that you
know could be a better choice there

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:46.990
know could be a better choice there
 

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.150
know could be a better choice there
that's actually a great lead-in to the

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:49.160
that's actually a great lead-in to the
 

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.650
that's actually a great lead-in to the
next example I want to cover which is

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:50.660
next example I want to cover which is
 

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.830
next example I want to cover which is
the the way that the Play apps make use

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840
the the way that the Play apps make use
 

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.930
the the way that the Play apps make use
of the navigation drawer so what you're

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:55.940
of the navigation drawer so what you're
 

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.370
of the navigation drawer so what you're
seeing here are the play music in the

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:57.380
seeing here are the play music in the
 

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.890
seeing here are the play music in the
Play Books app you know at the left play

00:24:59.890 --> 00:24:59.900
Play Books app you know at the left play
 

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.400
Play Books app you know at the left play
music opens up and it has you know five

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:03.410
music opens up and it has you know five
 

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.380
music opens up and it has you know five
different navigation options you know

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:05.390
different navigation options you know
 

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.630
different navigation options you know
and could add more it's scalable so I

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640
and could add more it's scalable so I
 

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.580
and could add more it's scalable so I
was kind of there more ways of consuming

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:09.590
was kind of there more ways of consuming
 

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.390
was kind of there more ways of consuming
your music we can naturally suit that in

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400
your music we can naturally suit that in
 

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.380
your music we can naturally suit that in
and that's also I think something that

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:14.390
and that's also I think something that
 

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.770
and that's also I think something that
goes into that decision not just kind of

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:17.780
goes into that decision not just kind of
 

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.750
goes into that decision not just kind of
where you are immediately enter in your

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760
where you are immediately enter in your
 

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.300
where you are immediately enter in your
app but what you see the roadmap for the

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.310
app but what you see the roadmap for the
 

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.150
app but what you see the roadmap for the
next version of the version after that

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:24.160
next version of the version after that
 

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.520
next version of the version after that
so kind of planning ahead for more

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:27.530
so kind of planning ahead for more
 

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.350
so kind of planning ahead for more
significant navigation needs might also

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360
significant navigation needs might also
 

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.630
significant navigation needs might also
be a good reason to adopt the drawer you

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640
be a good reason to adopt the drawer you
 

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.000
be a good reason to adopt the drawer you
know slightly early but in this

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.010
know slightly early but in this
 

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.960
know slightly early but in this
particular case we've got can somewhat

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:37.970
particular case we've got can somewhat
 

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.960
particular case we've got can somewhat
symmetric ordering of the options

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:40.970
symmetric ordering of the options
 

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.850
symmetric ordering of the options
between these two you know different

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:42.860
between these two you know different
 

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.290
between these two you know different
apps the different focus on different

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:44.300
apps the different focus on different
 

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.450
apps the different focus on different
types of media and they both start with

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:46.460
types of media and they both start with
 

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.880
types of media and they both start with
kind of this now oriented context either

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:48.890
kind of this now oriented context either
 

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.740
kind of this now oriented context either
listen now for music or read now for

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:50.750
listen now for music or read now for
 

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.200
listen now for music or read now for
books they then go into kind of looking

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:53.210
books they then go into kind of looking
 

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.640
books they then go into kind of looking
at the way that your library is

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:54.650
at the way that your library is
 

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.290
at the way that your library is
structured in ways you can consume it

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:56.300
structured in ways you can consume it
 

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.630
structured in ways you can consume it
music has more options in that regard

00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640
music has more options in that regard
 

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.570
music has more options in that regard
because it also supports playlists and

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:00.580
because it also supports playlists and
 

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.740
because it also supports playlists and
instant mixes but it's you know

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:03.750
instant mixes but it's you know
 

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.080
instant mixes but it's you know
still those are versions of how is the

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:06.090
still those are versions of how is the
 

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.060
still those are versions of how is the
content organized and both of these

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:08.070
content organized and both of these
 

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:10.010
content organized and both of these
navigational drawers then terminate with

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020
navigational drawers then terminate with
 

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.440
navigational drawers then terminate with
a shop option which is actually not even

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:12.450
a shop option which is actually not even
 

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.899
a shop option which is actually not even
an internal navigation it's a handoff to

00:26:14.899 --> 00:26:14.909
an internal navigation it's a handoff to
 

00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:18.470
an internal navigation it's a handoff to
the Play Store by presenting those

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480
the Play Store by presenting those
 

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.720
the Play Store by presenting those
similar structures in similar orders

applications you're helping the user

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240
applications you're helping the user
 

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.850
applications you're helping the user
build up a good mental model of what

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860
build up a good mental model of what
 

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.890
build up a good mental model of what
they expect a play app to feel like and

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:27.900
they expect a play app to feel like and
 

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.409
they expect a play app to feel like and
how they can kind of quickly learn ways

00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419
how they can kind of quickly learn ways
 

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:32.299
how they can kind of quickly learn ways
to navigate them and apply what they

00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:32.309
to navigate them and apply what they
 

00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:35.299
to navigate them and apply what they
learn in one context to another one of

00:26:35.299 --> 00:26:35.309
learn in one context to another one of
 

00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:37.789
learn in one context to another one of
the nice side effects I guess of having

00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799
the nice side effects I guess of having
 

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:40.460
the nice side effects I guess of having
shop open up the Play Store is that

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:40.470
shop open up the Play Store is that
 

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.500
shop open up the Play Store is that
actually the Play Store also uses the

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:42.510
actually the Play Store also uses the
 

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.720
actually the Play Store also uses the
kind of the branded single accent color

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:44.730
kind of the branded single accent color
 

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.390
kind of the branded single accent color
action bar like once you jump into the

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:47.400
action bar like once you jump into the
 

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.659
action bar like once you jump into the
shop for books area you actually get a

00:26:50.659 --> 00:26:50.669
shop for books area you actually get a
 

00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:53.060
shop for books area you actually get a
blue action bar with a books icon and so

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:53.070
blue action bar with a books icon and so
 

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.560
blue action bar with a books icon and so
on actually notice the play icon at the

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:54.570
on actually notice the play icon at the
 

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.649
on actually notice the play icon at the
top left but there is some kind of

00:26:56.649 --> 00:26:56.659
top left but there is some kind of
 

00:26:56.659 --> 00:26:58.970
top left but there is some kind of
persistence of state you're not jumping

00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980
persistence of state you're not jumping
 

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.919
persistence of state you're not jumping
into a completely separate experience

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:00.929
into a completely separate experience
 

00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:02.330
into a completely separate experience
that's it's still kind of part of the

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340
that's it's still kind of part of the
 

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.730
that's it's still kind of part of the
same family of products yes definitely

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:04.740
same family of products yes definitely
 

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.289
same family of products yes definitely
and then you're you're kind of back

00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299
and then you're you're kind of back
 

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:08.299
and then you're you're kind of back
navigation away has some interesting

00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:08.309
navigation away has some interesting
 

00:27:08.309 --> 00:27:09.140
navigation away has some interesting
effects there as well

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:09.150
effects there as well
 

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:13.100
effects there as well
so mm-hmm the next example I want to

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:13.110
so mm-hmm the next example I want to
 

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.549
so mm-hmm the next example I want to
look at was Google Earth and which has

00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559
look at was Google Earth and which has
 

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:18.470
look at was Google Earth and which has
some slightly non-traditional usage of

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480
some slightly non-traditional usage of
 

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.330
some slightly non-traditional usage of
the the navigation drawer but I just

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340
the the navigation drawer but I just
 

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.980
the the navigation drawer but I just
wanted to kind of talk about this a

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:21.990
wanted to kind of talk about this a
 

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.090
wanted to kind of talk about this a
little bit because I think it's it's

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100
little bit because I think it's it's
 

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.770
little bit because I think it's it's
interesting the first thing I'll point

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:24.780
interesting the first thing I'll point
 

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.580
interesting the first thing I'll point
out is that Earth doesn't use a proper

out is that Earth doesn't use a proper

would affect the action bar and even the

would affect the action bar and even the
 

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.159

Yin's you guys did a presentation at i/o

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:08.780
Yin's you guys did a presentation at i/o
 

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.070
Yin's you guys did a presentation at i/o
about structure and app design right so

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080
about structure and app design right so
 

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.620
about structure and app design right so
this is also well covered there so lots

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:14.630
this is also well covered there so lots
 

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:16.330
this is also well covered there so lots
of good resources outside of this video

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:16.340

if you're looking to employ so think we

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:18.890
if you're looking to employ so think we
 

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:21.970
if you're looking to employ so think we
have about we have a few minutes left we

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:21.980
have about we have a few minutes left we
 

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.500
have about we have a few minutes left we
should probably go through a couple of

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:23.510
should probably go through a couple of
 

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.970
should probably go through a couple of
questions I know there's some burning

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:24.980
questions I know there's some burning
 

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.650
questions I know there's some burning
hot questions from community that I

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:26.660
hot questions from community that I
 

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.870
hot questions from community that I
wanted to ask you guys we probably have

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880
wanted to ask you guys we probably have
 

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.810
wanted to ask you guys we probably have
time for like three or four and let's

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:31.820
time for like three or four and let's
 

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.460
time for like three or four and let's
let's like I start with one of the

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:33.470
let's like I start with one of the
 

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.420
let's like I start with one of the
popular ones so a lot of the community

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:37.430
popular ones so a lot of the community

sure um let me break it into two parts

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:01.820
sure um let me break it into two parts
 

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:02.950
sure um let me break it into two parts
because I think there's kind of two

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960
because I think there's kind of two
 

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.270

interesting things that we were looking

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:04.280
interesting things that we were looking
 

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.190
interesting things that we were looking
at you know pretty extensively during

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200
at you know pretty extensively during
 

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.650
at you know pretty extensively during
our exploration of this the first is the

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:08.660
our exploration of this the first is the
 

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.090
our exploration of this the first is the
question of keeping the action bar in

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:10.100
question of keeping the action bar in
 

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.730
question of keeping the action bar in
place and that was a decision we would

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:12.740
place and that was a decision we would
 

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.040
place and that was a decision we would
come to fairly quickly we thought there

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:15.050
come to fairly quickly we thought there
 

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.260
come to fairly quickly we thought there
was a lot of value to kind of even as

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:17.270
was a lot of value to kind of even as
 

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.990
was a lot of value to kind of even as
that drawer component comes in keeping a

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000
that drawer component comes in keeping a
 

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
that drawer component comes in keeping a
stable element that just really speaks

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.010
stable element that just really speaks
 

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.310
stable element that just really speaks
to the identity and the context that

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320
to the identity and the context that
 

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.320
to the identity and the context that
you're currently within within the

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:26.330
you're currently within within the
 

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.740
you're currently within within the
application it gave us the ability to

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:28.750
application it gave us the ability to
 

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.300
application it gave us the ability to
transform the action set to open up and

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:31.310
transform the action set to open up and
 

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.480
transform the action set to open up and
show actions that

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:32.490
show actions that
 

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.160
show actions that
you know maybe weren't in the immediate

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:34.170
you know maybe weren't in the immediate
 

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.890
you know maybe weren't in the immediate
context but had global relevance to the

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:36.900
context but had global relevance to the
 

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.840
context but had global relevance to the
app and could be you know convenient

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:38.850
app and could be you know convenient
 

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.760
app and could be you know convenient
accelerators for things you would want

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:40.770
accelerators for things you would want
 

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:44.900
accelerators for things you would want
to do from any context so we very early

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:44.910
to do from any context so we very early
 

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.610
to do from any context so we very early
on latched on to the idea that we'd want

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620
on latched on to the idea that we'd want
 

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.070
on latched on to the idea that we'd want
to keep the actionbar president and we

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080
to keep the actionbar president and we
 

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.750
to keep the actionbar president and we
definitely looked a lot at should we

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760
definitely looked a lot at should we
 

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.390
definitely looked a lot at should we
push the content or should we slide the

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:53.400
push the content or should we slide the
 

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.840
push the content or should we slide the
panel over I think we had a kind of a

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:56.850
panel over I think we had a kind of a
 

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.850
panel over I think we had a kind of a
gut instinct that we thought slide was

00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860
gut instinct that we thought slide was
 

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.919
gut instinct that we thought slide was
going to be interesting because of the

00:33:00.919 --> 00:33:00.929
going to be interesting because of the
 

00:33:00.929 --> 00:33:03.169
going to be interesting because of the
desire to as Yin's talked about before

00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179
desire to as Yin's talked about before
 

00:33:03.179 --> 00:33:05.690
desire to as Yin's talked about before
bringing the drawer in from kind of

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700
bringing the drawer in from kind of
 

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.120
bringing the drawer in from kind of
deeper levels of the hierarchy that even

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:08.130
deeper levels of the hierarchy that even
 

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.380
deeper levels of the hierarchy that even
when the affordance wasn't there you'd

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:09.390
when the affordance wasn't there you'd
 

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.669
when the affordance wasn't there you'd
want to be able to bring the drawer in

00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679
want to be able to bring the drawer in
 

00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:13.190
want to be able to bring the drawer in
and I felt more natural to us to think

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200
and I felt more natural to us to think
 

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.950
and I felt more natural to us to think
of it sliding over as opposed to kind of

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960
of it sliding over as opposed to kind of
 

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.560
of it sliding over as opposed to kind of
existing to the left of all these

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:18.570
existing to the left of all these
 

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.230
existing to the left of all these
different spaces of hierarchy and and

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240
different spaces of hierarchy and and
 

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.120
different spaces of hierarchy and and
kind of more thinking and more

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.130
kind of more thinking and more
 

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.930
kind of more thinking and more
experimentation with that led us to just

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:26.940
experimentation with that led us to just
 

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.490
experimentation with that led us to just
as we were playing with these different

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500
as we were playing with these different
 

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.100
as we were playing with these different
prototypes we always put a strong focus

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:31.110
prototypes we always put a strong focus
 

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.900
prototypes we always put a strong focus
on the importance of direct manipulation

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:32.910
on the importance of direct manipulation
 

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.210
on the importance of direct manipulation
to the user that we want them to feel

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:35.220
to the user that we want them to feel
 

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.040
to the user that we want them to feel
like you know when their finger goes

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.050
like you know when their finger goes
 

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.930
like you know when their finger goes
down on a device and they start moving

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940
down on a device and they start moving
 

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.490
down on a device and they start moving
in it that the content is really

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500
in it that the content is really
 

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.370
in it that the content is really
strongly anchored to that and responding

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380
strongly anchored to that and responding
 

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.690
strongly anchored to that and responding
directly if we were to do the push there

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:47.700
directly if we were to do the push there
 

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.130
directly if we were to do the push there
are some conditions where that wouldn't

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140
are some conditions where that wouldn't
 

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.080
are some conditions where that wouldn't
feel that that way so you know if it's

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.090
feel that that way so you know if it's
 

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:52.610
feel that that way so you know if it's
that I have my main screen and then

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620
that I have my main screen and then
 

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.010
that I have my main screen and then
beside it the drawer sits and it's just

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:55.020
beside it the drawer sits and it's just
 

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.230
beside it the drawer sits and it's just
kind of slightly off screen well if

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240
kind of slightly off screen well if
 

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.640
kind of slightly off screen well if
those two are really married together in

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:58.650
those two are really married together in
 

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:00.169
those two are really married together in
that way then you would expect that a

00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179
that way then you would expect that a
 

00:34:00.179 --> 00:34:02.870
that way then you would expect that a
drag a kind of a pull on that main

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880
drag a kind of a pull on that main
 

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.610
drag a kind of a pull on that main
surface would bring the drawer in

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620
surface would bring the drawer in
 

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.310
surface would bring the drawer in
naturally if we were to do that then you

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320
naturally if we were to do that then you
 

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.830
naturally if we were to do that then you
wouldn't be able to do the swipe to do

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:09.840
wouldn't be able to do the swipe to do
 

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.629
wouldn't be able to do the swipe to do
any other action within that main view

00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639
any other action within that main view
 

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.369
any other action within that main view
you couldn't use kind of a view pager

00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379
you couldn't use kind of a view pager
 

00:34:13.379 --> 00:34:16.760
you couldn't use kind of a view pager
you couldn't use swipe to dismiss you

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:16.770
you couldn't use swipe to dismiss you
 

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.200
you couldn't use swipe to dismiss you
know in the earth example you couldn't

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:18.210
know in the earth example you couldn't
 

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:22.550
know in the earth example you couldn't
even pan within the view of the the

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560
even pan within the view of the the
 

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.060
even pan within the view of the the
globe that you're seeing there yeah so

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:28.070
globe that you're seeing there yeah so
 

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.940
globe that you're seeing there yeah so
you know we didn't want to kind of set

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:31.950
you know we didn't want to kind of set
 

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:33.710
you know we didn't want to kind of set
up this relationship that didn't feel

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720
up this relationship that didn't feel
 

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.930
up this relationship that didn't feel
authentic and feel true for all these

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940
authentic and feel true for all these
 

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.780
authentic and feel true for all these
manipulations so by saying no it's an

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:38.790
manipulations so by saying no it's an
 

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.580
manipulations so by saying no it's an
edge swipe and that's pulling it and

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:40.590
edge swipe and that's pulling it and
 

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:43.159
edge swipe and that's pulling it and
it's just pulling this surface and not

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:43.169
it's just pulling this surface and not
 

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:44.799
it's just pulling this surface and not
affecting the one that you're not

00:34:44.799 --> 00:34:44.809
affecting the one that you're not
 

00:34:44.809 --> 00:34:48.109
affecting the one that you're not
we felt like that gave the most direct

00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119
we felt like that gave the most direct
 

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:50.859
we felt like that gave the most direct
feedback and just simply felt the best

00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:50.869
feedback and just simply felt the best
 

00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:55.460
feedback and just simply felt the best
to users as we experimented with it and

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:55.470
to users as we experimented with it and
 

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:58.250
to users as we experimented with it and
I also think that that it somewhere the

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260
I also think that that it somewhere the
 

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.420
I also think that that it somewhere the
heather has a more non-modal feel to it

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:01.430
heather has a more non-modal feel to it
 

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.549
heather has a more non-modal feel to it
in that you know it feels like a like a

00:35:04.549 --> 00:35:04.559
in that you know it feels like a like a
 

00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:07.010
in that you know it feels like a like a
little navigation helper that you that

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020
little navigation helper that you that
 

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.609
little navigation helper that you that
you can pull on screen that does not

00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619
you can pull on screen that does not
 

00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:14.480
you can pull on screen that does not
give you the impression that you know

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:14.490
give you the impression that you know
 

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.670
give you the impression that you know
this level that you're pushing out of

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680
this level that you're pushing out of
 

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.700
this level that you're pushing out of
the way is directly linked to the

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:19.710
the way is directly linked to the
 

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.440
the way is directly linked to the
content that you're pulling onto the

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:21.450
content that you're pulling onto the
 

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:26.170
content that you're pulling onto the

hierarchical relationship right whereas

00:35:29.539 --> 00:35:29.549
hierarchical relationship right whereas
 

00:35:29.549 --> 00:35:32.660
hierarchical relationship right whereas
if you push the content other way they

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:32.670
if you push the content other way they
 

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.329
if you push the content other way they
sort of feel like they're stuck together

00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:35.339
sort of feel like they're stuck together
 

00:35:35.339 --> 00:35:38.240
sort of feel like they're stuck together
and and one is directly subordinate to

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:38.250
and and one is directly subordinate to
 

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.809
and and one is directly subordinate to
the other and that sort of would not

00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:41.819
the other and that sort of would not
 

00:35:41.819 --> 00:35:44.390

work if you pull in something from the

pointed out earlier make sense next if

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260
pointed out earlier make sense next if
 

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.010
pointed out earlier make sense next if
you have any questions yeah I only

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020
you have any questions yeah I only
 

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.020
you have any questions yeah I only
sauced a little bit more about kind of

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:57.030
sauced a little bit more about kind of
 

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.220
sauced a little bit more about kind of
right-hand roll as you touched on it a

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:58.230
right-hand roll as you touched on it a
 

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.720
right-hand roll as you touched on it a
little bit in the end talking about

00:35:59.720 --> 00:35:59.730
little bit in the end talking about
 

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.450
little bit in the end talking about
earth and one today and but it's not

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460
earth and one today and but it's not
 

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.339
earth and one today and but it's not
saying we've particularly documented in

00:36:04.339 --> 00:36:04.349
saying we've particularly documented in
 

00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:08.089
saying we've particularly documented in
the in the design guidelines so the way

00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099
the in the design guidelines so the way
 

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:09.740
the in the design guidelines so the way
I see is we're kind of sticking to the

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:09.750
I see is we're kind of sticking to the
 

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.839
I see is we're kind of sticking to the
general arrangement with the action bar

00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:11.849
general arrangement with the action bar
 

00:36:11.849 --> 00:36:13.880
general arrangement with the action bar
so navigation is always on the left and

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:13.890
so navigation is always on the left and
 

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:15.799
so navigation is always on the left and
actions tend to be on the right hand

00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:15.809
actions tend to be on the right hand
 

00:36:15.809 --> 00:36:17.450
actions tend to be on the right hand
side so that's the way you see a

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460
side so that's the way you see a
 

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.370
side so that's the way you see a
breakdown so you could every legitimate

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380
breakdown so you could every legitimate
 

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.559
breakdown so you could every legitimate
to use left-hander and a right-hander or

00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:21.569
to use left-hander and a right-hander or
 

00:36:21.569 --> 00:36:28.010
to use left-hander and a right-hander or
one or the other yeah so definitely as

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020
one or the other yeah so definitely as
 

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.230
one or the other yeah so definitely as
we've seen in the in the example with

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240
we've seen in the in the example with
 

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.930
we've seen in the in the example with
Google Earth you know one one option

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940
Google Earth you know one one option
 

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.780
Google Earth you know one one option
could have been to you know take all the

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:35.790
could have been to you know take all the
 

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.730
could have been to you know take all the
settings content which is not directing

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:37.740
settings content which is not directing
 

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.339
settings content which is not directing
navigation content move it over to the

00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:40.349
navigation content move it over to the
 

00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:43.599
navigation content move it over to the
right but you know for me I you know

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:43.609
right but you know for me I you know
 

00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:46.099
right but you know for me I you know
sometimes break it down as you know

00:36:46.099 --> 00:36:46.109
sometimes break it down as you know
 

00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:48.230
sometimes break it down as you know
things on the right you know the actions

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240
things on the right you know the actions
 

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.589
things on the right you know the actions
or settings that usually are in the

00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599
or settings that usually are in the
 

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:55.039

00:36:55.039 --> 00:36:55.049
overflow they're contextual to the to
 

00:36:55.049 --> 00:36:57.609
overflow they're contextual to the to
the view right so if I

00:36:57.609 --> 00:36:57.619
the view right so if I
 

00:36:57.619 --> 00:36:59.890
the view right so if I
pull in something from the right invoke

00:36:59.890 --> 00:36:59.900
pull in something from the right invoke
 

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.220
pull in something from the right invoke
an action or you know two customizations

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:03.230
an action or you know two customizations
 

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:07.000
an action or you know two customizations
of a view there they're all directly

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.010
of a view there they're all directly
 

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.410
of a view there they're all directly
related to the view that I'm currently

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:08.420
related to the view that I'm currently
 

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.500
related to the view that I'm currently
looking at whereas navigation is more

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:11.510
looking at whereas navigation is more
 

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:14.980
looking at whereas navigation is more
more at a meta level it helps me to

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:14.990
more at a meta level it helps me to
 

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:17.830
more at a meta level it helps me to
reach the different destinations inside

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:17.840
reach the different destinations inside
 

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.349
reach the different destinations inside
of my app whereas the the right-hand

00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359
of my app whereas the the right-hand
 

00:37:20.359 --> 00:37:22.930
of my app whereas the the right-hand
stuff sort of manipulates the stuff that

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:22.940
stuff sort of manipulates the stuff that
 

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:28.570

I'm currently looking at cool so I had

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:28.580
I'm currently looking at cool so I had
 

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.370
I'm currently looking at cool so I had
two more questions I'll ask the first

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:30.380
two more questions I'll ask the first
 

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.730
two more questions I'll ask the first
one first I guess so Google Hangouts is

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:33.740
one first I guess so Google Hangouts is
 

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.470
one first I guess so Google Hangouts is
another application that was released

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480
another application that was released
 

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.090
another application that was released
recently and it actually uses something

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:37.100
recently and it actually uses something
 

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.790
recently and it actually uses something
that is some similar somewhat similar to

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800
that is some similar somewhat similar to
 

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.710
that is some similar somewhat similar to
the navigation drawer but it's different

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720
the navigation drawer but it's different
 

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.840
the navigation drawer but it's different
so for developers out there it's really

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:43.850
so for developers out there it's really
 

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.640
so for developers out there it's really
the difference between draw or layout

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:45.650
the difference between draw or layout
 

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:48.160
the difference between draw or layout
and sliding pane layout so can you guys

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:48.170
and sliding pane layout so can you guys
 

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:49.330
and sliding pane layout so can you guys
talk a little bit about the difference

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:49.340
talk a little bit about the difference
 

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.520
talk a little bit about the difference
between something like a navigation

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:51.530
between something like a navigation
 

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.170
between something like a navigation
drawer and something like what Google

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:53.180
drawer and something like what Google
 

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.390
drawer and something like what Google
Hangouts uses to kind of have lists on

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400
Hangouts uses to kind of have lists on
 

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.800
Hangouts uses to kind of have lists on
the list of stuff on the left and

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:56.810
the list of stuff on the left and
 

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:58.870
the list of stuff on the left and
details on all right sure sure I mean I

00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880
details on all right sure sure I mean I
 

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.300
details on all right sure sure I mean I
think the the easiest way to kind of

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:01.310
think the the easiest way to kind of
 

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:04.120
think the the easiest way to kind of
think about that difference is to kind

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:04.130
think about that difference is to kind
 

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.710
think about that difference is to kind
of take a slight step back and think

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720
of take a slight step back and think
 

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.770
of take a slight step back and think
about how what function the different

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:08.780
about how what function the different
 

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.270
about how what function the different
elements are trying to perform within

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280
elements are trying to perform within
 

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.190
elements are trying to perform within
each of those contexts so the

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200
each of those contexts so the
 

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.609
each of those contexts so the
traditional navigation drawer is in a

00:38:15.609 --> 00:38:15.619
traditional navigation drawer is in a
 

00:38:15.619 --> 00:38:17.290
traditional navigation drawer is in a
sense it's I want to get away from the

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:17.300
sense it's I want to get away from the
 

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.660
sense it's I want to get away from the
current current context and I want to go

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:19.670
current current context and I want to go
 

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.220
current current context and I want to go
somewhere else you know what's currently

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:21.230
somewhere else you know what's currently
 

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.230
somewhere else you know what's currently
here isn't interesting anymore so I want

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240
here isn't interesting anymore so I want
 

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:27.040
here isn't interesting anymore so I want
to go elsewhere for hangouts it's a

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.050
to go elsewhere for hangouts it's a
 

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.530
to go elsewhere for hangouts it's a
slightly different case and for a few

into my last question that I had so you

00:40:59.180 --> 00:40:59.190
into my last question that I had so you
 

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.550
into my last question that I had so you
know some some people some folks may

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560
know some some people some folks may

of dynamic items so for example let's

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720
of dynamic items so for example let's
 

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.690
of dynamic items so for example let's
say I have three major items like you

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700
say I have three major items like you
 

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.410
say I have three major items like you
know Explorer or like home Explorer and

know Explorer or like home Explorer and
 

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.560
know Explorer or like home Explorer and
shop right and then let's say that you

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:18.570
shop right and then let's say that you
 

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.700
shop right and then let's say that you
allow the user to favorite so

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:20.710
allow the user to favorite so
 

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.190
allow the user to favorite so
items throughout the know or maybe even

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200
items throughout the know or maybe even
 

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.170
items throughout the know or maybe even
favorite certain sections like let's say

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:25.180
favorite certain sections like let's say
 

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.089
favorite certain sections like let's say
your your sports app maybe your

00:41:27.089 --> 00:41:27.099
your your sports app maybe your
 

00:41:27.099 --> 00:41:29.280
your your sports app maybe your
favoriting certain leagues or certain

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.290
favoriting certain leagues or certain
 

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:33.150
favoriting certain leagues or certain
teams even what do you guys see as you

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160
teams even what do you guys see as you
 

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.370

know or is it is it appropriate to use

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:35.380
know or is it is it appropriate to use
 

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.370
know or is it is it appropriate to use
or to show these types of items in the

or to show these types of items in the
 

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.329
or to show these types of items in the

I think it's a it's totally appropriate

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:42.550
I think it's a it's totally appropriate
 

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.570
I think it's a it's totally appropriate
and I think those collapsible items are

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:45.580
and I think those collapsible items are
 

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:50.329
and I think those collapsible items are
a good way of structuring this content

00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339
a good way of structuring this content
 

00:41:50.339 --> 00:41:54.960
a good way of structuring this content
if you think for example about an app

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:54.970
if you think for example about an app
 

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:59.400
if you think for example about an app
like Google Drive for example where you

00:41:59.400 --> 00:41:59.410
like Google Drive for example where you
 

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.950
like Google Drive for example where you
have certain folders that you visit

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960
have certain folders that you visit
 

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.500
have certain folders that you visit
regularly you could employ something

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:04.510
regularly you could employ something
 

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:08.990
regularly you could employ something
like frequency a recency scheme or even

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000
like frequency a recency scheme or even
 

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.390
like frequency a recency scheme or even

a particular folder in order to
 

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:17.760
a particular folder in order to
represent this in the navigation drawer

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:17.770
represent this in the navigation drawer
 

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:21.000
represent this in the navigation drawer
to make it quickly accessible once I get

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:21.010
to make it quickly accessible once I get
 

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:23.910
to make it quickly accessible once I get
back to the app right so I think you

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920
back to the app right so I think you
 

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.490
back to the app right so I think you
know those those dynamic items are you

navigation drawer isn't a good fit for
 

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.510
navigation drawer isn't a good fit for
every single app out there and I want to

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520
every single app out there and I want to
 

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.849
every single app out there and I want to
talk about that a little bit I mean it's

00:43:17.849 --> 00:43:17.859
talk about that a little bit I mean it's
 

00:43:17.859 --> 00:43:19.320
talk about that a little bit I mean it's
kind of like the hot new thing right

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:19.330
kind of like the hot new thing right
 

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.359
kind of like the hot new thing right
it's so kind of lots of cool and

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:21.369
it's so kind of lots of cool and
 

00:43:21.369 --> 00:43:22.710
it's so kind of lots of cool and
interesting apps of picking up on this

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720
interesting apps of picking up on this
 

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.660
interesting apps of picking up on this
pattern and we see lots of people

running towards it just because it's
 

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:27.750
running towards it just because it's
interesting so I think it's really

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760
interesting so I think it's really
 

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.820

00:43:52.039 --> 00:43:52.049
navigation talk from Google i/o where
 

00:43:52.049 --> 00:43:55.219
navigation talk from Google i/o where
you go through and using use cases and

00:43:55.219 --> 00:43:55.229
you go through and using use cases and
 

00:43:55.229 --> 00:43:56.959
you go through and using use cases and
other modeling tools to really kind of

00:43:56.959 --> 00:43:56.969
other modeling tools to really kind of
 

00:43:56.969 --> 00:43:59.239

draw and what should you know you need

00:44:06.289 --> 00:44:06.299
draw and what should you know you need
 

00:44:06.299 --> 00:44:07.819
draw and what should you know you need
to really think about content so I

00:44:07.819 --> 00:44:07.829
to really think about content so I
 

00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:11.690
to really think about content so I
wanted to say yeah it's awesome pattern

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700
wanted to say yeah it's awesome pattern
 

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.309
wanted to say yeah it's awesome pattern
and had some really great use cases but

00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319
and had some really great use cases but
 

00:44:13.319 --> 00:44:16.489
and had some really great use cases but
it's not for everyone right yeah exactly

00:44:16.489 --> 00:44:16.499
it's not for everyone right yeah exactly
 

00:44:16.499 --> 00:44:19.309
it's not for everyone right yeah exactly
as you as you start to structure you

00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319
as you as you start to structure you
 

00:44:19.319 --> 00:44:21.109
as you as you start to structure you
have you really should spend some time

00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119
have you really should spend some time
 

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:23.479
have you really should spend some time
on deciding what your top-level

00:44:23.479 --> 00:44:23.489
on deciding what your top-level
 

00:44:23.489 --> 00:44:25.940
on deciding what your top-level
navigation scheme should be and it

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:25.950
navigation scheme should be and it
 

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:28.279
navigation scheme should be and it
really should serve the purpose of your

00:44:28.279 --> 00:44:28.289
really should serve the purpose of your
 

00:44:28.289 --> 00:44:30.920
really should serve the purpose of your
app so if you know your top-level

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:30.930
app so if you know your top-level
 

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.259
app so if you know your top-level
navigation is all about you know spur of

00:44:33.259 --> 00:44:33.269
navigation is all about you know spur of
 

00:44:33.269 --> 00:44:35.479
navigation is all about you know spur of
the moment switching you know quick

00:44:35.479 --> 00:44:35.489
the moment switching you know quick
 

00:44:35.489 --> 00:44:37.549
the moment switching you know quick
switching between different facets you

00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:37.559
switching between different facets you
 

00:44:37.559 --> 00:44:40.279
switching between different facets you
know fixed tabs are you know the best

00:44:40.279 --> 00:44:40.289
know fixed tabs are you know the best
 

00:44:40.289 --> 00:44:45.709
know fixed tabs are you know the best
way of doing that of course as you have

00:44:45.709 --> 00:44:45.719
way of doing that of course as you have
 

00:44:45.719 --> 00:44:48.109
way of doing that of course as you have
more top levels you know you're running

00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119
more top levels you know you're running
 

00:44:48.119 --> 00:44:50.839
more top levels you know you're running
out of space there then you know you

00:44:50.839 --> 00:44:50.849
out of space there then you know you
 

00:44:50.849 --> 00:44:53.180
out of space there then you know you
might have to do something different but

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:53.190
might have to do something different but
 

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.299
might have to do something different but
even in those cases you know if you

00:44:56.299 --> 00:44:56.309
even in those cases you know if you
 

00:44:56.309 --> 00:45:00.170
even in those cases you know if you
think about the Google i/o app from this

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180
think about the Google i/o app from this
 

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.099
think about the Google i/o app from this
year for example you know you can think

00:45:04.099 --> 00:45:04.109
year for example you know you can think
 

00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:07.430
year for example you know you can think
about combining certain facets into one

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440
about combining certain facets into one
 

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.239
about combining certain facets into one
view in order to you know still only

00:45:11.239 --> 00:45:11.249
view in order to you know still only
 

00:45:11.249 --> 00:45:13.969
view in order to you know still only
have three options in your fix tab so

00:45:13.969 --> 00:45:13.979
have three options in your fix tab so
 

00:45:13.979 --> 00:45:17.440
have three options in your fix tab so
for example the Google i/o abused

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:17.450
for example the Google i/o abused
 

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:21.640
for example the Google i/o abused
Explorer as one tab that included maps

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:21.650
Explorer as one tab that included maps
 

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:27.019
Explorer as one tab that included maps
and I think the different tracks for the

00:45:27.019 --> 00:45:27.029
and I think the different tracks for the
 

00:45:27.029 --> 00:45:30.259
and I think the different tracks for the
conference so here you know we sort of

00:45:30.259 --> 00:45:30.269
conference so here you know we sort of
 

00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:33.640
conference so here you know we sort of
took you know the the maps facet and the

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:33.650
took you know the the maps facet and the
 

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.789
took you know the the maps facet and the
tracks facet and we combined it into an

00:45:37.789 --> 00:45:37.799
tracks facet and we combined it into an
 

00:45:37.799 --> 00:45:39.829
tracks facet and we combined it into an
explorer facet you know and the

00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839
explorer facet you know and the
 

00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:43.259
explorer facet you know and the
switching between the facets using the

00:45:43.259 --> 00:45:43.269
switching between the facets using the
 

00:45:43.269 --> 00:45:46.489
switching between the facets using the
tap control was still super fast and

00:45:46.489 --> 00:45:46.499
tap control was still super fast and
 

00:45:46.499 --> 00:45:51.269

fun doing for the i/o talk was just
 

00:46:02.409 --> 00:46:04.559
fun doing for the i/o talk was just
taking the Google Apps and just kind of

00:46:04.559 --> 00:46:04.569
taking the Google Apps and just kind of
 

00:46:04.569 --> 00:46:06.149
taking the Google Apps and just kind of
considering well you know what if the

00:46:06.149 --> 00:46:06.159
considering well you know what if the
 

00:46:06.159 --> 00:46:07.319
considering well you know what if the
app you know and love-- used a

00:46:07.319 --> 00:46:07.329
