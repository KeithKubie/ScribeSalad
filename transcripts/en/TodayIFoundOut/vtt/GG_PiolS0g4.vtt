00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.840
When it comes to spiders, people generally
know two facts about them- that you swallow

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.930
around eight of them per year and that their
blood is bright blue.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.939
Fortunately, the former is absolutely not
true at all, the latter, on the other hand,

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.149
is mostly correct.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.680
While it’s certainly true that spiders have
blue liquid in their veins, the reality is

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.100
a bit more grounded than is sometimes depicted,
with the fluid a much more reserved shade

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.360
of blue-ish green.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.899
Also, thanks to fact that spiders are (generally)
so tiny and contain very little liquid, you’re

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.280
not going to see too much of this after smashing
one.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.390
It should also be noted that, unlike humans,
spiders have what is known as an “open circulatory

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.390
system.”

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.070
Essentially, their blood is allowed to mix
with all the interstitial fluids within their

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.070
bodies.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.339
The scientific term for this mixture is hemolymph,
which is a combination of the Greek word for

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.380
blood (Haîma) and the Latin word for water
(Lymph) and it’s defined as: “The circulating

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.140
fluid in many invertebrates that is functionally
similar to the blood and lymph of vertebrates”

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.349
So what in this mixture is causing the fluid
in the spiders to turn blue?

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:25.110
Well, as you may recall, human and indeed
all mammal blood is red because of the presence

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.200
of the protein haemoglobin.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.980
The reason haemoglobin makes blood red instead
of say, green is because of the presence of

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.210
iron as an oxygen carrying pigment.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.500
(And to quickly debunk another popular blue-blood
myth: No- deoxygenated human blood does not

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.530
turn blue.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.690
It turns dark red.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:02:11.240
On a related note, the red juice you see in
red meat at the grocery store is not blood.)

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.280
Spiders and other arthropods don’t have
haemoglobin in their bodies, rather they have

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.510
a protein known as haemocyanin, which contains
copper instead of iron.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.530
However, haemocyanin isn’t bound to any
cells in the creature’s body like haemoglobin

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.500
is, instead it just grooves around their circulatory
system at its leisure.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500
When an oxygen atom binds itself to haemocyanin,
instead of turning a deep shade of red, it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.500
will instead turn a pale blue-ish green, as
copper is wont to do when it oxidises.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.380
The result in spiders is less than impressive
because their bodies contain so little hemolymph

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.920
to start with; in larger arthropods though,
this effect can be quite stunning.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.640
For example, the blood of the horseshoe crab
is a delicate shade of baby blue thanks to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.920
the presence of haemocyanin, as is the blood
of lobsters, crayfish and most mollusks like

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.290
slugs and snails.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.540
horseshoe-crab-bloodBut what’s even more
fascinating (and unique) about horseshoe crab

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.580
blood is a chemical found in the amoebocytes
of its blood.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.060
When this is exposed to a potentially dangerous
foreign bacterium, it will immediately coagulate

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.600
around the threat, rendering it harmless without
actually destroying it.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.710
This effect is near instant and the blood
can be used to detect a potential threat even

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.880
if it’s diluted as much as one part in a
trillion!

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.760
This effect is amazingly useful for detecting
bacterial contamination in things like medicines

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.600
and vaccines, or on medical equipment like
needles, pacemakers, and numerous other items

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.380
that are required to be sterile.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.320
In fact, no drug on the market today can be
certified by the FDA unless it has been tested

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.800
using this exact method (known as the Limulus
amebocyte lysate test, in homage to the species

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800
of the crab- Limulus polyphemus).

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.010
It’s by far the best way scientists are
aware of for detecting whether a batch of

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.400
medicine or vaccine has been compromised or
not.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.440
As such, the blood of these crabs is worth
a small fortune, selling for around $60,000

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.560
per gallon.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.590
If you’re wondering how this blood is harvested,
the crabs (over a half a million per year)

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.720
are carefully picked up when they visit the
shore for breeding purposes and taken in cooled

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.040
trucks to certified labs where around 30%
of their blood is drained, after which they’re

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.100
returned to the sea.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.410
The blood cells are then separated using centrifugation.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.950
Next, the isolated cells are placed in distilled
water where they will eventually burst (see

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.849
Why Salt Preserves Meat for why this happens),
releasing the valuable chemical inside.

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.970
After being purified, it is then freeze-dried
and stored to be used for testing.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.320
Approximately 85%-97% of the crabs harvested
for this purpose survive and go on their merry

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.550
way after, with the crab’s blood levels
returning to normal in under a week.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.820
Even with the relatively good survival rates,
all of this may sound harsh.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.020
But there is one type of animal besides humans
that, at the least, is glad this property

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.919
of horseshoe crab blood was discovered in
1956 by Dr. Frederik Bang- namely, the rabbit.

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.759
Before the horseshoe crab blood method (LAL)
of detecting microbial contaminants, a much

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.449
less accurate and time consuming system involving
testing on live rabbits was used.

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.960
(In this rabbit pyrogen test, the rabbits
were injected with a sample of the substance

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.439
to be tested.)

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:59.890
So to sum up, if you’re not too technical
in your definition of “blood”, spiders

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.169
do have slightly blue fluid coursing through
their bodies.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:06:20.239
Also, horseshoe crab blood may someday save
your life, if it hasn’t already.
