yeah I think I think that there really
 

00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think that there really
isn't<00:25:03.610><c> much</c><00:25:03.730><c> I</c><00:25:03.940><c> can</c><00:25:04.090><c> say</c><00:25:04.270><c> this</c><00:25:04.690><c> is</c><00:25:04.780><c> exactly</c><00:25:04.870><c> the</c>

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:05.230 align:start position:0%
isn't much I can say this is exactly the
 

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.010 align:start position:0%
isn't much I can say this is exactly the
question<00:25:05.320><c> he'll</c><00:25:05.740><c> ask</c><00:25:06.010><c> him</c><00:25:06.390><c> you</c><00:25:07.390><c> know</c><00:25:07.510><c> it's</c>

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:08.020 align:start position:0%
question he'll ask him you know it's
 

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
question he'll ask him you know it's

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:13.570 align:start position:0%
have been able to say look there's uh
 

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.409 align:start position:0%
have been able to say look there's uh
there's<00:25:14.290><c> a</c><00:25:14.380><c> speedy</c><00:25:14.650><c> trial</c><00:25:14.950><c> clock</c><00:25:15.309><c> that</c><00:25:16.150><c> has</c>

00:25:16.409 --> 00:25:16.419 align:start position:0%
there's a speedy trial clock that has
 

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:19.470 align:start position:0%
there's a speedy trial clock that has
