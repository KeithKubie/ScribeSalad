Speaker 2:          00:01:57       Lloyd of attractiveness. It's just noise coming out your mouth, son Caden Cuddy. The beginning was really interesting. I like it. But then that whole whiny part in the middle. I wasn't feeling that shit. Yo, you just got to high Joe. Is that what it was? We think so. Yeah. He can't handle his weight. Do you think that because you're too high, maybe. Maybe John Fun. Are you too high? I am not high at all. What? I know. Oh, I see what, you know what Scott corporate gigs. I'm, no, I'm not. I'm literally not. How's that possible? I'm, I think I'm immune. I think, uh, I mean to marijuana. I think so. I've never like, you know, I was in college and stuff like that. I would, I would waste it and I would see people get high off of like a hit or two and I go, I just wasted an entire bag and I'm not, I don't think I breathe in properly. Or You were just telling us about eating it. Yeah. I've only, I'm a big fan cause I'm not fan of coughing and I'm not fan of that act cause I think I'm going to die every time. So if I do on just I eat it, which is cool cause I literally, and anytime

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I do, I get lost. So lost in a music before we go any further out to say this podcast is sponsored by the fleshlight fleshlight go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link and say 15% that we have a real sponsor. We have to like really pay attention. You know what they need to do with those is actually put a battery in them for an actual light. Because in, in, especially in this, just see my loads glowing through. Yeah. But you know where that is. Even if it's hidden, you know where that is. And if your power goes out in your house, you could probably get to that quicker than a legitimate flashlight. Right. Because let's say you haven't been joy in lose. This, you know, is if it's under some books underneath the couch, you know exactly where to go to get a very good point.

Speaker 3:          00:03:40       I have no idea where any of my flashlights, but you know where that is, what that is. That's so true. That's a good point, dude. You know that actually might be a legit product. You might actually be able to sell that to them. Yeah, because they don't bring that up with the fleshlight people in emergency flashlights the back. But people worry about shooting loads and then getting battery acid on their dick. You know, like something breaks and you get battery acid just sprays out all of your balls. But there's less of a chance of getting battery acid there. Then actually thrown into some chicken meat and Vegas. You probably have a better chance of having something wrong. Go down with the random chicken and battery acid. Really? You think so? Do you think, uh, a random chick is scarier than sticking your Dick in some sort of a machine that makes light out of a battery?

Speaker 3:          00:04:21       Jesus Christ, man. Fucking laissez faire. How lackadaisical and relaxing color are you with your balls, man. You're posting in your batteries. The statistically probably there's a better chance of getting something from a random chick then to get battery acid on statistically. But that's because statistically over the years a lot of people been fucking random chicks. Not that many dudes been sticking to Dixon battery holes. Well not that we know that. We know that there must be. So yeah, there's gotta be some guy that spoke girls, you know a couple of girls. What? They've got battery acid or liver JJ from vibrators. Oh yeah. Right. Cause it's not the same thing if you ever [inaudible] you tell him the truth

Speaker 4:          00:05:01       there. There was a long time ago, there was this girl I used to date back in high school that used to have this vibrator that was like the like she stole from her mom who's mom stole it from our grant. It was the grossest vibrator ever. And it was so cheap and plastic looking. One time I was just looking at it and was like, you have the dirtiest vibrator. Cause we had like that this white powder all around the the where the battery was on the, on the side of it and opened it up and it was just a blown up, you know like those old batteries where the acid just goes everywhere. She goes, I never turn it on though and I'm like, but look at this white stuff all around it. Oh my God, that white stuff is eaten up or snap probably. I mean like how horrible these battery acid, if

Speaker 3:          00:05:38       there was a pawn star show we're dudes brought in, that would be funny. I would watch it. I would like to see, this is a vibrator I've had in my family for like three generations. My grandma had it and then they adapt to bring that expert out to test it. It'd be a tumble dildo tester and this is a good quality. This was, I've always touched

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       at battery acid by mistake. Like, you know, like you're taking an old remote control and you're like, God damn these batteries and he pulled out and you're always looking at your hands like, am I really supposed to be doing this right now? Some nice car. Some day sex toys will be like, they will be like antiques that are fascinating. Like if you find some Walras bone dildo from the fucking French Alps, it used to be in neanderthals. That some fascinating shit man to us. That's, that's really interesting. Yeah. I guarantee you like flashlights and shit someday those things are going to be like a big point of novelty when they have like, you know, three d holograms at suck your Dick when they have some, you know what I mean? I mean they're gonna have some crazy shit. It's going to be just an a new experience and artificial experience like wired into your brain or micro robots.

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       Like it's a lotion that you put in your vagina and like all these little baby microscopic robots are formed a vibrate certain ways and you could just use your iPhone to like turn up the volume of the, the vibration in my vagina jail. You know what I mean? I don't think it's going to be that complicated. Go fucking microscopic robots inside your pussy. I wouldn't trust him in there. What if they decided not to leave and you get some sort of a yeast infection or that? Yeah, they start freaking out and they get the virus and they start just slip. They won't turn on you at first. The be a friends. Everything we perfect. Yeah. Then that's when he turn on me and we just want to get better ways to get off. You don't have to stick robots in your posts. That's just me though, man.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       I'm old school. I'm simple when it comes to shit. If you hear my voice you like, Damn Joe, you saw I've got a cold. I still do have a fucking cold. This is so disappointing. I've had a cold for over a week now. This is a longest, longest cold I've had in years. Man. Me and John are about to get this cold. So what is, what is the forecast for you when you get this cold? Gets is going to come about like next Thursday you're going to start getting sniffles. I mean, is that going to be okay for you by next Thursday? Yeah. That's cause that takes vitamin C and sleep and you'll be fine. That'd be good. It'd be on stage in New York going.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       Where are you in New York? Uh, Gotham when New Year's Eve. Oh, New Year's eve in Gotham. Gotham's a great club. I loved that place. I love it because of the security guys that are there. Everybody's cool. They're employees. Those guys just have a certain kind of coolness when boom, people are kind of being douchey. Former cops. Yeah. They go in, they do this move where they just put their hand on the guy's shoulder. He don't say a word and then they just walk away and then that guy doesn't get, he doesn't get mad. Like other clubs where Ian, great. Uh, shoulder move, sort of like a Spock thing. Kind of like, I'm not the only one here. Notice I'm in a suit and so are these other guys and we probably all have weapons. Wow. All in one. One little one little. That's a God damn pro. One little.

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       Yeah, that's a great club. It is. It is. I love that club. Love that quote. That's backdrop to [inaudible] club. I think just, you know, it's most of our clothes backdrop. Walking to that club stand up to the special there. Oh, did he? Yeah. Yeah I did. It's showtime special there and really interesting background. He had like mirrors in the background. You remember it like a reflection of themselves, like an eighties dance club. It, it looked like did it? Yeah. Yeah. It looked like a couple bad. Yeah, I taught, I thought it was just unusual. I didn't think it looked like a ladies dance club. So remind me of like a one night or you used to have to do where the, you know, I liked it. It's small though. I like that, that it's all intimate like that. I may be the way to go when you're filming a special, I mean everybody wants to do like a big crazy special and the theater and I've done that, but it doesn't seem, it's not the same kind of show as the the the club show.

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       The club shows a different show. Yeah, definitely both fun. They're both different. Like the laughs and the big theaters are way bigger cause there's so many people, it's just, you know when when you get on a roll and gets pretty fucking crazy. But at a theater there's, for me there's like a little bit of a disconnect because, well one you just can't see the people. It's not we're doing on purpose. You just have so many lights. You just, as you literally looking out into the dark on, well I hope I'm staring at people, but you can't tell. Yeah, it feels very strange. It feels almost like a, like sort of an artificial show feels like a fake show. You know? It's weird. It's sometimes they get going though and they feel just like a regular show. I've had giant places that feel like a regular show sometimes just because of the mood is right.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       It's like it works out or you're at a small, you know club. It's in the basement somewhere that has a hundred people in that show feels, I don't shows a crazy I did, uh, your, your, your favorite place in Michigan. Ann Arbor comedy showcase where I started. That's a great place. First place ever. We were there for the UFC and this place is like an hour away from whether UFC was but uh, mean a cigar did shows there and fuck was a great club. Perfect size. It's like 250 seats. He like a comedy club. You're in a basement. Yup. And then you can literally touch without even extending your arms. I'm off. There's something about those rooms, man. Those intimate rooms when you're onstage and it hauls connecting and everyone's having a good time and the materials just coming out smooth and everyone's laughing. It's like, man, it's like some crazy energy.

Speaker 2:          00:10:53       It's the same if you ever walk into an older house that was built a long time, you know, an older house in a neighborhood, there's an energy about it. Then you walk into somebody's house who lives in one of those prefab new subdivisions and it's a different energy. I think it's the same thing when you feel like it's been lived in dwelt in comedy club at mall where it, it doesn't have that same whatever that thing is. Yeah, that is, I mean I guess you could recreate that if you just had a real good environment, but you're right. All the new cool spots, like even new cool spots to just open up in la like, wow, what a great, cool spot. Even if it feels cool, there's something missing. Those, those older clubs like the comedy works in Denver, Denver and also in a basement and he was exonerated as a theme is it says photos punch low in Atlanta. I just tricked by photos. Maybe you're just like, oh my God. So much head shots in my head and my place has a lot history. Totally be. Stoner talk might totally be stoner. Talk. Absolutely. But you know, there's, there's people that believe there's certain like scholars that actually have proposed

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       that the concept that everything has a type of memory. You know, Rupert Sheldrake experiences, I think he's an evolutionary biologist. I think that's what he does. But he, um, had this um, concept that everything has memory, like tables and chairs. They all have some sort of memory came out to your table having memories. I'd be like, God damn, I look at that table's memories. They carry like a certain, the certain weight of their experience. Although the environment they've been around, the idea is that when you're giving off bad energy or good energy, anything that's going on, like the things around you pick it up. That's why when you go to, I mean the eye, it's totally more total hippy doc. But if you go to someone's house and they're like really cool, like their whole house feels cool, it feels like friendly, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:12:34       Did you ever go antique shopping? It's kind of creepy and it's not just like looking at regular furniture. You're going through the shit that was owned by somebody. It's probably dead. And then you get to a box of old photos of people's like wedding photos and stuff that are just, you know, there's no kids that took them, you know, so are just miscellaneous people's photos from like the 20s and stuff. I'll buy a couple and just like look at him and like draw mustaches on them and throw them away and stuff. But there are only like 25 cents. You should go there, go to an antique store, find the box of old photos. It's freaky. That's all I had to say. Wow.

Speaker 5:          00:13:04       Yeah. Old Pictures of weird man. The, the idea that they just captured some person, you know, it's like we were so connected today that just the concept of the way people lived in like the, the late 18 hundreds early 19 hundreds like that's so alien to us. Just the idea. So when you see a photo of someone from like some fucking dude who was trying to make it across the country with his kids, you know from the wild west from like 1865 and you see a photo of the dude and he like walked off, fuck, look at that guy. That guy was just, he was almost some sort of an animal, you know? I mean [inaudible] no fucking cell phone. No cable. What did he learn? Some Shit in school. What did they even know then? Did they know anything? I mean they were one step removed from thinking that people would get in a boat and fall off the face of the earth.

Speaker 5:          00:13:55       These motherfuckers that came over here, those, the settlers like Jesus. When you see a photo of them and their family, hard looking people out there in the woods and you knew eventually there probably got fucking scalped by Indians. Yeah. Like whoa. That's a crazy ass picture. Could you imagine if somehow or another you got fucking transported back in time and you had to live in the old cowboy days? No. Fuck. Only the, the, the prostitutes would be good I think. I think that would be clean. Prostitutes. Are you kidding me? You get nothing is clean. No pregnant. All regular girl smelled like dirty prostitutes back then. Yeah. I forgot about processes. Powdered wigs and be kind of cool to be disgusting. Those women must have been just rancid. It must have smelled like animals just found this. No one's shaving their legs. They're barely survive and they're eating dirt sandwiches every day. They're out there in the fucking dust taking baths. I what? They're like

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       entertainment tonight or extra wide. Like they had the gossip about random crap. They didn't know that they were missing the Internet. They didn't know that they were missing, you know, stuff because it didn't exist in their head. So they weren't, so they all had to just socially was it just my only references are like tombstone when they go to that dance. Yeah. They'd go to the billiard hall. I remember they played pool and they would like get mad at each other and shit. I remember Kevin Costner and Wyatt Earp. Yeah. But I guess you're just complain about like, boy these, these, if you've seen these new horseless carriages, they're not gonna you know, I guess you would have those guys, the haters and the, Oh I don't think the horseless carriage just came around for awhile and I was like I'm those actually going to be off on a lot of it rubbed her I lifetime and when competing at anything that I have a whole generation or three.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       Yeah. What, how many years is officially a generation? Cause I always like to think of it as lifetimes. I don't think like generations are too fucking confusing. Like you know what? How many, how many years do you fall into, you know, tactically it's 10 kids. He always invent new names for the new, is it 10? But then if I can go look my dad's, yeah, I think so. It's officially here. This is definitely officially a new generation because people will always talk to me about someone who I have no idea who the fuck they are and they act like I should know this person is, you know, like some famous singer or some famous, you know, rapper or whatever the hell it is. Yeah. I'm at that age where whatever band is on like a late night talk show. Yeah. Yeah. Used to go, oh cool. These guys. And they're like, hmm. Two don't know anybody. Yeah. I don't know anybody. It's crazy. I watch, you know, dancing with the stars. I'm like, who is this watch? Who is this guy? I watched an episode the other day. Why did I like dancing? Joe? Hi. Um, no, I don't like, but you did dance furthers that the upcoming movie movie. Yeah. You kind of got the little dancing. A flavor dance fever. Yeah, I got it yet.

Speaker 2:          00:16:45       No Man. That the rhythm catch him. The rhythm caught on that rhythm. It was hard. Dancing is difficult. It requires a lot of focus. Like, well, we had to do, I forgot what it's called, some Spanish thing, but it's like a big fucking serious like bullfighting fucking dance. It's like they throw their chest forward, arms back, and the dude who like was typing in, punch out the dude who was like teaching me how to do the mail moves was this dude. He was like this bad house dancer and I'm like, you know, this is like something really hard to do that you get like zero credit for, and they're like, dudes don't give a fuck that you're in really good dancer. You know they, they're like, part of them is like, yeah man, that's awesome man. Wow, you been incredible. Then part of them was like, why the fuck are you spending all your time doing this?

Speaker 2:          00:17:29       What are you doing? Fruitcake? Just spinning around the music that got his shit together. Yeah. It's weird that that guy learns all those dance moves in Britain. Probably hundreds of moves within a song, but then we give a lot of credit to a basketball guy who can you go over here, post out and then turn to the left? That's all. You know what I mean? Well, there's some one ones or something to fund this. I mean, I guess, look, there's something to all of it. There's something to fun dancing and then something to this as like some sort of a, a visual performing arts sort of a thing. It's definitely a different experience, but it's a lot of fucking work. I have ballroom dance one, two and three in college. It's a lot of work and the final result is not interesting to me. No, it's fine.

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       I don't care. I dated a girl who was, I get big dancing. Chuck, you're at the Brown Derby here in town. Whenever I first moved to La and she taught all these ballroom Nancy's and then we went to some club that just played normal music. Oh No. She didn't know how to dance. And she like, no, I don't know. It had to be one, two, three, four, one, two, three, one, two. Like you're banging some crazy robot broad. But yeah, but you think that because she knew 18 south of dance that you know, we get on the dance floor, you know, hearing, you know, you guys love snapping power and says I love it. We didn't talk about, we weren't talking about where we're going to have our second chance prompts. Awkward moment ever is when they see like in Vegas about five dudes hanging out together and there's no girls Nero and they're getting a couple of drinks in them and they start sort of like half dancing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       They can't like totally commit to dancing, you know, so like little go through like half the moves. Like I'm not really in the fuck of this music when it doesn't make me move that much. But you know, I'll give a little move or get with a little move here and the, you know, but they can't like dance with each other. They can only move just some minimal amount. You can't get crazy now. You can't just sit in front of each other, grow gyrating hips. This is, you're not allowed to do that to dudes. Girls can get together and dance all they want, but with dudes, you can only sort of half dance. I used to go just by myself. Yeah. Sometimes. Sometimes just to go out by yourself to clubs. Um, when I first moved to La, I did really, I would go on the dance floor by myself.

Speaker 2:          00:19:35       Oh my God. There's something wrong with your brain and you need to go to a doctor. At first it's a little bad. At first you, you're going to get the guys that are like, look at it. What's this guy doing? You kind of do, but then you get the girls that come over to you because they liked the guy who's then. We've done a lot of work. Yeah, it did look, got tea. I think it was a very gutsy, gutsy move. Not always worked. How many times does it failed on you? Oh, I don't even know. Probably more times than, but, but it just takes that one time, you know, just that one time. Some dudes can take criticism or rejection rather. Some dudes are fine with that. I have a friend, he would, he would hit on every girl that, he was an ugly guy and he was fat, but he didn't give a fuck who would swing.

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       He would swing at every pitch. I know a couple of never known that way that he's a comic. Yeah. I don't want to give them up on the air. I've owned you do mine either, but you can't go to bars with that guy because it's, it's too much too. Those are always the guys who let people know you're a comic. Like, like there's a whole bunch of comics that are that way. So they go up to the volunteer, they, hey, where's the comics had to chuck a hut and then the bomb to usually like, I don't care. It's not what you want for, or they want the girls to be impressed. It's back. It's brutal. When you with a dude will, you know, there's no way. If you go somewhere and there's a chick that he's not going to hit on her and then it's not going to get annoying and it's not going to get embarrassing.

Speaker 2:          00:20:58       Yeah, those guys are brutal. Or, you know, it's like, okay, I can't hang out with you anymore because if I hang out with you and we'd go somewhere, you look immediately. Just everything that moves the first fucking, the waitress comes over. I think she's kind of, Oh man, look at that target. And then the next thing, no, all, it's all about this fucking waitress and him getting this waitresses number. I'm like, Whoa, why can't you just have lunch fucking Weirdo. And then they don't come to your table anymore because they don't want to deal with Ya. And then, yeah, exactly. And it because it works every 30th time. They fucking just want to put in those numbers, man. Yeah. Those crazy dudes, they just want to put in those numbers. And if you're around them, you're like, oh great. It's embarrassing. Yeah, it's fucking disastrous, man. It's a shitty feeling.

Speaker 3:          00:21:41       I would, uh, gather move when I was on by myself. I would go up to girls and say, my friends left me. Can I dance by you? So I don't look like I'm dancing by myself and low. Then you dance. But here's, here's the trick, young guys. Here's the thing, you have to commit to that and you don't talk to those girls. You don't go, can I? Bebo and then, Hey, what's up ladies? Then you ignore them. OOO, okay. And then the cooler, one of the group will then kind of come over and go, you can, and then they'll let you into the circle if you're not completely hideous and embarrassing them. The key is, is not to give them attention after you do that little move. Wow. And then now you're the hurt animal in the forest. You're the bird with a broken wing. And there'd be one nurturing girl in that group that will bring you in. And yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:22:25       I just go up to him and go, Hey, I'm a producer. I like, or moves, uh, ladies, I just want you to just stop and think about how fucking gross men are. Have you heard a bang brothers? I started, I stop for a second. And think of how gross men are and how fucking, how much effort you put into creating the perfect environment where they think you're a nice guy or interesting or mysterious or cute or whatever the fuck you're doing. How much of most most guys, every day focus is just to try to get girls to log them.

Speaker 3:          00:22:56       94, 4% of the day. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:25:13       That guy was a bad mother fucker back in the day. There's certain certain dudes when the well runs dry it, they, they, they, their music is like so different. You know, like perfect examples. Billy Joel, Billy Joel is like one of the biggest turnarounds ever from like a guy who was like this young guy who had this, these really passionate lyrics and it was really interesting. Like songs that really like moved you to uptown girl. She's been living, you know, it's like in that eight. Yeah, something happens where they just hit the fucking rocks. Whether it's love, it's too much love. You know what I'm saying? Or too much hot chicks sex, you know, like they've got it all now.

Speaker 2:          00:31:21       now here's where I am. Last Christmas that was eminent. More no love ambulances, a bad motherfucker. This album is called recover a little company. It's awesome. I think it's probably one of his best. He's got such an unusual flow, you know, he's never not pumps me up. Like even if I don't, I'm like, wait, what? What'd he say? I just, it's really his right. It's like that's his shit. Yeah. You know, it's like he's got a real original way of making shit rap and rhyme or making Shit Ryan. And when he, when he hits that flow man, it's like, it's so compelling. Yeah. I tell her to do is I couldn't listen to them. Yeah. It's driving me crazy. But when m and m came on, I'm like, God damn, this dude is a master. I wonder here. And that type of music that just to meet his jazzy, you just want to start hitting stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:32:06       How many people fake UFC walking music in their bedroom? Like grown adults? Like when, when the music's playing, the kind of, you know, the kind of getting that little hopping. I do it. Do you do it? Who you pretend to walk out like you're about to walk out. That'll be a really funny scene in a movie, Dude. I have a fake walk out to a fight. Wow. Because I got to sing when I'm ironing before show where after you don't want to get toto. I put in music and then a miring and then that kicks and then before you know it, you've got something wrong with you man. Boxing around doctors, it's twice. I think you've got to go to a brain doctor. Sorry. Going to clubs by yourself. That was when I was like 20 something I didn't want to go to karaoke with.

Speaker 2:          00:32:51       And then standing in front of the mirror pretending like big John McCarthy's fucking checking your cop fucking Weirdo. I do do the Tito Ortiz hop sometimes that when you bounce light in your house by yourself, like when am I earning and when? Oh, when I get jazzed by the music you get fired up and then you're kind of in those boxer briefs. They guy. You kind of liked the fight shorts that you go through these stages where you get into martial arts training and you do it for awhile. You do a Krav Maga for a while. He did. You do to for awhile. And when, what are you doing now? Are you doing anything? Uh, I've been doing this a, I think she's an ex porn chicks. A workouts on body rock. Go to body rock.tv. I tell you it's your new thing. Shake weights. No, you have to check out this website and see how hard the workouts. Oh, I'm sure man. People goof on. You know those just step type in in a row. Clusters. Those fucking things are hardest shit, man. I've been doing it in shape girl lately. It's like these ribbons and sticks. It's an exercise thing. It really helps me out. My cash.

Speaker 2:          00:33:50       What the fuck you ever see? They get in shape, girl fro? What does it get in shape? I used to be this exercise thing for kids in the 80s with ribbons and sticks. It's kind of funny that they can have women's only gyms, but you, they'll bitch at you if you try to have a men's only Jim, you can't have like a Menzel in gym. You can have those curves and shit like that where women can't go, but you can't even even boxing gyms, women go to the boxing gym, so I think even have to have a male and female locker room or bathroom. Actually you could have a co because they do that in Hollywood. They have a coed, which is horrible because then girls have to go in there. I have to do is take giant, stinky. Yeah. I liked that sub separate. Yeah, you should have stuff separate.

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       You don't want to smell my shit hooker Joe, you should. You should bring a guy only Jim and cut instead of curves. Call it like bulges or something like all's bulges. Hairy balls. So I've been doing the body rock.tv. You have to check it out fellas. Gonna you getting paid for this? Is this a sponsoring your website? Because it is. I'll throw up in your lap 100% of that, but you should see the girl who was on there. That's what I'm trying to give you guys. More nos filled with hot chicks so you could look at them anytime you want on the Internet. You don't have to work out to them. Um, and then, then I was going through a phase where I'm like, there's a do you do to plays right across the street from me. We're at just literally it where I live.

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       Well you have to go and it's right there. And I'm like, well maybe I'll go. And then I saw um, video, some guy doing a reverse arms lock or something. I'm like, maybe I'll just do judges. So I go on phases where like I just, I don't want anybody punching me anymore. Well, the Jujitsu thing, the good thing about that is that it's, you don't have to do striking grappling enough to worry about it. You'll get hit anyway. You're always going to get hit. You're going to get headbutts. So people slammed and listen, you're accidentally, it just, things always get hit, but it's not like the thing that impressed me when I was um, doing this guid. You do too, that there's a guys in there that was like 60, 65 in probably more way more flexible than me or containing young guys on a, that's cool thing about rolling around like that is the older you get, you never have to leave it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:48       You're Jane might slow down a little bit, but very technical martial arts, very technical, like I roll a lot of times with guys who are way, way lighter than me and weaker than me, and yet they can still tap me. You know, there's, there's not too many sports like that where someone who's bigger, stronger, faster, more agile than you, and yet you could still contain them. You know? I mean, if you're playing football and even if you're like, there's no one on one football or one on one basketball, even if you're like, you know, fairly talented. If a dude is very fast and very athletic and much quicker and stronger than you, he's probably gonna fuck with you. It's probably going to fuck you up. But in Jujitsu, it's amazing what like a light person can do to a big, strong, heavy person. There's a Fred, Felicia, Felicia, oh, do you know Felicia?

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       She's, Whoa, what a John Jacques Machado is black belts. Yeah. That's where she's a great person. She's really, you know, an excellent, like legit black belt. Well, this Guy Seymore butts. You know who he is? The porn star. I used to have that TV show. I forget what it was. It was a showtime show. Oh, it's cause demos? No, it was the showtime show about him. Something about him. Anyway, uh, he wanted to film an episode where he learn Jujitsu and then rolled with the girl. So he came to Eddie's class. He learns all these moves, learns when an Armbar is law firms with a triangle is and they gave him like a couple of private lessons and then he rolls with Felicia on camera and Felicia just commences to strangle him in every way, shape or form. She wants to, she arm bars him, triangles m takes his back.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       I mean she just fuck's this dude. I had no chance. It was like just a, just a total mangling. She mangled him and I think they put very little of it if any of it on the television show. He didn't want to be embarrassed but he stopped doing it because I would say a dual, I was saying about Jujitsu or either knife fighting or let's be realistic. Cain fighting. They get, stop all that. Go to Ju Ju Jitsu, man. What did I just give you an inspirational speech about 130 pound woman strangling a male porn star to death too. If she fought him to the death, she would have won. He'd be a dead man and she'd be standing over him. I will with his fucking head in her hand. She fucking finished him. Wouldn't it be cool to take like a Chinese stars like class to become really good at it?

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       To make it like at like a boomerang where you can just go, yeah, and then someone pulls out a gun. This is Jesus Christ. Why not get good at fucking cannon bolts and no, this is what you need to get a sling and a really cause. That's how David Killed Goliath. But what if he's throwing knives? If you got really good at it, you do. When you eat a gun, it's heavy. They're sharp. Carry a gun. You couldn't beat a gun. You could. No, you didn't. He got so good he could hit the guy right in the vein in his superhero. Come on. Fuck it. Goddamn kind of looks good now you're just making up rules. Silly Dude. I think that does pull that fucking fill full of bullet holes. Show

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       you guys one day. This is the beginning of kickass three bread pan returns. What's wrong with you? Boy, that's what I want to know. What is wrong with you? Uh, it's, it's pretty smart if you think about it. I mean if it's a knife with five corners, it's like a star of night. You've got to keep them in a pouch so they don't stab, you know, you go to get them out rather obvious man purse thing on the side. Oh and a million in there. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I see what you're saying. I saw like a thought this through a belt buckle. Chinese star and like Black Belt magazine you could get, yeah. He sat down to Brian wants to be a character in a Spiderman comic book. You did not. You did not order Chinese starts as a kid. Yeah, definitely. Pretty bad ass Dorn comes you're way better.

Speaker 4:          00:39:20       They're way better. Yeah. But if you get pulled over with a gun, it's a little bit different. If you got pulled over with a bunch of trying to catch up with, yeah. You know what the difference is? You can have a license for a gun and you could buy Chinese. Chinese starts like what the fuck you and nanny shows or legal. Yeah, they're sort of are they? Yes. You can know by the Chinese stars at the mall. Samurai sword. There's some laws to those things. Shiny stars. No, there's no laws. I don't think so. Not In California. At least there wasn't in Ohio. I know there wasn't in Ohio. I haven't looked into Chinese start either way. They're going to think there's something wrong with what he can't have it in your pocket. Cause that would be a concealed weapon. Yeah. But if you have a big clear Ziploc bag, like you go to the airport, he starts, I do need you, but you're kind of a poured Ninja.

Speaker 4:          00:40:05       So yeah, you have to keep it in a Ziploc bag. You know you don't really, you didn't have all the cool Ninja stuff. You got problems kid. Both. Both of you together, make dual appointments, go to the brain doctors. You think baths are really that much worse than taking showers? Like if you were to take a bath everyday and scrub every day, do you think it's worse? I mean your showers are a hundred times better, right? Well, the problem with baskets that you're in the same goddamn water that doesn't rinse off. If you took a bath and then took a quick shower afterwards, that's the move. Right? But line in your own filth and you just, it's like t. That's what it's like. It's like butthole tea. Yeah, that's hot water. Your butthole, your balls, all that is all run your face now and you dunk your head under notes on your forehead.

Speaker 4:          00:40:50       It's all butthole and balls. Tea. That's what it is. Yep. And soap and dirt and skin. No, it's stupid. You ever meet those girls that only take baths? They didn't take their pussy butter. That's gross. I don't want to smell your feet either. You need to take God damn shower I clicker. It's 2010 almost 11 get your shit together, John. You and check. Check this out. I went to the ghetto washing machine the other day at best buy. This shows you how bad best buy's been getting lately. Lately I've been going to best buy and looking at like Kodak camp, there's this camcorder that I got off Amazon for like $175 right then and I noticed that they always have it there for $250 and I'm like, why is that such a price difference than Amazon? I went to get a washing machine yesterday, five 99 $599 I was about to pay for it, but then I read lasered the price tag thing on what does that mean?

Speaker 4:          00:41:40       Red Lasers, that application where you at scans the UPC code and shows you how do you do it? It's an application on your iPhone. What do you do? You took a photo it, yeah, well you pull it out and it opens it and point it towards the UPC symbol and it scans it and finds any local places that has this product, any online places and gives you all the information about whatever product you're scanning. So I'm about to tell this guy, I'm like, all right, I want this washing machine, 500 $599 fine, whatever. That's a good washing machine. And I scan it right at the last second and it was two 99 at Sears and free shipping. So they were like, oh, I guess we'll price match that. And they gave me free shipping and I got done the washing machine half off. Do they have to price match that?

Speaker 4:          00:42:19       They, that's one of their policies. Best buy price matches everything. And then just last week the Internet, Huh? No, no, no. It has to be a local retail around you, but they also just drop their fees. Like when best buy was notorious. Every time you bought something and then you return it, they always charge you like 10% 15% restocking fees. The other day they just stopped that. So there's no more restocking fees. They're trying to, you know, compete with Amazon and stuff. But then you see these products lately, like how the fuck are you? That's 50% more than Sears.

Speaker 2:          00:42:48       They're just hoping that nobody notices. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Well back in the day when they say we are, we'll give you the guarantee. They knew nobody was going to check. That was probably safe. But now that you have phones and you can go, okay, I'm going to pull it up right now. That's incredible. You've got to adjust that red tacting see things like that alone. Make the iPhone and even droids you can do that with two it. Yeah. I mean this is like some fucking futuristic shit, man. Getting was incredible. Yeah. You can take a photo of the, the price tag, it scans it and finds those fucking objects in local markets refuse and every, it's amazing the between that in the fucking that Shizam Shit. When you're at a restaurant and you press that thing and it picks up the song and tells you where the song has let you buy the song, let you watch it on youtube instantly.

Speaker 2:          00:43:34       Cause you young kid, you didn't know what it's like where you'd have to walk into a record place or [inaudible] place and go up to the guy. Do you guys have that one song that goes [inaudible] imagine going with that m and m song, not being able to figure out what it is going to a to a CD stone go. Do you ever when he goes [inaudible] [inaudible] or something like that or no, do it again to this guy [inaudible] I remember there was places where you could go where you can sample them. I don't know what, what was it, virgin? I think it was virgin. You would go and you'd put headphones on and they would have this specific CD knew you'd be listening to tracks. So you would always be waiting like God damn, I can't get in one of these fucking headphones. All these greedy people keep listening to every song.

Speaker 2:          00:44:18       So some people would just stand there for hours. There was sitting there for hours just listening to album after album cause they had them all up. They're available to listen to and that's how you'd find enough shit was any good. So you take, I'm thinking about taking a chance on this CD. Let me listen to do it. And you'd go up to the little station and listen to it. Yeah. Which wasn't that long ago. No, no, you're, yeah, we're, you're talking less than 10 years. Not even. Probably you talk about a fucking business has been trans. I don't know if this is a true fact, but talk about a business has been transformed. I was looking on the, uh, OMG facts on, on Twitter, and it said that 90% of all music is downloaded illegally. Yeah. That's crazy. Cause I buy every single thing that I get.

Speaker 2:          00:45:00       Yes. But you make good money. You're, you're successful. I want to know if you were hurting, I could see the justification. I mean, I could totally see it. If you're broken, you're a fan of something. I totally get it, man. I think it's a gray as fuck area. I don't think it's as simple as everyone calls it stealing. I don't think it is. I think it's ones and Zeros and it's out there. And I think that when people can support you, they will support you. And that kind of support I think is more valuable voluntary support than people who just can't fucking afford to support you financially. But they still like what you're doing. So I see it both ways. I totally see the pirates point of view and I totally see the artist's point of view. I don't think it's a cut and dry issue, man.

Speaker 2:          00:45:45       What you're doing is you're giving out information, you know, you're given out, whether it's books or movies or it's, if they enjoy it, they're going to support it. If they can, they're, they're going to support it. You know? And it'll be like an even proposition, you know, when people can support you and do support you, well then the guy spent money because he's a fan, you know, and like you gave him some legit shit and he wants to support you. And that to me is a way better exchange than he took the chance on. I didn't like it. And you've got his money anyway. I don't want that money. You know, I want the money where you know what the fuck you're getting. Right. You know what I mean? But that's not like for capitalism. It's not the best strategy, you know, unless you do, a lot of people just got to figure out new ways of working.

Speaker 2:          00:46:27       I mean that's what, you know, back in the day, that's what Dane Cook did with, I think his first album. Right. He gave, he put it on the Internet and gave it away for free. And that's why everybody in that age bracket at that time, right when mp3s came out, you had Dane cook stuff on there cause he gave us and then look, look what happened. Let's see. There's a big difference between us as comics and music. The music industry, the music industry is basically nonexistent. It's gutted. I mean they've lost so many jobs and so much money for us. See putting my stuff on like, well I'm a fucking comic. I, I'd go on stage and I talk. You know what I'm saying? It's just me. I wrote it. I sat down, I put it all together, I performed it, you know, a thousand times over the year and then boom, there it is.

Speaker 2:          00:47:09       You know, it's like there's such a big difference between that, that as a, as a piece of performance and music, whereas you've got producers, you've got all these fucking people that are involved in it. The band, you've got all the, the drummer you got the guy writes the music, got the, the guy who writes the lyrics, they all have to go together. They've got agents, they all have separate agency, all of separate managers. And then there's a fucking record producer production company that acts actually put money behind this and advertise them and build up an image for them and get them on all these television shows and there's a fucking machine behind this brand and that machine just got, it's supplied to money cut off. It's like somehow or another, there's a giant leak in their barrel. They're barrel of wealth that they had forever.

Speaker 2:          00:47:53       I mean they had, they never thought the record industry would go away. Jesus Christ, everybody's been pimping artists forever from the Elvis days, Beatles, the rolling stones, you name it. People got rich as fuck off of selling them. And now that shit has changed. It's changed radically. It's why the record industry's coming back. They're bringing back lps that you know, a best buy. I saw they have a bunch of lps now, you know, like give me record disks. Yeah. Because that's something, you know, even if you steal, you're buying something right with the music and you don't. People have a record and it's a novelty. It's a novelty to have to look at like Dee aunt word, Deann word became famous entirely through the Internet. They don't need anybody else. They don't need anybody else. Man. They have a giant loyal fan base already and growing all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:48:39       Every day when people are passing their videos around and passed her songs were on, they could fucking make their own shit. If they had a backer, they had someone to print up their, there's their shit and sell it and then it's, you know, arrange a deal with iTunes, arrange a deal with, you know, amazon.com and all those other places that sell them online. They don't need anybody. No. You could do a new business. Yeah. Especially even your comic. You could literally with some small technology record your thing. And have it up on iTunes in a day or two. I wonder what the numb the numbers on iTunes are though. I wonder like what like a really good selling, like you know CD is on iTunes. I believe they sell. I was listening to a as if it's 90% you know? Yeah. It was just in a w train was talking on a radio show and they were saying the bad thing is let's say you, you like some band and you have to buy the whole album and then that would make huge album sales.

Speaker 2:          00:49:29       But now if you only like the one song, people are just going to go get into one songs. You're not really selling a lot of good. That's because a lot of your songs are wack as fuck son. I need to get back to the drawing board, get some stronger hash before you put out your shit. Yeah man. How many times have you gotten cds in the past and where it was like, there was like a couple of jam and songs and there were some songs. It looks like they just slapped that bitch together to fill to most of them. The worst is when you, there was that one's got that one band had a great song that hit and most of the time their whole CD was just awful songs. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:50:03       the time. Uh, ice cream castles. The only album because that was at the time there were there five songs on that album and a thinking back. I'm like, I paid full money for that when I was that age and the only get five songs, there's less than 20 minutes. Brian Find Morris Day and the time. Cool. Because I'm cool dude. [inaudible] Morris Day and the time. Cool. This is one of my favorite songs. When I was a kid, I loved Morris Day. I was always sad when Morris Day just did not get the recognition I felt he deserved to me. He was mad aging personality and he's very interesting. I like the, I just holds the mirror Jerome. Yeah, Jesse.

Speaker 6:          00:50:44       Yeah. Listen to this shit. This is from, what year is this baby? I have no idea. You've got to put on my NASA space goggles for this. This is great. Welcome to the decimal. A club. Cup it up like, Hey, this isn't the right song dude. Like the intro that he doesn't say cool.

Speaker 2:          00:51:10       This is not the right song. Boys Day at a time to walk. Orion. Yeah. What's the name of the sidewall? C. O. L. E. W. J. L. B. I just wanted to get you guys warmed down. Here it is bro. Turn though. This song is one of my all time favorites. It's not. It's not. The library was. Please don't do it. Go back and do it to me. Here we go. We'll try that. No, by the shit on Itunes, man. Jesus. Boy. I'm to hate. Is that station that all the music's on now, is that Vivio or whatever? That's on youtube. Vimeo and they make you watch commercials. Here it is. Give me some volume.

Speaker 6:          00:51:50       This is probably like, what is this like an 83 or you feel like 81 81 years old to the majesty. It's got everything bro. [inaudible] everything. He's got everything. [inaudible] [inaudible] he's just bragging. That's the whole song. He's just a bad motherfucker. Don't get [inaudible] my time. Just letting me know. Driven everywhere to take me home. Dozens. Dude's got doesn't ring right here. Heaven knows it. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:53:58       the the narcissist song to get one. The greatest narcissists song perhaps ever. Although a little bit earlier we were talking about three guys sitting around on a dance floor. They couldn't really commit, but during that song we were, we were those three guys. I'll dance right in front of Bitch. I ain't here. You got the wrong guy. Brown wearing a NASA suit would fuck it. Space Goggles on. You don't think I'll dance in front of you. Which by the way, we were discussing before when people travel, they should have to wear those when I'm wearing them from no one everywhere. This was my fanny pack. That's how I'm gonna move around the airport. Right. When people know where I am, I wonder if they get, you get in trouble to think like you look like you work for the airport or something. You could just say this is a fashion statement. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:54:39       Bro. It's my travels. Not like, it's not like official government aren't wearing this on stage from now on just where Nasa Shit. We just think if you only wore that for the rest of your life, you'd never have to worry about ever finding anything else to wear it. Just that. Yeah. But I don't want to be that guy, dude. I don't want to be space. 1999 okay. Why trying to sell me down that road? John Heffrons want to wear a fucking jumpsuit. I don't want to work in an aviation plant. I don't want what you guys get though. Did you get ice cream too, bro? We're from NASA. We worked for an acid the whole time. Reason I've been asked, questioning the moon landings. I am an agent of disinformation. I'm, I'm here to make a doubter's look foolish. That's what I do. Yeah. And I just worked in human resources, but believe it or not, easier to keep me alive.

Speaker 2:          00:55:25       Try not say anything. So yeah, I get a little bit crazy when I did that wacky tobacky inside me and, and they don't want me to represent the company in a mostly sexual harassment. But yeah, for him, I, I talk about black cock and I stayed in his eyes, hey, I don't think it's sexual harassment, but for him, whatever he gets nervous happen once in space. Right. Do you think sexual harassment and space, can you imagine that if he came back and the woman goes, I would like to file a complaint. We were up there. If there was one camera that the the astronauts didn't know about and then, you know, get back to earth and everybody, they're bringing my toe room. Why do you want to explain what the fuck this is all about? They're all waitlists sucking cock fly through, spinning, rally air blowing each other.

Speaker 2:          00:56:06       I mean, have you ever had sex experiments up there? They had to off. I'm sure it was off records, but the Russians did it. The guy, they probably can't help themselves. They fuck those wild animals. They're probably up there just banging right now. That was probably a pickup move. Hey, I, this one's off the record. Bob was supposed do sexual experiment today. You know what? Honestly, now that you brought this up, I seem to remember that there was like some sort of a debate on this recently about where they were talking about people having sexual relations in the space. I'm going to have to Google that shit. I wonder if they have banked. That was an issue. They should have a birth in space. That'd be Badass. Yeah. But could, you know, dude, it would not be everywhere in with lists. Yeah, you could. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       I'd be like better than giving good for the kid. There's no way. Yeah, dude, you can't have a kid in the high altitude. You know, when we, we had to get out of, uh, the of the mountains mountains above boulder because, uh, my wife was pregnant. Imagine being a fucking space sex band aboard the International Space Station. They have banned sex. You can forget joining the 200 mile high club a cig out the Massa commander Alan Poindexter told the reporter about the concert, who asked about the consequences if astronauts boldly went where? Probably know others have been. Okay, what does that fucking Innuendo you bitch ass politician that sexual intercourse is not permitted. A board, the International Space Station, we are professionals. Poindexter said we treat each other with respect and we have a great working relationship. Personal relationships are not an issue. He explained we don't have them and we won't.

Speaker 2:          00:57:46       Hm. Well, what are you going to do when people go in a space for like six months at a time? That's the thing. If they ever decided to like Malay shares, what does it flow? Some shit to footloose guy of the space. There'll be no dancing to be no sex in dancing on this and I got base stations for you. Well, the way I look at it, that galaxy come through here. We, so we're technically not on the feet. Do Roots. If you got dudes in a spaceship and they're traveling six months to Mars, they might start bawling in each other. I got news for you. Six months is a long ass time though. Scientists might crack just a, I'd be fine with six lines. You would be the, I think we both have some friends. That would not be. It'd be like when we, all right guys, let's someone's, someone's jerking me off and just tell your story now before we go any further, there's no big deal.

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       Chokey comment. How long can you only gave? It's on earth. Both technically not on earth. Close Your eyes and you pretend you're making butter and I closed my eyes and pretend you're a girl. That you're beefing man. Like chimpanzee hand as a girls, you're catalyst fucking thick fat fingered knuckles as they pump up from my cock. What Jeb? We talked about this in the meetings. It's illegal by the way. It's illegal. That's the thing. Now, you know sex is banned aboard the International Space Station. So we answered her own question. Okay. So if you're the two people that, that, that you do have sex, then is there a third that's going to be the snitch? Probably was the land and the guy that was going to San Sacks, jealousy, some bitch locker. Poindexter this guy's name's Poindexter coincidence. I think not. Or if you did it, you did.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       That would be the biggest story ever. Yeah. If I said, well, why is, why is a second space illegals? I'm fucking Poindexter and you can't tell me what I can do in space. Sounds like Lee Lee. That's like [inaudible] is Brazilian. If we had Brazilians in space, they would just start fucking, they won't even ask. Did you ask questions? Say, well, Tao Tao the bag. We had set a precedent sphere first doing it and there's banging. Did you know astronaut's camp? Bourbon space? Astronauts cannot burp and space. And why is that? I don't know. It's a fact though. Really? Oh, it's not physically possible. No, it's not physically possible. You can be good to stay in space, Huh? That cannot be good for you when you're at zero altitude. Apparently it plays all sorts of havoc with your bones. Like your bones get real brittle and shit. They get like, you know, they get thin and you're, you lose all your muscle because you're not resisting.

Speaker 2:          01:00:08       You know, it's like, yeah, you, he come down to earth. It's like you're all fucked up man. It's like look, you've been in bed for a year, you know, man, it's pretty crazy. Like you have to like recover. It takes a long ass time to recover. Can imagine now you can't cry on space properly. So how the fuck are they ever going to have it so that people can go, I mean how, what's the longest that that a person's been in a space station is like a year. If they'd done a year up there by themselves. Who's done the longest? No, I have no idea. We should find out how would they going to me, cause like when you see like shows like Battlestar Galactica and shit and people are traveling across the galaxy like a cool, it's like a mall. It's like as you make gravity, do you make fake gravity on the, on those ship?

Speaker 2:          01:00:45       Is that possible? Can I do that? Can you make fake gravity until they make fake gravity? How the fuck that? Fuck gravity with the jets. You how are they free fall? Yeah. Or is that's fake. No gravity. Right? We need to do it backwards. Or do you adjust it like the temperature in the house so you can like go. It's, there's a little too much gravity here. There's a little too less and there's a dial just on the law that Kirk, can you just go and turn up and people float a little bit easier? Good question. I'm on space. Age does not a good question. It was a good question. Both me and Brian be like, wow, what a good question. You're, you're taking credit for something that was not that good fellow. Did you know Venus is a planet that rotates clockwise? Holy Shit. Check this dude out.

Speaker 2:          01:01:29       This guy has been up there for 748 days. Ooh, whoa. I bet he's crazy. Oh No. No cumulative time in space ever. Oh, okay. You cons? I think there's guys who can mean they dropped him off at his space station, left him up there. There's a country. Yeah, because isn't that what the space shuttle does is go up and give those guys like help them out and well, yeah, they leave him up there for a few months. That's gotta be so hard. I mean, I've been a gas stations in middle of the country where dudes I think are equally as trapped. Well they don't move around much up there either. You know, there's not like a lot of room. It's not like, you know, you're up in like a hotel room in the sky. Like, no, you're in like these fucking tubes. What happens if you go counseling or you can, you know, there's, there was one, um, there was an issue where they were talking about having a gun on board and whether or not they should have gun on a case.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       If the shoes, I should look up that too. Gun on speeding. Crazy. Youtube commentators are just astronauts that have gone crazy up in spaces being assholes because they're fucked. His video space station crew can access a gun. Yeah. Yeah. They have a gun up there, man. They have a gun up, Derek. He said what? He goes low loony k. Some dude goes like fucking event horizon and pulses eyeballs out and starts screaming Latin at you. Do you ever see that movie dad? They went into, they went through some fucking wormhole and it's like some futuristic science fiction horror movie and it's what the dude from Jurassic Park, I forget his name, but uh, it's kind of fun. It's kind of stupid fun, you know, stupid fun space, horror movie. And he uh, he goes, naughty guy with a gun. Did you see that video of that cop debt?

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       This guy was Robin, like a cvs cop comes in just to get something into standing behind them and then realizes what he's doing. If you, you know, I think it's new. No. Where's that? Is that a great deal? Here's the deal with the gun. The Russians have the gun, those mother fuckers every, this is how it goes on the spaces. Every space. Craft carriers, survival gear for crash landing and the Russian suse, s, O, y, u, Z. I don't know how to say that. Suis Suez has a kit that includes a gun. Russians leave it to the Russians. There's smart man. They're like, well, I fuck around building a gun. We have a gun than a kettle bell. You don't need it. You have it better done than to need it and not have the gun has been there for as long as the space station has been an orbit.

Speaker 2:          01:03:54       Its existence has been kept secret. NASA and Russian officials won't talk publicly about it. That's funny. You can't talk about the fact that people might go crazy because then you plant that little seed out there and then they could possibly go crazy. It's very tricky, right? Hmm. No, that's not, you know, you gotta be tricky, man. You don't want to, you want to plant the seed. You want to say everyone who's done this mission has found it invigorating. They come back and you write a book. It's foster phobia. We're really gone by the first couple of the preframe them before yourself. All the view is so spectacular. I guarantee you, you're just going to have a smile on your face all day. Don't forget to take pictures. You think you're there and then there you are on day two and you're like, oh my God, I'm stuck up here for six months.

Speaker 2:          01:04:43       Gun. What? The God closet in the cloud and he's a Chinese guy. Keeps filling with a gun. I want to kill him with these chopsticks. Shut off. I get about the gun fucking ears. There's a gun on this. Make sure that bullet only goes through him. No, and not through the Hall Mall Space. How do you shoot a gun and space? What if you blow a hole through the wall? Doesn't everything explode? I mean, aren't you going like fucking 3000 miles an hour or something crazy and what? I think when you're on an airplane can, if you should have gotten in an airplane, yes. You know what else tries me crazy about the space station. My seat up. There I go. Wouldn't you think constantly that you're

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       going to get hit by a meteor or an asteroid? I guess there's a lot of stuff up there, dude. I would be fucking freaking figure. I mean if they figured out how to avoid it, I don't think there's been an instance where anybody's gotten hurt. But if you look at the night and you see like shooting stars, those are fucking just rocks not manned by that stuff. They have one guy just on thruster, just like a video game. We're going to head comm. They don't see those things until they're awake. It's till it's way too late. And the darkness of space, you don't see things like you. You can't just look out for it, you know? And little ones, micro meteors, they're like little fucking grains of sand that will go right through metal. You know though, how do you not get it? But I don't know.

Speaker 5:          01:05:57       I don't know how they avoid that. Somehow or another, maybe they just roll the dice and hope everything's going to be okay. But if they got caught in some sort of media I'd shower and it just hit the right spot. Like, Oh man, I think could get fucked up. Hmm. And, and you don't have like force fields, no force fields. So that's not the idea of us getting wiped out by a meteor. Seems so alien. Seems impossible. It seems so stupid. Like to even bring it up is like you think you really worry that people would get wiped out by a meteor impact or an asteroid impact really. Does that really bother you that much? But then you know that it's happened like all these times throughout the history of the earth. Like why wouldn't we be thinking about that? Why the fuck did we think that we're immune to all the shit that has definitely happened before. Right. You know, we just keep going through like, hey we're going to be fine. No worry bumped meteors. Come on man. In one sense it's true. You can't live your life worrying about meteors. Cause then you waste your whole life and you're an old man on your death bed going, fuck not a single media. And then you'd die and then yet you know, and you go, God, I could've had a goddamn party if I just ignore those meteors.

Speaker 4:          01:07:02       But that's like with everything into one that focuses their time on that is ridiculous. Like, did you see that story of that lady was just driving with her whole family and like a car in front of her, like hit up pot, a pot hole that they fixed, but they didn't fix it all the way. And so when the car in front of it hits it, it made the concrete fly off and it went right through the windshield of the car behind them and just woman's face smashed, gone. And she died instantly. And it's like, that's like a meteor. You know? If you're worrying about a meteor, same thing would've happened. You'd just be dead, you know? Why would you be so concerned about meteors killing you? You know, when anything be

Speaker 5:          01:07:39       some strong logic there. Brian, you know, I liked the way you said that. Oh yeah. I mean, I'm not really worried about meteor, so I don't think anybody would be or could be. Right. You can't really, you can't even intellectualize it. That's what I'm saying. It's like the idea is so alien to us. It seems like it's fiction. It seems ridiculous, even though it's absolutely true. Yeah. We'll probably be hit by Mexico before we be hit by a meteor. I think the aliens are coming first before anything happens to come in and save us. John F John F on, do you believe in aliens? Um, I would say yes. There's got to be, we can't. I think we can't be the only once we would most likely. But do you think they've ever been here? Um, I would like to think so. I don't know. I mean, you watch all the, the pyramid stuff and then you see people try to create and you can go, okay, how was that?

Speaker 5:          01:08:30       Or yeah, but that doesn't mean that the, the most likely scenario for the pyramids is not that if you, if you go and do it, the most likely scenario, which is really fascinating, is that they were an incredibly, incredibly advanced civilization. And it's somehow or another, they fell from that high level of advancement and became, you know, rather ordinary, which is how Egypt is now. You know, that's what's I, I'd say actually even more fascinating that it was obtained by human beings and that something happened. Whether it's, you know, people just kept coming in. My joke that I still, my act is that all these dumb people out fuck the smart people and there was no smart people left and they wonder what their version of keeping up with the Kardashians was. Cause maybe something like that happened and then should they were going to be this super smart race.

Speaker 5:          01:09:12       Then Bam. Dot. Hasselhoff you blaming the keeping up with the Kardashians, those type of shows that still shows are just a symptom. There are a symptom of the rot under the, what was their version of that like? Maybe there was a guy who stood in front of a colleague seeing things and people listened to him and then they stop. I think most likely the Egyptians were super advanced, but there were advanced in a completely different direction than we're advanced. You know, we've spent all this time and you know, working on computers and working on technology and working on, you know, the ability to split the atom and nuclear power and all this crazy shit. Whereas I think they spent a lot of their, their science and their ideas on studying the cosmos and they had all these wacky ideas about the afterlife and the human body and that they're there.

Speaker 5:          01:10:00       They were fascinating as far as like their, their ability to make objects and construct things that were so much more advanced than anybody else near them. Anybody else, anywhere else in the world of fun? I mean they were making these incredible, incredible fucking structures, like the Great Pyramid, 2 million, 300,000 stones. I mean some people think they poured them with concrete and they made concrete out of them. Some people think they were caught, whatever the fuck they did. I mean the fact that anybody was able to do that at least a few thousand years ago where they think it's 2,500 BC. But there's some other people like John Anthony West that think that, you know, the, the, the oldest part of Egypt is even older than that, but there's some structures that they found under the sand that predate even the construction of the Great Pyramids that are these amazing, you know, stone structures. And the idea is that there was a, a civilization there thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago, maybe even 30,000 years, a really super advanced civilization.

Speaker 5:          01:10:53       And that there was a few of these all over the world, but some shit happened, some shit went down, whether it's a meteor or whether it's, you know, some crazy supervolcano or some massive fucking disease that killed everybody. Hmm. The weird thing is you're from Detroit, right? The weird thing is when civilizations fall apart, it does not take long for the fucking earth to take back the land. Yeah. You know, Detroit, I mean has a huge issue now with first of all bears and some of the outlying cities, the outlying towns, bears have started moving into towns because there's so few houses because the houses are broken down and all these houses, there's like a website that was dedicated to it. All these houses where trees are growing through the fucking the front floor and the porch is getting eaten up by trees. It's like nature is just taken over that shit over in a couple of decades. Not even.

Speaker 3:          01:11:41       Yeah, and that's the thing about Detroit. It's not even a scary city in the sense that there's a lot of people there. It's so ghost towny yeah, you can go for subdivision cause they were trying to do a lot of that urban farming where they were just going to blow up subdivisions and stop putting greenhouses and going, let's just start growing stuff in the middle of the city. Wow. They're really going to turn it back into the country. That's what they're doing. How nutty is that urban? There's so few people there that that's like actually a legit move. Yeah. Yeah. There's tear down the houses and build huge greenhouses and just dealt right now cause now that can do that with soil and they can just all right. That's why if the, you know, well we were the last pot, well we were there for the well that would definitely help them.

Speaker 3:          01:12:21       You know, just call on when we were there for the UFC they said it's 33% unemployment rate in Detroit now. 33% that's insane. Yup. One out of five. That's insane. It shows you what those auto jobs through what one auto job did, you know that's amazing. One out of three is unemployed three guys. One of them was out of work. That's amazing. And when you go there it's, it's such a weird vibe that it obviously so that everybody has that mentality. Everybody just feels like all my, you know, my whole family and everyone I went to high school with and college all has that we've been beat on mentality like do but

Speaker 5:          01:12:56       til way better off than third world countries. You know, if everybody just moved in together and you know, and had less meaningful if w two out of three are working, that's still way better than Guatemala. You know, if everybody had like a real sense of community and hoard it all together and got all the family together and they all ate meals together and they all shared wealth. Yeah. You know, it's just, it would be fine. There's still a first world country. It's still America, but nobody wants to live like that and everybody wants to have their own fucking parking spot. And you know, I mean, in one sense, I understand. I mean, everybody used to have it just a little while ago, but in other sense, no matter how bad Detroit is, you know, it's not fucking Peru. No. You know what I mean? There's some spots in this, there's some spots in this country or this, uh, this map rather, where, you know, you can go to countries where there, there's just fucked man. They're never going to get out of this hole. There's just poverty. And everywhere you go, there's, you know, these factories that are popping up out of nowhere and they're polluting the rivers and there's no jobs and there's no fucking future and no hope, just sadness. So Detroit not that fucking bad, you know? And I always slept around Goddamn time. Still America.

Speaker 3:          01:14:03       Yeah. Yeah. I went to this bar the other day called bar sinister. Have you ever been to it Joe? It's a bondage bar I've ever been to bondage Barbara for

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       doing when you're not with me, I'm going to lose you. But there were, there was, there was, there was a party, you're going to get raped. I know those places. There was a, there was a party though and it was pretty sweet. But you walk in and there's like these like handcuffs and just people, normal growth. Like, oh my god, ha ha, I'm at this bar. They get tied up in these guys with whips come out and just start spanking them. They're just like, oh my God. Yeah. You know, there were two normal girls. Guess what? Those aren't normal girls. Yeah. Well, I mean normal girls don't like full of whipple. They looked like fucking snow white. These girls are like, they were just like, oh my God, we're out of at, you know, like tourists. That's what they look like. Okay. And it was the greatest thing ever, man.

Speaker 4:          01:14:50       He's like, do you think they got caught up in the moment or do you think that's like holy loving it and it was just chicks? It was kind of like the, the crowd that you would see like at dimples when you do Karaoke, which is just a bunch of girls there at the Party and have fun. It was like, that is kind of bowls demos as a thing that John used to be a dumb, the master. He would go every weekend when he was, uh, it was by my house in Burbank. It just, uh, you see it on a lot of TV shows. It's like the first karaoke bar in the country and it's, I mean, that's her Brittany Spears got busted for if we're doing like a lot of famous people go there. It's the dive. Iest uh, that's where they were at. The Bar story happened and uh, yeah, but I used to live right dash paint Christmas eve there.

Speaker 4:          01:15:31       Once I spent Christmas, there was no dancing by yourself. He rocked George. Michael was your thing, right? Yeah. Yeah. We me and a buddy would sing. What song would you sing last Christmas? Well he would sing cause he's from wherever. George Michael's farm. So he sounds exactly like them. George Michael. So I would just be up there and the people that are like, you guys are so good. Keep in mind, dude, I was 24 years old when I see a little George. Mike, you were the guy you were trying hard to karaoke. No, karaoke scares me to death. I literally will have a panic attack before I get on stage and sing. Unless there's like five other people with me, then I can just be the guy who gets lost in the back. So what are you talking about then? But I would go on stage. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:16:16       And then, you know, cause I'm still, and then you'd sing a song. It was either this one or in the funny thing, you would do this in July. Took it song, sing it for us, John. No, I think that's a really, really like, if this comes on the radio, are you going to change it? Um, to be honest, I would probably leave it on, I wouldn't have to go from m and M to this to seven dust. Uh, I would have to be really, really hard to listen to this. Yeah, really high. I would have to be so hard that I shouldn't be driving or there was no other cars around you while you were driving. I have gotten so high, those by myself at an airport cuddled up in the corner with the iPod going, what is this going on here? That's what the song is. The song, you renew the lot cards in Los Angeles. The guy plays his song and goes, Julie, you like this? And then if you go, yeah, I'm kind of into it. Here's your card.

Speaker 5:          01:17:11       This is, this is one of those songs you find in your iPod and you really go, what the fuck was going on? How about you're at the gym and somebody asks you a question, when you take it out of your ears, this is what they here. Do you ever um, press shuffle and get embarrassed by your collection of Shit?

Speaker 4:          01:17:26       Yeah. That you have? Yeah, I have some, I have some songs that I'm not sure if I bought them as a goof or you're in the mood sometimes I just don't know. You know, how many times have we been on the road and we'd go to like a record store and you'd just buy the most ridiculous cds just cause you and Joey Diaz started talking about in the car. And next thing you know you have mc hammer the ghostbuster too soon. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:17:47       track. Hey, track four is legit. My Proton pack on my back and disparate Joey Diaz will get me excited about music. That's the truth. Joey Diaz starts talking about pink Floyd. Do you want to move to England? Where were they? What's the neighborhood? What's the street like? I drive in the left hand side. I'm fucking moving man money and we're just going to sit and listen to it all day. Let me Cox like a David Gilmore in 1972 dirty white boys in England.

You're like, I gotta get on a plane. I'll kind of go, I've got to find my destiny.

Speaker 4:          01:18:27       The craziest thing with Joey when he talks about music is sometimes he'll just break out somebody's name and I'd be like, no way. That's a good song. He's like, no, it's John Test and the pointer sisters, they're doing it too wet and you're like, no way is that good. And he puts it on and it's great. Oh, he's kind of a knowledge for it. Well, all he does is smoke weed and sit around and come up with shit. Yeah. You know? I mean, that's what he does. He smokes weed. He watches Clint Eastwood movies. He smokes weed. He watches Steve McQueen movies. He smokes weed. He listens to music, he smokes weed. He writes jokes. Have you seen black swan yet? What does that, it's a new horror movie.

It's that cool. I heard it was fucking Badass low. I saw heard that fighter movie was really good. That's really good too. Yeah, that's the one I want to Christian Bale, man, that guy, there's, there's dudes who like, they do something when they get a role, you know, that completely transforms their body but nobody does it. Like that fucking guy. Did you ever see the machinist? Yeah. How did those guys change their bodies so much? What did you see? The machinist, you know he did no,

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       do you know what I'm talking about? Full blown. And machinists was a movie where he lost super skinny. He was eating like an apple and a can of tuna a day. That's it. And he literally like, he probably fucked up his body. Like when you're, when you do something like that and you probably take years off your life, you probably damage your organs. Like what he did was extreme like really like almost like he looked like a monster, you know, like he would, he would like make life a little crazy, like you know, gestures and there's photos and videos of it all on online. Like people use it as a avatars on message boards. Just because it's so fucking creepy, man. There's, there's dudes that are willing to go that extra mile and he's one of them. And then how do they get big enough to be Batman?

Speaker 5:          01:23:50       Just get on the juice son here. Start telling some spots, eat some burgers. I don't know. I mean I guess if you, you rehydrate, um, I guess like how long would it take you to get back to your normal salvo? Take months. It would definitely take notes months and months and you would have to do it slowly. You know, your body just suddenly you starve it like that. Your body like would not be very receptive to weight lifting or anything either. You're Bobby probably be so freaked out, you know, just probably trying to like try not to. Yeah, yeah. No Shit. All then I won't do it then. Don't do that, dude. What'd you do that, if you ever got a movie, Somebody said, John have fun. We want you to be in this movie, but you've got to play this crack head. You got to lose like 100 pounds.

Speaker 5:          01:24:33       You got to look all fucked up when a scratch you up and my whole life, ever since I wrestled 98 pounds than one oh five I just kept telling myself, I will rule the world if I'm one 60 I haven't ruled the world. If I'm one 70 now I'm like one 80 I'm like, I need to get back to one 70 my face is round and fat. Too many singers losing weight in high school for wrestling. I did it for wrestling and I did it for taekwondo. It's the stupidest thing in high school. Half the people that are growing and they're, they're, they're getting them to do stuff to their body and cut weight so bad. Luckily I was always little so I never had to cut. I mean I was that small anyway. Yeah, but you didn't cut anything? I never did. Oh really?

Speaker 5:          01:25:11       Yeah, I know. I've always had us cut everybody cut weight. I was always like four pounds under whatever way class, so I never was like, I'm going down. My friend Anthony used to lose an insane amount every year and he always talks about how he, he would just eat everybody's Italian, his whole family beat and Pasta and he'd be sitting there with a cup of shaved ice and that's what he was allowed to eat and they'll just, cause he had to drop all this weight and even nutrition and how to do that stuff has changed over the last 10 20 years. So even fuck, even when we were in school. Oh yeah, the UFC guys have it down to a science. Then you go and still eat a lot and get strong and add muscle and still lose weight. It's crazy. You'd like to use American top team guys.

Speaker 5:          01:25:51       I've never seen anything like it. These guys, somehow or another, I don't know what they do, they just have it down to like an art form. They know how to get these guys there. They get them to cut like 20 pounds over the course of a few days and you know, and it's not that long. It's a, it's a pretty short amount of time they do it in. And then the guys weigh in and then they balloon him back up and they, they gained like 15 pounds, 20 pounds. Yeah. We walked in once on Tiago Elvis, he was a in the gym at the palms and it was a day he was fighting and they had him the day of the fight, they hadn't gone through all these, uh, shadow boxing moves, like go, go, go, go, go, go. It was burning like he's trying to like put all this, you know, glycogen depletion out of his muscles.

Speaker 5:          01:26:32       And then he would give him some sort of a drink and the drink was like this carbohydrate drank that refueled all the muscles so the muscles got back to full size. So that was the idea is that you make them work and then when you make them work a little bit, it allows them to take in more moisture, more water, and they get thicker. More sugar. Yeah. These guys, they haven't down to an art form. And so they have these guys like yours, you know, and t Bowers, he's the biggest 155 pound fighter on the planet. He's one of those guys where you looking at me and go, how the fuck is that guy won 55 well, he's not, he's only one 55 for like an hour or I know he's won 55 he gets down to the weight, it weighs in and then they give them a little pedialyte and then they give them bags of Ivy.

Speaker 5:          01:27:16       Like most guys use ivs now. You know, that's the smart way to do it. To get water back in your system. They need to have I ve places for people who leave bars that are like really boozed up. We can just plug in and feel good. Yeah. But it's good man. It's that simple. You're fucked. You know, it's kind of go through your whole system, you know? There's no shortcut to sobering up. I don't think they can do that with an ivy. But yeah, if they could, that would be the [inaudible] or the next day. How about that? When, when you know, when you feel super super that well you could do that. You could go the nearest banana bag or something, popping in like a Jiffy Lube. Sit there for 15 minutes. Get plugged in. If you went to a place you know that could rehydrate you with like a vitamin drip in and ivy and you know the Sugar Water Iva, you could totally do that.

Speaker 5:          01:27:58       We should do it. You know why? Why not? Why not do that man plugin sit there like a hangover stations in Vegas. Oh, that'd be perfect. No, but the problem is people don't want to get needles. Man. You'll go into stick some fucking needle in my arm. Whoa. I'm fine man. I'll just drink some water. Depends on how screwed up he got the night before. But isn't that the, the main thing with um, with hangovers, isn't it dehydration? Isn't that what's really fucking you up? Yeah, it's, you're just, yeah, your body's depleted from all that stuff. So put it back in. Powerful. That's why at the end of the night, I usually switch to beer and water for like the last couple of years and then after that, that's really smart. You should pound pound water when you get home to just force yourself to drink way more than you want to just pound it, pound it. Yeah. You know, speaking of Vegas, picking up pounded at February for me, Joe Diaz and Ari Shaffir at the Mandalay Bay theater. It's the day before the Superbowl weekend UFC to be a sick UFC to Anderson Silva's fighting Vito Belfort. And uh, that's going to be off the chain and I'm sure there's a great

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       supporting cast as well. I don't know the full card yet, you know, it's kind of when they're in February. I was thinking like, man, anything can happen between now and February, you know, in the MMA guys get injured so often. US, Vma, I've heard your voice almost every night this week for three hours. Oh yeah. You've been getting into the UFC lately. I just, you know, I just got a 2010 all the game game flight it and it, it came get that. So then that got on the new one though. Yeah, I was supposed to work this week, but I can't because my voice and then I created John Heparin, a hundred and hundred 80 pounder. Look at you. I thought you want to be one seven. It's easy to learn. I heard it's really hard. I heard that the controls are pretty hard to master. I buttoned smashed for awhile now.

Speaker 2:          01:29:43       I've got one or two moves, but I swear playing the video game, but I think it's all how you visualize stuff that you actually learn. You can learn some ground stuff by doing it on the video game. 100% really like actual moves. Oh, here's somebody put on the message board. Somebody puts some photos of Christian Bale. Look at those pictures will be the one on the left. Dude. God Damn, he's crazy. I did it again for this movie too. He got super skinny for this movie to hmm to play crack. Ed. Why don't you just get like a cool one when you can eat a lot and just become a fat slob? Well, that's fine. That role. That's what a dinero used to do, or even a Matt Damon did it. Denny Denny for his last one where it's like a, he's a CIA agent, but maybe it's kind of supposed to be funny.

Speaker 2:          01:30:30       Not Serious. We gained really? Yeah, and you just ate a lot of pasta and donuts. A just got written the outage that is that the movie about the dude who's like some swings in informant, the informant. That was obviously a good mood. Yeah, I didn't see it. Yes, I didn't. Why didn't I have to gain weight for that? I think he did though because these guys wanted to be doe. Yeah. Yep. That's absolutely fine. Yeah. Stallone did that once too. Remember that he did that for cop land. He gained a gut and there was like, Whoa, so fast. Yeah, that was a good maybe, but I think that UFC going through some of the ground stuff than in your brain, you kind of learn. Okay. I think that's how you, do you think you've actually applied something that you learned from the game to a sparring session?

Speaker 2:          01:31:14       Have you done that? I think you would have, you know? No, but I think people do all the time. What are fights like in school now, do you think? How many kids you got to MMA? You know, I'm like fighting it so much more of a part of our culture now that it was just a couple of decades ago. Even let's even go 10 years ago. Do you think anybody in let's say just a regular, you know, nonlethal just fight with everything about throwing your knee. Nobody would. Nobody was, everybody was headhunter. But now I've seen youtube fights where guys clinch and throw on that strictly from watching UFC. Oh yeah. Directly from just, just seeing it going, all of that exists. Let me bring that into my repertoire. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like a move that anybody can do to, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       it doesn't, it's not like a giant flying head kick, you know? It seems pretty simple. I even grabbed the guy and you throw your knee up and you hit him. You know, it's not like they're complicated. Yeah. Or, and you were to get ahold of them, or even dirty are clenching or dirty by holding that and stuff like that. A lot of that's going and watching youtube fight with this guy. Have you seen the break one? When the guy just says, put me out. It's this kid, he's got really baggy pants. He's just telling this guy, let's go, let's go. He says, put me out. He go, yeah, put me down. He's like telling the guy to knock them out, but his hands are, are at, is this the guy? Knock them out. It's an awesome really to really skinny kids. And then there he almost like there's a type equipment.

Speaker 3:          01:32:40       Is it a fight? No. They're on the street. One guy staying or is it a fight? No, it's, it's a fight. Okay. In one guy's got like a phone, which I have, but it, I took it off here. I have a video. When I was in grand rapids, this guy was trying to fight. He fought a couple guy. This guy has like a sweater on, puts his hand in his pocket and starts walking over to him, grabs him right, spins around, throws in a rear naked choke when he's on top. So this guy obviously knows some type of fighting because he was way too cocky. You don't put, you know, so he's got a rear naked choke on the guy, jumps up in the air in and knocks out the guy's legs so you know, wants to fall down with him. But he's got his back, he's standing, the guy now who had the rear naked choke and falls to the ground because he pulls the guy on top of them, smashes his head onto the cement cause you're in the middle of the street.

Speaker 3:          01:33:34       Oh Shit. Now loses a thing. Pretty much is knocked unconscious and that guy rolls on top of them and just starts wailing them. And I had it on my phone up until I was in the middle. Then a huge fight broke out and then I decided to put my phone away. I'm like, why would that guy think to pull guard? You know what I mean? Cause that's also from watching kind of UFC where you go, you know that I would have just stayed standing and wouldn't choke the guy out from standing. He's just fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. It was like, it was the craziest thing I've ever seen. I'm like wow, that guy just, he did a duck under, you know, so he goes to grab ducks under then throws in the choke and the guy then jumps up and pulls the guy right on top of, there's so many street fights.

Speaker 3:          01:34:16       No on fuck fucking cell phone cameras. I love watching them. I just like watching them to see what, what guys do in, in, in there. But the other one I saw this guy throws a knee and then the guy black block the knee, you know, put, Kinda did that little handout thing, but you know, they didn't notify you. Jump from the iTunes listener. John was just moving his hands left and right. What, cause he was like saying, uh, uh, he was taking his knee over here for the iTunes. There's been, I'm, I'm trying as I have enrolled or done anything in forever, but there was this guy on youtube that showed a, um, a thing, so he's on his back, reaches up, grabs the guys a head

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       and arm, you know, and pulls him close and then sweeps him. Right? I'm like, oh, that seems like a pretty cool sweep to know with basic, I don't know how practical it is when you basically just reach up, grab the guy's head, pull them in and then plan a foot and then saw good. As long as he doesn't know what he's doing. But I bet you spend running that in my head over and over again. This is what you get in. Then I need to do at this class, go to a Goddamn Jujitsu class. This is what Kung people, Kung Fu people do. They sit down and they go, well, it's like grabbed, you'd like this and then I got your arm right. He ain't not throw you on the ground. And then they'll like practice doing that over and over again. Well that that's not how you do it.

Speaker 2:          01:35:34       The way you do it is you've got to try it on somebody. I remember, if you don't try it on somebody, you've got some nonsense move that you don't really know what's going to happen if it got defense. Cause you have to learn whatever. The guy grabs me here, oh, if he grabs me here, I'm fucked. Okay. So I have to stop them from grabbing me here and then I have to make sure that this leg gives and get past this lie. Cause if it does, then I'm fucked again. I remember when we did that a tour together a couple of years ago, the Tate was with us in some guy and some guy was saying, yeah, I just, you just do this and you break the guy's leg and Tate just goes off and goes, really? How do you know? Do you have a room full of us, small Chinese boys that you break their legs and practice?

Speaker 2:          01:36:07       You've never broken a leg that way. Have you ever seen anybody who's Bro, it was funny. How do you know? How do you know that, that you don't know. So, so don't say it's going to bring some really good impression that taste really good. That's like the best impression that Taylor I've ever heard. It's totally true. Tate and I were, uh, I think I've told this story before, but I'll tell it anyway. Tate and I were in a hotel in Vegas and some big Douche bag. Let's go. It was really a taint. It's huge. Right? Tate is like six foot three. He walks around like two 35 and he's got a shaved head. He's coming. He just looked. Yeah. You just see, look at him and he'd go, no, probably not. The guy in the room. I'm like, yeah, it looks like a killer. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:36:44       And he's a nice guy, but you know, but people will fuck with him even though he's this big, it's so ridiculous. It's fucking kid who's like a frat boy. He looked like he was about six foot six and handsome fella drunk off his ass. But he was being a really, really aggressive and uh, you know, he's telling, stated that wasn't his room tape was like looking for his keys. Like that's my room bro, while you go to my room. And Tate was like, looking at this guy, I was like, no, I'm pretty sure it's my room. And he sticks the key and they're like, Tay was being really friendly about it and the key works. He goes up, seats my room. So he goes in, take it easy and shuts the door. And once he gets inside my room was right next to him. I hear Bang, Bang, Bang.

Speaker 2:          01:37:22       I hear pounding on his door, right? So, uh, we, we go out into the hallway and the guy is pounding on his door and the guys like fucking pussy fucking shut that door in my face. I told you that's my fucking room. It was like craziness. It was like, oh no, what is going to happen here? And tape was like, oh yeah, yeah. Big Guy. Is that what's going on? This is your fucking room, Huh? And the guy's like, what do you fuck up? Kick your fucking ass bitch. She was saying all this crazy shit. So Tate says, come on man, come on, take a swing at me. And the guy like doesn't know what to do, doesn't know where to go. And so he moved. There was a lot of John back in play before all this happens, but I'm going to cut to the chase.

Speaker 2:          01:37:58       The chase was the guy steps forward. Tate leg kicks him and then pulls guard on the dude. So he's got this guy on top of them in in the lobby and he's got them in what's called an Omoplata, which just got him in the shoulder lock position. And right when he gets him down, he's got them in its own path to the security guy. Show up, stop. Hey, stop, stop the fight. Are you the guy from fear factor? I go, yeah, yeah, don't worry about this. This guy's not going to get hurt. I go, he's going to be fine. He's just going to get choked unconscious. This guy's an asshole. So then Tate hears that. He goes, well, I guess I'm choking on my conscious. So Tate sinks or rear naked, choke on them and puts them totally asleep, doesn't hit him, doesn't hurt him that God doesn't have a scratch on him.

Speaker 2:          01:38:38       The guy's face down in the carpet, unconscious snoring, his friends come grab him, apologize, pick the guy up, put the guy in an elevator, the elevator door closes and he goes out of our life forever. He just had odd by the way, thank God. Yeah, well he was just so embarrassed and he probably didn't even know what the fuck happened. The guy was so drunk and so stupid. This is my room. They never did anything to him. Tate. They did not hurt him. He did not hurt him at all. He just incapacitated him, taught Tom a quick lesson and his friends were so happy because his friends were like regular size dudes discloses giant guy and this guy was a giant Douche, you know, the whole day. And he probably had to deal with that. Nice. Just everybody where ever he goes, what the fuck you looking at bitch?

Speaker 2:          01:39:19       They just one of those guys and so he fucked with the wrong dude. I mean it's like Karma just led him to take call university. You know what? We need to make a little shift on how you view life. You need to see drop you off at floor five. You've been treating people like shit, looking to throw something in your life that's going to push you in a different direction. Yeah. I became a yoga teacher after that. I really tried to find a center. You back with the goggles? I liked the goggles. It's a cool look. You know what I like about goggles when you're, you know, I always wondered like I watched Al Pachino get interviewed the other day and he got interviewed and he kept his sunglasses on the whole interview. He was talking to Larry King. I'm like, what kind of nonsense is that?

Speaker 2:          01:40:03       Is it, is it hot in the room or is it Brighton Room or something? Like why do you have sunglasses on? And he was talking about, I was so shy. He wears sunglasses because he can't even look people in the eyes. Like, is that it or do they like, it's really easy to pretend that you're living in a movie and that life is like some crazy fucking thing that you've created when you're looking through goggles, you know? Yeah. I like wearing sunglasses all the time. Yeah. I just didn't ever want him. I just, I like my eyes be as relaxed as possible. Nighttime indoors, nighttime indoors so much. But Hey, a bonded by colors. You wear them indoors. Uh, like if I'm at a restaurant and it's during the day and it's like bright in the restaurant, I'll wear it once in awhile. I'll wear my son. But if you're having a conversation with somebody, you take them off. Right, right. If they're wearing glasses too. So you just go with it. Yeah, I remember like I don't like, I don't like squinting, I hate squinting cause I squint on the

Speaker 4:          01:40:53       computer all the time. So I like my, I like to massage my eyes when I, when I can. So it's not a matter of looking cool. No, no, not at all. No. It's relaxation of the eyes. She, she doesn't want your eyes to have some shade on Him, right? Hmm. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Like I really like if I'm at the olive garden, I don't want to seed the, the, the decor. I don't give a shit about the paintings and stuff like that. The power of Yardi. Emily, do you eat at Olive Garden family? Huh? Do you eat at the, Oliver got eight there. You got eat there bro. What's close and you're hungry. It's not a bad choice. Right? It's fast. The breadsticks still good. I've been, it's great. The only problem with the olive garden is that lately there salads are half the size it used to be.

Speaker 4:          01:41:36       So they'll still refill them all you want, but they're like, they take longer to get now and they're half the size, so they're trying to fill you up so you get, you know, full faster so you won't get them salads. They're trying to get you full bug giving you less salad. Yeah, because they're there, they're giving you half as much and so you eat it and then you have to flag down the, the weight, the weight or to get you another one. That's a half one, you know. So that's one full regular old school salad that took twice as long to to go through. And the whole time you're sitting there getting full use out of your sign of the economy. Brian, they may believe salad I believe soon. So something that's troubling you. So because it doesn't all of garden fanatic, uh, you could tell like nowadays all olive garden fanatic.

Speaker 4:          01:42:18       Fuck yeah, I love the olive garden or you like one of those Fandango dudes. It's got like a little, I'm actually, I just don't care that much about the f the off guard, but I go there a lot. But you'll notice if you go to the salad. Yeah, I do. I'm a Yelp elite. But if you go to the salad, uh, if you go to this, if you look at the Saudis a lot smarter now, how do you become a Yelp, Yelp elite? You get chosen. What does Yelp, yeah. And hopefully I just had to put in my application to become the 2011 Yelp elite. But hopefully they pass me. So if you're listening yelpers, what does that mean, Bro? What are you doing? Going to a stadium and it's 12 guys, look, I get this other badge that most people don't have on Yelp.

Speaker 4:          01:42:52       So just check it out. Go to my profile and tell me what's going on with Yelp. What do you yeah, I don't even running around reviewing things all day. No, no. Once in awhile or review something. Usually. How many reviews do you have on your account? Not, not that many. I don't do it that much anymore because I'm so busy, but it's not their money here. I'll tell you, hold on honey. Yet big enough to get a Yelp elite. Yeah. What does that mean, Bro? I think you're, you're being very a sketchy with my Yelp status. A Yelp elite pretty much only means that, uh, that, that your reviews get pushed up higher than the other guys. I think B and modest burn and that a, you get invited to Yelp parties, which is a a great time. Yelp parties have 95 reviews. Wow. That's a lot of reviews kid. But I've been doing it since 2006 or 2007 or something. Damn. You just go into whatever restaurant store, just whatever it is and go. Yeah. And the customer service, we're okay. Yeah, exactly. I do it for restaurant member of the media. Have you heard like bloggers calling the media?

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       That's what it gets. Hilarious. Right. You know, that was a member of, as a member of the media, like Whoa, what? Right. But I guess they are right. I mean, what the fuck is the difference? I mean at a certain point in time we have to make some sort of a distinction because every douche bag that has a website can't be in the team. You know, there's some people that are absolutely terrible at it. Like you have to like if you were, uh, uh, you know, a member of the media, a writer for say, The New York Times, you know, they had standards. By the time he got to the New York Times, you were a certain caliber of journalist, you know, but any asshole can just start a fucking blog and basically now it's all the same thing. You have just as much of a possibility of getting your shit scene. Yes, some really high traffic thing. If you write something good and it's controversial or

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       totally interesting, one celebrity tweets it, fuck, you know, and then everyone goes

Speaker 5:          01:44:43       the there, the media then then all of a sudden they're showing up at places with cameras and it's All v Webs fueled. You know, it's how we live in a strange time, ma'am.

Speaker 3:          01:44:51       Look, Joe, I reviewed the hotel the day after the fire at the hotel in San Francisco. Yeah, the fire at the cliff and then one night, that's a terrible hotel. Stay at folks if you, I mean if it's a nice hotel, but if you're going to stay there and a fire breaks out, the fucking hotel has these staircases that are these tiny single file staircases. They were jammed up with people. You know what I heard when I was in San Francisco, however many times ago, I had dinner with, um, Tim Ferriss, you know, guy wrote four hour work week and he just a four hour body and he was, his buddy wrote this book called Emergency Neil Strauss I think wrote emergency just about how to live like Bourne identity guy, how to have a couple passports because the problem is if stuff goes down and you can't get out of your country, that's all you know.

Speaker 3:          01:45:40       So anyway, he tells you to have extra passport. This guy emergency says that's a good way to get arrested, man. Catch you with extra passports. How do it, well, there's other countries, uh, that will give you dual citizenship real if you invest legal. Yeah, yeah. Show you. But you have to invest in their infrastructure. So how much, uh, I think in the book the Guy was talking to guy for like $100,000 or something. Fuck Outta here. [inaudible] up with $100,000. Give us some whack ass little fucking third world country. You get to view a female. Yeah. What are you doing, Bro? You give an icon in Nigeria so then you get fuck out of here Graham. But he said the guy. Nah, I could he, yeah. He asked what hot many fire trucks you think is there to protect the entire city of San Francisco. And I was, I always said, I don't know, probably hundreds. It was I believe less than 20 total. Whoa. Now say these words, but I could be wrong, but it's, it's something like that where you would think there's no, there's hundreds for the entire city of, no, there's literally big rigs

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       that can shoot water like 20 of them. So if anything really happened in his city like that, the thing is it's, it's going to go well. We were the whole show. The whole book is how to survive. Like born, we were at the hotel and the fire broke out supposedly four 30 in the morning, but it wasn't really a fire. It was just some assholes that blew off fire extinguishers. But it looked like a fire that it looked like a fire. There was smoke because of the extinguishers are like, it looks like smoke and it's flooded, you know, through the hallways. And we were going down this little single file staircase at four 30 in the morning where people just shuffled on the staircase. It was maddening. Everyone was going so fucking slow. It was really scary, man. It was. I thought so hit their head and the stairs going down and at one point like me and Joe both felt like we're just going to start beating up the people in front of us.

Speaker 2:          01:47:35       No more, no more hotels that are from the 1700 now. They didn't kiss my ass first floor, second floor. Now I'm like first floor, second floor. That's all I want. Well it's just those old ass hotels man. Like that's, that's your staircase, right? I mean it was so small. I literally had a hard time getting through it. Me, I have one person had a hard time getting through it. So I got skinny ass staircase and there was fat people and old people and tired people and people in poor health and they were all just clogging up the stairs. You know, you really, when you see a person during the day, you see a person that's all warmed up. You know they've had coffee and they're moving, you know what I'm saying? They got up a couple of hours ago and had breakfast and they're, you know, walked out to the brisk, you know, cold air before they got into the building where you meet them.

Speaker 2:          01:48:22       But when you see them, boom, right after they wake up and they're all disoriented and their slowness might get you burned to death. Yeah, it's a fucking trip, man. You always wonder about that when you're on a plane or you have to sit in the exit row and you're like, okay, I'll, I'll open this if I have to wear these hundred and 50 people active allies of stuff. And then I always think, no. I'm like, there's no way. But then you hear about stuff like the plane and landed in the Hudson where everyone just orderly. You know, the got 150 people out. I'm like, I dunno. That's just such a, that was a safety landing. That landing was almost like they landed on the ground. It was just, they were on the water, you know, it almost seemed like it made sense, but I hear you.

Speaker 2:          01:48:59       Yeah. Like you never know what people just, you know, climb over the week in the slow just to save or is it already, I don't know. I've never depends on the situation and how dire the circumstances are and it depends on, I mean, look at black Friday or whatever it's called, and you see people trampling over each other to get into a store. Right. So they're on a southwest flight. Chances are you going to get trampled, right? Yeah. So then you're good to go. Yeah. If you're on virgin, you're probably going to be okay. Everyone's going to be cool with you. Yeah. Have you flown many virgins? No, I heard it's awesome though. Yeah. The view. No, I haven't fun any of them. John half on. You're a world traveler, Huh? You're constantly not around the world, but I mean around the country you're covering stand up. Yeah. It's a lot of fucking lasts. I don't like planes anymore, man. Last year, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       last year was 40 something weeks or something. And then I have this week off and then June 1st is my first week and the you in and off starting next week. And I leave God, you just out every weekend. Yeah. How do you do that? It's a used to be easier, but now I uh, to be honest then now I occupy my time with so much other little projects during the day that that's what gives me, you know, like dancing. I dance, I do my, my ribbon thing. I'm in my a knife fighting and Cain fighting class stars. Do you take classes and shit when you go on the road? Like if you go on the road, are you a Wednesday through Sunday guy? Like how do you do the road Wednesday? Yeah, Wednesday through Sunday. So you can't say travel day. You're just home Monday, Tuesday and then Bam, you're out on the road on Wednesday?

Speaker 3:          01:50:33       Yeah. Sometimes a Thursday, you know, leave on Thursday. Is your wife meet you places? Do you like try to set it up where you see each other more than two days a week? No. Whoa. I mean we used to, um, but now she's got a job. So No, you know, when we see each other like asking classes, like when I was in Atlanta, um, there's a boxing gym by my hotel, so I would go in there and then work with that guy for a couple of days. Just do you ever go to the boxing gym and they try to set you up and once I'm doing to spar with you, uh, I won't do Mount Holyoke asked you though. I had before and I've gotten beat up, you know, then you're on stage going, somebody beat you up, not beat up. But you know, other guys, 60% might be different than my 60% and it's a funnier story if some guy knows who I am and knocked me out then going 60%.

Speaker 3:          01:51:19       That's a boring story. Right. So, yeah, it's hard to trust people. I don't, when you're spoiling me, unless you find, you know, do you have a problem with tr Accra Krav Maga Class A couple times? You know when you're sparring. And I'm really, I pride myself in going, if we're going to go 50, we're going to go 50. I don't have an ego. I don't need to go 65 and prove anything to you were both here to learn and blah blah blah, blah. But there is a couple of times where I haven't been, I just, I still get even mad thinking about kicking 40 50% a five year old could probably catch that. Kik when you literally are just going more of the Mo motion to maybe step in. The guy catches my foot and then straight just, you know, just how hard you punched you in the first enough.

Speaker 3:          01:52:04       Why all stars and fell to the ground. Do you think you hit your hundred percent? Uh, he pretty hard. Not, not a hundred, but it was, no, it's tricky, right? There was no martial arts classes. A tricky, you've got to make sure that the people that you're training with, you trust them. You know, that's where, when you, when you're striking things get weird when you, you know, kicking him punching. Yeah. Cause you know you really can't do it full blast everyday. So you've got to assume that the guy is going to be willing to work with you and you know, we're just going to kind of tag each other. So we work on our timing. Yeah. That's why I like doing like just I go to a place like that, I'll do a lot of just bag work or Mitt work and bounce around where there's really, except for the midst maybe slapping yet, like that's equally as well.

Speaker 3:          01:52:45       I just want to do it to give me something to do and get my heart rate up. So I don't want you to take the guys on the road with you. Uh, used to. And then the last couple of months I haven't cause evolved con Kinda cutting, not famous, but then they kind of move on and they're like, I don't feel like witchy to me is, you know, you gotta get slackers, get people who just don't want to get famous and yeah. Yeah. Then I've got to go on the road on the roads too hard yet. It's funny, his kids I used to, now I think starting next year I'm going to find some guys, but I'm going to have some rules. You know he, I know that sounds dumb, but I did a show where it was me and brewer is both of us pretty amazing show cause I'm high, low level and he's even even higher level.

Speaker 3:          01:53:27       But I did, I didn't do more in 20 minutes in front of them in and then he would, but during that 20 minutes I'm like wow, that feature spot you will, you don't have time for anything. There's no time to talk to people in the crowd. 20 minutes. It's very quick. Yes. So then now when I see guys opening for me having conversations with the crowds, I'm like, how do you have the time stop that do 20 minutes of nonstop material and then get off the stage. Don't have a, I don't know how. So now I got, yeah, but sometimes when you're opening though, sometimes like talking to the crowd just a little bit here and there, it kind of like brings everybody to, I'm talking, no, I'm talking feature. I'm not talking to MC. So just the feature, that spot you should just go up and rip.

Speaker 3:          01:54:07       Just be yeah. You know, I think, but then I was fine. Guys that sit on the stool and these start day there, everybody's got their own thing though man. Like, but for me, uh, you know in front of me, those guys. So I gotta I gotta fine. Yeah, I've got to find, got to find the right God. That's funny that you monitor what they do. Why don't monitor and say anything but it, but it bothers you when they sit on the stool. But that's 40 some weeks a year and that's where that kicks in where then now you just find little things, a bitch book. It's funny where you go to a Condo, the same guy, you go with the same guy 40 weeks in a row. Um, I used to settle, drive you crazy. Yeah, I think that's what I got to do is fine.

Speaker 3:          01:54:43       You start telling them what to do with his act. Like don't sit on a stool. Don't ever say anything. No, I don't see any bigger roles. You say you got rules? Well now if I have a new guy opening for me, I would kind of find a guy and you go, okay, I let his yet. I like his style. So you treat it as if he's an employee. The only thing I don't like dude's doing is what's the tricky. It gets tricky if you, you bring a guy with you and then he starts talking about the shit that you talk about before you talk about it. Then you're like, hey man, you know, I already talk about that. Like, why are you talking about that when you bring me up? And I thought, that's weird, you know? Yeah. You know, it's funny, as you're walking to work with guys, let's say that are just there and as the week goes, I notice this and they'll start doing more and more.

Speaker 3:          01:55:23       Yeah, similar, lightly touching, not even doing it, but just dusting in enough where you're like, really? You haven't watched what I've done who do that on purpose? You know? They do that on purpose. They're stepping on your materials, what they're doing, they're stepping in your area and they're doing it on purpose just to, to so that when you bring it up there is not the initial recognition of, yeah, yeah. Like they've already heard this 20 minutes ago, you know, they've heard that they've heard this subject breached 20 minutes ago. Even briefly. It just takes some of the wind out of the sails a little bit. I worked with a guy, I heard him talking to his friend and the on the phone and he never saw me do stand up. He's like, he's in the green room and he's like, yeah, this guy's going to have a good hard time following me this week.

Speaker 3:          01:56:02       You heard him say that he's bragging. He walks in and he saw that I heard. I'm like, Yeah Dude, I hope you rock it. That'd, that'd be great. You can't, you really did your with your, you know guys and paint like to hunt men like you're going to do gauge. It's hilarious. Who was his Garmin and call them out and then used to fuck Aye. Aye. Aye. No, do it. I don't remember. I bring Joey d road whenever I can. Joey should be a headliner, but he's just too crazy to go on the road by himself. Right. Catcher's trust. Joey who won't show up. You know why I think back in the day when you first started doing comedy for Guy Crushes in front of you for me, because you'd be insecure, you'd go, oh, that guy crush, what am I going to do? But then you reach an age in a confidence level.

Speaker 3:          01:56:50       You go, that's awesome. Yeah, I'm, I'm not gonna ride that same way. Well, you all capable of be enjoying it. Unfortunately for some people guys that go on before him, it's like a competition, you know, and they're not enjoying it. Instead of like watching the, the act and having fun and being inspired, they're, they're not enjoying it. And you could see shows where like if you, or see you and Joey and, and anyone else went when every, when the comics like each other to show is better because there's a cooler vibe. I've done shows where it's Mc hasn't talked to me. Feature guy was just being friendly and me. And then I get on stage almost like I'm by myself this entire week. Yes, let's hear it for those guy like, and there's no connection and there's no opposed to if your friends are like, the worst is when you try to bring a guy in like you, like you try to pal around with them, but you realize like deepen this a one way street.

Speaker 3:          01:57:37       This guy's a Douche bag. Like, fuck, I'm working with a douchebag. Yeah. You know, it's always tricky, man. Going on the road. That was the number one thing that I hated the most. So you never knew who you're gonna work with. You could be working with some dude with a real negative energy and I work with twos that get super drunk and just one of fallen down and make an ass out of themselves in the next light. You got to hang out with them again. You're like, hey man, you guys want to go to a bar? No, I don't want to go to a bar with you. You crazy alcoholic. Fuck right. And then, you know, no, no longer have a friend for the week. Yeah. I worked with a guy recently who read news or even worse is the guy who used to drink and looks down at you want a shot? No, I don't drink. I'm trying to look down at people never looked down. Brian. Fuck you man. I don't look down at leave. I'm a little, I don't drink. Yeah, I've seen drunk John Heffernan. I've seen sober. Jon had, I welcome sober Jon Ephrata drunk. John Heffrons better for all of John. The phone's breaking up. I can't hear what I just said. He's not gonna remember this conversation

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       anyway. Yeah. There's the guy that John Hernandez desert drank way better. Yeah. Way more money way. Uh, John was the old John Heffron was easier. Yeah. What do you mean to get into bed? And Brian, Brian's got plans. Um, what was I going to ask you? You got the one oh, silly hologram bracelets on. Do you really think that things helping you? I know, but I like to wear it though. I like something like an athlete. Yeah. It's Kinda cool. It's like a moderate up. What is the first goes live strong bracelets. Yeah. I used to have one for this Q lane that was supposed to do the same stuff years and years ago, but that was really expensive. This I got free in like a golf bag or something. It's supposed to be something that's supposed to balance you. It's all nonsense. Complete total nonsense. They cannot not be nonsense.

Speaker 2:          01:59:26       But what the placebo effect people like take those things. Then they have all sorts of like benefits. Their back feels great and all of a sudden their injuries go away and then if they deal with the placebo and it works, then it works. But it's kind of placebo effect is some real shit. I don't know why, but it's some real shit, you know? Yeah. You just tell yourself and you go, okay, it's all connected to evade. The placebo effect is very much like, like when you're on stage and you know things are funny. You know how you got that feeling where you know things are funny and you just kind of like trust in it and it just goes to this sort of magical place for it just comes out. I think the placebo effect is the same thing. It's like you know this is going to heal you, you know there's going to make you better and boom, it just lights up all those parts of your brain.

Speaker 2:          02:00:04       You just have to truly believe in it. And He'd do it. You're an idiot. Look at, it's a rubber band, which should probably bandwidth with the sticker that would be on underneath your baseball hat if you bought it for a little Hologram or your baseball cards. It shows that it's a real, a upper deck shit is goddamn ridiculous. Just kind of, so how long do you think you can keep this up? This travel on the road? 40 weeks a year cause I that'll kill them on. What are you running from running to? What's good? You're saying sassful you know it's a sign. It's 80 it's so funny. I keep joking with people telling people I'm going to start a mailing lists for when I'm about 65 in Branson, Missouri. Oh, I'm going to do a 1:00 PM show Yakov Smirnoff specialists, but it's legit but can be 65 70 at that point.

Speaker 2:          02:00:45       You know who cash. But I do have a thing I told myself and I'm putting plans together where I'm going to retire when I'm 50, you know, just done really and only working for when I want to because I'll still be relevant. And you know, there's not really any time, but that's my goal is I'm in work around La and work wherever you are, whatever, who stands up whenever you feel what happens 10 years from now. But I'm going to keep running for the next 10 years. I wanted to talk to you about this while we have you on the podcast because now I'm just remembering, um, you were the one that has been doing these crazy cyber conference shows and we've actually talked about you on the show before about you've done these corporate gigs. Explain, explain exactly how it goes. Yeah. I brought a tape of it, but we can't play it. What it is, it's with Cisco's telepresence and you go into a room, just a conference room. You sit down at a table and then across from you is maybe three big screen TVs, maybe about eight inches each.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       68 68 inch screen, maybe each one. Each one. Wow. Okay. So then on one of the screens was Boston, the one in the middle was New York. The other one, Washington DC. In each screen, imagine 30 40 people sitting in each screen. So that little squares, like webcams? No, just a Oh, a group? Yes. Just like your group, like an audience. It looks like a window when looks like a window. No, it doesn't look like a Webcam at all. It looks like. So the, the screen is filled with an audience. So if we were to, you have a, a big sliding glass door. If we were to set up uh, chairs and then Brian gets on the other side of the, of the window, that's exactly what it looks like. You're to scale, everything's to scale. So you're not looking at little guys, you're, and then how you sit in the table because then their table does the same.

Speaker 3:          02:02:32       It looks like it's one big round connected table. Dude. Someone should set up cyber comedy clubs. Well that's due. So I was the friend. I wish I had a, you don't have to show video. And this is more and more people are listening to this on iTunes and [inaudible]. So in your house? No, this, this one was I, I've done it at a couple hotels. I just wanted the big chains. The Hiltons or something has this, this, this technology and then their hope it is now you have a business meeting in New York. You live in Los Angeles. You're not flying. You go into their hotel sitting there. I can look across from you. It's all, this is a whole chain. Like all the Hiltons, it's, it's, I don't know if it's the Hilton's, I forgot what plan I was the cliff hotel. Yeah, but so that's their thing.

Speaker 3:          02:03:16       So I've done it now Cisco a bunch of times, but three or four of them? No. Are these squeaky clean gigs? Do you have to be squeaky clean? Yeah. In what had happens is in each room is people who want to buy the technology. So it's the owners of these companies that spend 25 million, 50 million. So imagine those type of guys. Okay, so you're doing stand up to them. So then you sit down, are you doing stand up or are you do my presentation? No, I do my act. So I sit down and then you have the Cisco person here going, you know for a meeting because maybe they watch a presentation about the system but Dah, Dah Dah. And then I get an intro almost like a, like an mc wood and then you kind of go off into it. And how I look at is, you know how when you do morning radio you show up.

Speaker 3:          02:04:05       It's just the Dj and maybe a news girl. It's the same. You have to tweak your, your brain. You know how when you get there you kind of performance mode, but you see all the people sitting there looking at it. So then you see them and then you could go in whatever room is the loudest. That's what you see. So it, it, it knows if somebody is talking. So let's say Boston was laughing really hard, that it, ah, and the need quiet down and all of a sudden New York would pop up, you know, cause somebody talked or, or did something wrong. I'm looking at one screen. Well, it would constantly, well that's annoying. Why wouldn't it just be the same screen over and over again? It does, it picks up whoever's talking. So then that way the focus can be on that person talking. Can't they have it static?

Speaker 3:          02:04:49       I wouldn't see that from me. You would want to see the audience and they would just want to see you. If you could just have that stat. What if you fall in love with somebody? Tell me, Brian, please. Piano music. Am I done in San Francisco? Um, so yeah, so you do it and then you would look across from you, hey guy in the NASA suit. And then so that's what I would have to do is you'd have to bring in people, um, you know, so they feel connected and then you just do your, your stuff. Could they do it static where they just see you all the time and then you, yeah, because I laid on that piano mother fucker. This isn't even sad anymore. It could be a sad if we want it to be. What do you want to talk about several way?

Speaker 3:          02:05:27       Have you ever fallen in love to talking about sad things? I think to some of the status things. Are these people like HD though? Like, like I mean like really, really good pitchers. Like you're looking into a window and the person's right there, that's the only, and their faces just kind of come on like so it was a room you in that you're in like pitch black. So you just see like these faces that, are these bodies come in front of you eight? No, it's least three. You have three screens, but each screen does not have an individual video on it. They all have, they all have the same thing. Doesn't weird, but I'm sure there's adjustments, but sometimes all three screens will be one city and then other times it would split and I don't know, it's all voice activated so I don't know.

Speaker 3:          02:06:08       And that would be distracting. I think if they could keep it static so that you could just get into your head and do your material. I think it can be very much like an audience. I think that's a real possibility of cyber comedy club where a comic would perform in a studio in la or wherever the hell they are in New York and people would come, you know like, hey, we're going to do Austin, Texas and Ohio and, and you know, you're in the room with you, like what's up, what's up, how are you already doing? And it's like, wow, where we really are in a room together like that. Dope. Last, a couple of weeks ago I did a thing for Cisco at their place and then I went downtown to some steak place right by the staple center too. This is a great idea for a TV show, man.

Speaker 3:          02:06:46       So I'll, so doing what you're saying. I was, now I'm in a steakhouse downtown. They have a conference room, there's a, I'm sitting at this table, almost like the last supper table with people all on my right and left a screen and TV in front of me. I'm looking at another steak house that was in Tempe, Arizona, full of a hundred people all sitting at tables. Just like, uh, you know, like you're at a restaurant, they're watching me on TV. I'm doing my stuff in that 100 people in that room are laughing. So I would like, and I would literally do crowd work. I'd go, yeah, be in the white sweater and the second table from, what's your name? And she would shout out Sarah. He said, what was the last argument you got in with your husband? And then she would have a thing and I would talk and then that room would laugh.

Speaker 3:          02:07:35       It's a really, it's kind of crazy. That's pretty interesting, man. So you can do it. And people were like, Eh, the people in the room wanting be, um, into it yet because, so imagine watching a comedy central special. What? Say That again? Like a lot of people go in. Cisco was wearing, I had some other trainers that want to buy the technology. They were saying, how can you engage or build rapport with a hundred people that are in a different city, not with you. That was a weird thing that like is a comic gonna work, but it works because just like you're watching comedy central and you're watching someone special, you're laughing. Now imagine if that guy could look out at you and go, hey, you're a, you're almost pit and have a conversation with you so it really adds this whole, why would they say it wouldn't work?

Speaker 3:          02:08:21       Look, as long as you can interact with the people you can interact with them, it's going to be a weird thing. A cyber comedy club was a very, very interesting idea. That technology that they have a home version of that still look at me now, but you know what I'm saying? Like you wouldn't have to travel so much. You know you get, if you had a cyber comedy club, you could have people come to see you all over the country. They organized the shows, you know, and have a be cheap like a movie ticket instead of like a comedy club tickets where it's a live show and you gotta to justify the airfare and all the shit to get the guy to the club this way is just, you know, it's just in a studio somewhere you cut a lot of the expenses out is cheaper and the people go and they're, it's a real show.

Speaker 3:          02:08:56       It's like they're interacting, you know, and you know, and like, especially for me when I do question Anson Shit question and answer shit. Like you could see that it was really happening right there. And then, and I don't know how many cities you can, let's say you do it at the hotel where it's set up. If you, if there's, I don't know what the limit is, but you could have like yet 10 satellite cities and what, I don't know what the technologies were like one, you had like five cities going at the same time, but yet one conti audience, they're just heckling and being douchey. Just mute them. I put you on ignore Kansas City. You just got on the door, you should probably have a moderator. You'd have a club owner, which is just, you know, somebody sitting there meeting people that are getting out of control.

Speaker 3:          02:09:34       Yeah, the mute the audience, but the, the feed still comes through, you know, watch. It's a Cisco is 8 billion trillion dollar company and I gave them a legitimate thing. When you're done with those, it's a weird thing. You Go, okay, well we're done. And you know how when you're done with something, you're used to shaking a hand or pat or there's a, okay, we're done. Well they don't have anything. And I told them they need a virtual fist pump where when like, okay, later I hit a button and a fist just comes to your screen and then we do a, you watch this right now, I'm going to show you, I will be willing to willing virtual mansiony, maybe a virtual handshake, fistfuls bone dare to business travel, business fist bump in the world of human resources, it's not going to exist. I bet you not going to watch you behavior with secret handshakes and fist bumps and shit.

Speaker 3:          02:10:23       There's going to be a some type of a thing. Whoa. Maybe like a green light, a nice green light like a palm. I invent a two thing like palm, it shows up in the screen watching and I'm gonna say this. Then the ideas can be there. All the business guys take off their jackets. You know they have the shirt and ties and they throw them over the back of their chairs. I'm going to invent suit jackets that aren't real once they just covered the back of your chair. So you see that as a piece of your suit, but you don't have to wear the jacket. What the fuck is wrong with you? You got tackled. Brilliant idea. That's an idea. You're talking about. Signage. Jackets are never a good idea. John had fraud. They're going to go on the back into herself too long. Virtual fist pump talking about your sake jackets bro.

Speaker 3:          02:11:04       That are going to go on the back of, because here's the thing, when you do those, you don't have to wear dress pants because they can't it. They're like newscasters. So the new look, you can go board shorts, flip flops, maybe a nice shirt with a tie fake jacket cover over the thing. You look like you're wearing a suit and you got problems. Brain dog guys are NASA in the beginning of the show brain doctor, you need to go see one telling you you're gonna, you're gonna, we're gonna see it. You're all gonna for start there John Heffron I'd be willing to bet you an insane amount of money. That fake jackets that you put on the back of your city will exempt. Okay. Cause he will exist cause I'll create them. Okay. You will, they will exist and they will be a money pit of disastrous proportions for me.

Speaker 3:          02:11:46       I need somebody that direct message me. I need a seamstress. What is it like dealing with those people in that world and doing like squeaky clean comedy only and not being able to take any chances up there or go into any weird directions. What does that like I've always done is that type of comedy. So it's not weird for them than you do. You're currently has got me. I'm an adult, but I'm not, you know, I don't get ever super grass. I, I'm, I believe you can turn a, a clean bit dirty, just buy things then vice versa. But yet you are one of the most perverted people I've ever met in my life. Right. It's pissed off with that. Plus I think it's weird when you have jobs that then affect you. Like when I used to do morning radio with Bonaduce, we are on a soccer mom, a duty station.

Speaker 3:          02:12:29       You have gun buyback. You guys were on a soccer mom's station. Yeah. We would like blow. Danny tried to get in a fight at a matchbox 20 concert. So that shows you what kind of saying try match. But in a fight at a mailbox, he, it was the great, he took off his shirt and was going to fight the entire row. Jj at pineapple. Why would the shirt off? Because better in the bathroom, I think this is back when Danny partied, I think, uh, Danny met up with the listener and the disappeared, whatever happened. So he came back in an altered stain. No, he was never that type of guy liquor. Um, no. I thought, I think we was. Um, and he's talking, he's talking about the story, so I'm not thinking of, but it was that date, rape drug, whatever your thing. He did GHB.

Speaker 3:          02:13:12       Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, but, but Danny scar tissue, he did mid to all this stuff. I don't know how that guy, but so he did. So then he came out crazy. Did you say Danny is scar tissue? His whole body is, or there's no way you can be alive with all the stuff that he has done. Really? There's no way you have to be totally embalmed. What did they do that with frog? So the body's preserve? Yeah, formaldehyde. His, that's his entire body. Really? Oh yeah. He's a Zombie. You can't, he's not alive. What's wrong with him? He's just done so much stuff to his body. What was it like working with that guy? How long did you work with them? Different? Kiss him five years. Five years on the radio. Every morning. Every 15 in the morning. And Michigan, which means that's when I scraped off the ice on my thing.

Speaker 3:          02:13:52       Drove 45 minutes. How many months a year is it snowing like that? And Michigan, it started December and go to like May. June. Yeah. I mean it's, so that's a long drive. A June, seven months. Seven months. Eight April and yeah, half the April, half a year. Half it's cold and crappy. Yeah. Okay. So cold and crappy. You get up at three 30 in the morning. You do it stand up at night still? Yeah, around town. Um, but it was Austin cause I would sell out stuff. I mean there were some benefits I wasn't playing and I was 25, 26. Why would you ever want to sleep? So I would do like radio bar appearances, you know, like I was that guy movie premieres, but he got paid a lot of money. How crazy was daddy? Uh, beyond crazy? Because the thing with Danny is you never knew which guy you were going to get.

Speaker 3:          02:14:40       You can have a guy that you work with that's a consistent ass, but at least then you know how to tip toe. Other times, Daniel be the coolest human being you've ever met. And then you come in the next day and you'd go, he's gonna literally slit my throat. The only advantage, I mean did it. Now we're, we're really good friends. And at first he, he hated me. He wanted to hit you. Um, well I never did radio before I met him. I was just a comic round town and I didn't know how to talk with that person. It's try having that conversation with them. It's tough. So imagine being a 22 year old kid, not, you know, David [inaudible]. And I was like, yeah, but one time I, you know, I just didn't have my rhythm. I just didn't know. So he hated you because, oh, hated me.

Speaker 3:          02:15:21       Hated working with you. Hated just, yeah. Yeah. And he didn't want to work with you. He didn't want to know why to me fired. I just moved back from Los Angeles. So I moved to from Detroit to Los Angeles and then got that job and move back to Detroit and then got fired maybe three or four weeks later. And then did he get you fired? Yeah, he got me fired and then we went to Chicago together. It was an odd for some weird thing and then we ate. He didn't suddenly liked me and then then I was on the shelf. You know what? What are you talking about? We did a radio show together and for some reason why we were doing it in Chicago, something clicked where he's like, oh, I get you and I'll have friend. Okay, you're in. Then it was so, I'm so confused.

Speaker 3:          02:16:03       Okay. You started off together in Michigan, you did a radio show, he's got you fired and they got me fired because they were going to get me, you know, how did you go to Chicago? What is this Chicago trip about? I got fired on a Friday and we were going to go to Chicago on Monday to do a hit this loop, the loop in Chicago. So we do it as a permanent gig. Well, Danny's thing was a, I can't believe they did that. You know, why don't you come to Chicago? We'll do the show Monday. Puts you up. I didn't know. Just took confuses. He's still doing the show in Michigan and he does a show car. So yes, he would do morning shows in Detroit afternoon in Chicago. So he would get on a southwest flight. Wait a minute. He did a show every day in two markets.

Speaker 3:          02:16:46       Yes. Oh my God. We'll get on a southwest flight and fly from Detroit to Chicago, do the thing, and then get on another flight. Fly back. Holy Shit. Yeah. Every day. Yeah. He did that for a couple months and then, you know, then he figured out technology, but keep, you know where they can ISD and at where he would do it in thing. But he was doing that every day is insane. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. How long is the flight? A year? 10 minutes. 20 minutes. 40 yeah. So it's an on Vegas, like flying to Vegas. Yeah. And he would do it every day, back and forth, and then do his radio show. Holy Shit wrapped in, you're in Chicago. Yeah. You gotta give the Guy Credit for that? No wonder why he was on drugs. So he got to be on drugs. So I was fired, but he didn't tell me that it was, he was like, I can't believe they did that.

Speaker 3:          02:17:30       I that's like so he didn't, I didn't tell you that he got fired. So he goes, why don't you just come to Chicago this weekend? We'll, we'll party that just sucks. Have friend. But you know, well, so he's Kinda like probably felt guilty. I'll let you party in in Chicago with me and then you're gone for life. Okay. Did the show with them on that Monday and he's like, you know what, I'm going to make a call like we had, cause he never listened to me. You know what I mean? Like what's the problem on the show if you would just listen to me. He knows. So anyway, long story short, I came back and like, Eh, you know what? We won't fire you but we'll give you, you got to take a pay cut. Because I was making, if you know, keep in mind, I'm 23, 24 morning radio in Detroit, making $150,000.

Speaker 3:          02:18:09       Wow. I mean, that's like $1 million to a 23, 24 years. Was this because, well, why were they given you a pay cut? What are they doing? You know, because I was, I had no management or anything and they're a huge corporation. They're like, you get the Gig in the first place. Uh, this huge radio guy, Dick Perton in Detroit was leaving the radio station and he suggested to that management, you need to bring this Heffron kid in. Keeping in mind, I'm just at college, you know, so then they go and you know, dig burrows. Most standup comedian. Yeah. And I was on a show and he was probably the most famous radio guy in Detroit, so they hired me just because of that and put me with Dan. But Dan is the guy. How crazy. Danny. Yes. Danny. He's the guy who, and I've told it well, anyway, he's the one who got me into fighting.

Speaker 3:          02:18:52       Um, he was really in the boxing and stuff. So then what he did was he came to the radio station and he had like headgear cups, boxing gloves and says, you know, I'm friends with Jackie Colon, we're going to go to her place and we're going to, I want you to learn to box so I have somebody to spar with. So he bought me all my appointments. He bought me all my equipment, got me crazy coaches and goes, have friend. I'm going to tell you, I mean, she got a box so I have somebody to, and we're going to suffer every day from 12 to 12 to three. That's ridiculous. So long time to get good at boxing can just start sparring. Someone had been doing it forever. Yeah. So I, so I got to stuff and then, um, then me and Danny fought and I would never been more afraid of my entire life.

Speaker 3:          02:19:36       Like there's a thing about fighting. You can be a really good, you go to class, you're learning, but you have to have that thing in you that makes you want to kill people, which I've never had. I enjoyed fighting and I learned learning stuff, but I don't have that. There's that thing. Dan is a complete psycho. He completely has that thing and we'll kill you. Then that's when that shortly after, that's when he gave me a concussion. Hit me right in the back of the head, um, to people punching on you dude. Cross guard. That's right. To, to do cheat. So that's when we, so he hit me in the back of the head. I went home, the girl was dating at the time, comes to my apartment and goes, why'd you buy a VCR on my kitchen table from best buy out a VCR?

Speaker 3:          02:20:16       I'm like, I didn't buy a VCR. She's like, yeah, well who's is that ago? I Dunno, looked saw that the credit card receipt was my signature. But this was weird. This was in the 90s when people bought DVD players. So I actually went backwards in technology. Don't remember buying a VCR. She took me to the hospital and then the guy did the stand up on one foot thing and I fell over and he's like, what's a mat? So then, you know, I had a really weird duty not to backwards in a technological progress with, with a punch. He knocked you back to the visa and then after that he recruited me. We're friends. Why wasn't there anyone around to stop you from boxing him? I had no guidance. That's so sad. I had no guy. I wish I could've been your front of and no, no.

Speaker 3:          02:21:01       I had no guys don't do a chart and don't get, we need you here on earth. We need you for your brain. We need you to be funny. And we can't have people after that, Danny, you know, like me and stuff like that. Let Him Punch you and fire you and he's the best guy ever. Yeah. You just gotta go the big bit of a gauntlet and then it isn't doing, so you've got a show in Philly or something? Yeah, he's married. He's about to get married again. It was, he married, uh, I don't know. How do you know this? And there's somebody that knows somebody who knows somebody who's marrying him. Yeah. Really? Oh, tell me more. Very interesting. Yeah, he was dominating. Yeah. Interesting guy to get in a fight out of matchbox 20 concert. You really have in a work because that crowd is not necessarily violent Oz fest.

Speaker 3:          02:21:42       Yeah. Of 20. It's guys being forced to take the girls you've never seen man. Some emo do's get really pissed when they see the trick with another dude and they realize that they're crying isn't working. Sometimes they turn like temper tantrum ish. Right? Yeah. Well John had fun. Where are you next buddy? Tell people where to where they can cut you up. Towels or what? Well John ron.com. Right? Two F's W uh, John, uh, h e f f r o n.com and a Twitter schedule. And your Twitter is at John Heffron. Yeah. And John and I met a long time ago. We was doing the maximum comedy tour. You, me and Charlie Murphy and we've been pals ever since. There was a fun tour. Yeah. Wise there was a financial disaster for bud light and all the people put it together. If they did, the guy who was a promoter

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       didn't like no advertising. We just kind of showed up everywhere. The kids never did any radio. He didn't do any, you would expect to sell out, uh, uh, you know, 7,000 like you okay. Every show you've ever done when you go on a city sells out. Especially for me at that time, even go four years later I was selling out like crazy. But then so you would think and that just shows you that nobody knew about it. Nobody knew about. It was a miss my own friends that know about it and I didn't promote it very well on my own shit, on my website and everything. I thought they hadn't taken care of. I didn't think of how to think that. You're like, finally there's a tour with a lot of money behind it. They're going to put posters and they're going to do some stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:23:03       I didn't get it. The whole, uh, selling, you know, the, that promotion is actually a part of the job. I never thought of it that way. I always thought, oh, little take care of itself. Someone will take care of it. Right. You don't take care of it if you don't let people know about it. They actually get upset. They're like, what the fuck, dude? I didn't even know you had a show. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I started concentrating more on my message board and on my number, my message rather than my mailing list and Twitter and all that shit after that. Yeah. You know, it's not when someone else puts it together, it's not fun. But it was a fun gig. You know, we, we had a good time, man. I would love to do some mortgage like that with you. We should do some, some big travel points where you just have to know our acts are so different.

Speaker 2:          02:23:39       You know, we should do some, uh, some big gigs together. You know, where we, uh, you know, we made it, make our fans meet how we started. Yeah. I always thought of a cool thing where you would, um, you know how they have all these four leases places in every city you go to just, you can go to any mall or strip mall. There's buildings. We just to see the power of the Internet and go, we're in this city. We're doing it at the corner of this, you know, ran out one of those places for the day but not a normal comedy place. Like a restaurant that went out of business. Right and you get set up a sound system and then you go, we're going to show up and then you blast it to your network and see how many people show up in that one area.

Speaker 2:          02:24:17       That's an interesting idea. If you knew the venue in advance, you knew it was a at the pre and then you'd have to go and just see. It'd be kind of like a workspace comedy show, but I don't know. By the way I should mention this. What is the shit and we will be doing it soon is Kevin Smith's Mod castle in La. It is the Shit I did. Tom Green's podcasts from there. He does a live podcast with an audience. It's fucking fun as shit. I lost like half standup comedy half audience like we got to do on there with Joey. It's, it's incredible. What did they call it? Pod pod. Castle Smith Smog cast. Smith podcast and it's just like almost like a studio for people do podcasts. Like, you know what it's like, it's like one of those little tiny theaters where they teach acting classes. That's what it looks like. It's like one of those really small theaters. Seats may be 50 people and they have a stage and a microphone set up and a, you just give the dude and SD card. He slaps it in at the end of it. It's over. They, they, they sell tickets again in the ticket's paid for renting the place. That's 20 bucks, 20 bucks taken in an old school way. If you think of that, what's that Guy Camp Wogo

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       Wobegon that old school radio. Garrison Keillor. Yeah. Yeah. No, but, but you're thinking you're doing a live show in front of live people that's so old school. The way that they use, uh, Jimmy Pardot has got a podcast and they did a live show where they had people in the audience and it was just Webcam for 20. It was really, I did Carolla's podcast. Tony was, it was odd because Corola had it almost like a radio show, you know, one guy would, these guys would go out for 15 minutes and the next guys would go up for 15 minutes. You know, I think you know, and then you, you almost felt like I was doing standup. It was like real when I was doing stand up on stage with him. You know, we were just riffing and talking about shit. It's very strange. I think, um, the way we do it, it would be more interesting.

Speaker 3:          02:26:05       Like the way we do it where it's, you know, the, the, the whole podcast is just some long run on conversation with someone who's interesting and you do these, keep having guests come in. Yeah. New guests and you go to the crowd to you and you let the crowd ask questions, give them a microphone. You know, Tom Green went out to the crowd and then, you know, the crowd gets to throw questions at you and talk to Joe, who are you going to allow any of that nonsense? None of that silliness. Yeah. Those are the most people you got to do that. That would be awesome. Not The great thing about technology fees. I was playing UFC a whatever it is undisputed. Yeah. You know, from just kind of knowing you and some other stuff I've done. I've know a lot of fighters and it's funny, when I was in a tournament, every time I would come up against a fighter that I know I would take a picture of it and then I would tweet them.

Speaker 3:          02:26:52       So it's cool that you can have that much interaction. Now it could be playing a video game. Oh there's frank Trigg. I'm going to let Frank Trigg, Nolan bought the knock them out and then you sent him a video. Hey, here's what's going to happen to you. Hey, do you think that you could set it up so that we could try to do some sort of a cyber comedy club thing? Do you mean? If you know these Cisco people, great to hear is it's be someone who'd be into doing something like that were really into, because the cool thing is is that they were using me to show that it doesn't have to be stuffy, but here's another cool, well they also have the, I don't know what it's called. It's some home unit, but not the home unit. Look, I'm, I'm talking about, but you could do a home unit, but I'm talking about setting it up in a hotel somewhere where you sell tickets online.

Speaker 3:          02:27:35       The people come to the hotel. To be honest, I met so many hotels that I forgot which one is the one that, but I'm pretty sure it's like the Marriotts or some and what you do is you technically, how it works for businesses is you rent out that space and then somebody rents it out. Whatever. Dude, we should really sit down all we do shows over and talk about this because this could be a great way to do shows where you don't have to travel. You can do shirts at Cisco. I know that like we could go to there for this last one I did was hilarious. Right. And when I was in New York, I wait a minute. Stop. Where Cisco? Um, off of Santa Monica. Oh, it's in La. Oh yeah. The one of the buildings I've done in front. So they have like a studio there.

Speaker 3:          02:28:18       Uh, it's, it's, it's like huge. Imagine 500 cubicles for people to work, but nobody works there because everybody works at home. It's like their craziest place. You walk in, they all work at home. Yes. So it's all these empty desks, but it's a huge office building. And then they have a big conference room with this technology set up in there. Like, so they all use this video conferencing technology that no one goes to work. Yeah, no, nobody. So when I went there to secretary, let me in and I'm a pretty fucking dope. Yeah. And I was about to go to do my thing. Last time I did it, there were 30 people in the room with me. Right. So there was some energy there. Right. This time I show up on myself. I'm like, oh, there's going to be, there's nobody, right? One guy shows up, am your liaison.

Speaker 3:          02:29:01       So then we walked around the cubicles. I went to two guys I didn't know that are working and go, hey dude, I got to go in there and do stand up. You need to come in there with me so I'm not the only one. You need to sit next to me. And when I'm doing my material or talking, smile and laugh the entire like, I don't even know this guy. You waited in the waiting room so dull. So you, you went and grabbed people. I'd rather two guys and said go need to know. Not only did you grab them, you instructed them on how to enjoy our a diva, John. Yeah. You're a dealer. God Damn it. Well no, because now it's about the thing, cause I didn't want to be there and then have this guy sitting next to me just stare at him and he's not getting paid.

Speaker 3:          02:29:39       You're the one getting paid. Did it? And it was like a cool kind of would be hated your comedy. Yes, well that would suck. But there was a, two of the coolest guy podcast is like, we're doing this and for me there's a 1086 people tuned in right now while we're doing this. You're doing the same thing. You're doing standup for a thousand people right now. Yeah, it's the same. It was just cool. Let's go. But it was weird. It reminds me when I was, uh, doing a lot of colleges performing, you'd have to do these noon teasers where you'd go in at noon and the, in the student union, what, you never had to do these, so I, you'd have to go in. They would make you go. So you and Brian are studying. I would have to go up and go, hey guys, this is, keep my no TV credits though.

Speaker 3:          02:30:21       Nothing. Stop it. I would go, hey everybody, I'm John Hepburn on the comic. He'll be in you. I'll be in the Rathskeller, uh, tonight at eight. Go. And you'd have to do, you'd go around to the tables and this was part of your contract did to get people to show up at the show at nighttime. Stop that 100% I would do that constantly. Oh my God, I've never heard of them. This was back in the day when I was in my early twenties I would do 80 to 100 colleges a year. Oh my God. This is pre or post any amount of duty. This is a pre radio. So keep in mind, I'm 21 concussion to blame. No, no, 2122 so now it's funny. 20 some years later and $8 billion more for the show that I'm doing. I'm going around to random people going, hey guys, I'm going to be in this room. Can you come in? It's so funny how it goes in full circle and it's the same, but you're getting paid way more. That's hilarious. I really think that that could be a unique thing like [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:31:21       those guys are doing would be a real business, a cyber comedy. Well, here's what I thought that Simon and a strip club, so imagine going into a room gone. I was turned it. Bell came anyway. So, um, I'd like to see a girl in Bangkok and then Bam, you're in Bangkok. Well, I guess you could do that, but there's a lot of videos out there, dude. You are talking to them telling Webcam show there's Webcam shows and get them set up so we can do it. Well let's do it. Let's do a comedy club. I think, um, if we could set it up with a few hotels in a few different cities, you know, and banging out like fight only if it's online. Yeah. Cause he just need holds. It's like Nita certain promoter in each individual town and make sure that there's seating and then they have alcohol or whatever they have at the, at the show.

Speaker 2:          02:32:01       Because you do it at the hotel. There's a hotel bar. They can have some or don't come in. Yeah. And then they showed his wait staff there and have it take a cyber comedy club. We can, this is a great idea, dude. I've done it. And have I brought your video to see him? Oh, well we use the video. Yeah, you can't. Um, but dude, it's fun. People are people and it, right. But you're doing it all through the corporate network, whereas you have to be super squeaky clean. What I would want to do is use them and like maybe like get them to have it just be a, yeah. It's just whatever you feel like talking about. Yeah. I don't want to have to worry about being clean. I don't wanna have to worry about that. Well, we can't use your technology. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:32:37       No, this is, you're using our technology and they don't rent it out to whoever wants it. You could be talking about anything. We need to talk to them. We'll do it. Something has come out of this podcast, ladies and gentlemen, birth an idea. Make sure you're getting bad fruits. We do not know. We cannot know, but that's one of the beautiful things in life. Sometimes just you have ideas and those ideas create something. Cause the imagination manifest things in real life. The imagination seems like a frivolous thing, but without it we would have nothing. It is a real thing. It's a force. It's a force that makes ideas appear through the work of man. I tell you this, you look around whoever you're watching this look around your room, that you're in, everything you're looking at with somebody idea, mad truth, everything from everything was.
