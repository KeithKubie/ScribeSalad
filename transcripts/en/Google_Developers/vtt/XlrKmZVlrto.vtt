00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.080
Thanks, Dan.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.460
That was awesome.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.404
Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:13.570
My name is Nathan Camarillo.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.070
I'm a senior product manager
on the living room team.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.272
And today, I want to tell you
more about our technologies

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:21.230
and some of the great
improvements our team has

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.110
recently made to enable new
experiences in the living room.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.870
Our first product
was the Chromecast.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.280
And it was the top selling
streaming device, including

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.549
streaming boxes, in 2014.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.950
That momentum
continued into 2015,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.360
and we introduced a new Chrome
cast in Chromecast Audio.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.910
The new Chromecast
has better Wi-Fi,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.220
supporting both
2.4 and 5 gigahertz

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.910
Wi-Fi, a better physical design
for behind the TV connectivity,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.140
and upgrades our
Chromecast app to service

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.800
all the great content, apps,
and games that you love.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.950
We built a larger
ecosystem of devices

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.030
from televisions,
to set-top boxes,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.380
like the Razer Forge
TV and NVIDIA Shield,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.400
and audio devices powered
by Google Cast for audio.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.592
All of these products continue
to see tremendous success.

00:01:04.592 --> 00:01:06.550
We're always improving
the developer experience

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.460
by unlocking even more
opportunities to extend

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.590
your games to the living room.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.680
And televisions with
Android TV already built

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.900
in, like the Sony Bravia,
are proving very successful

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.710
and give you all the power
of the Android TV platform

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.580
with Google Cast built in.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.161
Simply put, Google is
already in the living room.

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:26.660
Come join us if you
haven't already.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.690
We're here and we'll continue
to be here in the future.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.050
So first, let's talk
about Google Cast.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.920
Google Cast is designed to
use your mobile experiences

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.180
to drive entertainment
experiences on your home

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.820
devices.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.030
People love using their
mobile devices and tablets

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.520
to find content quickly without
the cumbersome chore of setting

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.530
up all their accounts and
trying to find content

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.440
with a traditional
slow remote interface.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.190
And Chromecast is really easy.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.360
You just pick content using the
apps you already know and love,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.390
you tap the Cast button, and you
enjoy the content on your TV.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.470
A Google Cast game extends
this concept to gaming

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.130
and enables multi-screen game
playing between mobile devices

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.670
and television.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.880
People love games--
so much so that it's

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.740
the most popular category by far
of all apps in the app stores,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.202
but gaming on the TV is not
always that easy or cheap.

00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:15.785
You need a device
that's a few hundred

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.230
dollars, like a console, or you
have to buy a remote or game

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.739
controllers for every player.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.280
Wouldn't it be so
great if I can just

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.390
play any of the
mobile games I usually

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.290
play on my phone on the TV?

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.610
With Google Cast, you can.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.320
It leverages the
power of your phone

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.750
to render great gameplay on
your TV which just a $35 device,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.880
or you can cast it
to your Android TV.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.810
And we made it easy
for any mobile game

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.310
to get on the TV
with Google Cast.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.554
That's why we created the Remote
Display APIs for Google Cast.

00:02:42.554 --> 00:02:43.970
There's millions
of mobile devices

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.600
with powerful GPUs and
sensors ready to send

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.910
amazing interactive content to
the largest screen in the home.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.120
With the Remote Display
APIs for Google Cast,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.950
this is now possible.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.990
To make it extra simple, we
released a Unity remote display

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.810
plug-in in the fall.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.000
There is a Unity plug-in
sample to get you started,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.480
and you'll be
surprised how quickly

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.260
you can extend your existing
Unity game to the TV.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.760
With all of our
technologies, you'll

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.230
find online tutorial videos,
all the documentation you need,

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.450
code labs, and more.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.009
And if you enjoy developing
natively for Android,

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:16.550
there are lots of
endpoints out there

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.650
for you to reach
with Android TV.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.270
Android TV is scaling
rapidly with more partners

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.600
across many regions.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.230
That means more set-top
boxes, and more smart TVs

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.300
to run your great
gaming experiences.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.330
Android TV can power everything
from high end experiences,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.950
like Razer Forge TV and
NVIDIA Shield set-top boxes,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.100
creating a AAA immersive
gaming experiences,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.000
such as the upcoming
release of Borderlands:

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.956
The Prequel straight
from the console world

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:45.460
to profound opportunities to
do D-pad simple games with even

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.350
a larger reach cross
all end points.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.630
As mentioned earlier, since
every Android TV is also

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.830
a Google Cast end point,
there are many ways

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.560
to extend the gaming
experience into living rooms

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.080
all around the world.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.260
And what does this mean for
you as a game developer?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.730
Across all of our technologies,
when games and apps

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.560
are connected to the TV, we
see increased engagement,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.050
stronger monetization, and
because the living room is

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.700
inherently social,
multiplayer games that result

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.290
in more downloads for you.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.510
Because you can utilize
the reach of these devices,

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.384
all the power of the
platform, like payments,

00:04:15.384 --> 00:04:17.130
already exist for you.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.829
The party is just
getting started.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.529
And we're saving a
seat just for you.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.945
The living room will continue
to be a very exciting place,

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.850
and we'll be there with you.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.630
Thanks, everybody.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.470
And allow me to introduce Cliff,
who is going to speak next.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.970
Thanks.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.420
