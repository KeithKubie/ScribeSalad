00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.070
Alright so we've got states. So next is whats called

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.980
the model or the transition model. Sometimes people refer to

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.710
it as the transition function, and basically it is a

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.020
function of three variables. It's a state, an action, which

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.600
I haven't defined for you yet and another state. In

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.310
fact since I haven't defined what an action is for

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.020
you yet, let's skip that and actually do define actions

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.880
for you. So the third part of our model are actions.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.500
Actions are the things that you can do in a

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.050
particular state. So what would the actions be in this world?

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.180
&gt;&gt; Well the four different decisions I could make were the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.130
up, down, left and right. Though it's maybe a little confusing because

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.580
I think those were also the four possible outcomes. That's true.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.540
Well no, there are other outcomes. You could stay where you were.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.390
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.270
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.710
&gt;&gt; So these are actually the actions. These are the things that

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.890
when I'm in a given state I'm allowed to execute. I can

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.740
either go up, go down, go left or go right. You'll notice

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.640
that as I described before there was no option not to move. Mm.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.730
&gt;&gt; But there could have been, and there could

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.370
have been other actions, like teleport, or there's anything

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.090
that you can imagine. But the point is that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.100
your action set represents all of the things that the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.580
agent, the robot, the person, or whatever it is

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.150
you're trying to model, is allowed to do. Now, in

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.200
its full, generalized form, we can think of the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.910
set of actions that one can take as being a

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.640
function of state Because there's some stage you can do some

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.620
things and some stage you can't do those things. But most of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.330
the time people just treat it as a set of actions. And

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.640
the actions that aren't allowable in them particular states have no effect.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.640
Alright, so we understand states. They're the things that describe the world.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.310
We understand actions. Those are the things that you can do, the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.520
commands you can execute when your in particular states. And what a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.960
model describes, what the transition model describes is in some sense the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.880
rules of the game that you're playing. It's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.640
the physics of the world. So it's a function

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.080
of three variables: a state, an action and

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.290
another state, which, by the way, could actually be

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.620
the same state. And what this function produces

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.830
is the probability That you will end up transitioning

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.640
the state s prime, given that you were in

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.020
state s, and you took action a. Got it?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.300
&gt;&gt; I think so. so the s prime is where you end up, and the s, a is what

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.660
you're given. So it's, so you plug these three

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.845
in. Oh I see, and you get a probability Mm-hm.

00:02:14.845 --> 00:02:16.750
&gt;&gt; But the probabilities have to add up to one if

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.680
you if you sum it up over all the s primes.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.270
&gt;&gt; Right. That's exactly right. So for example if you think about the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.160
deterministic case where there was no noise then this is a very simple model. If

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.830
I'm in the state the start state. And I take the action up,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.840
then what's the probability, I end up in the state immediately above it?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.825
&gt;&gt; Was that a 0.08?

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:43.050
&gt;&gt; No, in the, in, when we first started in the deterministic world.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.960
&gt;&gt; Oh, that was probability one.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.680
&gt;&gt; Right, and what would be the probability, you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.340
ended up in the state to the right? Probability zero.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.620
&gt;&gt; Right. In fact, the probability that you end up at any of the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.840
other states is zero in the deterministic world. Now what about the case when

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.010
we were in the non-deterministic world where an action

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.080
would actually execute faithfully only 80% of the time. If

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.070
I'm in the start state and I go up, what's

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.260
the probability that I end up. In the state above.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.341
&gt;&gt; That was 0.8

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.770
&gt;&gt; Was the probability, I end up in the state to the right.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.780
&gt;&gt; That was 0.1.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.400
&gt;&gt; And, what was the probability I end up where I started.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.595
&gt;&gt; That was also 0.1.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:15.990
&gt;&gt; Right, and 0 everywhere else. And, that's just sort of the way

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.090
it works. So, the model really is an important thing. And the reason,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.660
it's important. Is it really does describe the rules of the game.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.930
It tells you what you, what will happen if you do something in

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.520
a particular place. It captures Everything that you know about the transition

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.410
u, of the world is what you know about the rules, got it?

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.920
&gt;&gt; You called it physics before?

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.200
&gt;&gt; I called it the physics of the world.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.160
&gt;&gt; Huh.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.000
&gt;&gt; These are the rules that don't change.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.540
&gt;&gt; But they're very different from real world physics.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.140
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, although they

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.860
don't have to be. I mean in some sense, you could argue

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.980
that a mark off decision process, what we described so far, these three

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.990
things In fact, do describe the universe, the states are, you know,

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.280
in the positions of all the atoms. The positions and velocities of all

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.370
the atoms in the universe. The transition miles as you do, take

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.150
certain positions in the world whatever they are how the state of the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.390
universe changes in response to that. And the actions or whatever those set

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.840
of actions could be. And it can be probabilistic or it's not probabilistic.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.460
&gt;&gt; It's definitely probabilistic. The transition

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.730
models are by their very definition probabilistic.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.430
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.
