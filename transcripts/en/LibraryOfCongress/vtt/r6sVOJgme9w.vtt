00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.970
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Good morning.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.590
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.900
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.240
I'm Carla Hayden,
Librarian of Congress.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.380
And today, we are commemorating

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.710
and celebrating two
important events.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.060
One hundred and fifty
five years ago today,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.200
President Abraham Lincoln
delivered the Gettysburg Address

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.300
in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.000
It was a very significant speech
and a very significant moment

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.330
in the history of this country.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.260
And today, we are memorializing
this historic speech

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.510
by having the copy
of the address

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.720
that President Lincoln
brought with him

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.670
to the battlefield that day.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.890
It's his reading copy.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.120
And it is on display for
today in the Great Hall.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.770
You can imagine that we
rarely, rarely take this item

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.360
out for public display
for conservation purposes.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.460
So we're eager to show you
this important document.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.910
To emphasize how rarely we take
it out and how important it is,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.620
you may notice that we have
the capital police here.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.740
So, enjoy looking at
it, and no sudden moves.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.350
Now, and also today, the Library

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.880
of Congress is launching
a brand new initiative

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.900
that we are calling
By the People.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.750
And it's a major crowdsourcing
project that we're hoping all

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.200
of you everywhere will help
us with, transcribing tens

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.360
of thousands of the
Library's collection online.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.790
And we need your help.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.620
In particular, transcribing

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.720
over 20,000 letters
to Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.220
And that's why it's
By the People.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.980
So today, you may have noticed,
we have computers set up here

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.610
in the Great Hall to give
everyone a hands on experience

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.060
to dissect and transcribe
histories.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.830
The Lincoln Letters will be
one of several collections

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.230
that you can help us transcribe.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.610
We also will have
papers available

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.850
from Civil War soldiers.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.270
The scouting reports of
baseball scout Branch Rickey,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.760
who wrote about Henry
Aaron and Ernie Banks.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.450
The papers, a Red Cross
founder, Clara Barton,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.630
and of the Civil Rights
activist, Mary Church Terrell.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.180
Now, we are live streaming
this morning's program

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.870
to encourage students like
the ones that are right here,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.650
so we hope that you will be
the first on the computers.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.790
That's why I asked you
to take your coats off.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.050
To go public coast to coast.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.590
And it's very easy.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.100
Go to loc.gov and
start transcribing.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.240
So, joining us today
are students

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.810
from several D.C. area schools.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.470
And I know they want to
see the Gettysburg Address,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.940
but also to help us record
and understand these letters.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.720
So, would you give a shout
out when I call your school?

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.510
The Richard Wright Public
Charter High School.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.230
[ Applause ]

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.670
Students from the Washington
Global Public Charter

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.510
Middle School.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.710
[ Applause ]

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.210
Students from the Capitol Hill
Montessori Logan Middle School.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.500
[ Applause ]

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.170
Now, and all of you
students here, please join us

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.300
in giving a really big
Washington shout out to students

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.690
from my home state,
Illinois, the Land of Lincoln.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.700
Students from the Iles Middle
School in Springfield, Illinois.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.510
Yay!

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.080
[ Applause ]

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.820
The students in Springfield,
Illinois, you should know,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.480
and I spent summers
there every summer,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.680
and they go to Lincoln's home,
they know all about Lincoln,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.380
and so we're so glad that
they will be part of this.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.740
So last month when the Library
launched a new strategic plan,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.920
we wanted to make sure that
people, wherever they are,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.250
could connect with the
Library of Congress.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.870
And so I'd like to
introduce you to one

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.140
of the Library's most eminent

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.730
and celebrated experts
on history.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.670
I can't think of a better person

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.940
to help us celebrate
President Lincoln

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.250
and the Gettysburg
Address than the person

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.450
who also helped historian Doris
Kearns Goodwin on the Team

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.510
of Rivals, our own
Michelle Krowl.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:11.290
[ Applause ]

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.590
&gt;&gt; Michelle Krowl:
Wow, what a welcome.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.890
After that, I was
wondering, wow,

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.150
who is that eminent
historian who's coming today?

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.630
For the next few minutes, it is
my privilege to provide a bit

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.610
of background and context

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.280
to Abraham Lincoln's
Gettysburg Address,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.790
delivered 155 years ago today.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.380
And it is altogether
fitting and proper

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.760
that we should be honoring
the Gettysburg Address

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.670
in this particular room, as the
mosaic above the doors leading

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.390
into the main reading
room include a quote

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.690
from the address.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.290
Government of the people, by
the people, for the people.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.320
So after we've done
this, you can turn around

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.570
and just look right behind you,
and that mosaic the woman has

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.360
in her lap that phrase.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.360
It is July, 1863.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.490
A tremendous battle
has just taken place in

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.910
and around the small
town of Gettysburg

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.460
in southern Pennsylvania.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.520
The inhabitants of the town
number about 2,400 residents.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.900
But during the three days
between July 1st and 3rd,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.830
nearly 160,000 Union

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.620
and Confederate troops
fought on the nearby fields.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.720
Fifty one thousand of
those men were casualties.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.500
And of those, between 7

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.190
to 10,000 were killed
or mortally wounded.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.340
Since both armies still relied
on animals to transport men

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.280
and material, 5,000 horses lay
dead on the battlefield as well.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.640
And it was July, which
meant summer heat.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.980
Something had to be
done immediately.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.290
The fallen horses were
largely consumed by fire.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.420
And unless taken home by loved
ones who travel to Gettysburg

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.170
to claim their soldiers, the
fallen men were hastily buried

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.560
on or near the battlefield.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.690
That summer, talk in the
overwhelmed town turned

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.250
to creating a national
cemetery to reenter the bodies

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.810
of the Union soldiers
who died at Gettysburg.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.110
Governor Andrew Curtin

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.940
of Pennsylvania appointed
Gettysburg lawyer David Wills

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.280
to lead a commission to
establish a new cemetery.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.490
He approached the states whose
soldiers had fought and died

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.160
in the battle of Gettysburg

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.250
to contribute funds towards
the cost of purchasing

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.380
and improving land for a
cemetery and reentering the dead

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.880
from their temporary graves.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.090
With financial pledges from
the participating states,

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.230
the commission purchased
17 acres adjacent

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.820
to the private Evergreen
Cemetery on the Cemetery Hill

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.140
that had seen so much action
during the battle in January.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.960
Landscape architect William
Saunders designed the new

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.520
cemetery, which would ultimately
hold about 3,500 Union dead.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.980
A memorial would anchor
the site and be surrounded

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.270
in semi circles by the graves
of the fallen Union soldiers.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.610
He arranged the dead by state,
although the largest group

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.320
of the burials would
be the unknowns,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.200
their identities
lost to history.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.440
The rank of the soldier,
or his position

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.690
in life, made no difference.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.710
All the gravesites and
markers were the same.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.310
All were created equal.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.880
Wills and the commission began
planning a dedication ceremony,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.460
which required a
speaker of significance

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.600
and national prominence.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.900
And if you think this is

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.610
where Abraham Lincoln enters
the story, you would be wrong.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.210
The commission wanted Edward
Everett, who after a long

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.840
and distinguished career in
education and public service,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.100
was one of the most
respected orators of the day.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.750
Wills invited Everett to speak
at the dedication ceremony,

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.130
which was then set
for October 23rd.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.450
But Everett was known for
long, carefully crafted,

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.180
and well researched
addresses, which he committed

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.660
to memory before delivering.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.340
He couldn't possibly be
ready before November 19th.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.370
So to accommodate
their star attraction

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.540
at the event, November
19th it was.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.040
That's why we're celebrating
the Gettysburg Address today,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.260
because of Edward Everett.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.580
It is not clear when Abraham
Lincoln was first approached

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.310
about participating
in the dedication.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.740
It might have been
as early as August,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.810
with an informal word
from Governor Curtin.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.760
The official request did
not come until November 2nd,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.980
however, when David Wills wrote
Lincoln a short letter asking

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.880
him to deliver a few appropriate
remarks at the ceremony.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.720
Just a few appropriate remarks.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.060
Although busy preparing his
annual report to Congress,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.090
and concerned about leaving
Washington while his young son

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.910
Tad was ill, Lincoln
agreed to participate.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.300
The opportunity to honor the
Gettysburg dead and speak

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.140
to the nation about the
war outweighed his pressing

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.660
obligations at the White House.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.360
Lincoln and his traveling party,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.530
which included three
Cabinet secretaries

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.690
and several foreign dignitaries,
arrived in Gettysburg

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.350
by train on November 18th.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.990
The next morning, the 19th,
the president and secretary

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.880
of state, William Seward,
visiting a battlefield,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.550
an experience which exerted
a profound effect on Lincoln,

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.780
and one that may have
altered the course

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.370
of his address that afternoon.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.660
Always reluctant to speak
extemporaneously, particularly

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.590
on important occasions, Lincoln
likely drafted his remarks

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.940
in Washington and carried the
document with him to Gettysburg.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.300
The earliest known copy

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.480
of the Gettysburg Address is now
referred to as the Nicolay copy,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.950
which we have on display
today in the Great Hall

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.510
of the Library of Congress.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.160
And it's covered right now,
but you'll be able to see

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.770
if in just a little while.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.590
If you're joining us remotely,
you can view the document online

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.910
in our online Abraham
Lincoln papers.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.120
You will see that the first
page is written in pen

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.810
on Executive Mansion stationary.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.060
But the second page is
written in pencil on a piece

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.000
of lined Foolscap paper,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.120
equivalent to our
legal size paper today.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.960
And at the bottom of the first
page in pencil are corrections

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.450
to form a somewhat
awkward textual bridge

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.470
between the two pages.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.320
So, why the difference in the
paper and the writing medium?

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.790
Based on eyewitness accounts
and the document itself,

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.590
some historians speculate
that Lincoln's morning visit

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.690
to the battlefield inspired him

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.470
to alter the ending
of his address.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.700
The portion in pen, written in
Washington, remained the same.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.780
To change the ending,
Lincoln used the paper supply

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.770
and writing implement at hand,

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.620
a piece of torn Foolscap
and a pencil.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.080
With a modified, but essentially
completed speech in hand,

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.810
Lincoln set off for the cemetery
about 10:00 in the morning.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.430
The ceremony began at noon,

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.600
with appropriate music
and an invocation.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.830
Edward Everett began reciting
his Gettysburg Address

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.170
soon after.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.440
After harkening back to the days
of ancient Greece for precedence

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.140
for the occasion, Everett spend
the first hour narrating the

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.350
Battle of Gettysburg, only
five months in the past.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.890
Then he argued against the
Rite of Succession claimed

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.750
by the Confederates, and mused

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.100
on an eventual reconciliation
of the two sides.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:24.980
After almost two hours, Everett
Edwards' 13,000 word address

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.510
came to an end.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.860
Remember those numbers.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.970
President Lincoln followed
Everett at about 2:00 p.m.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.900
and spoke approximately
272 words

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.790
that took roughly two
minutes to deliver.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.090
Lincoln's role was only

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.070
to deliver a few
appropriate remarks.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.760
And he consciously
kept his address brief.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.960
But how significant
those few words were.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.260
The speech itself progressed

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.620
through a three part
construction;

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.550
past, present and future.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.400
Lincoln began by
invoking the past.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.030
Four score and seven years
ago, our fathers brought forth,

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.270
upon this continent, a new
nation, conceived in liberty,

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:11.040
and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.570
Although he respected the
rule of law established

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.620
in the U.S. Constitution,

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.120
President Lincoln revered
the ideals expressed

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.500
in the Declaration
of Independence.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.100
Lincoln returned to the
declaration again and again

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.990
in his speeches and writings,
and firmly established

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.140
in the Gettysburg Address
that ideals of liberty

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.840
and equality formed the heart

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:36.500
of the national experiment
begun 87 years earlier in 1776.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.060
So four score and
seven equals 87.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.810
Lincoln then moved
to the present.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.160
Now we are engaged in a great
Civil War, testing whether

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.200
that nation, or any
nation, so conceived

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.110
and so dedicated
can long endure.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.770
Unlike Everett's long oration
on the Battle of Gettysburg,

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.630
Lincoln only referred in
passing to the battle,

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.790
noting that quote, "we are
met on a great battlefield

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.830
of that war for the purpose of
dedicating a cemetery to the men

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.540
who died, so," quote, "that
the nation might live."

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.800
He concluded with a
projection into the future.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.580
The dead had already
consecrated the ground

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.460
with the blood and deeds.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.050
Rather, it was up to the
living to honor that sacrifice

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.130
by dedicating themselves,
quote, "to the cause

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.540
for which they here gave the
last full measure of devotion."

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.960
The cause, as Lincoln saw
it, was quote, "a new birth

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.530
of freedom for the nation and
a determination that," quote,

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.520
"government of the people, by
the people, for the people,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.540
shall not perish
from the Earth."

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.490
The war was a fight to save
the Democratic experiment

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.300
of self government that
the founders conceived,

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.150
and be reborn with a new
dedication to freedom.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.880
What a new birth of freedom
entailed could be interpreted

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.880
in many ways.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.290
Freedom from bondage for
the emancipated slaves,

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.710
freedom for the nation from
the institution of slavery,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.060
freedom for the union to
march, to march toward progress

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.550
after having survived
the test of Civil War.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.640
And beyond national borders,
a new birth of freedom

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.340
in America could inspire
other Democratic experiments

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.870
around the world.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.450
In December, 1862, Lincoln
referred to the union

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.520
as the last best hope
on Earth, of Earth.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.220
And that still held
true in 1863.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.040
But the nation needed reminding
of that larger context.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.040
The war was in its third
year in November, 1863.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.490
And with no end in sight,
war weariness and doubts

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.410
about the war had set in.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.660
Emancipation remained
unpopular in much of the north.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.410
In fact, just a week after
the Battle of Gettysburg,

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.160
destructive draft
riots against the war

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.020
and emancipation
ignited in New York City.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.270
With his words at Gettysburg,
Lincoln reminded the country

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.330
of the principles for which
the soldiers fought and died.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.120
And how did Americans respond?

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.070
I know this will be hard
to imagine, but newspapers

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.870
and media openly aligned with
one political party or another.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.330
An editorial opinion largely
followed the party line.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.710
The Springfield Republican

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.640
in Massachusetts thought his
little speech is a perfect gem.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.990
The Patriot and Union in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.710
on the other hand,
called the text

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.540
of the address silly remarks.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.830
And that, quote, "the veil
of oblivion shall be dropped

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.210
over them, and that they
shall be no more reposted

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.890
or thought of."

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.280
Well, the Patriot later
issued a retraction

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.490
to that editorial,
however, in 2013.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.210
Better late than never.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.540
But the renowned
orator for whom the date

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.780
of the ceremony had been changed
immediately recognized the

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.470
significance of Lincoln's
few appropriate remarks.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.280
The next day, Edward Everett
wrote to Lincoln with praise.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.840
"I should be glad if I could
flatter myself that I came

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.810
as near to the central idea
of the occasion in two hours

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.010
as you did in two minutes."

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.020
I think most of us would
agree with Everett Edwards',

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.310
Edward Everett's assessment.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.460
Today, of course, the
Gettysburg Address is one

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.580
of the most admired speeches
in the English language.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.710
The phrases four score and
seven years ago, little note,

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.580
nor long remember,
altogether fitting and proper,

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.830
a new birth of freedom, the
last full measure of devotion,

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.660
and of the people,
by the people,

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.390
for the people are
instantly recognizable.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.290
But you might be
surprised to learn that even

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.090
for such an iconic, there are
still many questions we cannot

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.680
definitively answer, due to
absent or conflicting evidence.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.580
As a Lincoln scholar once wrote,
touch any aspect of the address,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.050
and you touch a mystery.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.950
For example, presuming
there was a second sheet

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.220
on Executive Mansion stationary

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.330
in that original
draft, what did it say?

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.750
We don't know.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.400
How different would that
first ending have been?

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.070
We don't know.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.080
Did Lincoln read the
address on stage?

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.730
Did he memorize it?

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.470
Or both? Conflicting evidence.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.240
Was the addition of
the phrase under God,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.610
as recorded in the newspapers,
an improvised addition

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.310
at the time, or was there yet
another manuscript provided

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:41.230
to reporters on the scene
that contained that phrase?

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.550
Did the audience applaud
during the speech,

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.600
as some newspaper
accounts record?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.210
Or did they remain
respectfully silent throughout?

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.650
It's important to remember
that on November 19th, 1863,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.760
the audience didn't
know they were listening

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.110
to a two minute address
that would become one

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.470
of the world's most treasured
texts, and would be the subject

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:06.060
of fascination and study
for generations to come.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.860
What we do know for certain
is that words contained

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.370
in historic documents
have power.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.020
They have the power to
inform us, entertain us,

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.270
enrage us, inspire us.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:22.340
They tell us who we have been
in the past, how we became

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:27.350
who we are in the present, and
who we could be in the future.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.970
They are worth preserving and
exploring so that the history

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.840
of the people, by the people,

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.820
for the people shall not
perish from the Earth.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.340
And now to read the
text of the Nicolay copy

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.840
of the Gettysburg Address
is Christian Melgar.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.430
Currently a senior at Rockville
High School in Rockville,

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.190
Maryland, Christian is enrolled

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.180
in the International
Baccalaureate Program

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.480
at his school.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.620
He plans to attend college
where he will major either

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.000
in early childhood education,
or proceed with a bachelor's

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.870
of science in biology.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.920
Or hopefully maybe do
both at some point.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.250
He has been acting
in his school plays

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.420
and musicals for six years.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.530
On top of living a normal
teenaged life, he has a job

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.090
at the Barrie School
in Maryland,

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.970
where he is a camp counselor,
and an extended day employee.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.740
When Christian isn't working
with children or at school,

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.700
he enjoys going on nature walks

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.320
with his two adorable
little nieces.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.410
Christian has always
valued education,

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.760
and has taken advantage of
it, much like Abraham Lincoln,

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.370
whose stirring words
Christian will now read.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.510
So please welcome
Christian Melgar.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:41.360
[ Applause ]

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.720
&gt;&gt; Christian Melgar: I'd first
like to welcome, or thank,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.470
the Library of Congress.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.160
It's an honor and both a
pleasure to have invited me.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.510
Four score and seven years
ago, our fathers brought forth,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:59.470
upon this continent, a new
nation, conceived in liberty,

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.850
and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.750
Now we are engaged in a great
civil war, testing whether

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:14.200
that nation, or any nation so
conceived, can long endure.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.310
We are met on a great
battlefield of that war,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.950
and we have come to
dedicate a portion of it,

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.490
as a final resting place
to those who died here,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.820
and that the nation might live.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.330
This we may, in all
propriety, do.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.070
But, in a larger sense,

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.480
we cannot dedicate
we cannot consecrate,

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.790
we cannot hallow this ground.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.180
The brave men, living and
dead, who struggled here,

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.780
have hallowed it, far above our
poor power to add or detract.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:50.150
The world will little note, nor
long remember what we say here;

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.320
while it can remember
what they did here.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.770
It is rather for us, the
living, to stand here,

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.890
we here be dedicated to the
great task remaining before us,

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:05.240
that from these honored dead,
we take increased devotion

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.830
to that cause in which they
here gave the last full measure

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:14.090
of devotion, that we here highly
resolve these dead shall not

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.440
have died in vain; that the
nation shall have a new birth

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.100
of freedom, and that the
government of the people,

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:28.190
by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.990
Thank you.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:40.010
[ Applause ]

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.310
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter:
Hi, everyone.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.610
My name is Meghan Ferriter.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:43.910
I know that you are
really anxious

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.540
to see the Gettysburg
Address draft,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.120
and also to start transcribing.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.650
And thank you for
being here today.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.240
I just want to share a few
details about our program,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.850
why we're taking this approach,

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.130
and also what's going
to happen today.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.320
So, you've just learned
about the Nicolay copy

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.090
of the Gettysburg Address,
and other documents.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.400
But did you know the Library of
Congress holds letters, diaries,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.420
reports, and many other
materials, as well?

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.720
Well, it's true.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.020
It's a variable treasure trove.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.400
And if you get the
opportunity to see them,

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.520
you should always
take the opportunity.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.070
Today, we are working together
to complete transcriptions

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.430
of letters that people wrote

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.220
to Abraham Lincoln
during his career.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.070
And when we say work
together, we mean we're going

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.160
to work together in this
room, but also people who are

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.890
around the country, and
possibly around the world.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.660
If we work together to do
this, we can join Dr. Hayden

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.960
and the Library of Congress

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.960
to make these treasures
more accessible, readable,

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.800
and legible to many
different audiences.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.550
So whether that is our
people who are visiting

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.410
for the first time online,
or they're doing research,

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:47.080
or they're just a little bit
curious and want to learn more.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.630
So, as you know, we've
already shared some

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.930
of these versions online.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.230
For example, Michelle mentioned

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.110
that the Nicolay copy is
visible online already.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.740
But some of these documents
are not keyword searchable.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.220
So that would mean you would
have to come find a page

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.520
and read through
the entire thing

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.890
to find what you're looking for.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.350
So what we're trying to do is
create transcriptions or text

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:09.010
that lets these things
be keyword searchable.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.410
So, that's a little
bit of the why.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.710
Let's talk about the how.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.540
So, today, if you're
with us in person,

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.030
we're going to take a couple
of different approaches.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.610
So if you're one of the
student groups who's with us,

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.310
we're going to move you
through some stations.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.480
There are also other stations
that are available for those

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.590
of you who are visiting
today and are not

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.090
with a student group, to try
your hand at transcribing.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.750
We have also some
handwriting activities

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.490
that are a little bit
further back here.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.800
So really quickly, if you're
watching on the live stream,

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.250
or even if you're
here in person,

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.560
here are the ways you're
going to get started.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.830
The first thing you can do
is look on the home page

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.500
and click the blue Let's
Go button, which is going

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.920
to take you to a page
that needs some help.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.170
You can also find a project
by clicking on campaigns

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.470
and selecting a project.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.580
We're recommending that
you start in the years,

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.710
in the Letter to
Lincoln's campaign,

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:58.360
and also in the years
1860, 1861, and 1862.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.850
So once you're in a letter,
you're going to see an image

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.980
of the letter on the left
hand side of the page,

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.310
and a transcription field
on the right hand side.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.700
And you can zoom in on the
image, you can turn it,

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.930
you can drag the screen
so you can see the letter

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.230
on a little bit more largely.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.620
And then you'll begin
typing in the field

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.990
on the right hand side.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.970
There are also quick tips
to help you get started.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.770
And we have a really
robust help center,

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.580
and we would love your feedback
to make that even better.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:27.390
So, a few last tips to
help you get started.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:28.690
One thing to keep in mind is

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.250
that we have thousands
of pages available.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.550
So there's something
for everyone.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.290
If you find a page that looks
too challenging or complicated,

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.560
or you just really think
that there's a better story

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.860
on the next page, that's fine.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.910
You can find a new
page and get started.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.330
We recommend that you try
reading a letter first.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.490
Sometimes by reading,
you can get a sense

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:46.790
of what handwriting was like

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.630
and how people corresponded
in the 19th century.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.910
You can find directions
in the help center.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.910
You can use the help tab
that's at the top of each page.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.670
You also, if you're ready
to start transcribing,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:01.070
can take it slowly and read the
words that are on either side.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.440
And sometimes the context

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.860
of words helps make
things make more sense.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.160
Excuse me.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.820
Another thing that we're
asking is have fun.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.120
It's not a test.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.490
So if you have some questions,

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.030
you want to find
some information,

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.330
or you're not really sure,

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.100
you can ask anybody
else who's around you.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.840
If you are online and you're
watching, you can share

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.170
on Twitter or on History Hub.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:24.300
We also want you to
contribute as much

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.650
as you or as little as like.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.080
So if you have only done a few
words, you can save that page

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.300
and send it on for
someone else to work on.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.600
So, one last pro tip.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.900
You can transcribe
without an account.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.150
If you're at any of the stations
today, we've logged you in,

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.280
so you can try tagging as well.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.420
And we want to say thank
you for being here.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.510
And if you're watching
from afar, you can join

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:43.930
in on Twitter or on History Hub.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:48.660
You can send questions to
at crowd underscore loc.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.530
Or send us an e mail at
crowd dot loc dot gov.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.010
We'd love to hear more
about what you learn

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.510
and what you think about
this program By the People.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.090
And you can also find it
at crowd dot loc dot gov.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.880
My colleagues and I
are here to help you,

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.410
and we're really looking forward
to spending time with you today.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.460
But right now, I'd
like to ask Dr. Hayden

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.820
to share something
very special with you.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.270
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Thank you, Meghan.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.900
Thank you, Meghan.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.890
I'm eager to jump on
one of those computers.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.520
I have my glasses.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.170
For those of you
of a certain age,

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.500
you know that's what we need to.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.250
And before we do that, and
I'm going to have Meghan

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.670
and Christian and
Michelle join me

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.600
to present the Gettysburg
Address to you of great reveal.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.010
I want you to think
about the fact, though,

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.790
that what you're doing,

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:39.060
in helping us transcribe
these letters,

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:45.120
is bringing to life the letters
and the thoughts of people

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:52.000
from decades and centuries
ago, people from 1860 that felt

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.150
so strongly that they wanted

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.600
to write letters
to Abraham Lincoln.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.080
And what you're doing, and
what you can help us do,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.760
is bring those thoughts
to life in this age.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.060
So, thank you.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.530
Thank you for doing that.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:13.180
So, now, I think we're
going to pull the cover off.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.190
And if the young
people could help us,

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.510
we're going to count down.
