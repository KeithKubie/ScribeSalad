00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.450
Spaceflight does a number on our bodies — we
lose muscle mass and density, fluids shift

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.050
in strange ways, there’s even evidence that
radiation exposure in space increases risk

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.100
of developing Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.610
And now new research has revealed that long-term
missions expand brain tissue with some scary

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.610
results.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.260
I’m never going to get to go to Mars.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.730
In all the research done on how spaceflight
affects the body, there’s been fairly little

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.140
done on the brain, specifically brain tissue
and the cerebrospinal fluid space.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.020
But that’s not because astronauts don’t
show signs of some kind of brain changes when

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.100
they return from a stint on the International
Space Station.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.290
Many exhibit symptoms of an ill-understood
condition called "visual impairment intracranial

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.890
pressure” syndrome (VIIP) — they report
poorer vision upon landing that can last for

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.840
years, and physicals show some of the cause
is swelling of the eye's optic disk as well

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.010
as increased pressure in the skull.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.480
So, a team of set out to study these changes
before they happen.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.180
They used MRIs to look at astronauts’ brains
before and after long and short duration missions

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.569
— 165 days on average for long and 13 days
on average short flights.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:13.329
Physicians then read the scans looking for
displacement of brain tissue and narrowing

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.610
of cerebrospinal fluid spaces — that’s
the space where the spinal fluid roots in

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.610
the brain.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.369
One point of interest was the central sulcus,
a cleft running through the middle of the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.229
brain that divides the areas responsible for
motor control and sensory input.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.709
They found the central sulcus narrowed in
almost all cases of long duration missions

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.840
but very few on short flights.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.409
Also after long missions, scans showed an
upward shift of the brain tissue against the

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.869
top of the skull as well as a narrowing in
the space for the spinal fluid.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.729
In the short term comparisons, only one astronaut
showed narrowing in the space for the spinal

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.039
fluid in the brain.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.779
It’s not entirely surprising that something
like this happens.

00:01:55.779 --> 00:02:00.380
Our bodies are adapted for the gravity field
on Earth, and when you take that away our

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.499
systems keep working with some odd effects.

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:08.369
But all this might sound worse than it is…This
is a classic case of “more research is needed.”

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.290
For the moment scientists aren’t sure what
this narrowing means, whether or not it actually

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.019
has an impact on the flow of spinal fluid
or puts more pressure on brain tissue.

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.170
It’s one of many studies NASA is conducting
about how space affects the brain, including

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.219
impacts on motor control and multi-tasking
abilities.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.440
If we’re going to send astronauts to Mars,
we’re going to need to make sure they get

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.299
there with healthy brains.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.580

big space danger -- radiation -- does, Amy's

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.120
And speaking of heads in space, Apollo astronauts
saw flashes in their eyeballs!

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.840
They were cosmic rays. That's so cool.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.580
Again, Thanks for watching.
