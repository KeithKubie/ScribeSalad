There's all these rich people, you know, there's all these beautiful fucking, you know, I don't know what, you know, walking around, God knows how old they are. They really getting good with the plastic surgery meant they really, really get fucking, I was still with some amazing old looking women walking around, you know, where in forever 21 shit that they bought it, you know, I don't know one of those stores up and down the block.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       Right. So we're walking around, you know, it's fucking hilarious. Every restaurant was like closed over there. They're like, fuck the dads. He like five food trucks. Even over there. They're like, Yay. It's the daddy doesn't give a shit. Show him a couple of fucking Babel shown the Lincoln from entourage, which they had over there, which was fucking coolest shit. One of the great cars out there, the Lincoln continental suicide doors and all that. I'm not a convertible guy, but you know, it worked for the show, the overhead shot, iconic shot at this point. Uh, they had the Eleanor car from gone in 60 seconds, but I liked, I like all, I always liked the weird shit. Um, I saw like a 19, what the fuck was only had 1961 62 or 63 Mercedes Benz, limousine and I, everything that was there, there was a Tucker there, there was a fucking one of those mid feeling of 55, uh, Mercedes gullwing, you know, bunch of Ferrari's Lamborghini's, you know, they have those weird years in the 70s.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       Those ones, uh, Adam Carolla has a lot of them. I don't mean weird like that. Not good look and it's just like, you know, I always saw him as the racing car and then to me it was for me, I just felt it went right to magnum Pi and it wasn't until I did Carolla's podcast back in the day when I saw the Lamborghinis and Ferraris and I was just like one of these, he was like, oh, this is it. This one, this is that one from like the, like the late 67, seven. Now their coolest shit. He was ahead of the curve by the way. Um, I was watching a local, a newscast out here and um, Adam Korea's a free plug here. Adam Corolla was on and he was promoting, he's got a, he's got a documentary on the 24 hours of Le Mans in the 1950s when Ford decided that they were going to guess compete and see what they could do over there.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       And uh, they came out with the Ford Gt. He's got this great, I can getting rave reviews and he has another documentary that he already put out about the racing life of Paul Newman. And if you go to his website, I believe it's chassis.com something, if you just put an Adam Corolla Le Mans, it's going to come up. And uh, what I love is all I could find on the website was just the DVD, which is great for me as an old man. I don't like that fucking, hey, you downloaded and then it's in the air and somehow it's on my computer. And then I dumped some orange juice on the keyboard and then I don't own it anymore. I like the DVD. I'm gonna I, I'm an old man. I like the DVD that's like having the gold behind your money. So had I known about this, I would have asked for both of those for a father's day.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       So instead I'm just going to buy it myself. So anyways, I fucking go over there and they got this Mercedes Benz like 1960160260 three some in their early sixties. And it's a a, it's a limousine. It's fucking black. It's got this, uh, I took a video. I know, I always say I'm going to post it. Then I always forget that I say I'm going to do it, but I'm going to try to remember here had this beautiful red interior and um, it was just, I was like that, that right. That's what the fuck is he? The older I get, as much as I enjoy driving, I don't enjoy driving in La because the traffic is just fucking insane. And my wife, my laugh, she, Uber's all the time. So I'm getting used to this jumping in a car and somebody else is driving. You know, when I go out with her and um, I get all this business done, be it breaking people's balls back on some texts, you know, call it back fucking Joe to Rosa is some shit better.

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       Call Saul's Joe to Rosa for your consideration is the fucking veterinarian on that wonderful show. Um, turn, email calls, business shit, all of that. And uh, you know, you always read about these, these fucking people out here, the, these moguls like the Ryan Seacrest's out here, they don't fucking drive. They have a drive around. They sit in the back and they get shit done. They pull the curtain right and they just backed there. They got like the Janet Jackson headset on. They're fucking firing off emails that buying stocks. I don't know what they're doing back there. I'm not a mogul. It's like they're going to tell you fucking tell someone how to be a mogul. Then everybody's a mogul in the way you, you just sort of, you're just a regular guy. Next thing you know, you've stopped at a red light. You looking over, you look, is that Ryan Seacrest driving his own fucking car? What happened that this guy had 17 fucking TV shows? Um, anyways, I,

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       I could really get into that to be honest with you. But who's kidding who, I'm not a mogul. I, I'm just fucking lazy and I don't know, I think that there's this two types of people as they get older. This is a person that just, you know, takes up cycling in rock climbing and they take like a fucking glass blowing class or some shit, you know? And then there's other people being like, you know, and I, I fucking tired man. You know, I, I'd like to chill if I get another 49 years or whatever, I get, you know, I'm on the back nine. Who's kidding who 49 times two is 98. I want to make a hundred stay in positive or who's can do all right, feel like I'm on the 12th hole. Um, it'll fuck wants to drive in La. It's fucking horrible. I would actually thoroughly enjoy it and I would just, if you had that kind of loop, you free do an old fucking beautiful car like that. You restore it, you bring it back to life, and then you just in the back, you know, you got, you got, you know, you've got a little humor door, some fucking cigars, you know, couple of your favorite little fucking accoutrements being the booze there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       Then you just fuck or whatever. You just drive around.

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       Well,

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       whatever your driver's name is, you still call him James. Every fucking, every a chauffeur was always named that when, that'd be great. You want to go to the movies? You know, I drink too much already, man. There's no way I can, I can handle always having a designated driver. I began fucking stupid going to the supermarket. Um, speaking of which Billy, no fun. Oh Jesus. Jesus Christ was seven days in seven fucking days. And last night I had a couple glasses of wine. We went out with another couple. What am I supposed to do? Everybody at, Oh, I'm having an Italian meal. I'm not supposed to have a little Barolo. Come on, come on. What am I supposed to, I had a couple of those, you know, and I, I don't even fucking like mine. It just, it's just, it's always reminding you of the hangover. It's going to give you, turned your teeth gray.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       Um, but I actually enjoyed, that's the one wine that I like. I really enjoyed it last night and um, I was actually gonna order a whiskey, but uh, uh, I almost said the referee, the waiter forgot to come back and asked me. At that point I was just like, fuck this, I'm just going to stay with the wine. And then tonight my family took me out for father's day and I had one whiskey and I, Oh man, I got fucking good one. Right. I got a really good 28 years old. And then I went outside to return a phone call and I had set the glass down. I came back and, uh, one of my red learners had bumped the table and said they knocked a little bit out and I didn't think there was that much. And then I looked down on those as big puddle of it and I was like, Oh fuck, that was 28 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:10:30       I mean, the back of my head, I was like, oh, that's good because I'm trying not to drink anyways, but it was 28 years old as shit poured in a glass. I sipped it and then somebody came by, boom, hit the table, and then those are puddle of it. Spent 20 years in a fucking barrel to be spilled on the floor and then cleaned up with a rag. Ah, that's a travesty. I felt my liver crying, but it was good because then I had the perfect amount of booze and I was fine. So I don't know. I know you guys who were in Aa, you know, collecting your little chippy poos there. You knew it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:05       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       Sober, you know, give you a little cookie. Um, got you down that chain. There's no way, even if I was like a full on fucking alkie, like I'm in AAA of alcoholism. Um, I never got called up to the big show. I'm basically like Kevin Costner and a bull Durham, except I'm drinking, um, that would annoy me going to Aa and they give me my stupid chip like that. So I'm like, I'm supposed to be fucking chasing these things. I've got too much of a contrarian in me. That's the new word for content, by the way. I'm a bit of a Canarian uh, Canarian a contrarion a bit of a contrary. Yeah. Yeah. You're, you're difficult. You or can't, you know, you're fucking in the ass. You're the kind of guy I have to fucking jet went down. You're the fucking guy. You're the guy that would get us killed. We'd all be fucking sitting there if we survive going, hey, you know what I say? We go over their storage. Everybody agreement. Yeah. And then they always want to go, whoa, Mu, this rich. Well, why don't you fucking go over there buddy. We had mauled by a bobcat. We'll wait for you to slowly die and then they're there. There's a new nourishment for the rest of this fucking walked down this snowy God forsaken Tundra.

Speaker 2:          00:12:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       Anyways, sorry. Um, the fuck am I talking again? So, so we go to the car show, right? None of the fucking restaurants are open. Fuck the dads. It's like food trucks. Nobody gives it. You know what's funny though? I didn't give a shit. My wife was upset. Oh my God. Why do we know any of these places are open? She's like, are you alright with us? Like, yeah, I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit. You know, I really don't. I am. I am the way I'm wired like a guy. I walked around, I looked at some shiny cars. I'm happy. It's hot as shit. Let's get back in the car and go home. I'm fine. Completely fine. Brunch. That's, that's some you shit turning this whole fucking thing to do a whole day. Yeah. Father's Day. You leave that. I had to buy the perfect father's day. And then, um, I didn't even say I started my day. Who fucking, uh, no fun Billy. I can wake up now like super early and um,

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       I finally have a little drum space, about 20 ways a little row, a little Jesus Christ who came to talk a little ways away from like 20 minutes away from my house. I got a little rehearsal studio, right? It can just rent them. And I got the smallest fucking one. Like if I stretch out, I can touch the walls on all sides. And I got this little fucking, that little sonar kit that I bought, the Martini Kit, 16 inch bass, a bass drums, which cracks me up because I was playing that giant bottom one that at a 26 inch fucking bass drum and a, I'm trying to, you know, just go in a completely diff, different direction after all of these goddamn years of just fucking trying to ape everything that, uh, that he did. And I just, I, it just hit me one fucking day. I told you what, if one day I just sat there and I said, what is this fucking guy came back to life and he came walking into my house.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       I keep saying this on the podcast, right? And I was just like, hey man, John Bonam, Holy Shit. Hey, I'm a big fan of yours. Come in and look at my drum kit. And I had his exact drum kit right down to the Rogers high hat. He would have looked that he would've slowly backed out of the fucking room. And what was funny is, now I'm going down this whole fucking rabbit hole. You know, I'm listening to Pan Tara and fucking Primus in Miles Davis. Figure that one out. Listening to all of fucking great drummers from Philly, Joe, Tony Williams to fucking Jack Dejan it just listen to these fucking geniuses and I'm trying to get something else in my fucking head. And uh, through reading up on Tony Williams, I went down this fucking rabbit hole full of, I don't know how many hours on the Internet, just trying to, Ellie's tracks I was listening to and trying to see if I could, there's so many tracks with Tony is just killing it live and they just won't show him.

Speaker 1:          00:15:24       It's so fucking annoying though. We showing miles or cold train a fucking nickel. [inaudible] plaintiff Coltrane, Myles are fucking, was it shorter that he played with? I don't know if they're always showing those guys. Yes. It's like if everybody else stops playing, they'll finally fucking show him. It's annoying. Um, but you know, typical, they never show the drum. That's why I love the Romantics when I was a kid. And what I like about you came out and I finally got the w the drummer was singing. If the drummer sang then there would be on hotel California with Don Henley. You'd see the drummer the whole fucking time. Okay. Other than that, you would shit out of luck. Um, so anyways, I ended up, when you read about Tony, that leads to Billy Cobham, which leads to fucking eventually, you know, I dunno Vinnie, Kali Yoga and Steve Smith and all these fucking guys. And then they start talking about the guys they listen to and then you go back around again. It's amazing. So I ended up finding this quote that really made me

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       feel good about getting rid of the drum kit that I did because sometimes I think going on, man, I always wanted that kid. And I finally fucking had it, and then I just always think, yeah, and you sat down and played it and you sounded like you so and it was too fucking big for you and you have all these other ideas. Why don't you go pursue those? And I just stumbled on this quote by Vinny Kali Uta, right? That's actually transcends playing drums. You can apply this to anything. It's, he says, this is what he was trying to find his own style. He said, I went through periods where I tried to imitate Tony and Billy. That's Tony Williams and Billy Cobham. He goes by eventually realized how dangerous it was. Basically trying to imitate those guys. That goes, I began to ask myself, what am I saying?

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       I wasn't saying anything. It had been said before and had a reason for being said, but I didn't have a reason. I wasn't making a statement. I was just repeating it like a parrot. By imitating and copying someone else, a person becomes a parrot. I saw the trap and I knew as great as those guys were and still are that I had to find my own voice and I was like, God dammit, look at that. That applies to stand up comedy. That applies to fucking washing cars. Do you want to be one of the greats? You know how many times can you watch misdemeanor Augie do the wax on, wax off before you're going to fucking break out of that. Come up with a new way to do it. Right. I know. What the fuck to tell

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       you. I'm just happy. So now I got this place so I wake up now cause um, you know

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       the way my daughter sleeps, she sleeps in these four hour chunks. So she finally falls asleep, you know, around two in the morning after she slept from my, you know, eight to 12. Then she'd be like up for like an hour and a half of some shit. And then she sleeps till like seven. My wife feeds her and then she goes back to sleep again until 10. So that window right there from seven to 10. Now, I just been jumping in the car, drive 20 minutes down the street. Nobody's up. There's no musicians over at that place. You know, they're just getting done, doing blow. They're going home. You know, I'm there at like eight in the fucking morning and I get to play for like a nice solid hour having the time of my fucking life. I don't know why I didn't do this for myself years ago. I didn't never dawned on me to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       I was always trying to play him in the fucking house and trying to find quiet ways to do it. Cause who's kidding? Who drums are fucking annoying other unless you're the person playing him. Um, so I finally got this place and I'm a, I'm beyond psych, so we'll see. We'll see what this little kit leaves me. Um, but, uh, I don't know, whatever. I'm just saying it was a great father's Day. So I went out tonight and then, uh, get a nice framed picture of me, uh, hold my beautiful daughter and I could not be having my arms around her anymore. And she looks content is hell. It's was an instant classic. I'm kissing her on the cheek and I get it framed. I'm looking at right now sitting on my desk and fucking psyched. So I'm happy. Father's Day, Father's Day to all the fathers out there.

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       Uh, you know, and if he used to play drums, you want to play him again. Go get one of those, get that fucking, that quest love little break beats set. Go find some fucking studio space cause she like one 25, 200 bucks a month. Who gives a fuck? You know, go get it and go down there and bring you fucking, you know, or find a studio space like, you know where I used to play, I never used to say that cause I didn't want anybody bugged me down there. Um, the best place that I found out here in La, if you don't have time to get a drum kit and all that shit, but if you just want to go play someplace is cascade studios down on Santa Monica Av just east of Highland. It's the shit. It's fucking cleaned. The drum kits are great. And, uh, it was the first class place and I, I went to a bunch of places that was the best place that I've found. So free plug there, it, speaking of that speaking and Oh, by the way, everybody keeps telling me to watch the fucking Lakers Celtics documentary thing that they got on ESPN. So I have to check that out. Um, but before I do that, before I do that have fucking fucked up too. God Damn podcast, that podcast, they fucked up the

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       password

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       ain't no complex. These things have to be now, you know, I, you know, you know, I hate you fucking put a nice easy one in and then they just say to you like, Oh yeah, that's not a, that's not good enough. That's not fucking good enough. It's like, well, why don't I determine that? Why are you acting like I'm in the Pentagon? I don't give a fuck. You know what I mean? Um, oh, you know what's hilarious too. And now that I've got a, I'm out of my bottom phase, um, I still played to some Zeplin today. I'm not gonna lie to you. When I was over there. But um, somebody showed me his fucking, remember that car in the song remains the same. That crazy looking. I don't know who made it, Ford or some shit that he had that held that crazy paintings and stuff like that. You know, you always wonder what happened to that shit is somebody bought it and then somebody else bought it and now it's up for sale. It's like 250 fucking grant. You always going to buy that thing. I'm, I'm Jim or say, uh, the colts.

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       I think that guy's going to end up having like the equivalent of Jay Leno's car collection. He's going to have that with musical artifacts. I mean the guy's getting to the point where he can kind of fuck with the rock and roll hall of fame. He's got like a Prince Guitar. He's got Jerry Garcia's guitar. If you had John Bonam car, I mean, that really adds to the collection. Then you put your fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:22:12       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       Printers, guitars and all this. Charlie Parker's saxophone, whatever the fuck else that guy owns in the back.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       Yeah. Some hookers come over. He starts doing blow, whatever the fuck it is. He does mean it could, could be a good time.

You know, those fucking roast jokes for some reason, the, the format of, of roast jokes is still from like the 1950s. I don't understand why that is. I have to figure out how to do this shit. Um, so and so is here. You know, last time I saw I had liked that it had a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       You know, they still use that except the young guys now they all say aids and cunt and fucking, it just, it's just so over the top, you know, nine 11. It's always like, I gotta figure out how the fuck to do this and I only have four days to do it. And of course I'm busy as shit. So, uh, I dunno what to do here. So, but this is the last thing. If I just get past this, which I will either by doing a good job, a mediocre job, or eating my fucking balls on it. The bottom line is it's over. You know, it's a 12 minute spot. I just have to get, if I get past this fucking roast, the rest of them I've gone up the rest of my year. It's downhill, Billy. No Fund is saying no to everything. What do you want? When is it not?

It's nine 22 at night and I was ready for bed two fucking hours ago. It's just my cutie pie doesn't asleep til about nine. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       and you know what's great about no booze. You sleep like a fucking baby. I mean, booze, we'll put you to sleep, but the next morning you wake up and you're just like, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:32:54       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       you wake up, you feel like you should be tied to a chair, you know, and there's some guy just waiting for you to come around to continue interrogating you by punching you in the head. And then you realize like, no, I punched myself in the head with all those fucking drinks. Um, so I'm actually really enjoying it despite the fact that drank the last two nights. I have one tonight and half of it's built on the fucking ground. All right. Fucking judge me. All right. I decide I'm in my own Aa. Okay. I still learned a chip today. I just feel like for me, having my own a is a good thing. Speaking of from me in reality show stars, you're not going to fucking believe who I think was at that car show today. We're walking around with looking at data that's fucking, this two door Cadillac that I swear to God was like, it was like two town cars put together. Um, incredible fucking car.

Speaker 2:          00:33:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:55       Gigantic. Oh my God. I saw this one Jaguar, you know the one that has the early, that one of the head in the 60s with the long fucking hood. I'm not the one from the 50s that Sinatra had that won the James Bond era one. You know the one and like the patch back open like a fucking regular door. This guy showing it off, right. He's got the back door open and then the hood opens like the reverse way, you know, from the windshield out looks cool as shit. And then I look in there, he's got like some small blocks, small block Chevy engine in there, you know, I don't know. That's what you want to fucking do. I don't know why you would do that. Um, anyways, I um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:37       so walking around and looking at those cars and all of a sudden he is this, these people on like, you know, the given out awards to cars and shit and that there's these listings. This person on the microphone going, I think that's Caitlyn Jenner.

Speaker 2:          00:34:51       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:51       I think Caitlyn Jenner's. Yeah. And I was like, no fucking way. I got to go seek, I gotta go see K. Right. I've got to go see when by the time we got there, I'm not even sure if it was, but like Nia said that Bruce, it gets confusing. He sees, she said she's really into cars. So I got confused saying like, all right was, was he not into it? And then can that happen? Do hobbies change? Then I knew what she was saying. It's like, no, he was into him. He's always been into him and now he's become Kaitlin. Tr uh, I want to sit transferred. What's the fucking word you're supposed to say? Transitioned helicopter. November one, five, three Sierra hotel on with you. Information. Bravo. Requesting, talking transition through a transition to, uh, you know, being Kaitlyn. But the hobby stay the same.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       There you go. Who would've know that? I would think you'd take up some other hobbies, right? Maybe you wouldn't. I gotta look this up. I gotta look this up. This is fucking weird. Cause I know you take hormones and stuff, right? So does that make it into other shit? It's, it's fine. It's fascinating. You know, and you know what's funny is they're going to keep doing the same way they doing the plastic surgery. Whether, you know it's going to keep looking better and better and better. You know what I mean? Same Way, you know, everything keeps getting better and better and better, except for the fucking environment, you know? Um, oh, by the way, I did a fucking benefit the other night and flea was in the crowd. I can't fucking believe I didn't give him a shout out for given a shit about bees.

Speaker 2:          00:36:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:42       There was one of the few positive things I saw about the environment last year was that flee somehow. Got It. You know, fleas up the fucking bees, a dying off and fleet shows up like a goddamn hero and that he gets into these beekeeping stuff. He's got the whole suit and everything. I saw this whole article on it. Eddie, he's, he's hooking up like a little, like there was like 10,000 of them hanging out in his backyard. You know? You know what's funny is that's one of those things your neighbors would be annoyed at because they don't understand photosynthesis. I don't know where that fucking word came from, but I, I literally, I think I, I think I used it correctly, isn't that when the bees go from flower to flower and stuff gets on their cute little feet, you know, a cute little beef feet, you know what I mean? And then they pollinate shit inadvertently.

Speaker 2:          00:37:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:37       They're out there running errands for the Queen, right? The Queen Bee. Um, the fuck was I talking about? Oh, I gotta look this shit up. When you transition, do your hobbies change fucking list. Am I going to get put on, look in this shit up. Oh, come on man. Don't do this to me. Come on Internet. Come on Internet. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       Can you believe someone who can't even get Internet in his whole house is talking about having a chauffeur? I mean, how fucking first world country is that habit change is easy when people move in your house for strategies to change your habits. Was that not specific enough?

Speaker 2:          00:38:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:29       I, this has to be, I have to be wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:38:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:32       You transition to woman, do your hobbies change.

Speaker 2:          00:38:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       13 ways to master the transition from college to the real world. Habit changes easier. How to successfully transition your diet, nerd fitness, health, and your forties wow. You know what? I searched to twice, I guess so Bruce was intuit.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       Does your preference, a color change? If you taken hormones like you're fucking would like the chemicals, right? Is it at fucking amazing how I just refuse to read about shit and I just continue to ask questions while answering them, but this is how I come to conclusions and then I can somehow legally get on stage with the microphone and do a fucking podcast. I can't imagine how many people who used to be men and are now women are just slapping their female forehead. They're transitioned forehead right now. Listening to me as I'm talking to him. I apologize to anybody out there transitioning. I don't fuck them. Why would I think that?

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       Yeah. Cause she said she's really into cars. It doesn't take a not to trip me up. That's all I'm saying. All right. Let's read some shit here, right. Mute math and Cole bear. Hey Billy. Boom Bap. Boom Bap. Um, thanks for putting me onto mute math. Uh Oh my God. That fucking amazing fucking incredible band. They've got a brand new album out. Whatever you kids say they got some brand new shit that you can download through the fucking air, man. Capture it on your device. Share it with your friends, man. Um, this guy says, I've seen the name before but never listened and they are all caps. Fucking dope. Uh, just bought a ticket to see them on their tour in September. Dude, you are not going to be disappointed. They're fucking is good as their bank or their, their albums are, they're fucking incredible life. Fucking incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:40:53       Ben. Um, and then he said to me, he told me to check out these bands. It says checkout big data in Portugal. I don't understand this next sentence. It says the man Comma, I think you might dig them. Is the man also a band? I'll look it up. All right. If my Internet hasn't shut down after that last stupid fucking search, keep drumming and make Steven keep drumming and making Steven Colbert or uncomfortable. Oh, I did this Steve Colbert show last Thursday aired Friday. I wasn't making them uncomfortable. He, he enjoyed it. I had a great time with them. He's a, uh, I met him briefly one time at some benefit, but uh, he's a really good dude. It was fucking amazing to go back and do that show cause that's where Letterman used to tape and it's still fucking ice cold in there. It's still roughly like the same setup.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       And it's just weird because coal bears desk is over with a band is, and um, I talked to him, you know, during the break on and go, oh, this is crazy being over here. You know, I did stand up on Letterman like four or five times and this is where I always look over. And Felicia and Paul Shaffer, Anton fig, all the whole band was over there and now the desk is here. And he said that, um, he asked Letterman where you should put the desk and Letterman set on the right side saying that he always wanted to sit over there, but Johnny sat over there. So out of respect, he sat on the other side. That's how much, you know, the level of respect that wasn't made. Just amazing story. The lead of a lover's SPEC that Letterman had for Carson. And why wouldn't you?

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       The guys, the king of it all. Uh, but Letterman was the car of my generation. Alright. Phelps versus the shock. Uh, Bill, I just listened to your, uh, Monday morning or your Thursday afternoon just before Monday podcast and enjoyed your rant about the upcoming fight between Mcgregor and Mayweather. I, it's not, it wasn't a rant. Was it a rant? I just was discussing the fucking subject. If I was screaming and yelling, ranting and raving, that is a fucking rent. You know, I'm going to look up ransom. I'm probably really wrong. It's wrong. A mom, you know, if you transition your fucking habits change, why the fuck would I be wrong about this rant definition? Come on. Oh, somehow I go to rant now. What the fuck is that now? Rant. You can't come on

Speaker 6:          00:43:26       definition.

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       Okay. Rant definition. Speak or shout at length in a wild, impassioned way.

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       Yeah. She was still ranting on the, I don't know. Wow. I think this just goes back to me being from Massachusetts in my ideas of, of yelling and fucking being out of control. I just different than everybody else's. But you'd want to say a ranted finally, fine. Whatever. Um, yeah. I just don't want, I fucking hate most about that McGregor Mayweather fight. Aside from the fact that that Mcgregor is only going to be allowed to box B, that guy's a fucking Swiss army knife of death and that they only let them take out the spoon. You know? Um, you want to fucking annoys the shit out of me about that fight as I know. I'm going to order it. I know I'm going to order it. How do you lay off that? Once they found out it's only going to be a hundred bucks. I thought it would be like 200 bucks. I thought they will both make it 100 million, I guess May. Whether it makes a hundred million Mcgregor makes 20 million for whatever fucking reason. How up is that? I think the guy that isn't, you know, if they were doing the fact that Mcgregor isn't allowed to do what the fuck you know, we could do, which is put Mayweather right on his back and the thing would be over in 30 fucking seconds, he should be getting 100 million.

Speaker 6:          00:44:49       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       this is a walk in the park for Mayweather. This is his fucking strike. And if we went the other way, Mcgregor was allowed to use all of his fucking fighting skills, then may whether she get the hundred million. This is classic, may one it, this guy's a fucking genius. He's getting an entirely his way and he's making $80 million more than this other fucking guy. Um, anyways, he goes, did you see that Michael Phelps is going to race a great white shark for some discovery channel thing? I fucking refused. That's a joke, right? That has to be a joke. Do I have to look this up? I thought you might like that one. That's that. That is fucking ridiculous. I'm um, all right. I got to look it up, dude. Even if the shark was full, I mean, that's, this is like the Mayweather fucking McGregor fight. This is what he does mean Phelps Swims, but he also does other shit. He goes to restaurants. You know what I mean? He hits a bong every once in awhile. What the fuck does a shark do? It's all it does. There's no fucking way. There's no self. Oh my God. It can't know. Phelps Verse Shark.

Speaker 1:          00:45:52       This can't be fucking real Michael Phelps to race a great, uh, to race against a great white shark in shark week's Phelps Verse Shark. Jesus Christ. Whenever I haven't just been on the fucking Wheaties box, not making enough money doing that. Michael Phelps isn't done swimming yet. The 23 time I'll be 23 time Olympic gold medals. This guy is 23 gold fought. You know what? This guy wants to race us. You know, we, of course he does. He's done with human beings. I think a shark is, is a good tune up fight when you're going into the ocean. I think this is who, I don't know who put this together. Maybe it was Mayweather he sent me. He always picks the perfect fucking opponent.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       You go in there and gets a great white shark. You know what I mean? They're, they're not known for their speed, are they? It's always dolphin zipping around. It's always the shit that they have to fucking catch. That's fast, right? Than the slowest thing gets caught. All right, 23 time Olympic gold medalist will compete in the most adrenaline filled race yet when he swims against a great white shark for this discovery channel. Shark Week. All right, so how do I handicap this? Are they starting in the water? Is the shark got to get up on that fucking block two and wait for the whistle? Are we've got a false start? We got a false start. We have a difficulty explaining to the shark what the fucking whistle is. He's just so freaked out that he's out of his natural atmosphere here. Um, and Phelps verse shark, Great Gold Verse. Great white is what they're calling this. The retired athlete will take on the oceans most efficient Predator in a competition of speed.

Speaker 2:          00:47:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:42       Jesus Christ. Can you imagine, Oh, who is Nike putting up the swim goggles for the fucking shark.

Speaker 7:          00:47:48       MMM. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:50       All right. And I guess Phelps tweeted something. I was able to do something that I'd always wanted to do. Be in a cage and dive with great white sharks.

Speaker 7:          00:47:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       Wait, is he married? He's got a kid. No. Good Fam. First Birthday party. Hey, happy father's day to him. What kind of a dad he's got? You know what? He's got all that gold, you know, you know what's funny? The dollar, the entire US economy could collapse and he's going to be fine. He's got 23 gold medals. You just melt those fucking thing down. You make a little nickel size coins. That guy's eating subs for the rest of his fucking life. Um, Phelps great white race isn't the only shark week special. He'll be appearing in the father of one will also join. I don't give a fuck about what he's doing together. The trio will dispel myths and misconceptions and teach Phelps the proper way to get up close and personal with hammerheads and great whites. Okay. You know what's funny about fucking the discovery channel after all these years of being the champions, the absolute champions of miss information about sharks, that you'd always watched their things on the sharks.

Speaker 7:          00:49:04       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       You'd always watch these things on the sharks

Speaker 2:          00:49:10       and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       while you watch the program, they'd always say all this, you know, these things are being hunted down, there aren't misunderstood, blah, blah, blah. But when you watch the fucking advertising,

Speaker 2:          00:49:23       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:23       For that week, Shark week, it was always the, there was like another jaws movie was coming out was really bad. So now I guess they're finally feeling guilty or maybe some younger people came in on the discovery channel and they're finally done a, I dunno, shitting on sharks. So wait, where are they going to be in a fucking saltwater pool

Speaker 1:          00:49:46       if they're in a pool? I like Phelps for the simple fact that I have a feeling that the shark's going to go out of its lane and be disqualified. And at the very least, the shark can't do that little somersault flip at the end of the fucking pool. Um, Jesus Christ is this, this is what the world is. The world of sport is becoming. Um, I dunno, back in the day, used to have those fucking fat bald guy, strongman, Theo always bald, right? Some about lifting weights back in the day, you know, you went bald. They would always be pulling trains with their teeth and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:18       All right. First Time listening. Hey Bill, first time listening to your podcast, my husband and I came to La for the Rose Bowl last year and saw your standup. We it. Thank you. Thanks for taking so much. Thanks so much for take talking in detail about jazz and sports. I think this show, this think this shows a lot of respect for your audience. We like cool shit. Obviously we like to stand up. Don't be afraid to go into technical details about whatever. It's interesting. Any who happy podcasting. Wow. All right. There's two people that are enjoying it. Um, I think I talked about it a little bit. Um, I downloaded all of this fucking miles Davis Shit. I am like a, I was a huge miles Davis fan like in the early nineties, and my favorite album was in a silent way. And I read his autobiography, I got like fucking, I mean I had all his shit on like cassette tapes. I even got like on the corner, which he talks about in his book how and Herbie Hancock came out with chameleon. Like that's what he was trying to do, that head hunters album. But you know, he's blamed the record labels saying that they know they fucked up the promotion of it. Um, but I got into all of that shit and then

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       I moved to New York and I stopped playing drums because uh, you know, I was living in a walkthrough fucking bedroom apartment and I just drums it too goddamn loud. I didn't play for like five, six years. And then I started back up again. So I started in [inaudible] 88 and I've been, I would like a five year break in there. So I've been playing about 19 years. Is that it? Whether it is, I don't know what the fuck it is, but um, anyways, Dave Brubeck Jess stuff here. We got more drunk shit. Ah, dear. Billy backbeat not the exact error you were asking for, but Dave Brubeck's band experimented with some crazy time signatures starting in the early sixties. Look for the album, the Dave Brubeck quartet at Carnegie Hall. I bought it when I was a music major in college and it was a borderline spiritual experience. It's got songs in 11, four aptly named 11 four.

Speaker 1:          00:52:33       Wait a minute, 11 for now. How the fuck does that work out? 11 four. So you just count. That's when you would, you've count that just up to 11. All right. So that's just basically it's like playing three, three bars of four, and then you just play one bar three, four and you just lop off that last beat, right? Five, four, take five, nine, eight blue Rondo, Alla Turk. Uh, not only are the song's great, but the audio quality is impressive for the time period. Every once in awhile you can even hear Dave or another member of the band blurt out a cool jazzy during a solo. It really immerses you in the time period and culture. All right. You know what, this is a classic. I'm going to download this and listen to this with from really nice headphones. MMM. He probably wished that I, you know, did some drugs.

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       Um, if you listened to a checkout, the track Castilian drums at the four minute mark, there's a drum solo where he turns to snare off and does some really cool and creative stuff with his hands and his sticks on the stairs. If you look at Joe Morello Shit where he's playing with his hands and stuff. And then once John Bonam playing with his fucking hands, um, I'm sure he Morella wasn't the first two. You only got to do it. But there's just a couple things where he's hitting with the back of his hand and shit and you see bond and do that. But then there's also like, like youtube and all that shit did not exist. Would Barnum was coming up so

Speaker 1:          00:54:04       he was over in England. The odds of him checking that out and actually seeing it is it's so fucking, I don't know how people we're able to, you definitely listened to everything you could, but to actually get to watch all the venues fucking in when some something came on the TV, you just fucking sat there and watched it. There was no hitting pause. There's no, all this is going to be a rerun and if you missed it, you fucking missed it. Um, anyways, this guy says thanks and go fuck yourself with that shiny new high head stand. Jesus Christ. All right. Join in the army.

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       I know, I know, I know, I know. All right. Here's a question for you. How did you pull the map up? Alright, here's your question.

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       All right, you're ready? Dancing wedding. Okay. Hey there, Billy back. Freckled uh, my girlfriend and myself are attending a wedding for our good friends too. Gay Fellas, this is a very progressive podcast by the way that you're doing. Yes. Oh well cause I already brought up Caitlyn Jenner and I learned something today when you kind of freaked me out when you said like, oh, she's really into cars. Why did that freak you out then? For, cause I know I had to do the math in my head. I was like, was Bruce not into cars? So then I was like, no, wait. I remember reading sports illustrated had Porsches and he was a pilot and all that shit. Right. Does his pilot's license? It must transfer over. Do you gotta change the name of how fun? How crazy is that? And then you've got to go down there and be like, listen, I'm this guy now. I'm sure it's, it's every, everyone knows their Caitlyn Jenner is alright, so if you're not famous, but if you're not famous, yeah. If you're not famous, you probably got to do who got some pain in to do. But I am, I'm gonna, you know, I'm going to get you for mother's Day next year. They speaking into a mic class. Sorry. All right, so here it is. Um, by the way. So I googled it when you transition to your habits change

Speaker 2:          00:57:50       and nothing came up.

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       So I guess it does. Okay. What's the color you wouldn't take one little thing would be kind of like, Oh shit, now I'm into this. Have you taken like hormones and stuff? Like when something change, your favorite color would change? I don't think so. It doesn't affect your brain, right? Why don't you allow to ask questions about this shit isn't be like, oh my God, what are you a fucking Trump supporter? I'm really excited to go to this wedding. He's saying, okay, these two gay guys are getting married, great to gay fellows. As he says, I'm really excited to go minus the fact that they are dancing fools. Could they be more stereotypical? Uh, my girl and that whole group will be dancing the night away. Well. So wedding. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       Do you not want to do this? No, I'm just trying to, I'm, I'm, I should wait to hear the question fully. Please proceed. Okay. You seem annoyed if any point you need to walk out and I'm fine with it. Okay. He says me for me. He says me for me or me, I just feel, he says me. I'm not a dancer. Perhaps I shouldn't assume, but I'm assuming that you're no dancer yourself. Evidently he is not seen daddy's home rights. Um, I'm the worst. I'm your standard pasty white guy who doesn't really dance. I don't like it. I don't really understand it. It's just, it don't understand. Just seems goofy to me. I totally lined up with this guy. I have an appreciation for it. You're on the bay. You danced at the wedding though. You dance at our wedding all night long. Yeah, I was drunk. My girlfriend has her dislike

Speaker 8:          00:59:22       with my opinion of dancing after a couple of drinks going as far as to tell me it's a real disappointment. [inaudible] that I don't enjoy dancing. Oh, I love how honest she is. You know, it's a real disappointment, uh, in our four years together. Have you, but I'm really, this really went in and I completely don't respect the fact that you don't like something that I like. Hey Nia, do you like hockey? Uh, I'll do what I do. Could you just play along? No, I doubt that's a real disappointment. Um, um, in our four years together, we've never really had any sort of arguments other than that one. Jesus Christ. That's the only thing you are, you about how you're very lucky. How often do you guys go marry this girl? He goes, I don't try and guilt her into doing something she doesn't like. So I get a little hot blooded when she does it to me.

Speaker 8:          01:00:15       Hi. Can she see you'll be dancing to that one? How blood? It wasn't a god robber. Hundred and three. Come on, baby. Do more. They dance right here. That's another white guy. Doesn't want to dance. They do more to dance. Can we get outta here so we get a, yeah, invent herpes. Uh, well, what do you think? What do you think? Oh, Ruby Pubi Ruby Pews Day. Um, I don't stand my ground in what do I stand my ground and what will most definitely become a disagreement when I don't go flail around. Like the non dancing whitey that I am or do I sack up and do my best Travolta from pulp fiction and go attempt to cut some rug even though I'll be miserable the whole time. Best to you? Uh, your little one and season two of f is for family has been great. Thanks for the content. And go f yourself. All right. All right. All right. So, um, what do you say? Well, as I'm snarkily said earlier, it's a wedding. So obviously there's going to be dancing whether they're gay guys are straight. Like everybody dances at weddings. Let's not, I don't know how he explains like why would he think that there wouldn't be dancing? Maybe that's not the, had nothing to do with the gay guy. He was just saying he doesn't want to, he just doesn't want to dance. No one can dance.

Speaker 8:          01:01:38       Oh, let little thing about me is a way that I wo I don't know. Oh listen, girls that liked to dance, like guys that liked to dance with them. That's just how it is that the name of a new reality show. If you don't go in there and do the why MCA and the electric slide, you can at least do a couple of slow dances. How about that? Can you come? Hi. Made me outside. How [inaudible] knows cashmere that um, maybe that can be the compromise. Listen, I'm not going to go up there. YMCAS break. Good out dude. Dude, dude, this is not the karaoke singing. So none of those things were [inaudible] prince. Did we have prints at our wedding? I don't know. Let's let's stay focused on, yes. I think the compromise, sir, is that you should give your lady a couple of slow dances and also also, wait a minute.

Speaker 8:          01:02:45       It's one night. It's not going to kill you to get up there and like be goofy with her. No one's watching you because I feel like there's a little bit of you that's like, you don't like to dance cause you feel like you can't dance. Nobody's looking at you, nobody's judging you. It's one night out of your life. Just be silly, have fun with it and definitely slow dance with her. She'll really appreciate it. This was one of those times where even though you don't like doing something, you do it for the person that you love. This is what it isn't. My suggestion. You're not going out dancing every single Saturday. Would you both for the wedding? You should. I'm a little distracted so I'm sorry I can't put my mouth like, you know, you want me to blow the damn microphone? No, I just want you to, he can do. He just, hello?

Speaker 8:          01:03:35       I feel I can't drive a car. Don't do that. I just, this is what he should do. He should go go there and have five quick drinks, five, five get fucking hammered and then just go out there and then just, that's it. You blackout drunk. I don't think that's a good walk around like a fish out of water the next day. I don't agree. When you're hung over and you're laying there and she's giving you look, she just looked at her and your best Clint Eastwood voice and you just feel like it was your idea. You want me to dance? These are the rules that would just sell. It said, listen, I'm going to dance my ass off that night. Okay, and I want you to know how stupid I'm going to feel. I'm doing this for you. However, these are the rules. You line up five shots. I'm doing those like Mister Blonde going through that bank.

Speaker 8:          01:04:32       That bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. If you had made me go out on the fucking dance floor, I don't think he should get a good mister blonde. That was all right. I don't think he should be five shots wasted. Break. Thank [inaudible]. Would you accept three? I would take two and see how it goes. Oh, you're the worst three. Give him three. This gives us a major anxiety. Need to think of all this stuff you all like to do, right? Exactly. Yeah, but I'm just saying at, well how about this? Can he at least give her us salad before he gets wasted? Can you just give her a slow, cause we love slow dances. They don't start with the slow dance. I know you go out there and it's like immediately like medially. Get down on it. Yeah, get down on it. Don't Du du, Du du Du du Du du Doo Doo Doo Doo

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       to the pain. Was it? I'm just barely doing the neutron dates. The team and someone stole my brand new Chevrolet. Yeah. At that point you've got to be like, you gotta be like fucking, you gotta be, you gotta be five shots in. It's one night out of your life. Do it cause you love her. Chosed and say, this is my dancing for the year given love you Mo. He's gotta be Shit faced. Can you just let the guy get drunk? Nia, I don't say this a lot. I don't see this lot. This is a white thing. What do you mean we don't do, we don't dance. Why people dance all the time. Fred Astaire. We did do it professionally. We just don't do it. Read reason. One of those people on dancing with the stars and that's it. I know. All right. Here's another one for a girl at Jujitsu. Hey, Billy Biloxi.

Speaker 9:          01:06:21       So my dilemma

Speaker 1:          01:06:23       is I'm 18 and I've checked on my, it's hot is frigging Health Indiana. You turn the AC on because what am I supposed to, oh, I'll hit pause. Hang on. All right, I'm back. Here we go. So my dilemma is I'm 18 and I've just finished the first, my first year of college a few months ago and I've been hitting the gym. Good for you as much as possible. Good for you. And I've been going to Jujitsu. You're crushing it for the past couple of months. Anyway, first day going there, I noticed a girl in the beginner's class with me and thought she was hot and she's doing Jujitsu. This is, this is nothing but a great stuff so far. Uh, so after a couple of weeks, I work up the nerve to talk to work. Good for you. Turns out I went to school with the younger brothers, something in common. This is like all rainbows right now.

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       And I was also the youngest in my year, so I think she might be 19 or 20. Jesus Christ, this is just all aces. Uh Oh. Why does my computer screen keeps shutting down? Um, I don't know. Anyway, after train, I don't know. Anyway, after training yesterday I asked her, I asked for her snapchat. Is that the way millennials as for digits now. I never even said digits. I'd be like, what's your number? Can I call you? You like my z Kaveri cheese. Daisy Buchanan instilled itself Micmac it. Try not to curse in front of her even though I've already done it 50 times here. I don't know any, I don't know. Anyway, it's a triple blah blah. And she gave it to me and after I asked her for it, I felt like a weight had been lifted because I've never really talked to that many girls, let alone get their snapchat or whatever is good for you.

Speaker 1:          01:08:02       Cause I'm incredibly reluctant and a bit scared to talk to them. Yeah, pathetic. I know, but I think this girl, his girlfriend material, that's not pathetic. Not just a fuck one time bitch. That was pathetic. Yeah. He really just made a left turn there. That statement was pathetic. He kind of built himself up as the AW shucks guy. Yeah. And then he now turn it around into, now he's a lady killer. Yeah. Well I know what it is. What he's afraid of. Low of whatever. No, no g see what you just did you just turn her off. Alright, I think I'm solo on this one. Um, so Billy boy, what should I do? How should I go about this? How should I text her? Any advice would be a pro appreciated. Loved the podcast. Wouldn't mind hearing for the lovely knee as input to have possible. We'd love for you. Can you just let a guy be a guy woods near? That's the equivalent. You guys being like, well what does he do for a living? How much does he make the, Oh, what size house could I get when I,

Speaker 8:          01:09:04       oh, is that the equivalent bill? Yes. Equivalents equivalent as equal. Nobody's onsite that at least not on my son.

Speaker 1:          01:09:11       Oh, sorry. And I, God, for me, I feel I need a twin from house. However your friends talk, we'd love for you to like play a Gig in Ireland sometime. Thanks to go f yourself too. I played a Gig, I played three last year. I went from Dublin up to Belfast and out to Galway and an Isosceles triangle of freckled. Fuckos I perform two out there. Are you trying to be

Speaker 8:          01:09:33       bad ass with this whole, not a one time bitch fuck type of thing. Like what was that? What was that little statement he threw in there? Because that did really turn me off.

Speaker 1:          01:09:43       Why do you keep latching onto that? This guy has all kinds of great qualities. He's 18 he's, he's, he's one year into college. Okay. He's hitting the gym, he's taking Jujitsu. He saw a beautiful woman. He was smitten by her and he's nervous. Okay. He loosely used it's locker room talk to, they just don't understand why he has,

Speaker 8:          01:10:04       I just don't build a wall around categorizing girls that he doesn't even know. And so this is like the kind of bitches fuck ones and this is girlfriend material. Go fuckers. So how about your neither, how about you're not going to get laid? And you're an asshole that won't have a girlfriend. And how about that? How does that feel,

Speaker 1:          01:10:22       Mimi? How Sad. How about dad? It's gets me out. Yeah, you guys do the same thing.

Speaker 8:          01:10:31       We're not talking about what you guys do and what everybody else does. I'm talking about this person that wrote in this question. Okay, that's not, that's not what this conversation is about. What everybody knows child, I want her to feel my passion. Okay. No. Oh her, her. Um, I'm not, we are, we're not discussing what women do versus what men do. We're talking about this particular person who is like, oh good for you. You got her snapchat also like snapshot, grow a pair and get her number. If you're really trying to like come with it, like don't be lurking on her snapchat so you can like jerk off to her like little selfie pics. I'm annoyed with this person. I'm sorry. I just, you know what? I'm jealous of this person. You know what son? I don't want to eat and he's working out, you know, the general appreciation, that little line that you threw in, so married his wife, that type of way about it.

Speaker 8:          01:11:25       So, um, all right, here's my advice, sir. Here's my advice. You know something, I swear to God, if you were a pitcher right now I'm coming out and before you even get to the mountain of taking you out of the game, I don't even know what that means. It means you got way too emotional. You lost your control and you're gonna, you're gonna kill somebody, hit the shower. She's girlfriend material, not just a one time the, you know, bitch you fuck was this guy cannot run in from the bullpen quick enough. You've completely lost your composure. Hit the showers on this one. All right. How do you know what kind of person she is? Oh boy. Cause you decided because you've projected what? You want your fantasy because she's out a real person to you, right? She's not a real person. She's just someone you saw doing Jujitsu and is like, oh my God, this is like my dream girl. Not like those other girls that you just like tossed to the side. You don't even know her. You don't even care to know her. You got her snapchat, her snapchat really via. Oh, a pair asked for the number or stay the fuck away. Don't be lurking online like some kind of creep. What does this person saying? Oh, he's from Ireland. Colin.

Speaker 8:          01:12:43       Mia, don't Seamus.

Speaker 8:          01:12:53       Shame is only airy. Uh, no shame is this guy has no Seamus, I'm sorry. Sorry. Patrick. Listen. Yes. Um, don't you hit [inaudible] guys have like, oh, this guy's husband material. Yes. Well, all right then. So why don't you relax. All right, good luck, Lord. I do get it. I really got hot. You got grumpy. All right, fine. Yes, this is it. There are days that you're like this guy, you would not want to be in relationship. This is a guy that you just like bang out a few times and don't ever see again. Yes. That, what do you mean bang out a few times? No, you're right. You're right. Women do the same thing. It's, it's 100% true. I, it just took 20 minutes to get there. I Dunno. Just bug me, of course bugged me. But I am being a hypocrite because I've certainly had those feelings towards certain guys, so, exactly. And it's about time I start fucking admitting then instead of acting like the world ozo rounded drinks. Now here's a man he's found, he's smitten with this girl. He's afraid, you know? So he just in the tooth coming in their house. Yes.

Speaker 8:          01:14:06       Well, this is what I would say. Uh, how should you go about this? Uh, you're gonna have to do something that's

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       probably difficult at your age. And I hate when older people say this, but you got to figure out a way to be yourself. You just gotta walk. I, you've said enough there and I think you've said, I'm sorry Shane. I'm sorry I yelled at you. I think you've said enough here. I think you dumped a whole bunch of other stuff from other days. Was it something I did? I don't know. But this guy did not deserve that. This is an 18 year old. He just became a man. Okay. Okay. I overreacted a little bit and he's a colleague don't to college. He's going to know how to defend his family bag full of goodies. Right? With his Jujitsu. I'm just saying, if you were my son, I'd be like, can you not? Can you get off at Nia? Alright, a Moffett on. Yeah, you're a hypocrite.

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       You're a hypocrite. But what I love about you is you admit what a pig you are like the rest of us. Jesus Christ. Can you give the kid some advice here? What was the question? He got her snapchat and he's nervous. He actually likes this woman. What does he do? Is you just be himself just to listen. I got to like I, I saw you across the room. A man one was a little mini heart attacks. I really like you. I'd like to take you out. You've got it. You got to go on a stage is asking. Yeah, you don't have to sit there and brewed in the corner and there no reason to feed. What you do is you, you, you fake with those ones. You just going to bang somebody actually like you gotta be honest with them or else it's not gonna work. So just a, yeah. Okay. This level one is getting filled up. I see. I'm going to go. Okay, cool. I think you will get, I think you both need a nap. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that. Hey, we all get there. Whatever his name is. It's my bad. Yeah. Well all you know his name is Vinny. Um, all right.

Speaker 7:          01:15:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:00       Dancing at the wedding. I already did that girl, that Jiu Jitsu. I already did that. Did I answer all the questions? Oh, joining the army, joining the army as you can sail the seven seas in the army. You can eat some mushy peas in the arm. You'll get joining the army. Dear William, no fun. I'll skip all the ass kissing since you blow through all your bolts through on your reads. Anyways. All right. I'm a 34 year old married guy, former navy vet [inaudible] who is sick of feeling like a shitbag. I want to do something with my life and feel like making a difference. I've kicked around the idea of going back into the military for a while now and it's shit or get off the pot time.

Speaker 7:          01:16:47       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       Why you want to go back into the military? 34 okay. I brought this up to my wife in the past in all she can say is you're married and changes the subject, so backstory on us, we've been together for seven years and married fiveish. We've had our ups and downs like any couple, but I get sick of being treated like a child. It comes to my own life anyway. I'm just about at the cutoff age cutoff, age wise to go down the path I want in life. I want to be a combat medic. Jesus Christ. Dude, good lord man. I mean how much excitement that you need in your life. You already serve and you want to go back here and this guy's a frigging hero here. He said, I'm a determined man who cares about my family and my family and my country. I've done my research and I have the time to join. Do the medic training, Goto Rasp, ranger assessment program. You're going to become an army ranger at 34. Did you guys ever watched that documentary on Netflix about just to see if you're worthy of, of going through like the week long of 10 days or 14 days of hell? Only thing I remember was they had this giant like telephone pole that you intend of. The guys had to hold up and do curls with it or some shit and his people quit. The rest of you had to hold the thing up.

Speaker 1:          01:18:17       I mean I was screaming in pain watching it and if you puked in the pit you had to get your puke out of the pit. It was just like, just that beginning thing was more obstacles than I've ever faced in my entire life. Um, you are a driven man. You're a special kind of person, man. If you can, does special forces, right? He says then special operations, combat medic training. My question is built, what do I do here? Do I risk losing her or stay here and resent her? I don't want to do either, but I also can't continue to work myself to death as a construction worker. Making someone else rich at the cost of my health and happiness. Dude, if you want to be a combat medic in your fucking putting drywall in, I mean that's gotta be torturing you. He said, I've worked seven twelves for six months, six, seven days a week, 12 hours a day for six goddamn months trying to save money to go to nursing school.

Speaker 1:          01:19:15       She tells me she booked us on a cruise. She spent that money on a cruise, Lee. Oh boy. I don't know what to do and I need your help. Thanks in advance for your advice and thanks for the [inaudible]. Mediocre job on F is for family. Go Fuck Yourself. All right, here's the deal, dude. Um, what's going on in your relationship and is a, is, is a critical lack of communication. Okay? You're telling her what you want to do. She's just saying you're married, changes to subject your, you've saved up all that money to go to nursing school. And either she didn't realize that that was what it was for and booked you on a cruise or she's one of the most selfish people on the planet, which I don't think you would've brought that up. So I think what's going on here is you're one of these, you're disguise guy, John Wayne type. And like most of them, you know, people like that. You ask you how you're doing and you just say, fine. All right, well you need to do what? You got to open up. You got to sit down. You got to say, listen, we got to talk and you have to sit down and didn't tell her what you want to do. Tell her how you feel at work and you have to communicate and start there and work your way to the ranger assessment program. That's what you have to do.

Speaker 7:          01:20:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:20:43       Because other than that, uh, you have a major blowout argument on the horizon and her catchphrase is going to be, where is all of this coming from?

Speaker 7:          01:20:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:20:57       You know?

Speaker 7:          01:20:58       MMM,

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       Yup. If you're one of those guys that does stuff the right way, there's a problem. You can run into where you have this expectation that everybody else should also do things the right way. And when they don't, then you get fucking pissed. And uh, it's, it's all of it builds it as complete. Like I lead by example and all that shit. You got to learn how to communicate. So yeah, I would sit down with her and I would talk to her. Um, all right. And, uh, good luck with that. Those are amazing frigging goals. I just want to learn how to play Tommy the cat. That's what I want to do anyways. That's the podcast, everybody. I hope you enjoyed it. Um, by the way, I have, um, I have a number of friends on that show.
