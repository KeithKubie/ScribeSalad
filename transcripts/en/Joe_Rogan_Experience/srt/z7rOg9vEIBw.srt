1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,790
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,150
you going to be happy living forever?
Like what if, when you die, it's amazing.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,900
What if when you die, there
really is a heaven. You really,

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,940
really do go to some spectacular
dimension filled with love and peace and

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,190
happiness. And there's no
emotions like we think about here.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,850
There's no fear. There's not none
of the things that hold people back.

7
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:27,570
None of the anxiety and the adjunct.
It's just consciousness and love.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,570
And then you're wasting your time.
You're just trying to stay alive,

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,090
taking pills to live,
to be a million

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,700
boy. You open up big can
of worms, right? Bra,

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,390
I will tell you, um, Joe,

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,780
without a shadow of a doubt,
none whatsoever.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,120
Death is not the end. You don't
think so? I know, I know too.

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,200
How do you know? Cause I've been
dead, right? Yes. I think there.

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,640
What about that experience
cemented it in your head? Um,

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,840
like I said,
it was the most peaceful.

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,900
Um, and, and I, I don't feel
like it was the most peace,

18
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,850
most restful, most I
was, I woke up laughing.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,070
I was, yeah. Yeah.

20
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:29,050
My wife tells me I was overjoyed.
You woke up laugh. Yeah,

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,800
I was over to you remember anything about
what happened when you blocked out the

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,940
time? Extremely peaceful. Extreme.

23
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,260
I didn't have a worry.
Extremely true.

24
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,410
And I was not sad at all.
You know,

25
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:50,350
I was overjoyed,
very happy,

26
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,940
very peaceful and erased.

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,520
Any fear that I might have had and a,

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,550
and any fear of dying is gone.

29
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,600
I don't feel that at all. It's so, I mean,

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,260
maybe that's why I don't want to live
to be a hundred cause it, I mean,

31
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,910
I wouldn't mind visiting that place again,
man.

32
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:17,860
It was so much peace so much and
it wasn't like, you know, um,

33
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,650
this is, you know, I'm just in the ground.

34
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:23,950
I'm a and I'm not a plant,
uh,

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,610
just dirt,
you know,

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,200
I know that I'm in a very
comfortable place and,

37
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,590
and you know, I wouldn't mind visiting
again. I wouldn't mind. Definitely.

38
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,200
I hold no fear.
And so when I say that it's,

39
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,810
it's definitely not the end. You're,
I believe that your soul, you know,

40
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,420
so people have a different name
for a consciousness of whatever.

41
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,370
It's definitely eternal.

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,880
And then here's how else could you have
these feelings or emotions or you know,

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,220
they have that sort of comfort,

44
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,790
the feeling of comfort and being in
the right place if something didn't

45
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:09,130
continue. Because my life,
my life was gone. The essence
of life, my, my bindings,

46
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,000
you know, gone, it was gone.
Flat Line, did whatever.

47
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,160
I told my doctor that died and he said,
no,

48
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,090
actually it's called some kind of Paul's
or some shit like that. And I'm saying,

49
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,790
look, if the pause lasted doc, I
wouldn't be talking to you too.

50
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,160
So I he call it appalls. I, well,

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,230
during that Paul's, I
was dead. So, uh, it's,

52
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,290
it was a wonderful feeling to them.

53
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,500
How about I don't,

54
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,970
I'm not a dystopian person terms of like
today I'm not cynical. I'm really not. I,

55
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,020
I think I like people, I like what
I see out there in the world today.

56
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,970
I think things are changing
for the better. What?

57
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:50,080
I'm worried that technology doesn't give
a fuck this and the way it goes live,

58
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,270
it's just going to just decide it's here
for its own advancement and in order to

59
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,940
complete its protocol of
constant completion of this
and it's going to become a

60
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,774
god,

61
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,580
it's just going to become
something insanely powerful
that doesn't need to worry

62
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,680
about radiation,

63
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:13,681
cooking it or worry about running out
of food or worry about sexual abuse when

64
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,880
they're a child,
doesn't have to worry about anything.

65
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,320
So it's definitely unstoppable.
I think this wave of technology,

66
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,670
all we can do is innovators and creators,

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,080
engineers,
scientists is steer that way.

68
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,950
We can is fit while we certainly can
steer it with her now where right.

69
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,250
And that's the best we can
do. And those are the, that's,

70
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,360
that's really the best we can do is
as good people, you know, steer it.

71
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,890
And that's why the leadership is
important. That's why the people that, uh,

72
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,610
Jack Ilan, Larry Page, uh, the,

73
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,870
everybody at the Mark Zuckerberg,

74
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,010
they are defining or this
wave is going. And, uh,

75
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,420
I am hoping to be one of the people
that does as well. That's beautiful.

76
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,460
Um, Joe of can I, can I finish
by reading something? Sure.

77
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,510
Of a recently witnessed
because of this Tesla work,

78
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,780
because of just the passion I've put
out there about particularly automation

79
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
that there has been a few people,

80
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,610
brilliant men and women engineers and
leaders including Ilan mosque who've been

81
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,530
sort of attacked, almost personally
attacked by really people,

82
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,400
critics from the sidelines.
And so I just wanted to,

83
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,580
if I may close by reading the,
uh,

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,350
the famous x or from a Teddy
Roosevelt. Yeah. Okay. Just for them.

85
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:44,380
It would make me feel good
if you want to do that. Uh,

86
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,970
it's not the critic who counts,

87
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,500
not the man who points out how the
strong man stumbles or where the doer of

88
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,210
deeds could have done them better.

89
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,920
The credit belongs to the man
who's actually in the arena,

90
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,150
whose face is marred by dust and sweat
and blood. Who strives valiantly.

91
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,530
Who Errs,

92
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,240
who comes short again and again because
there is no effort without error and

93
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:11,840
shortcoming. But who does
actually strive to do the deeds?

94
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,500
Who knows great enthusiasms,
the great devotions,

95
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,930
who spends himself in a worthy cause,

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,500
who at the best knows in the end the
triumph of high achievement and who at the

97
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:24,380
worst,

98
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,380
if he fails at least fails while daring
greatly so that his place shall never be

99
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,630
with those cold and timid souls who
neither know victory nor defeat.

100
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,440
Joe,
thank you for having me on.

101
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,450
Sounds like you let the haters
get to you a little bit there.

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,630
Okay.
She brought the guy in Florida.

103
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,140
They got arrested because he would not
take I eat ass off the back window we

104
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,220
were talking about that I eat ass.
Eat Ass said on the back of his window.

105
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,720
He said it is his first amendment right
to let everyone know that he eats ass.

106
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,870
Yeah, but that's a funny thing.
Imagine if that's your boy.

107
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,140
You have this little baby sucking
on your nipple and you're like,

108
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:07,370
my cute little boy. He's adorable. Oh
my little Billy wants to play baseball,

109
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:09,890
but he doesn't like getting up early
and he misses a lot of practice.

110
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,810
He got cut from the team and
now he's Kinda depressed.

111
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,370
He just plays Madden all day and in
one day Billy's got a pickup truck and

112
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:20,630
Billy's pickup truck says I e f and you
come home and he's still living at your

113
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:24,380
house cause he's a fucking loser and you
come home and you see little Billy with

114
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:28,400
his I eat ass on. Do you really
need to have that on your truck?

115
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:33,050
In my driveway I do through mall.
That's how I get my ass to eat.

116
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,230
A lot of guys don't, but
I do so I love by no. Ah,

117
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,170
ah, I do. I do. I do. I and a dad is like,

118
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,570
I still support them and I love
him very much. I also eat ass.

119
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,020
Imagine if you got it from your mom and
you're driving on the highway and you're

120
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:51,830
stuck in bumper to bumper traffic
with ies in front of you for an hour.

121
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,270
We'd laugh.
My mom would laugh.

122
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,510
My mom would get mad at me
for staying in the same lane.

123
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,370
She'll just change Joe Watch.

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,270
You're in this lane because you think
it's funny that I have to look at I eat

125
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,800
ass. I didn't say that, mom. I did
not say that. It is funny though.

126
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,930
You think it's funny?
It is very funny.

127
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,880
You'd think it's funny because
my story about that guy,

128
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:10,310
I know you think it was up.
I think it was more positive than that.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think he wanted to let people know
that he eats ass because he's got this,

130
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,980
he's got, I don't know if you know him
but we know him. I know him very well.

131
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,120
Jamie and I know him very well,

132
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,780
but he's got this half of his tongue
was bit off by a dog when he was young,

133
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,110
so he knows how to eat.
You go your rough. Yeah,

134
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:30,620
he's got it wrong at the end of it.
Yeah. He knows how the flipping roof,

135
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,230
he's good at eating this,
but I think people for years where like,

136
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:36,740
you can't eat ass anymore Mike.
And he was like, fuck you guys man.

137
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,550
What are you trying to say?

138
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,300
Do you know their Florida man story eating
ass man arrested after caught eating

139
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:44,450
ass inside toys r us store.
That's why they closed down.

140
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,290
That's why they're not in business. That's
a bold move. Little kids in there. Oh,

141
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:53,060
I know what I saw. It's around
here somewhere. It said thing.

142
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:57,000
That game is, there's a on the
cover and he's got a hammer.

143
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:01,620
He's trying to whack the malls and
there's guys in this drug's pool.

144
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,670
Guys eating girls poop. Yeah. Mommy,

145
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,920
you imagine if you saw a dude eating an
asshole underwear in the middle of toys

146
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:14,530
r us. You're walking around with your
kid. Go and show what your we get,

147
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,580
which should we get a wiffle ball bat?
You want to play wiffle ball? Yeah. Yeah.

148
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,590
Woo Football. Be Fun. Yeah.
And he turned the corner and

149
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,110
then the girl turned,

150
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,530
she was scared out of here.
Well down a rabbit hole with this one.

151
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,210
With ass eating. Yeah. Man.

152
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:32,650
Who ripped out girlfriends intestines
for yelling her husband's name during sex

153
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:36,700
gets life in prison. Oh, it
makes perfect sense. What again,

154
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,080
a revolution that's already happening.

155
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:40,120
We're gonna just gonna change
the way we make babies.

156
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:44,680
We're going to get away from sex as
the primary mechanism for conceiving.

157
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,530
Our kids will still have sex for
all the great reasons. Uh, we do.

158
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,150
And that's going to open up a
whole new world of a gist of how,

159
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:56,860
of applying science to what it means
to be a human with a lot of new

160
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:57,610
possibilities.

161
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,970
That's was going to be so freaking when
people stop having sex to make kids and

162
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:04,420
they make turns in a lab. Every kid's
mean in the lab when not only that,

163
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:08,410
I think we're going to move to an era,
an era where people who have,

164
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,330
who make babies through sex
will be seen as taking a risk.

165
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,960
Kind of like people who don't vaccinate
their kids where it's natural.

166
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,170
Tonight it's more natural to not
vaccinate your kids then to do it,

167
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:24,190
but people say, wait a second, you're
taking on a risk on behalf of your kids.

168
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,870
About 3% of all kids in the world are
born with some kind of harmful genetic

169
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:32,860
abnormality using in vitro
fertilization and embryo screening.

170
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:35,800
That 3% can be brought down significantly.

171
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,790
And what happens if you see somebody 20
years from now who has a kid with one of

172
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,900
those preventable diseases? Do you
think that's fate or do you think, well,

173
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,580
wait a second.
Those parents,

174
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,680
they made an ideological decision about
how they wanted to conceive their kids.

175
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:54,640
I think we're moving towards some
really deep and fundamental changes. Mm.

176
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,490
Similar. Well, yeah, that's a,

177
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:02,491
that's an interesting conversation of
whether or not you wonder what if we're

178
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,660
ever going to get to a point where
people don't allow people sort of like,

179
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:10,490
people don't allow people to
not get vaccinated. Right. Know,

180
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,420
like there's a lot of that going on today,
right?

181
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,790
Yeah.

182
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,280
Which is great. Right? You don't
want diseases floating around,

183
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,440
but what if that gets to the place
where we do that with people,

184
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,870
with people creating new life
forms? What have you say, hey,

185
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,010
you are being irresponsible. You just
having sex and having a kid. Yeah,

186
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,850
I know that's your grandma did it.
We don't do it that way in 2099 yeah.

187
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,360
I think it's going to be hard to do that
in a society like the United States,

188
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,450
but in a country like North Korea,
there'll be able to do that. What you are,

189
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,090
or if a country, if they said, look, um,
you can make babies however you want. Um,

190
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,990
but if you make babies the old fashioned
way and if you have some kind of

191
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,410
genetic, your kid has some kind of
genetic disorder that was preventable,

192
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,120
we're just not going to
cover it with insurance.

193
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:59,410
So you're going to have a
$10 million lifetime bill,

194
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,350
but you don't need to,
you don't need to require something.

195
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,610
You can create an environment where
people's behaviors will change it.

196
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:09,340
And then there are, there
will be increasing social
pressures. I mean, right now,

197
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,001
you know,

198
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:13,240
somebody sees some little kid riding
around their bicycle without a helmet.

199
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,670
They're kind of looking at the
parents like, Hey, what are you doing?

200
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:17,650
How come you don't have
a helmet on your kids?

201
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,330
And I just think that we're moving
toward this kind of societal change where

202
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,910
people will, I believe, see, uh,

203
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,040
conceiving their kids in the lab
as a safer, safer alternative.

204
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,290
And it's not just safety.
Because once you do that,

205
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,830
then that opens you up to the
possibility of all other kinds of,

206
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,010
of applications, of, of technology.

207
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:43,930
Not just not just to eliminate
risks or prevent disease,

208
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,150
but you have a lot more information.

209
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:51,151
So already it's possible to active roughly
rank order 15 pre implanted planted

210
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,550
embryos, tallest to shortest
in a decade from highest,

211
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,660
a genetic component of Iq to lowest
genetic component of Iq. I mean,

212
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,340
this stuff is very real
and it's very personal.
