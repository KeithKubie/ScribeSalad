00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
And there are 2 correct answers here.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.130
One is that we can use non determinism to guess a shortest tour.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.380
It's not totally obvious how to do that, because the if-better function

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.470
always can only do 2 distinctions,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.190
so you have to find a clever way to use that function to guess

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.410
how to construct a shortest tour,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.170
but it's possible in the way that I've showed you here.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.700
Then once the shortest tour has been guessed,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.060
checking if the length is shorter than

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.760
D, and as you'll remember, D was the maximum length that we allow for it,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.700
because we are having shortest tour in the decision problem.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.570
Once the shortest tour has been guessed,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.680
it's easy to check if the length of that tour is smaller than D,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.850
so by easy, I mean it's possible in polynomial time,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.390
so this one here is also correct.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.250
Non determinism can be used to guess

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.120
which vertices to put in the tour

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.430
is--obviously doesn't make sense, because all vertices are part of the tour.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.650
It's the order of the vertices

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.230
that matters for solving shortest tour.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.340
And then the final one, of course, that was easy to see that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.390
it's not really a viable answer,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.990
but I wanted to point out to you that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.760
even though it might sometimes be obvious,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.600
you should always make sure

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.170
to explicitly show that the problem is in NP,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.290
and we'll actually, later in this course,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.130
come across some problems where you might initially think that they are in NP

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.270
but actually they're much harder than problems that are in NP.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.310
So now, we have completed the first step.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.380
We know that shortest tour is in NP

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.620
and now consider finding a polynomial time reduction

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.760
from an NP complete problem

00:01:21.760 --> 99:59:59.000
to show shortest tour is NP complete.
