00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:01.750
- [Instructor] Let's get
some practice now thinking

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.977
about how ions typically form,

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:05.977
how they might form compounds

00:00:05.977 --> 00:00:08.597
and how we name those compounds.

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:12.144
So let's start with
something in group one.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:15.221
In this first column, this
first column is often known

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:17.436
as alkali metals.

00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:19.813
So let's start with potassium.

00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:23.014
K is the symbol for potassium.

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:25.087
Now things in group one here,

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:27.452
one way to think about
is their outermost shell

00:00:27.452 --> 00:00:29.455
has one electron in it.

00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:32.247
So they wouldn't mind
losing that electron.

00:00:32.247 --> 00:00:35.538
So when they ionize, they
tend to lose an electron

00:00:35.538 --> 00:00:38.538
and become a cation, a positive ion.

00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:43.880
And so let's look at a situation
where I have some potassium

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:47.270
that has been ionized.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.174
I could write it just like this,

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.032
we've seen that in previous videos

00:00:51.032 --> 00:00:54.404
and we can refer to this
just as a potassium ion,

00:00:54.404 --> 00:00:57.879
we could refer to this
as potassium one plus.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.629
We could refer to this
as a potassium cation.

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:05.948
Now let's go on to the other
side of the periodic table.

00:01:05.948 --> 00:01:09.991
Things that would really
love to grab an electron.

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:12.908
So things in group, in the halides,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.837
which is this column right over here.

00:01:17.837 --> 00:01:19.920
So these are the halides.

00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:23.778
They have seven electrons
in their outermost shell.

00:01:23.778 --> 00:01:25.639
They would love to have eight,

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:29.153
so they tend to be really
good at grabbing electrons.

00:01:29.153 --> 00:01:31.905
And so let's say we're
dealing with chlorine,

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:34.282
and chlorine is able to ionize.

00:01:34.282 --> 00:01:36.813
So it's able to grab an electron.

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:39.788
When chlorine grabs an electron,

00:01:39.788 --> 00:01:42.754
it will be a negatively charged ion,

00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:46.464
so you could write it
as Chlorine one minus,

00:01:46.464 --> 00:01:50.189
but the way that we
generally refer to an anion,

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.272
a negatively charged ion,

00:01:53.475 --> 00:01:56.812
instead of just calling
this the chlorine anion,

00:01:56.812 --> 00:01:59.425
we would call this chloride.

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:02.592
So this we would refer to as Chloride.

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:08.088
Now as you can imagine
with potassium having

00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:10.771
a positive one charge or one plus charge

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:12.794
and this having a negative charge,

00:02:12.794 --> 00:02:14.692
they're going to be
attracted to each other

00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:18.665
and they can actually
form an ionic compound.

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:22.192
The ionic compound they
would form, we would write

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:25.643
as, you'd write your positive ion first

00:02:25.643 --> 00:02:28.722
and then you would
write your negative ion.

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:32.115
And this right over
here would be described

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:34.675
as potassium chloride.

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:36.516
Let me write that down.

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:39.016
Potassium, potassium chloride.

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:46.024
Now you might be saying, "Well, I just,"

00:02:46.024 --> 00:02:48.442
Let me rewrite the whole thing.

00:02:48.442 --> 00:02:50.697
So you know the chloride
part, you say okay,

00:02:50.697 --> 00:02:52.038
this is going to be an anion

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.497
because instead of writing chlorine

00:02:54.497 --> 00:02:56.466
which is the name of this element,

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:58.710
I wrote this IDE at the end

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.293
to say, "Hey, this is an anion,"

00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:04.836
so I know that this is the
chlorine anion, this is chloride,

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:07.678
why didn't I do something
similar for potassium?

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:09.355
Well, the way the convention works

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.712
is if someone says potassium chloride,

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:14.568
you know you're dealing
with an ionic compound

00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:16.864
and if the chlorine has
a negative one charge,

00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:17.908
an ionic compound,

00:03:17.908 --> 00:03:19.789
the whole thing is gonna be neutral.

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.302
So if this one over here is one minus,

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:26.978
then you know this over
here is just one-for-one,

00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:29.319
this is going to be one plus

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.231
so you know that you're
dealing with a potassium cation

00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:37.398
and you could say and a chloride
ion or a chlorine anion.

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:40.875
You could refer to it various ways,

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.928
but this is potassium chloride.

00:03:42.928 --> 00:03:45.223
You have a positively charged potassium

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:47.540
and you have a negatively
charged chlorine,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.047
which we would call a chloride.

00:03:50.047 --> 00:03:52.546
In the next few videos I'll
do many, many more examples

00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:56.713
of this and ones that will be
a little bit more complicated.
