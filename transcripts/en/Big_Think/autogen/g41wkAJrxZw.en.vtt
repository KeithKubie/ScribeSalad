Westchester County the system is
 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.320
Westchester County the system is
basically based on capturing rainwater

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330
basically based on capturing rainwater
 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.380
basically based on capturing rainwater
from rainfall that is moved down the

from rainfall that is moved down the
 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.670
from rainfall that is moved down the
mountainside and obviously gets

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680
mountainside and obviously gets
 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.500
mountainside and obviously gets
collected through the system of streams

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510
collected through the system of streams
 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.290

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.160
the mid 19th century all the way to the
early part of the 20th century I'll make

word basically from the source up in the
 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.999
word basically from the source up in the
Catskills down to New York City there is

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009
Catskills down to New York City there is
 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.819
Catskills down to New York City there is
an elevation drop it is very very small

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829
an elevation drop it is very very small
 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.179
an elevation drop it is very very small
you know per foot per mile but it isn't

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189
you know per foot per mile but it isn't
 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.800
you know per foot per mile but it isn't
enough to keep the water moving through

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810
enough to keep the water moving through
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.889
enough to keep the water moving through
gravitation down to the cities uh you

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899
gravitation down to the cities uh you
 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.050
gravitation down to the cities uh you
know buildings and internal pipes so

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060
know buildings and internal pipes so
 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.700
know buildings and internal pipes so
that's essentially where the water comes

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710
that's essentially where the water comes
 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.459
that's essentially where the water comes
from about ninety percent of the supply

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469
from about ninety percent of the supply
 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.340
from about ninety percent of the supply
the 1.5 billion gallons that come to new

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350
the 1.5 billion gallons that come to new
 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.620
the 1.5 billion gallons that come to new
york city every day comes from the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630
york city every day comes from the
 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.740
york city every day comes from the
Catskill Delaware system essentially

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750
Catskill Delaware system essentially
 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.209
Catskill Delaware system essentially
which is basically the Catskill

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219
which is basically the Catskill
 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.160
which is basically the Catskill
watershed which is the water that falls

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170
watershed which is the water that falls
 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.410
watershed which is the water that falls
east off of the Catskill Mountains and a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420
east off of the Catskill Mountains and a
 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.750
east off of the Catskill Mountains and a
Delaware watershed which falls West off

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760
Delaware watershed which falls West off
 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.520
Delaware watershed which falls West off
the Catskill Mountains and eventually

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530
the Catskill Mountains and eventually
 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.280
the Catskill Mountains and eventually
would have made it its way down to the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
would have made it its way down to the
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.890
would have made it its way down to the
Delaware River were it not captured in

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900
Delaware River were it not captured in
 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.140
Delaware River were it not captured in
these upstate reservoirs so ninety

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150
these upstate reservoirs so ninety
 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.970
these upstate reservoirs so ninety
percent comes from that source it's a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
percent comes from that source it's a
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.860
percent comes from that source it's a
very very clean source because of the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870
very very clean source because of the
 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.890
very very clean source because of the
relatively minor amount of development

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900
relatively minor amount of development
 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.780
relatively minor amount of development
up in that region the ten percent

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790
up in that region the ten percent
 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.470
up in that region the ten percent
roughly that

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480
roughly that
 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.750
roughly that
comes from the east of Hudson system or

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760
comes from the east of Hudson system or
 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.649
comes from the east of Hudson system or
the the westchester and putnam system

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659
the the westchester and putnam system
 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.869
the the westchester and putnam system
actually is not quite as clean and it's

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879
actually is not quite as clean and it's
 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.089
actually is not quite as clean and it's
it's safe enough to drink but it's much

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099
it's safe enough to drink but it's much
 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.180
it's safe enough to drink but it's much
more has much more pressure on it and is

the problem is you've got to then

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269
the problem is you've got to then
 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.479
the problem is you've got to then
protect the water at its source up in

you got to build a filtration plant

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310
you got to build a filtration plant
 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.770
you got to build a filtration plant
that's the only way you can absolutely

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780
that's the only way you can absolutely
 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.190
that's the only way you can absolutely
safeguard that part of the water supply

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200
safeguard that part of the water supply
 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.500
safeguard that part of the water supply
the problem is of course is once you

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510
the problem is of course is once you
 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.330
the problem is of course is once you

after 911 because of you know the fear

00:07:22.989 --> 00:07:22.999
after 911 because of you know the fear
 

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:25.059
after 911 because of you know the fear
of terrorism and so on and a lot of them

that the the PCB levels and fish are
being maintained at a levels that are

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.250
being maintained at a levels that are
 

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.940
being maintained at a levels that are
too high that exceed the FDA and EPA

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:35.950
too high that exceed the FDA and EPA
 

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.190
too high that exceed the FDA and EPA
regulations so that's why we had to

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:38.200
regulations so that's why we had to
 

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.300
regulations so that's why we had to
close a number of the commercial

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.310
close a number of the commercial
 

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.710
close a number of the commercial
fisheries on the Hudson like the striped

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720
fisheries on the Hudson like the striped
 

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.500
fisheries on the Hudson like the striped

contamination so until we remove you

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:46.750
contamination so until we remove you
 

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.170
contamination so until we remove you
know the couple hundred thousand pounds

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:49.180
know the couple hundred thousand pounds
 

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.630
know the couple hundred thousand pounds
of PCBs are in that hot spot area we're

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:51.640
of PCBs are in that hot spot area we're
 

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.260
of PCBs are in that hot spot area we're
not going to remove or eliminate the

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:55.270
not going to remove or eliminate the
 

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.030
not going to remove or eliminate the
source of PCBs down a lower part of the

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040
source of PCBs down a lower part of the
 

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.800
source of PCBs down a lower part of the
river and until we do that we won't be

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:58.810
river and until we do that we won't be
 

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.450
river and until we do that we won't be
able to be open those those fisheries so

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:00.460
able to be open those those fisheries so
 

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.290
able to be open those those fisheries so
that's one issue another issue is sewage

that's one issue another issue is sewage
you know the Clean Water Act helped us

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:07.030
you know the Clean Water Act helped us
 

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.930
you know the Clean Water Act helped us
to force municipalities to build these

00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559
subsidized for so long that we are not
 

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:39.100
subsidized for so long that we are not
capturing the true cost of using those

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:39.110
capturing the true cost of using those
 

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.020
capturing the true cost of using those
sources you know in terms of all the

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:41.030
sources you know in terms of all the
 

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.130
sources you know in terms of all the
money that goes into building our

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:42.140
money that goes into building our
 

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.880
money that goes into building our
national highway system all the health

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:45.890
national highway system all the health
 

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.370

impacts that burning fossil fuels have

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:48.380
impacts that burning fossil fuels have
 

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.590
impacts that burning fossil fuels have
on our health the climate change impacts

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600
on our health the climate change impacts
 

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.000
on our health the climate change impacts
that were there coming down the road

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.010
that were there coming down the road
 

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.020
that were there coming down the road
that we're already seeing what you're

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:53.030
that we're already seeing what you're
 

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.660
that we're already seeing what you're
going to have huge economic impacts on

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:55.670
going to have huge economic impacts on
 

00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:01.570
going to have huge economic impacts on
our economy and so on so the key in my

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:01.580
our economy and so on so the key in my
 

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.570
our economy and so on so the key in my
view is to is to make carbon emissions

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:04.580
view is to is to make carbon emissions
 

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.970
view is to is to make carbon emissions
cost real money and the only real way

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:06.980
cost real money and the only real way
 

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.410
cost real money and the only real way
the most efficient way to do that is

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:08.420
the most efficient way to do that is
 

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.970
the most efficient way to do that is
through a carbon tax

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:11.980
 

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.410
well

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:13.420
well
 

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.850
well
the truth is that the environmental

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:14.860
the truth is that the environmental
 

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.130
the truth is that the environmental
movement in my view has been enormously

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:17.140
movement in my view has been enormously
 

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.820
movement in my view has been enormously
successful in its you know modern

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:20.830
successful in its you know modern
 

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.890

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:22.900
incarnation you know meaning from the
 

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.300
incarnation you know meaning from the
late 60s early 70s when we passed our

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:27.310
late 60s early 70s when we passed our
 

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.880
late 60s early 70s when we passed our
modern environmental laws till now we've

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:29.890
modern environmental laws till now we've
 

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.400
modern environmental laws till now we've
had cute huge gains here we eliminated

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:32.410
had cute huge gains here we eliminated
 

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:38.310
had cute huge gains here we eliminated
ozone polluting chemicals and and we've

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320
ozone polluting chemicals and and we've
 

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.070
ozone polluting chemicals and and we've
done a lot but the problem is is that

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080
done a lot but the problem is is that
 

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.710
done a lot but the problem is is that
we're such a specialized country that

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720
we're such a specialized country that
 

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.450
we're such a specialized country that
it's really been left up mostly to

the system works don't have a real clear

regulatory way to stop companies from
 

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.980
regulatory way to stop companies from
polluting and you have certainly the

polluting and you have certainly the
 

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.050

concern of a lot of Americans who

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:10.060
concern of a lot of Americans who
 

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.820
concern of a lot of Americans who
support us but they've got a million

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:11.830
support us but they've got a million
 

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.830
support us but they've got a million
concerns and the environment often has

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840
concerns and the environment often has
 

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.390
concerns and the environment often has
kind of ranked low so it's been the

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:15.400
kind of ranked low so it's been the
 

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.890

these these colossally large expensive

that was one of the results of that has

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:35.230
that was one of the results of that has
 

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.630
that was one of the results of that has
been that our progress has been

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640
been that our progress has been
 

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.210
been that our progress has been
relatively incremental and because of

that we are now starting to realize that

that we are now starting to realize that
some of the gains we've that we've made

some of the gains we've that we've made
 

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.620
some of the gains we've that we've made
haven't been nearly enough and you're

haven't been nearly enough and you're
 

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.900
haven't been nearly enough and you're
starting to see real kind of ecological

crisis and collapse potential for
collapse you know when you're talking

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:52.930
collapse you know when you're talking
 

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.170

about our fisheries our air quality you

about our fisheries our air quality you
 

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.980
about our fisheries our air quality you
know record level asthma rates a change

know mother nature is speaking back to

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:03.160
know mother nature is speaking back to
 

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.640

us and telling us that whatever progress

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:05.650
us and telling us that whatever progress

we've made isn't nearly enough and we
got to do a lot more so I think in order

got to do a lot more so I think in order
 

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.530
got to do a lot more so I think in order

everybody has to take a very hard look

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:31.130
everybody has to take a very hard look
 

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.100
everybody has to take a very hard look
at the way that they're living that

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:33.110
at the way that they're living that
 

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.140

we're living together and figure out how

we're living together and figure out how
 

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.570
we're living together and figure out how
to minimize our impact on the on the

groups we've got to have everybody doing
 

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.480
groups we've got to have everybody doing
their part and really making those

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:49.490
their part and really making those

personal lifestyle changes and choices
 

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.190
personal lifestyle changes and choices
in order to minimize that impact and you

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.200
in order to minimize that impact and you
 

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.340
in order to minimize that impact and you
know the myth is I think that it's going

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:57.350
know the myth is I think that it's going
 

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.350
know the myth is I think that it's going
to mean a radically it's giving this

00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360
to mean a radically it's giving this
 

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.230
to mean a radically it's giving this
radical sacrifice and that we are going

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240
radical sacrifice and that we are going
 

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.680
radical sacrifice and that we are going
to have to go back to caveman days and

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:05.690
to have to go back to caveman days and
 

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.140
to have to go back to caveman days and
living very frugally and uncomfortably

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:08.150
living very frugally and uncomfortably
 

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:09.760
living very frugally and uncomfortably
and so on I don't think that has to be

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:09.770
and so on I don't think that has to be
 

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.230
and so on I don't think that has to be
the case at all i think that we can live

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240
the case at all i think that we can live
 

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.640
the case at all i think that we can live
very very comfortable life lives without

so in a certain way you've seen the real

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:00.990
so in a certain way you've seen the real
 

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.720
so in a certain way you've seen the real
movement alone behalf of some of these

corporations but i think that the danger

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:05.460
corporations but i think that the danger
 

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.630
corporations but i think that the danger
is is if we decide that we can consume

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640
is is if we decide that we can consume
 

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.020
is is if we decide that we can consume
just as much as we always have we just

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:12.030
just as much as we always have we just
 

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.300
just as much as we always have we just
have to consume products that have a

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:14.310
have to consume products that have a
 

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.640
have to consume products that have a
slightly less damaging impact on the

slightly less damaging impact on the
environment we're not going to get there

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:18.690
environment we're not going to get there

we really have to change kind of how we

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:22.290
we really have to change kind of how we

we really have to change kind of how we
live our lives and in a more significant

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080
live our lives and in a more significant
 

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.360
live our lives and in a more significant
way than that and i think the part of

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:26.370
way than that and i think the part of
 

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.030
way than that and i think the part of
that is asking ourselves is my level of

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:29.040

planet even if it doesn't emit quite as
much carbon and so on there's a certain

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:35.610
much carbon and so on there's a certain
 

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.490
much carbon and so on there's a certain
point at which we have to maybe not

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500
point at which we have to maybe not
 

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.240
point at which we have to maybe not
consume some so so much now this can the

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:41.250

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.590
danger of what I'm about to say is it
can sound paternalistic but I would

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600
can sound paternalistic but I would
 

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.190
can sound paternalistic but I would
argue that actually consuming less is is

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200
argue that actually consuming less is is
 

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.680

strengthen our stature among elected
officials and other decision-makers you

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:34.409
officials and other decision-makers you
 

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:35.720
officials and other decision-makers you
know you've got to be out and about and

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:35.730
know you've got to be out and about and
 

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:36.710
know you've got to be out and about and
it's going to be doing that work

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720
it's going to be doing that work
 

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.020
it's going to be doing that work
externally and it's easy in a small

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:39.030
externally and it's easy in a small
 

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.750

the kind of day-to-day decisions that
 

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:47.460
the kind of day-to-day decisions that
need to take place

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:47.470
 

00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:50.129
there's no question about it I think

00:34:50.129 --> 00:34:50.139
there's no question about it I think
 

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.119
there's no question about it I think
that the environmental movement in

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:51.129
that the environmental movement in
 

00:34:51.129 --> 00:34:55.409
that the environmental movement in
general has suffered from from seeming

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:55.419
general has suffered from from seeming
 

00:34:55.419 --> 00:34:57.330
general has suffered from from seeming
to represent a pretty narrow segment of

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:57.340
to represent a pretty narrow segment of
 

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.400
to represent a pretty narrow segment of
society and that's not the case

00:34:59.400 --> 00:34:59.410
society and that's not the case
 

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.720
society and that's not the case
obviously you know we're out there

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:00.730
obviously you know we're out there
 

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.730
obviously you know we're out there
fighting for clean water and clean air

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:02.740
fighting for clean water and clean air
 

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.730
fighting for clean water and clean air
and saw we're doing for everybody of all

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740
and saw we're doing for everybody of all
 

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.310
and saw we're doing for everybody of all
economic or income levels of all races

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320
economic or income levels of all races

parties and so on you know there's no

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:13.510
parties and so on you know there's no
 

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.030
parties and so on you know there's no
discrimination in terms of work that

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040
discrimination in terms of work that
 

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.060
discrimination in terms of work that
we're doing but largely speaking the

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:18.070
we're doing but largely speaking the
 

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.650
we're doing but largely speaking the
environmental movement over the last 34

environmental movement over the last 34
 

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.940
environmental movement over the last 34
years has been dominated by by middle

the upper class you know white folks who

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920
the upper class you know white folks who
 

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.500
the upper class you know white folks who
have been leaving the charge on this

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:28.510
have been leaving the charge on this
 

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.450
have been leaving the charge on this
stuff and I think that's unfortunate i

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:30.460
stuff and I think that's unfortunate i
 

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.950
stuff and I think that's unfortunate i
mean i think there's some kind of

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960
mean i think there's some kind of
 

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.650
mean i think there's some kind of
reasonable explanations for that but

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:34.660
reasonable explanations for that but
 

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.620
reasonable explanations for that but
it's it's unsustainable because it's had

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:37.630
it's it's unsustainable because it's had
 

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.630
it's it's unsustainable because it's had
a couple of effects first of all we're

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:39.640
a couple of effects first of all we're
 

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.320
a couple of effects first of all we're
failing to reach a large segments of the

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:43.330
failing to reach a large segments of the
 

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.690
failing to reach a large segments of the
population that are actually being even

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:45.700
population that are actually being even
 

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.220
population that are actually being even
more hammered by environmental pollution

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:47.230
more hammered by environmental pollution
 

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.250
more hammered by environmental pollution
than a lot of the kind of you know upper

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:50.260
than a lot of the kind of you know upper
 

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.880
than a lot of the kind of you know upper
middle-class folks who are who are part

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:53.890
middle-class folks who are who are part
 

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.920
middle-class folks who are who are part
of these organizations so they have even

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:55.930
of these organizations so they have even
 

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.380
of these organizations so they have even
more at stake if you live in a urban

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:58.390
more at stake if you live in a urban
 

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:01.500
more at stake if you live in a urban
area or a low income area whether it's a

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:01.510
area or a low income area whether it's a
 

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:04.170
area or a low income area whether it's a
you know or a rural area and so on a lot

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:04.180
you know or a rural area and so on a lot
 

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.550
you know or a rural area and so on a lot
of times you're more subjected to air

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:05.560
of times you're more subjected to air
 

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.990
of times you're more subjected to air
and water pollution than other

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000
and water pollution than other
 

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.079
and water pollution than other
communities I also think that we have

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:10.089
communities I also think that we have
 

00:36:10.089 --> 00:36:13.500
communities I also think that we have
not done a good job of appealing to

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:13.510
not done a good job of appealing to
 

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.839
not done a good job of appealing to
folks as well and I think that that's

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:15.849
folks as well and I think that that's
 

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:19.020
folks as well and I think that that's

America in particular because we we have
 

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.610
