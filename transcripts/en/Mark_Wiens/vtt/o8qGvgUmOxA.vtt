00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
but it looks very similar to a chayote which is kind of like a small melon type of a

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.049
Vegetable and in fact, I'm just going to start with that immediately

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.719
Good morning, everyone. It's Mark wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.810
Oh thank you oh

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.429
No, thank you. It's another freezing cold morning

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.009
I'm sitting at my laptop this morning, and I am warming myself with a cup of tea

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.809
[and] we just opened the window to get that sunlight that sunlight makes all the difference and

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.989
And this is a pretty nice office today as well

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.849
I'm gonna sit here and try to get a little bit of a

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.729
picture editing done, and then after that we're gonna have breakfast and then we're gonna head start driving back to Thimpu

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.890
Now it is time for breakfast, so I'm starting off with my power tea, bhutanese butter tea

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.239
Hmm. Oh yeah, that is good. It's a salty version today and

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.249
Yeah, nice, and salty and very buttery it tastes good

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.140
Thank you, Che, che

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.709
Che Che is serving me some of the eazy and today for breakfast. We are having rice and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.220
Omelette and this is Bhutanese white rice

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.129
which is a little bit different from the normally we've been eating bhutanese Red rice and so

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.210
Yeah, I don't think I've even eaten white rice actually since being here

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.420
And then I also just got a little bit of that

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.659
Cottage cheese fried in butter that we had last night left over from last night heated fresh. This is a good

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.240
simple and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.860
Wonderful my kind of a breakfast oh and that that rice is really fluffy feeling

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.569
I've gotta squeeze myself a ball of rice and I'm gonna break off a piece of omelette

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.999
And eat it with that little ball of rice plus some of that eazy

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.629
Well that is so good mmM that rice. It's kind of similar to basmati rice

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.479
It's nice and fluffy and then with that that's the same eazy that we had last night

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.939
Just the chopped-up green chillies with that tree tomato. I think there are some green onions in there as well and

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.029
a little bit of cottage cheese for Flavor

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.030
Mmm. Yeah that is like the purest of all cottage cheese

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.230
..........

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.130
Oh, that is a good breakfast again

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.419
We are all packed up and ready to go and just taking a little walk around the turnip field there are some

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.959
Gigantic turnips and radishes in the field and we're going to start driving back to Thimpu

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.200
 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.690
On the drive up the mountain. We just came across some yaks so we just stopped to take some photos

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.200
I'm kind of scared of getting too close though

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.419
But I think they're pretty nice. They're just hanging out Chillin

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.749
Please come in. Oh  thank you very much. Oh. Yeah, we go

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:05.760
Establishing two kitchens, okay. One traditional kitchen and one modern kitchen. Oh wow. Traditional kitchen is not yet complete

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.500
My wife Ghelmo

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.160
And norbu

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
Staff. Wow very nice

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.830
So traditional kitchen is not yet

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.820
finished

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.820
okay, hopefully

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.460
Soon we  complete this one and we will be using this one

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.390
We drove for about four hours

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.349
And we arrived to Wangdue and we're just stopping by for lunch at a place called

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.849
Wangdue Eco Lodge, and this is a newly opened Eco-Lodge. It's really nice a great view of where the

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.259
Rivers meet as well as the Wangdue dzong which is being rebuilt after a recent fire

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.580
But this is a really nice place and the owner is

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.260
Actually the author of a bhutanese cookbook, and he's a really nice guy

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.869
He showed us around and we're gonna have lunch here, and I'm not sure what we're gonna eat yet

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.210
Foreign language

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.890
There's a real variety of different dishes that we have this plate. We have the red rice

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.930
there are some noodles which are from the Bumthang district of Bhutan

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.539
some mushrooms these are some potatoes, and then this is a like a little a

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.050
Bit of beef with tofu, and then this is the pumpkin soup there are some side dishes as well

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.710
Oh, I like this pumpkin soup just nice pieces of pumpkin

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.360
Mmm. [oh]

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.059
That is good. The natural taste of the pumpkin and then it has a little bit of a

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.799
Kind of a Smoky flavor almost like it almost tastes like bacon

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.589
I will start with adding some of the eazy to my rice

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.400
This is made with fresh chilies, and it looks like there's some cheese in here as well. Okay. That's some of that

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.950
ohooo that looks delicious. This is a beautiful looking version of Ema datshi

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.999
Which is chilies and cheese, and there's also a spinach in here. That's a nice

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.670
nice addition

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.780
Oh that looks beautiful. Okay. We call it ahh senchu beka

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.620
Senchu beka

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.310
That's it

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:31.229
but it looks very similar to a chayote which is kind of like a small melon type of a

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.019
Vegetable, okay, let me add some of this to my rice

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.790
Ohhhh looks delicious, and in fact. I'm just gonna start with that immediately

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:48.929
it's very similar to a winter melon with a thick cheese sauce but it's not too rich, but just good flavor and

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.620
creamy as well

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.510
I Like the addition of spinach in there the spinach has a little bit of a bitter taste

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.539
Which is really good and then?

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.919
Yeah, it actually complements the chilies and the cheese really nicely okay

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:09.478
And I also really want to try some of this beef minced beef with tofu

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.479
I don't think that's a that's a bhutanese dish I have not tried yet

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.630
Oh that is marvelous that tastes like yeah like minced beef

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:33.750
I'm not sure if I taste the tofu very lightly and then it has kind of a brown beef gravy flavor to it

00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:35.529
but like a

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:40.289
Really good flavor. Maybe a little bit of ginger as well Jang Bury and

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:48.239
They look very similar to udon, and I think they are spiced with I'm not sure what and then some green onions.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.070
Oh you can taste the garlic

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.640
On that yeah, that's almost identical to Japanese udon

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.650
but very

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.719
tastes very fresh and very handmade, and then I love that just that

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:11.309
Kind of like, like a glaze of garlic and szechuan pepper call that gives it some good flavor

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.089
Okay, let me try this potato. It looks like a barbecue sauce potato

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.940
oh

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.670
Wow

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.260
Mmm. That is really good. It's kind of crispy on the outside

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.609
Red Mm-Hmm. That does taste kind of like a

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.860
Tangy Barbecue sauce it's like a an entire potato french fry

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.980
coated in barbecue sauce and

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.099
I love the potatoes because they have that that silky texture to them instead of being dry and starchy

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.760
just finished with lunch that was an incredibly good meal and

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.720
Really good quality food as well everything prepared

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:58.140
homestyle, I'm now gonna have dessert and this is I believe a fried banana and

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.800
Maybe drizzled in a little bit of honey

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.969
Oh that is hot mmm that is freshly fried

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:17.510
It's crispy and then the banana is really almost like custardy on the inside

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.780
Thank you

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.740
and also the owner he's

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:40.330
Really cool guy. He's working on a second edition of his bhutanese food cookbook and so he's he's also

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.999
He's actually I think we share many of the same

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:49.119
interests for traveling and eating and so we connected with him well and also Che che

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:56.439
Treated us for lunch so big thank you to a Che Che a really cool place. We are now heading

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.670
I think we have about three more hours to drive to get back to Thimphu now

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:11.210
We just passed through the pass and just a quick roadside stop to buy some local apples and also

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.960
We saw some walnuts, so I will never miss an opportunity to buy some walnuts

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.020
This one Ying?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:29.860
And then what else Ying? Ya this one is 200 this one is 150

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:45.530
We're about an hour away from Thimphu City now, so that was a good stop. I'm gonna be eating some walnuts tonight

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:11.269
That was the highlight of my time so far in Bhutan I really enjoyed staying in the farmhouse is really

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:17.269
Really great way to experience bhutanese culture when staying at the farm stays and living with a local family

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:24.588
the cold Ying and I are not used to the cold so it was a bit freezing cold for us, but still really [good] and

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:27.300
That was yeah

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:34.129
Extremely, enjoyable. I want to say a big thank you to Che Che who went with us for the entire trip

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.289
She's really cool so big thank you to her and also to Tenzin our driver

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.779
Really nice guy as well, and we had a great trip tomorrow
