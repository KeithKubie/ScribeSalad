00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:01.610
[SLIDE CLICKS]

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.840
INTERVIEWER: These
uniquely-colored pools sitting

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.220
in what looks like the
literal middle of nowhere

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.080
are no doubt strange, but
they're also somewhat familiar.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.380
If you've ever stared out
the window of an airplane,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.560
you must have seen something
like this, different patterns,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.240
grids, and shapes.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.770
It's a perspective
that you can only

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.300
get when traveling thousands
of feet in the air.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.000
ALEXANDER HEILNER: Hi, my
name is Alexander Heilner.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.190
I am a photographer
and an artist

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.750
living in Baltimore, Maryland.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.610
I teach at the Maryland
Institute College

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.520
of Art or MICA, where I'm
a professor of photography

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.920
and digital imaging.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610
INTERVIEWER: Alexander is a
specific type of photographer

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.224
who enjoys taking pictures from
a different angle than most.

00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:45.890
ALEXANDER HEILNER:
For many, many years,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.710
I've been making a lot of
artwork and particularly

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.770
landscape photography,
which is really

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.060
focused on where the natural
and artificial elements

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.900
of our world coexist.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.360
About 10 years ago, I began
hiring small planes and pilots

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.970
to take a look at the
landscape from up above

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.010
and start documenting
places where

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.344
it seemed like we'd been leaving
huge marks on the landscape.

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:13.760
INTERVIEWER: And one of the
landscapes that caught his eye

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.260
was this place, a potash
mine in southern Utah.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.610
ALEXANDER HEILNER: Potash
is a substance that

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.492
has been used since ancient
times for a number of uses,

00:01:23.492 --> 00:01:25.450
but in the last couple
hundred years has mainly

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.060
been used as a fertilizer.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.180
And just basically, it's
one of the main ways

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.700
of getting potassium,
which is one

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.247
of the most fundamental elements
that plants need to grow well.

00:01:35.247 --> 00:01:37.330
INTERVIEWER: The potash
is hidden away underground

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.140
so mining companies pump
water down after it,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.310
flushing it out into
these great big pools

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.770
where they sit until all
the water has evaporated,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.822
leaving only the potash.

00:01:47.822 --> 00:01:49.280
ALEXANDER HEILNER:
In June of 2007,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.920
I was flying across the
country on a commercial flight

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.490
from New York to San Francisco
and I looked out my window

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.073
somewhere on the
middle of the flight.

00:01:56.073 --> 00:01:58.210
And way off in the
distance, in the middle

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.070
of a stark, red
desert landscape were

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.700
these amazing
pools of blue water

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.280
just shimmering on the horizon.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.690
It was absolutely magical.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.410
It's rare that I've seen
anything that stunning

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.470
and that surprising even
in all the flying I've

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.170
done back and forth
across the country.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.500
INTERVIEWER: Alexander was
so transfixed by the sight

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.460
that he soon returned,
hired a small airplane,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.940
and shot these photos.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.440
ALEXANDER HEILNER:
The abstract ones

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.064
are really beautiful
and really amazing

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.610
in a way that really engages
your eye and your senses

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.410
and asks you questions almost
about what is photography

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.810
and what is painting
and what is mining

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.340
and what is the landscape.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.110
I think almost any
place can be the subject

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.830
of an amazing photograph.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.790
I hope that these images
are inspiring to others

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.787
to look around and see their
world a little bit differently.

00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:51.120
