00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.210
Travel can be tough, the sun sets at the wrong
time, rises too early or too late and no matter

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.919
how much mental power you put toward the solution
-- it always seems like a fight against yourself.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.619
What if a simple DNA tweak made jet lag a
memory forever...

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:23.970
I fly a lot for this job.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.199
In the first few weeks of 2015, I was in five
different time zones, two countries and who

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.259
knows how many hours of sleep were lost…

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.180
Zipping from timezone to timezone makes us
feel awful but why?!

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.720
Desynchronosis.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.180
Desynchronosis is when your internal circadian
rhythm -- your biological clock -- gets out

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.860
of sync with the clock out here in the world.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.251
Every day, your body has controlled and regular
releases of proteins, sugars, hormones -- all

00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:49.890
based on your internal circadian rhythm.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.760
When that cycle gets out of sync, the cyclical
upheaval affects hunger cycles, eating habits,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.460
bowel habits, and (of course) sleep patterns.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.630
Symptoms include headaches, drowsiness, lethargy,
irritability, mild depression, attention deficit,

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.970
disorientation and even diarrhea or constipation!

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.860
Researchers have found the dry airplane environment,
changes in pressure and the time-difference

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.740
on arrival may all affect the condition, but
the biggest problem is sunlight.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.080
As you know if you've watched DNews regularly,
the hormone melatonin keeps your sleep-wake

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.220
cycle in sync which drives your circadian
rhythm.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.770
The suprachiasmatic nucleus -- in the hypothalamus
-- cuts melatonin production when there's

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.560
more light and amps it up when there is less.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.750
The further afield you go, the more out-of-sync
your body is with the regular day-night cycle;

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.241
so when sunlight hits your retina at the wrong
time, your body gets all messed up and you

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:45.070
experience desynchronosis; this is especially
true when going East, as the day gets longer.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.200
But, a study in mice from a 2013 issue of
Cell, looked at the connections from the retina

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.340
to the SCN and how a chemical called Sik1
acted as a chemical snooze button, telling

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.000
the SCN to stop preparing the body to change
the sleep-wake cycle!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.760
Unfortunately, they didn't know quite how
to use it, just that it was involved.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.000
And now, a new study in eLife found jet lag
might be cured by tweaking the single gene

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.340
that controls that sleep-wake cycle.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.779
While doing research on dementia, researchers
at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:23.080
found there were 213 genes which controlled
the suprachiasmatic nucleus, one of those,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.819
LHX1, is coded just for light sensing!

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.540
Those mice without LHX1 recovered from an
8 hour jet lag much more quickly than those

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.849
without it!

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.060
There were side effects, though.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.400
The mice they tested couldn't live like that
forever, their neurons weren't as in-sync

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.780
as the normal mice.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.709
Plus, there was a decrease of an intestinal
peptide called Vip, which no one knew was

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.469
related to the SCN.

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:52.001
Vip affects cell communication… so from
there scientists think we should go on to

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:56.249
research Vip -- because perhaps by breaking
it down more quickly, we could rapidly get

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:57.249
over jet lag.

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:02.109
The best way to get over it, without messing
with our genes, is a matter of debate.

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.659
Intriguingly, a small double-blind study by
the British Medical Journal, found taking

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.940
melatonin had pretty much no more effect than
a placebo; but another study found it was

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.559
quote "remarkably effective!"

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.810
So, it might be something you should try.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.760
A study in Cell Reports found insulin may
help regulate the circadian rhythm!

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.760
So, maybe, eating carbs could synchronize
the stomach clock more quickly than other

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.809
foods, possibly pulling the rest of the body
clock with it.

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:31.590
For myself, I try to stay awake until a "normal"
bed time -- say 10pm, and then wake up at

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.749
a "normal" wake up time -- 8 or 9.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:38.489
By doing so, the clock internally is forced
into the new time.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.480
It also helps to keeping lights dim before
sleep and bright in the morning -- both at

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.750
home AND on the go… even NASA recommends
doing this; as it helps continually train

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.969
your SCN to respond.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.980
Daylight is the best thing, according to The
National Sleep Foundation, because it quickly

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.180
resets your SCN; while being indoors is the
worrrst.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.260
They also recommend waking up with an alarm,
not oversleeping; and to avoid alcohol and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.719
caffeine, because they'll further complicate
your sleep-wake cycle.

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.719
In the end, desynchronosis is a brand new
human condition; it's only existed for about

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:07.719
100 years, and it's about as first-world as
problems can get.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:08.719
Most humans simply can't travel far enough,
fast enough, to experience it, but if you

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.719
do; good night, and good luck.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:10.719
Of course, jet lag only REALLY happens if
you get into an airplane and fly somewhere.

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:11.780
Which has it's own set of problems.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.930
Ever wondered why airplane meals are always
terrible?

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.019
You lose some sensing abilities in flight…
but I won't spoil it.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:35.560
My buddy Julian explains for you, (right here)
What's the worst 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.169
jet lag you've ever experienced?

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:47.419
Tell us how you dealt with it.
