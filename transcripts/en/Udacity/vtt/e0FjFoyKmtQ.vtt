Hello, your watching
the UDusky Offline first course,

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:05.817
I'm Jake Archibald
broadcasting from London.

00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:08.893
But we now go live to our US
correspondent Mike Wales.

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:09.790
Hi, Mike.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.293
How's the weather over there?

00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:17.664
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Mike, Mike, you're breaking up.

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:21.683
You some like two dialects
having a rap battle.

00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:23.185
&gt;&gt; Can you hear me now?

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:25.583
&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, go ahead.

00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:32.692
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think he's gone.

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:39.233
We had this whole news reader thing
planned, it was going to be fun.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.434
With home broadband and

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:44.110
smart phones, the human race is
increasingly reliant on the internet.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.223
But the internet isn't always with us.

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:47.753
I'm sure you're familiar with this.

00:00:47.753 --> 00:00:50.035
[MUSIC]

00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:51.479
&gt;&gt; That kind of thing.

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.815
The sinking feeling of being
abandoned by connectivity.

00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:57.536
You're stuck outside while
the internet parties without you.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:00:59.970
You can only imagine what
you're missing out on.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.105
It could be anything,
literally anything.

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:06.177
A new video of a cat, a politician
saying something stupid, world peace

00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:10.404
could be solved in 140 characters,
but you don't get to hear about it.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:11.770
All you get is.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.624
[MUSIC].

00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:16.355
Total failure in the face of
connectivity issues is a worst case

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:16.878
scenario.

00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:20.192
And it's all too common on the web,
but no longer.

00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:23.329
In this course we're going to
cover how you can build sites and

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.174
apps that work great what
ever connection the user has.

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:29.119
We're going to use service worker
to intercept network traffic,

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.252
explore the latest service
work at dev tools.

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:35.511
We're going to tame IDB, the in browser
database, and explore user experience

00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:39.030
strategies to deal with varying
network conditions and updates.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.010
Overall we want to make
[NOISE] a thing of the past.
