00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:06.000
[bright music]

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.366
Nteff: I'm Alain Nteff.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.666
I'm a 23-year-old
Cameroonian.

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.166
I'm from a very
modest background,

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.066
from a single-mom family
in Bamenda.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.066
While growing up,

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.033
I've always wanted
to be a medical doctor,

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:21.833
but to innovate
in the medical space,

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.466
you need, like,
30 years of experience.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.133
But then I realized that,
with mobile technology,

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.000
I could innovate
and generate change

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.633
in people's lives
a lot faster.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.366
Tankou: I'm Conrad Tankou.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.700
As a doctor,
one of my biggest fights

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.066
is to try to solve this problem

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.966
of maternal
and infant mortality,

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.400
and trying to use technology

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.966
to be able to attend this

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.066
in even rural areas

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.066
is one of the greatest
things for me.

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.666
Nteff:
The question on our minds was,

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.133
"How come we still have maternal
infant mortality

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.666
being such a very big problem?"

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.666
After doing research,

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.300
we noticed that it was
a problem of education.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.500
We saw mobile
as a very good channel

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.966
due to the penetration,

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.600
and together with Dr. Conrad,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.800
we decided to start GiftedMom.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.166
Tankou:
GiftedMom is an application

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.933
which contains basic
and simplified information

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.833
concerning pregnancy,
breastfeeding,

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.233
and vaccination for children.

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.033
The beginning was
really an adventure,

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.366
but when we built the app
and started testing,

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.366
it was really exciting,

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.833
because the reaction of those
who were using the app--

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:17.833
they were really excited.

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.266
It was a technology--

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.466
some of them had never seen
something like that before,

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.533
and also having
everything on one app--

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.933
all of them wanted to have it.

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.266
Nteff:
It was very important for us

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.933
to build
the GiftedMom application

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:29.933
to make it lightweight

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.000
in such a way that
it can easily be downloaded.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.933
Also, we provided content

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.800
that can be accessible
even offline.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.433
Tankou: The network coverage
in Cameroon is very good.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.733
Even in some rural areas

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.233
where you don't
find electricity,

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.500
you can really have
access to the internet.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.766
Nteff: We've noticed that 70% of
smartphone users across Africa

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:48.833
are on Android;

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.033
I want to leverage on this

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.333
to have 5 million users
across the continent

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.466
in the next three years.

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.400
Tankou: Consider the fact
that maternal mortality

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.300
and infant mortality
is a worldwide problem.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.800
One of our objectives is not
only to concentrate in Cameroon

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.333
but spread this concept
to other developing countries.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.666
Nteff:
Spending a lot of resources

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.266
and building health facilities
is going to come,

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.833
but in a very long time.

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:08.566
But with smartphone penetration,

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:12.500
we can actually provide people
with lifesaving information.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.400
Seeing the GiftedMom app
on the Play Store

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.866
was very exciting for us,

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.533
because it was one of our first
products out there,

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:22.233
and it was just amazing
how we could sit in our rooms,

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:23.666
create something,
put it out there,

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:26.133
and it's accessible
to the whole world.

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.933
Tankou: When we were
building the application,

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.800
some [indistinct] medical
professionals were like,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
"Is this going to work?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.266
"Are you sure that what
you're aiming to build

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.633
is going to be that productive?"

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:34.633
And when it came out,

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:35.833
all of them were shocked,

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:37.700
and they were like,
encouraged,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.800
and they went through the app

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.866
and gave us all this ideas
to develop it more.

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.233
It makes me really proud,

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:43.566
and it's also, like,
motivational

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:45.433
to keep moving forward, yeah.

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:46.733
Nteff:
It has been very inspiring

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.666
just seeing the app
that we have done

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:50.133
actually serving a purpose

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.566
in our rural communities,

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:53.933
and each time a woman
in this rural area

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:55.166
just loads the application

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.433
and we see popping up,
"GiftedMom,"

00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:59.800
it's like--
there's just this joy, man,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.033
and you're like,
"I'm going to go do better."
