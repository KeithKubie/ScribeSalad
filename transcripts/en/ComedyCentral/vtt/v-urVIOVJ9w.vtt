I DON'T EVEN THINK THAT THIS IS
ABOUT CHESS.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:48.034 line:91%
THIS IS ABOUT RUSSIA BECAUSE
WHAT'S THE ONLY THING RUSSIANS

THEY HAVE MORE WORLD CHAMPIONS
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY.

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:04.350 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHO IS THEIR
CURRENT CHAMPION?

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:05.685 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WELL, OFFICIALLY, PUTIN.

I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS ON A
REAL HORSE.

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:16.229 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DON'T LOOK BECAUSE YOU JUST
SEE THE NIPPLES.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:16.896 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU DON'T REALIZE.

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.197 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.467 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT HERE'S MY POINT, AMERICA HAS
BEEN TRYING TO GET BACK AT

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.939 line:91%
RUSSIA FOR STEALING CRIMEA, YOU

&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.

00:03:30.742 --> 00:03:33.212 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE
RUSSIA'S PLACE AS THE WORLD

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:37.149 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHESS SUPER POWER BECAUSE YOU
KNOW THAT WOULD REALLY HURT THEM
