JAKE ARCHIBALD: Hey, Paul.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.110
PAUL LEWIS: Hello, Jake.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.540
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We made it.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.229
We made it across
the narrow sea.

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:09.520
PAUL LEWIS: Big, bleeney wings.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.230
We actually made it.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.570
Help, we landed.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.310
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So did you
enjoy the keynote yesterday?

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.280
Was it good for you?

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.040
PAUL LEWIS: It was, actually.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.430
I was looking at a massive
screen around the whole thing.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.962
And I was like, I've
got to get one for home.

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:24.670
I don't know why.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.040
I can't even justify
that to my family, but--

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.970
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But
they don't release films

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.042
in that aspect ratio.

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:30.000
You gonna have trouble.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.579
You're just gonna basically
see a pair of eyes.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.370
PAUL LEWIS: I know.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.245
I haven't got a plan.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:37.050
Although what I think is maybe
if you got one of those GoPro

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.330
rigs that they showed.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.670
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, the ones
on the cardboard segment?

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.336
PAUL LEWIS: Yes.

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:42.122
That was amazing.

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:44.330
I've got to find a business
justification for getting

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.190
one of those in my life.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.040
I don't know.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.040
Maybe I need a stereographic
version of my toilet

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.270
at home or something.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.202
JAKE ARCHIBALD: What
would you-- Hang on.

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:55.910
Actually, I know.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.030
So I'm comfortable
going into the toilet

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.010
in unfamiliar places.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.950
So what will you guys do?

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.751
You're going to have
that set up at home,

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:06.750
so when you're on the
toilet in a strange place,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.720
you can wear cardboard and
have a live link back to home.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.970
PAUL LEWIS: Or just get one
of those screens installed

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.110
around the place.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.917
So I can just have
that curves around.

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:19.500
I'm not quite sure
how this works out,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980
but I think it's very important.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.870
I also noticed in the keynote
that if you stop talking,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.180
people start applauding.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.630
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, that
must be really awkward

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.100
for presenters, because you
have to just keep making noises.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.970
PAUL LEWIS: Blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.940
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Because
otherwise, yeah, an applause

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.200
erupts out and spreads
through the audience.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.250
There was nothing
I noticed, as well.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.950
When there was an
applause erupted,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.209
the camera would
switch to the audience

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:47.250
to pick up that reaction.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.960
But the camera on
it always found

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.424
a section of the audience
looking completely indifferent.

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:52.090
PAUL LEWIS: Yes.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.820
Yeah.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.737
It's not quite-- Yeah.

00:01:53.737 --> 00:01:55.945
I sort of was like, where's
the applause coming from?

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:56.980
Is it an applause track?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.760
Yeah.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.140
Well sometimes it was just
an audience who's like, yeah,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.725
whatever.

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:02.350
But then occasionally
you get a section

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.480
of people who-- they almost
look like they were trying

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.700
to work out who just farted.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.540
You know?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.831
Like there was a sort of like--

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:11.230
PAUL LEWIS: With
that said, there

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.880
was some amazing
announcements yesterday.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.687
Like, well what did you notice?

00:02:15.687 --> 00:02:16.520
Let me ask you that.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.380
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, I would
say, from an engineering

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.530
perspective, my favorite
thing was the Google Photos.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.520
PAUL LEWIS: Yes.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.020
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Because I went away,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.420
and I was playing around
with-- just doing a search.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.930
Like a search for cats.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.782
But then even more complicated
things, like yellow car.

00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:34.490
And it was bringing
up photos I had taken

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.573
that were of those things.

00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:37.030
PAUL LEWIS: Really?

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.750
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
It's kind of creepy.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.791
It's almost like it's
starting to get self aware.

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:42.104
I hope they've got a pair
of pliers next to the cable,

00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:44.520
connected to the computer
that's doing all that, because--

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.103
PAUL LEWIS: That is
always the mistake

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:48.730
when you've got an
apocalyptic computer takeover.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.345
Nobody remembers that you've
got to be able to cut the power.

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:52.178
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep.

00:02:52.178 --> 00:02:53.850
And if that thing
gets into the world,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.910
it can become self
aware, it's going

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.950
to be identifying
yellow cars everywhere.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.680
And that's gonna be a problem.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.230
PAUL LEWIS: What happens next?

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.855
Nobody knows what
happens next after it

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:03.280
identifies all the yellow cars.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.863
It's probably just
going to sit there,

00:03:04.863 --> 00:03:07.010
idly going, no more yellow cars.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.960
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yellow
car, red car, cat.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.470
But that will somehow
lead to the apocalypse.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.660
So that's something
to look forward to.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.060
PAUL LEWIS: It kind of has to.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.977
I noticed from custom tabs,
that really caught my attention.

00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:19.310
Because I was thinking about it.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.520
It's like today, when you've
got the Twitter native app

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.830
on Android, you can
tap into a link there,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.860
and it will load of the WebView.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.190
And then you can
then go to Twitter,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.200
like follow some
links, go to Twitter.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.160
And then it will ask you to
sign into Twitter, in a WebView,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.660
inside the Twitter
[? native ?] app.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.990
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Twitter
inside of Twitter inside

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.531
of Twitter inside
of Twitter inside--

00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:43.767
and browsing the
web in a web view,

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:44.850
it makes me a bit nervous.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.433
Well, it's problematic, because
you don't have the same cookie

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.370
jar, the same cache,
the same service where

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.420
you've got local storage,
all of those things.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.317
But it worries me when I see
a login screen in a web view,

00:03:55.317 --> 00:03:55.900
and in an app.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.470
Because I don't have
access to the URL.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.580
I'm like, well, that looks
like a Google login screen

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.200
or a Twitter log in screen.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.220
PAUL LEWIS: But is it?

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.370
And you don't want to find out.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.580
You don't want to
be going like, yeah,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.070
I just gave out my password.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.360
But generally, it just felt like
it was a really good match of,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.430
this is Chrome-- it is
Chrome, as you sort of expect.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.840
But from a user, or even
a product point of view,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.047
it's like it's
branded such that it

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.630
feels like it's part
of the experience

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.838
that you're currently having.

00:04:18.838 --> 00:04:20.970
It felt like a really good
understanding of-- you

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.130
want the web to be part
of a native experience.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.380
And it just felt like a
really good way of doing that.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.370
So hopefully, I think, we'll
see more people targeting that.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.161
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So one
of things that we've

00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:32.340
seen be proposed or start
to come out recently

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.600
is Facebook instant
articles, right?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.597
And I don't know about
you, but because I'm

00:04:38.597 --> 00:04:41.180
such a fan of the web, I was a
little bit. worried about that.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.830
Because it's like
they're saying,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.371
oh, the webs not good enough,
so we've kind of reinvented it.

00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:47.810
And if you look at
the JSON for something

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.150
like Facebook instant
articles, they'll

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.569
have an object that
represents a paragraph.

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.110
It will have a type
and the type will

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.474
be in [? couplets ?] paragraph.

00:04:55.474 --> 00:04:57.140
And it's got a little
bit more metadata.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.660
And then the text
for the paragraph

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.779
is actually more
verbose than HTML.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:01.570
PAUL LEWIS: Really?

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.945
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:02.945 --> 00:05:04.910
But the reason it
becomes fast is things

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.290
like it's able to
preload it, warm it up.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.626
And it does kind of stop.

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:11.250
It doesn't have the features of
the web that make the web slow.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.916
It's not inherently
faster than the web,

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:14.895
but you can't put eight
IFrames within IFrames.

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:16.270
PAUL LEWIS: So
it's like skirting

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.230
around those potential
foot [? guns ?]?

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.730
Right.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.980
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I'm
kind of really excited

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.105
about the custom tabs thing,
from that perspective,

00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:24.870
because within the app, you
could warm up the browser,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.240
you can warm up the content.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.525
So you get that instant
feel, but it is kind of

00:05:28.525 --> 00:05:31.600
down to developers
to go that extra mile

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.350
and well, no-- not
even go the extra mile.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.920
It's to walk back
the extra mile,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.320
and not do the stuff
that slows the web down.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.870
Yeah, reverse, reverse.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.497
Take all this iframes
and scroll handlers out.

00:05:41.497 --> 00:05:43.330
PAUL LEWIS: Talkign
about the beeping thing,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.920
I was walking past
the street here,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.090
and was just walking along
on the sidewalk, and all

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.840
of a sudden, it's like
wah, wah, wah, wah--

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.520
and it was like,
there's a car coming.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.490
Don't die.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.990
I was like--

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's a good
instruction for life though.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.410
PAUL LEWIS: I felt like it
was a very helpful thing.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.990
What was more concerning was
that the volume of the thing

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.230
was so sudden and so loud--

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You actually
jumped out into the road,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.730
by accident and got mowed
down by an oncoming bus.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.000
PAUL LEWIS: It felt
like it could've

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.340
done with a little bit
of easing in there.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.870
It just felt like the user
experience was, don't die,

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.203
but you might die from the
thing telling you not to die.

00:06:15.203 --> 00:06:17.360
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So there's
so many people here.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.510
It's absolutely incredible.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.630
And I don't know about
you, but I'm a nerd.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.410
I'm a proper nerd.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.550
PAUL LEWIS: I had noticed.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.330
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I have all
of the social foibles that

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.066
come with that.

00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:28.690
And we've been meeting
a lot of people,

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.020
saying hi, talking
about the web.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.854
And I just feel like that
amount of new people,

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:35.770
but also people I haven't
seen in a long time.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.521
I'm feeling like I've got a
really high error rate when

00:06:38.521 --> 00:06:39.770
it comes to social encounters.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.450
PAUL LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.570
I'm exactly the same.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.720
I don't know quite
what to do about it.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.590
Because it's like,
I want to be here.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.798
I want to meet with you,
and I want to talk with you,

00:06:45.798 --> 00:06:47.990
but my ego can't really
cope with the fact

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.830
that I'm just doing a terrible
job of being a human being.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.530
A sociable human being.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.450
It's like normally
they edit us when

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.870
we do videos and all
the rest, to make

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.280
us actually seem pretty normal.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.031
So I'm fine with--

00:07:00.031 --> 00:07:01.571
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Someone will come up,

00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:02.630
and I'll say hello wrong.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.796
Something as simple as that.

00:07:03.796 --> 00:07:06.702
In my mind, I'm like, oh,
you messed up a Hello.

00:07:06.702 --> 00:07:08.410
It's only going to go
downhill from here.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.785
PAUL LEWIS: Oh, your brain
goes into the two track thing,

00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:11.979
right?

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:14.020
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Commentary
for how terrible a job

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.880
you're doing at life.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.090
PAUL LEWIS: The worst one of
those that ever happened to me

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.970
was, I was on stage,
and I actually managed

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.254
to dislocate my shoulder.

00:07:20.254 --> 00:07:22.170
It's something that I've
done enough times now

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.202
that it can happen to me.

00:07:24.202 --> 00:07:26.660
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It almost sounds
like you do it on purpose.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.304
Sometimes.

00:07:27.304 --> 00:07:28.470
PAUL LEWIS: Got the t-shirt.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.050
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Got nothing
else to do for the next hour.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.240
Might just pop the shoulder our.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.240
PAUL LEWIS: Pretty much.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.860
So I dislocated it, and I'm
in front of all these people.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.150
And my brain went
into that two track.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.030
The one part went, oh you
dislocated your shoulder, mate.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.979
This is not good.

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.520
And the other one
was, I always think

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.686
as more of a thespian voice.

00:07:43.686 --> 00:07:46.212
The show must go on.

00:07:46.212 --> 00:07:47.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Be
the hero of the stage.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.540
PAUL LEWIS: Pretty much.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.039
Pretty much.

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:52.327
And so at that point, I
was just like, back in.

00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:53.910
JAKE ARCHIBALD: As
cool as a cucumber.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.940
Pop the shoulder back in.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.320
PAUL LEWIS: And I spoke to
people after, and I was like,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.890
did you realize that I just
dislocated my shoulder?

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:58.848
And they were like, no.

00:07:58.848 --> 00:08:01.360
I was like, well, at
least I can cover that.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.277
It's not really a resume
skill, if I'm honest.

00:08:03.277 --> 00:08:05.151
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Have
you seen-- did you watch

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.500
X-Files when you were younger?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.166
PAUL LEWIS: Yes.

00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:09.930
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Are you using
[? Victor ?] [? Tombs? ?] Are

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.670
you going to stretch down
into a chimney and kill people

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.106
at night?

00:08:15.106 --> 00:08:16.950
PAUL LEWIS: I
sincerely hope not.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.020
Anyway, back to the web.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.310
One of the other things
that some of the sessions

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.060
and so on-- and they got into
things like ServiceWorker.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.660
That's been nice to
come back forever.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.367
We see the one trick pony when
it comes to the ServiceWorker.

00:08:29.367 --> 00:08:30.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Of course.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.700
So it's great to hear that
mentioned loads in session.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.072
But just the
practical uses of it.

00:08:35.072 --> 00:08:37.530
So what it was last year, when
we were presenting about it,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.340
was it was just like--

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.339
PAUL LEWIS: Coming soon.

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:40.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.150
And a couple of
Googlers going, hey, we

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.774
kind of made a thing
using a prototype.

00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:45.410
We think it's going to be OK.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.940
Fingers crossed.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.132
Hope we don't break the web.

00:08:48.132 --> 00:08:50.090
And now we're seeing
people from "The Guardian"

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.790
using it for push
messages or just

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.290
using it to make
performance better.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.039
PAUL LEWIS: Right.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:57.380
Because it's the gating
for why the push messaging

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.910
and notifications and
all that kind of stuff.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.868
It's like [? SBS ?],
ServiceWorker, blah, blah,

00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:01.380
blah.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.070
And we're starting to
build a really strong

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.910
re-engagement story
off the back of it.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.826
It's not just like you
get fast bootstrapping,

00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:09.210
you get stuff that
works offline.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.400
But you can now start to
kind of say to your users,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.970
would you like me to keep you
updated on any of these things.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.912
So that is very excited really.

00:09:16.912 --> 00:09:19.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, so you
were talking about performance

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.260
as well.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.190
If you talk about what
makes a website fast.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.274
Like the whole rail thing.

00:09:24.274 --> 00:09:26.814
PAUL LEWIS: We've been talking
about rail, which is response,

00:09:26.814 --> 00:09:27.900
animation, idle and load.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.860
And how you can think about
app and site performance,

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.257
and bring all that together.

00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:33.590
So that's gone down really well.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.506
People are starting to
go, yeah, I understand.

00:09:35.506 --> 00:09:38.720
It's put the user in the middle
of your performance model,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.100
so that's been really nice to
share with the attendees here.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.030
Hopefully we'll get more
out about that soon.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.030
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Do you think
that's going to happen?

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.490
We're going to get a faster web?

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:45.990
Out of this?

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.448
Because that's what
we want, right?

00:09:47.448 --> 00:09:48.880
PAUL LEWIS: One can only hope.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.670
But in the meantime,
you know, here's

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.760
to another year of
the web and I/O.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: To the web.
