00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.560
In this lesson, you'll use workflow and approvals to

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.880
automate manual tasks. You'll learn how to automate sending an

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.150
email, updating a field, and creating a task for users.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.710
To do that, let's go back with Samantha and Andy.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.640
&gt;&gt; We've got this really cool thing. This

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.950
dashboard that shows all this data about things like

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.560
money and the bands playing. And this is

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.800
interesting. This state about the tickets, the open maintenance

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.140
items that need to get fixed.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.500
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.080
&gt;&gt; And so, you know, we've thought about how to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.140
collect the data? But really, is people doing these things?

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.890
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.770
&gt;&gt; We need to tell them, what to do.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.240
&gt;&gt; So, we need to automate, actually

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.060
notifying the people involved with the maintenance

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.740
tickets, so they can get. Started you

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.570
know, fixing those problems right away, yeah?

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.771
&gt;&gt; I mean, so, can we make it so that you

00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:50.818
know, a ticket gets created and then immediately a technician gets

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:53.350
alerted or something like that?

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.642
&gt;&gt; Definitely. So, what you're describing sounds a

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:58.575
lot like a workflow process. this is taking like

00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:02.265
something that's a manual process and automating it

00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:04.702
using a set of actions. So, in the case

00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:07.138
of maintenance tickets. Maybe you want to update a

00:01:07.138 --> 00:01:09.838
field, or send an email to this maintenance worker,

00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:11.630
or give them a task. You can do

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.410
all that using, just point-click configurations on your workflow.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.692
&gt;&gt; Cool,

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:16.272
let's do it.

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:16.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
