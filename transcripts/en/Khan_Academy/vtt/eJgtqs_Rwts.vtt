00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.255
- [Voiceover] So I have a map here

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:05.925
of United States
possessions in the Pacific

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:08.989
and in the Caribbean today,

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:12.125
and they're kind of all over the place.

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:14.563
And some of them are pretty tiny.

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:15.746
There's Guam,

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:18.441
which is just barely a
little speck on the map,

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.855
and American Samoa

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:24.825
and more well known would be
the Hawaiian Islands, right?

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:28.238
One of the fifty states
of the United States.

00:00:28.238 --> 00:00:32.024
Have you ever wondered
why the United States

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:35.298
has islands in the middle of the Pacific?

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:39.896
This is thousands of
miles from the mainland

00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:41.981
of the United States.

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:43.908
So what's the deal?

00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:46.067
Did the United States just want access

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:47.693
to somewhere to get a tan

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:49.829
and maybe buy some pineapple?

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.475
In this video I want to
talk about the very unique,

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:56.864
historical circumstances under which

00:00:56.864 --> 00:00:59.906
the United States acquired
a bunch of territory

00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:04.047
outside of the borders
of the lower 48 states.

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:06.019
Or how, in other words,

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.596
the United States became an empire.

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:12.287
And empire,

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:15.407
or imperialism,

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:20.191
is the practice of having
political or economic

00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:23.984
control over a territory that is outside

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:27.588
the boundaries of your nation.

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:30.721
So when did this happen
and why did this happen?

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.905
Let me give you a little background

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:36.480
on the run up to the United
States becoming an empire.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.196
So the Civil War ends in 1865,

00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:43.110
and while that is a conflict

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.015
just within the United States,

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:47.466
right, the definition of civil war,

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:50.276
the Civil War has kind
of an interesting effect

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.737
on the United States' economy

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:55.314
because for the the
course of the Civil War

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:58.545
the North

00:01:58.545 --> 00:02:01.656
really ramped up their
industrial production

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:02.817
to win the war.

00:02:02.817 --> 00:02:05.674
So they build railroad tracks
and they have factories

00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:07.508
that help them build the armaments

00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:10.249
that are gonna help them
with victory in the war.

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.526
Well, after the war,

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:15.078
all these factories, all
these railroads still exist,

00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:16.865
and they're turned to different purposes.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:20.256
So over the course of
the late 19th century

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:22.438
from the end of the Civil War,

00:02:22.438 --> 00:02:26.091
really up until even 1900 and beyond,

00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:28.809
the United States becomes the leading

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.780
industrial power in the world.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.148
So they make more stuff

00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:36.936
than anybody else,

00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:38.746
and this is one of the reasons why so many

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:41.766
immigrants are flocking
to the United States

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:42.949
in this time period,

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.550
because there are jobs in factories.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.687
But even though the U.S. was acknowledged

00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:49.869
as this great industrial power,

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.657
it was not really acknowledged as

00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:53.723
a world military power.

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:55.187
The number one power in the world

00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:57.114
at this time is England.

00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.434
This is the end of the Victorian Era.

00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:03.707
None of the nations of Europe
think of the United States

00:03:03.707 --> 00:03:07.307
as an important power in the world.

00:03:07.307 --> 00:03:09.978
If you were a diplomat from France

00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:13.739
and you got a diplomatic
posting to Washington D.C.,

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.860
that would be like getting a
diplomatic posting on the moon.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.440
There is nothing going on there.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.439
Nobody's interested.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.364
You'd much rather be in Vienna or London.

00:03:22.364 --> 00:03:24.756
But another reason why
the nations of Europe

00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:27.890
are such important world powers is because

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.582
of their own investment in imperialism.

00:03:31.582 --> 00:03:34.857
So let me show you a map
of the world in 1914,

00:03:34.857 --> 00:03:37.387
which is kind of after
this age of imperialism,

00:03:37.387 --> 00:03:40.708
but it gives you an idea
of how much territory

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.810
Europe had gobbled up in this time period.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.782
So this is the rest of the
world in this time period,

00:03:46.782 --> 00:03:48.616
and we're talking about kind of the period

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:52.424
from about 1880 to 1900,

00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:55.629
and in this time period
the powers of Europe

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.227
really competed with
each other to take over

00:03:59.227 --> 00:04:01.666
territories in the rest of the world.

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:04.335
And these would have
been developing nations,

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:07.564
nations that did not have the firepower

00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:09.142
to compete with Europe,

00:04:09.142 --> 00:04:10.744
and they were generally nations with

00:04:10.744 --> 00:04:13.044
a lot of natural resources.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:16.062
So in the mid-19th century,

00:04:16.062 --> 00:04:18.825
there'd been explorers
going throughout Africa.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:22.099
This is the period of Dr.
Livingstone, I presume,

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.909
and Dr. Livingstone
reports back to England

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:28.554
that there is a lot of stuff in Africa.

00:04:28.554 --> 00:04:31.270
We're talkin' about diamonds

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.942
and gold

00:04:33.942 --> 00:04:35.799
and rubber,

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:37.122
and elsewhere in the world,

00:04:37.122 --> 00:04:39.027
in India there's tea.

00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:41.975
And so in the 1880s, 1890s,

00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:46.179
Europe scrambles for
territorial control of Africa

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:49.637
and you see England here in South Africa,

00:04:49.637 --> 00:04:52.737
and France up here in northwest Africa,

00:04:52.737 --> 00:04:54.409
and then of course you've got England

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.219
in India and Australia

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.304
and they're even fighting
for influence in China.

00:05:01.304 --> 00:05:04.044
And they had two main reasons for wanting

00:05:04.044 --> 00:05:05.554
these colonies abroad.

00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:09.037
One is, as we said,
their natural resources,

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:11.126
so they can take all the raw materials,

00:05:11.126 --> 00:05:12.867
the unfinished goods,

00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:16.096
to run the empire and
then they can take that

00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:18.278
back up to Europe and process it.

00:05:18.278 --> 00:05:20.392
So it's a cheap source of stuff

00:05:20.392 --> 00:05:22.528
for their industrial production.

00:05:22.528 --> 00:05:25.036
The other thing they want is markets,

00:05:25.036 --> 00:05:29.378
so all of these territories,
all of these colonies,

00:05:29.378 --> 00:05:33.046
have people in them who
can buy the products

00:05:33.046 --> 00:05:35.183
from the European nations,

00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:38.827
and as their factories
produce more and more stuff,

00:05:38.827 --> 00:05:41.731
they needed more and more
people to buy those things

00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:44.494
or they're going to stagnate economically.

00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:46.885
So this is where the
United States comes in.

00:05:46.885 --> 00:05:49.161
So in the late 19th century the U.S.

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:52.017
has become this leading industrial power.

00:05:52.017 --> 00:05:53.805
They feel like they're
not getting any respect

00:05:53.805 --> 00:05:56.499
from Europe for being pretty big dogs,

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:59.749
but they also start looking
at this scramble for Africa,

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:03.023
this scramble for colonies in the world,

00:06:03.023 --> 00:06:05.298
and they think maybe the United States

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:07.041
should get in on this game,

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.547
and they have a couple of
reasons for doing this.

00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:11.661
One of the reasons for
doing this is the idea

00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:14.261
of expanding the frontier.

00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:17.095
So in the late 19th century,

00:06:17.095 --> 00:06:20.322
there was a pretty famous historian

00:06:20.322 --> 00:06:23.736
by the name of Frederick Jackson Turner.

00:06:23.736 --> 00:06:26.963
And what Turner has to say really troubles

00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:28.310
a lot of people.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.466
He says manifest destiny is done.

00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:34.880
So manifest destiny you'll recall,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.946
is this idea that God
wanted the United States

00:06:37.946 --> 00:06:40.779
to occupy the North American continent

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:42.985
from Atlantic to Pacific.

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:46.863
As of 1890, the census showed
that there was pretty much

00:06:46.863 --> 00:06:49.719
even population distribution all the way

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.205
to the Pacific Ocean,

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:54.199
so this process of conquering the frontier

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:56.406
that many white Americans thought was

00:06:56.406 --> 00:07:00.563
really crucial to the
American spirit, was over.

00:07:00.563 --> 00:07:04.324
So what is the United States going to do?

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:07.366
Culturally they pride themselves on being

00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:09.526
a pioneering people.

00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:10.895
But along with that goes the same

00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:14.030
sort of quest for new markets that Europe

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.142
is going through in the same time period.

00:07:17.142 --> 00:07:21.088
So if the United States is the world's

00:07:21.088 --> 00:07:24.016
leading industrial power,

00:07:24.016 --> 00:07:27.198
and they did that by
conquering the frontier,

00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:28.800
building railroads,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.283
finding new people to sell the
products of their factory to,

00:07:32.283 --> 00:07:33.723
what's going to happen if they have

00:07:33.723 --> 00:07:35.835
nowhere else to expand?

00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:38.042
Relentless expansion
is kind of the backbone

00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:39.923
of American capitalism.

00:07:39.923 --> 00:07:41.803
And so people started to worry that

00:07:41.803 --> 00:07:43.823
if expansion is done,

00:07:43.823 --> 00:07:46.795
then the American industrial project

00:07:46.795 --> 00:07:50.163
is going to falter with
no new markets to conquer.

00:07:50.163 --> 00:07:53.042
All right, so those are
the economic and cultural

00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:55.247
explanations for why the United States

00:07:55.247 --> 00:07:58.392
became interested in
being an imperial power

00:07:58.392 --> 00:08:00.435
at the end of the 19th century.

00:08:00.435 --> 00:08:02.850
There are also some military explanations,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.519
so let me take you back
to a map of the Pacific.

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:11.453
So in 1890, this man
named Alfred Thayer Mahan

00:08:11.453 --> 00:08:15.030
published a book called The Influence

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.592
of Sea Power Upon History.

00:08:18.592 --> 00:08:21.604
And Mahan's thesis

00:08:21.604 --> 00:08:24.531
was that all the great

00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:29.081
nations of history since time immemorial

00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:31.264
had gotten their greatness through

00:08:31.264 --> 00:08:33.950
a domination of the seas.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.618
So he says that if the United States

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:41.797
really wants to be a
world power going forward,

00:08:41.797 --> 00:08:44.120
they're going to have to make some serious

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.743
investments in their navy.

00:08:46.743 --> 00:08:49.158
He says first they're
going to have to build

00:08:49.158 --> 00:08:51.503
a really powerful naval fleet,

00:08:51.503 --> 00:08:54.824
which has never really
been the bread and butter

00:08:54.824 --> 00:08:56.682
of America's military.

00:08:56.682 --> 00:08:58.423
Up until this point,

00:08:58.423 --> 00:09:02.023
the United States' navy
was like five leaky boats.

00:09:02.023 --> 00:09:05.942
So he says they have to
build a powerful navy

00:09:12.565 --> 00:09:16.652
and that you should
consider putting a canal

00:09:16.652 --> 00:09:19.716
somewhere across Central America

00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:21.876
so that if a ship is in the Atlantic

00:09:21.876 --> 00:09:25.265
it doesn't have to go all
the way around South America

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.892
to get to the Pacific.

00:09:26.892 --> 00:09:30.374
It can just cut this corner here.

00:09:30.374 --> 00:09:33.231
And the last thing that Mahan says is that

00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:36.342
the U.S. is going to need friendly ports

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.966
all over the world so that this navy

00:09:38.966 --> 00:09:43.261
can dock places, refuel,
take on new supplies,

00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:46.836
because if your ports
are only on the edges

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.648
of the United States,

00:09:48.648 --> 00:09:51.319
it could take you days and days and days

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:53.895
to make it all the way over to Asia.

00:09:53.895 --> 00:09:57.518
So Mahan says we need good
harbors along the way.

00:09:57.518 --> 00:10:00.119
And you know what's a really great harbor?

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:02.743
Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

00:10:02.743 --> 00:10:06.127
It's one of the best harbors in the world.

00:10:07.015 --> 00:10:09.361
And basically in the
future the U.S. government

00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:12.751
is going to to do exactly what Mahan says.

00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:16.629
In between 1890 and 1914,

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:19.438
the United States
increases their investment

00:10:19.438 --> 00:10:22.016
in the navy by a power of seven.

00:10:22.016 --> 00:10:25.185
It's $22 million dollars only in 1890.

00:10:25.185 --> 00:10:28.877
By 1914 they're putting
$140 million dollars

00:10:28.877 --> 00:10:31.082
a year into their navy.

00:10:31.082 --> 00:10:34.288
And they will move forward with this plan

00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:37.446
to build a canal somewhere
in Central America.

00:10:37.446 --> 00:10:40.116
Hint, hint, it might be in Panama.

00:10:40.116 --> 00:10:44.528
And they will annex ports
all over the Pacific,

00:10:44.528 --> 00:10:47.646
and also in the Caribbean,

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:51.269
to take care of their new powerful navy.

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:53.546
So in the late 19th century,

00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:57.794
the U.S. is really poised
to enter into world politics

00:10:57.794 --> 00:11:00.279
as a major world power.

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:02.996
In the next video I'll talk
about the Spanish American War

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:06.061
of 1898 and how that led the United States

00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:08.639
to become an empire.
