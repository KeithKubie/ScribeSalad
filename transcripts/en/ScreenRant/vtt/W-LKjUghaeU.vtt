00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.460
Most Disney movies are all sweetness and light,
right?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.590
Sure, there are moments of tragedy - Bambi's
mother being shot and Simba's father falling

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.551
to his death reduced EVERYONE who witnessed
them to tears - but, in general, the movies

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.449
are all 100% child-friendly.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.089
Or so they seem on the surface.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.229
But there are actually some theories that
turn some Disney movies into terribly dark

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:27.229
affairs.

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:28.229
Interpreting these movies in such twisted
ways might seem a little morbid, but it's

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:30.840
actually pretty fun and intriguing, so we've
made a video about it!

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.260
We hope you enjoy it - and please make sure
you subscribe to our channel so you can keep

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.550
coming back to watch more like it.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.550
Here are ten Disney theories that turn into
the darkest movies ever.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.140
Up
2009's Up is such a heartwarming movie.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.550
Its three main characters are two cranky old
men and a nervous little kid, which is so

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.100
unlike most movies these days - but it's wonderful.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.499
However, it doesn't seem so wonderful if one
of those characters is actually dead, does

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:01.499
it?

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.280
Yeah, we're getting off to a gloomy start
here, because this theory suggest that Up's

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.840
Carl Fredricksen is actually deceased, having
passed away in his sleep after he was told

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.979
he'd be forced to live in a retirement home.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.850
It actually makes a lot of sense too.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.890
It suggests that the movie is Carl's journey
through the afterlife, with young Russell

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.350
being his guardian angel - one who is attempting
to earn his wings by guiding Carl through

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.640
his transition.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.920
Furthermore, Russell taking the form of a
child was to fulfill Carl and Ellie’s desire

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.340
to have children, the house in the movie is
symbolic of Carl’s attachment to the physical

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.570
world, and Paradise Falls is Carl’s idea
of Heaven.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.670
Interesting, right?

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:46.479
But you haven't heard anything yet...

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.479
Aladdin
So...

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.479
Aladdin.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.420
You're probably thinking it's set centuries
in the past, right?

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.000
Well yeah, it probably is, but there's a pretty
damn dark and disturbing theory that suggests

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.080
it might not be.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.320
The 1992 movie, of course, features the Genie
of the Lamp - voiced so wonderfully by the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.679
late, great Robin Williams - and he makes
reference to a number of modern movies and

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:06.679
celebrities.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.119
Now, given that he was supposed to have been
trapped in a lamp for thousands of years - and

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.640
given the supposed time setting of the story
regardless of that - that shouldn't be possible.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.300
I mean, how would he know of those references?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.850
Well, the theory we mentioned suggests that
Aladdin is actually set thousands of years

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.440
in future, in a post-apocalyptic wasteland,
after a world-ending disaster that set mankind

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.620
back by milennia.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.570
Nice, huh?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.880
WALL-E
What a nice, friendly, harmless little robot

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.880
WALL-E was.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.870
The star of the 2008 movie wouldn't hurt a
fly and the only evil robot to come out of

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.750
Buy-N-Large was AUTO, right?

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.550
Well, we'd like to think so, but one extremely
dark theory actually suggests that WALL-E

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.670
is responsible for the entire destruction
of Earth!

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.670
Yikes!

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.290
We saw him happily cannibalising parts from
another model he found, adding it to his delightful

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.990
collection of spare parts.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.510
But he also has a trailer full of parts.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.380
Just how many other models did he tear to
pieces?

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.950
Definitely alot more than he required to run.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.380
These were trophies from his previous kills!

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.990
Bearing in mind WALL-E had been around for
approximately 700 years, that 700-year-long

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.570
killing spree gradually wiped out the rest
of the recycling robots!

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.020
It explains why the planet looked like a total
dump and why he's the only robot around.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.720
He literally destroyed Earth!

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.590
Wreck-It Ralph
This is less of a theory and more something

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.610
that fans have decuced ACTUALLY HAPPENED,
but it's not something you immediately think

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.470
of and it definitely puts a much darker edge
on one aspect of 2012's Wreck-It Ralph.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.660
One of the movie's main characters - Sergeant
Tamora Jean Calhoun - has a tragic backstory

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.810
in that she watched her husband-to-be get
eaten by a Cy-bug, just seconds before they

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.060
were due to marry, then killed the Cy-bug
in question.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.190
That's bad enough, but fans have pointed out
that Cy-bugs assimilate their victims and

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.510
BECOME them, meaning Calhoun would've had
to kill a murderous insectoid version of the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.720
man she loved.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.700
No wonder she was sometimes crabby!

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.790
The Little Mermaid
There's a neat theory that suggests Disney's

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.440
The Little Mermaid, Frozen, Tangled and Tarzan
are all set within the same universe.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.470
We won't go into why here - that's not the
"dark" part of this entry - but just believe

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.930
us when we say it's true.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.470
The dark part comes because of what that means
for 1989's The Little Mermaid in particular.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.880
The aforementioned theory suggests that the
parents of Frozen's Elsa and Anna died at

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.060
sea on the way to Rapunzel and Flynn's wedding,
which would place their watery graves near

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.060
Denmark.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.560
That means the wreck from which Ariel scrounges
human artefacts to satisfy her weird obsession

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.080
is Elsa and Anna's parents ship - and Ariel
was graverobbing from and desecrating the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.720
decaying corpses of a nice couple who perished
en route to a wedding.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.080
Frozen
Speaking of Frozen, the 2013 movie was - and

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.449
remains - an incredibly popular movie.

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.090
In fact, it's the highest-grossing animated
movie of all time.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.960
Everybody loved it - especially children - but
we're not sure the kids would be so fond of

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.289
it if they believed a pretty dark theory that
is doing the rounds about it!

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.219
The heroic Kristoff seemed like a nice guy,
right?

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.850
Well this theory suggests that the guy's clothes
point to reindeer murder!

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.189
The indigenous Sami people are known for wearing
reindeer hide and the likelihood is that the

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.199
ice harvesters killed a reindeer and gave
its pelt to Kristoff to keep warm.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.030
Here's where it gets really dark.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.789
This theory explains why Sven the reindeer
is so attached to Kristoff - the guy is wearing

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.610
what remains of his dead mother.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.560
Peter Pan
1953's Peter Pan really is a quintessential

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.699
Disney classic.

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.569
In the movie, the titular boy has a mischievous
shadow with which he has a rather fun and

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.229
playful relationship - but one dark theory
suggests that there might be a sinister tale

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.229
behind the shadow, and that it's actually
a lot to do with dark magic.

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.480
The theory is that Peter's shadow is a window
into hell and an extension of himself - notice

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.639
how it was able to touch and move things?

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.680
For reference, Dr. Facilier's shadow in another
Disney movie - The Princess and the Frog - could

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.419
do the same thing, and he ended up being dragged
to hell after making a deal with the devil.

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.669
Could Peter have made a similar deal?

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.349
It seems unlikely, but when you consider that
it might have been in exchange for his eternal

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.349
life, it starts to make sense.

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:10.060
Let's just hope Peter keeps his side of whatever
bargain he made with Satan!

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.550
Partysaurus Rex
Although it's not a full feature picture,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.479
2012's Partysaurus Rex - a spin-off from the
Toy Story movies - is indeed a short film,

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.330
so we feel happy to include it here.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.759
The theory about it, however, is more based
on the Monsters, Inc. movies - and it suggests

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:30.229
that poor Sulley has been turned into a toilet
seat cover!

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:41.250
You may remember a quote from Monsters, Inc.
in which Randall Boggs says "I heard humans

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.300
skin monsters and make toilet covers out of
their fur."

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.719
Well, look at the toilet seat in Partysaurus
Rex!

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:49.719
That's Sulley!

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:52.900
He's been skinned and turned into a toilet
seat cover!

00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:06.690
No wonder there was no sequel to Monsters,
Inc. - its star character is most likely dead!

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.889
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
We're going back a long way now - pre-World

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:15.580
War II, in fact - to 1937 and Snow White and
the Seven Dwarves.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.849
Given just how creepy this theory is, there's
absolutely no way we could have left it out.

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:23.710
You know how the Prince in the movie is...
well... the quintessential Prince Charming?

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.999
Well what if he wasn't?

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:26.830
What if he was actually Death itself?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.319
The theory suggests that the kiss he gave
Snow White to revive her actually sent her

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.610
to the afterlife.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.900
It stems largely from American Horror Story:
Asylum, in which the Angel of Death's method

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.030
for sending people to the other side was to
kiss them and suck the life out of them.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.050
Snow White saying her goodbyes to the dwarves
looked like she was being led off to a fairytale

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.509
ending - but what if she was waving goodbye
to them for all eternity?

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:49.680
Creepy, right?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.279
Moreover, the Prince has a white horse.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:57.169
Revelations 6:8 states "I looked, and there
before me was a pale horse!

00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:59.589
Its rider was named Death."

00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:02.930
The Incredibles
You probably remember the "no capes" scene,

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.580
from 2004's The Incredibles, when Edna Mode
tells Mr. Incredible on about all the past

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.210
superheroes who died because their capes got
caught in things like vortexes and missiles.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.389
And you probably remember Stratogale getting
sucked into a plane engine by her cape.

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:19.349
Well there's a very dark side to all of that.

00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:23.539
Not only was Stratogale a mere schoolkid,
making her death all the more tragic, the

00:08:23.539 --> 00:08:28.659
likelihood is that her death caused a plane
crash, killing hundreds of civilian passengers.

00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:32.190
Remember how the movies tells of superheroes
going into hiding because of the collateral

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.420
damage they caused?

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.130
That all makes sense now, right?

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.661
Furthermore, Edna designed Stratogale's suit,
so she probably blames herself, and a dark

00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:44.190
theory suggests that she did the same for
the evil Syndrome and purposely included a

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:50.910
cape in his ensemble in order to potentially
get him killed as a way of making amends.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.270
Thanks for watching our video about ten Disney
theories that turn into the darkest movies

ever.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.850
What other theories have you heard that make
Disney movies seem a lot darker than they

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.940
do on the surface?
