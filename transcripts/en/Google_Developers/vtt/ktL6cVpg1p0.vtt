00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.230
Hi everyone.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.680
Thanks for joining today.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.470
I'm Steven Bazyl, one of the
developer advocates here on

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.110
Google Drive, and today I'm
going to take a look at a

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.900
fairly new drive app that we
found in the Chrome Web Store

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.090
called Ultradox.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.970
This is an app from Florisoft.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.400
If you're familiar with them
they've actually been doing a

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.380
lot of apps for Google Apps
users over the past few years.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.520
I've worked with them
in the past.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.980
There's some really great
tools in the Google Apps

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.600
Marketplace for domain
administrators and things

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.350
around Shared Contacts.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.250
And I was really happy to find
that they did this new

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.790
application called Ultradox,
which adds some much needed

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.230
features for Google
Apps users--

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.190
people who use Google Drive and
want to get things like

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.310
mail merge and templating and
batch processing for doc

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.670
generation, using Google
Docs and Google Drive.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.650
I want to take a quick look at
their Chrome Web Store entry.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.910
For those who had been looking
for a solution for doing

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.410
templating and mail merge in
Google Docs you can take a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.880
look at this.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.000
You can find them in the Google
Drive collection.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.140
Actually it's a pretty
cool app.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.870
If you want to go and look at
the video, and they have a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.630
really great tutorial showing
off all the features.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.140
And if you go take a look at
their application, they have a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.460
whole bunch of really
cool templates to

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.530
help you get started.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.660
Everything from interview letter
feedbacks to badges,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.120
some really interesting things
with dynamic maps, being able

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.440
to create dynamic documents
based off of, say for example,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.620
contacts, address, or
information that you have in a

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.360
spreadsheet.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.140
Lots of cool stuff.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.110
And to be honest, I haven't
actually gone through and

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.490
tried all of these yet.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.540
There's a lot of power
here that is a bit

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.010
of a learning curve.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.570
But I want to show off the basic
features, and talk a

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.310
little bit about some of the
integration things they did.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.950
From a technical perspective,
some good, some interesting

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.550
but not supported.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.250
So let's just actually
jump into that.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.060
I created here earlier
a new Ultradoc.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.950
You can actually go and create
these from Google Drive under

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.680
the Create menu.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.890
So you can go here and say,
create new Ultradoc.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.920
And this will just give us a
blank project to work with.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.580
And here it's just untitled.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.520
We can rename this.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.990
We'll just make this one
another "GDL demo."

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.400
And of course the next thing we
need to do is actually have

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.010
a template for our document.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.310
We can use Google [? OS ?], so
we can actually select an

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.460
existing template or
create a new one.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.950
And then we can merge that
template with data either from

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.960
Google Contacts, from
a spreadsheet--

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.040
we can actually even do both.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.850
We can select multiple
contacts, multiple

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.720
spreadsheets, and pull data from
different ones in order

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.500
to generate that document.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.740
I'm going to start with
a really simple

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.540
example using Contacts.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.700
And first I'm just going to
bring up myself as a contact.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.220
You can see here all the
different variables that it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.950
found in Contacts.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.960
These are things that we can
then use in that template.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.820
It's really great to see that
they're using the contacts

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.020
integration in addition
to drive.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.120
And let's go create
a new template.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.320
So one of the cool things
they're doing here which is

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.610
both cool and slightly unnerving
is iFraming the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.150
Google Docs editor.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.640
This is not something
that is officially

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.990
supported, but it does work.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.790
And in this case I really like
what they did in terms of

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.070
using the iFraming to display
additional help in Contacts

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.500
for how to actually
write templates.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.310
One of the things that would be
very difficult for users if

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.220
they just had our editor without
the additional help,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.760
then I would be lost as a user
trying to write a template.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.570
But here now I have this
really handy reference.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.340
I can look through all the
different template variables.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.010
In this case because all I have
is just a contact, those

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.340
are the only ones that are
available to me in addition to

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.290
some generic ones are
always available.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.170
So let's just write, dear to
dot name dot, full name.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.130
So a really simple example, and
we can even just preview

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.780
this really quickly by clicking
Generate Documents.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.470
And here we can see, "Dear
Steven Bazyl, hello." Not too

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.750
exciting, but a really useful
thing just to demonstrate the

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.880
simplicity and the
power of this.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.010
So I want to actually go back to
this project and bring in a

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.650
spreadsheet.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.630
Let's just create a new
spreadsheet, and let's just

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:46.090
say this is task, dismiss that,
and we'll say, clean

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.115
house in three hours.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.400
Amount, I'll say $50.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.980
So a really simple
spreadsheet here.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.320
If I go back over to the
Ultradoc, actually as I edited

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.460
it, it's actually been polling
for changes to the document

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.190
and detected that I added
a few things.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.280
And you can actually see here
one of the challenges with

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.750
polling for changes to documents
is it actually

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.800
didn't pick up all of the
columns that I've added.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.900
So here I have task
hours and amounts.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.790
Because I waited a few seconds
before adding that third

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.590
column, it hasn't yet detected
it, but on its next polling

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.900
interview it should show up and
it should show this as a

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.150
new variable that's available.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.700
You can go over to our template,
and we should also

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.730
start to see these appear here
in our list of variables that

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.380
are available.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.710
So again, one of these things
you can do, I can say we'll do

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:03.400
sheet one, task, and I'm
not entirely sure

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.650
if this will work.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.820
So one of the things with
Ultradox is they actually do

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.280
have different styles of doing
templating depending on the

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.000
source of the data.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.860
So for things like contacts,
it's actually really easy to

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.640
reference the data.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.170
So basically you have a single
object, you could just pull up

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.350
the fields that you
need for that.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.680
For Sheets it does treat the
sheet as a single object

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.390
itself, and it does aggregate
the rows together.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.930
So in order to do things
like rows--

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.170
well either do formulas, you
have to actually do the proper

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.370
template variables
for doing that.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.310
The good thing is they actually

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.500
have really good help--

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.690
let's actually go
over to that--

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.670
on here for how to do all
this with their product.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.870
So we can look at templates.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.430
They talk about how to do
conditionals, how to do loops,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.720
how to format.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.830
We can do aggregates.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.230
All sorts of really
cool things.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.320
And so when you actually start
getting into some of their

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.460
advanced features, you can start
to see how you can use

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.120
this to do things like, for
example, you're a contractor,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.660
you're doing a job for a
customer, and you're keeping

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.490
track of all the different work
items for a particular

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.760
jobs in a spreadsheet.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.540
You can now have a nice little
template of a cover letter

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.210
that you sent out to your
customers when you invoice

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.590
them, and have it nicely
formatted in a doc.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.080
And if you want to do really
advanced formatting, they also

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.730
support LibreOffice files, in
addition to Google Docs.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.760
So if the formatting controls
in Google Docs isn't quite

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.780
enough for your needs, you
can go use LibreOffice.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.880
And you can even use LibreOffice
online with some

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.670
of the applications that we have
in the Chrome Web Store,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.000
such as InstallFree Nexus.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.070
In which case you start to see
that power of having this

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.250
ecosystem of applications
where I can start to do

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.480
everything I need to do in the
browser, in Chrome, on any

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.170
device, whether or not it's
using Google Docs as an editor

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:18.030
or LibreOffice inside
a browser as well.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.190
Really, really cool stuff when
you start to combine all these

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.440
apps together.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.920
A couple other things I wanted
to show in here is they

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.960
actually do have some other
things you can do in terms of

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.360
how these documents
are generated.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.930
So obviously you can save them
back to Google Drive in

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.060
different formats.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.640
You can do a PDF, or you can
have that converted back into

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.880
a Google Doc format if you just
wanted to share it out to

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.010
somebody, specify the
folder and so on.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.860
Of course you can email
these out to people,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.330
send multiple copies.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.980
But another really cool thing
is Google Cloud Print.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.380
I don't have any printers
configured for this particular

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.850
account, but this is something
that they support.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.950
When you do the OAuth grant for
that application, it will

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.990
ask for permission to access
your printers.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.330
Right now all I have is the kind
of the default saved to

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.040
Google Drive one.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.420
But if I had my printer at home
or one of the printers in

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.340
the office configured, I can
have it just printed out

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.490
directly from the application.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.170
And this is really useful when
you actually start doing

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.810
batches of documents.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.110
If you want to do a mail merge
type functionality and select

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.410
a bunch of contacts, you can
do that and have them just

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.760
print out automatically all
from this web app without

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.520
having to deal with your native
printer dialog, or

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.600
without even being anywhere
physically

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.020
close to having a printer.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.420
So it's a pretty cool app.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.070
And I actually just noticed,
here earlier I was mentioning

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.790
about the latency with polling
for the changes, we can

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.250
actually see here now that it
did discover the additional

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.390
templates in there.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.500
You can actually even see this
too if I just start putting in

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.930
a random template variable.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.680
We'll just say [? "foo," ?]

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:22.700
We'll go back and it should,
in probably a minute or so,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.160
this field here where it says
"ready to go" is actually

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.280
going to update and warn me that
I have a variable in the

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.110
document that isn't really
bound to a value yet.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.150
It's not something coming from
a contact, it's not coming

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.400
from the spreadsheet, so
it is something that I

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.090
need to fill out.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.160
And it's really good for those
one-off things that you just

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.595
need to do that final little bit
of customization for, that

00:11:46.595 --> 00:11:47.760
you're not going to be
pulling from one of

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.840
these other data sources.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.640
So overall, I'm really just
scratching the surface with

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.850
this application, and I do
actually plan on playing

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.790
around with it a lot more.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.550
I think it's a very cool
application and something that

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.500
a lot of Google Docs users have
been asking for, for this

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.370
type of functionality.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:12.710
And I think they did a pretty
good job at making a pretty

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.060
good user experience.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.040
There's a lot of complexity and
there is a learning curve

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.850
because it is in a new
templating system.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.870
There's a lot of power you can
do with spreadsheets and

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.140
looping and dealing with
multiple contacts doing batch

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:26.840
processing.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.450
So it does take a little bit of
time to really get familiar

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.240
with everything that you
can do in there.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.760
But once you get into the
advanced stuff with having

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.120
customizable maps and dynamic
image generation, really

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.080
awesome features.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.750
And a very welcome addition
to the apps ecosystem

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.060
that we have here.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.470
I know they've also made this
application available in the

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.440
Google Apps Marketplace for
domain administrators to

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.880
install for all their
users as well.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.780
And I know that there are
certainly some technical

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.760
challenges that they had to
encounter there in dealing

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.400
with multiple marketplaces,
different ways of doing

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.690
authentication and
authorization, depending on

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.930
whether or not this is a
domain-wide install versus an

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.230
individual consumer
coming along.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:24.430
Something that we may explore
in future GDL sessions, but

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.140
they did a pretty
good job there.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:32.810
The biggest criticisms I have,
and I really can't fault them

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.990
too much for these, is the
polling latency is noticeable.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.110
Particularly as a new user for
the application where I want

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.000
to do a lot of experimentation,
and going

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.130
back and creating and updating
a spreadsheet in the template

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.350
and switching back and forth
in order to explore those

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:54.160
features, having that latency of
30 seconds to a minute for

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.990
it to detect changes to the
template was a little bit

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.560
bothersome.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.825
And that unfortunately is not
something they can easily work

00:14:00.825 --> 00:14:03.850
around with at this time.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.810
If they were to increase the
polling frequency, they would

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.850
start to run into quota
limitations.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.530
So it's just a balancing
act right now.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.070
Hopefully we'll have a better
solution in the future for

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.020
this type of functionality.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.920
And then the other issue is the
iFraming of the editor.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.610
Again, this is not something
that we particularly encourage

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:30.260
or support, but in this case
they did so for good reason,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:36.210
to overlay the help dialogue
or this little help pane.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.920
Again, this is hopefully
something we'll improve in the

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.770
future and give developers more
options for integrating

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:44.460
with their editors.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:49.240
But in the meantime it's
a pretty good use of an

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.020
unsupported feature.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.300
But I would not recommend anyone
do that unless it was

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.280
absolutely necessary to do so.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.510
Other than that, a really good
use of combining multiple

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.680
Google services with contacts,
spreadsheets,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.080
Google Cloud Print.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.380
And I do know this does
run on App Engine.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.320
You can actually notice the
first time that you use the

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.550
application, you will get some
App Engine specific artifacts

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.800
around authentication.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.240
And it's one of those things
where it's a trade-off for

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.200
developers.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.010
App Engine does have some really
nice features in terms

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.030
of integration with
Google accounts.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.460
The downside to using those
features is you do pay a

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:42.400
little bit of a penalty on the
user experience, because of

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:48.270
the separation between the App
Engine login screen and the

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.190
OAuth grant.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.960
If you end up with a two-step
approval, which we're not

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.580
going to actually show here,
but the first time that you

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.560
use this application you do
actually have to do two steps

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.980
to authorize the application
fully.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.790
That could have been avoided
by doing a pure OAuth two

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.730
based system for both
authenticating and authorizing

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.360
user and do it in one step.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.920
But they would have had to write
a little bit more code

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.400
in order to manage the users
themselves rather than using

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.840
App Engine's built-in
user service.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.420
Yeah, I'm actually really
excited to play with this

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.010
application.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.650
I actually have a lot of things
in mind just personally

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.970
for how this could be useful.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.940
My family, we send out lots of
stuff around the holidays, and

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.620
I could see doing--

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.310
as our news around the holidays
grows, and I want to

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.760
start doing form letters,
I probably

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.750
will be using Ultradox.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.360
Other than that, really good job
to the guys at Florisoft.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.120
And I think that's
it for today.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.900
So try Ultradox if you are
looking for templating in

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.340
Google Docs, or mail merge
functionality.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.740
It's a really cool product.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.500
Come back next week, and I don't
know if we have a topic

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.319
set, but we do have a few
things in the pipeline.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.339
So hopefully some new features
that we can announce next

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:19.520
week, and if so, I think
they will make for

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.680
very interesting sessions.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.180
Thanks, and see you
all next time.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:48.400
