00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:33.770
HERBERT GROSS: Hi, always being
somebody who wants to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.250
get something for nothing, I
figure any time in this course

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.770
that we'll study the new
function, the very next thing

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.670
that we'll do is study
the inverse function.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.980
In other words, since the
inverse is just a change in

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.330
emphasis, why not just change
the emphasis to get the result

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.390
that we want?

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.950
So you see, today's lesson
is called the inverse

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.450
trigonometric functions.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.730
And the longest part of this
lecture will be a few

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.730
computations just to get
the feel of things.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.870
The reason being that other than
that, everything that we

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.720
have to use will be drawn from
results that we've already

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.630
studied in our lessons called
inverse functions.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.200
It's still the same idea, only
a different illustration.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.090
Well, at any rate, let's get
on with the subject.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.480
Let's start with the curve
'y' equals 'sine x'.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.860
Now you see, when we plot the
curve 'y' equals 'sine x', it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.280
doesn't take us very long
to discover that this

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.220
curve is not 1:1.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.550
In fact, it misses
by a long shot.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.420
Because for every 'y' value
between minus 1 and 1, there

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.010
are infinitely many values
of 'x' that produce

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.740
that value of 'y'.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.240
This is an oscillating
type of function.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.320
So you see from our rigorous
point of view, there really

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.690
isn't much sense in defining
the inverse sine function.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.500
Well, in a way, this
is an artificial

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.930
drawback that we have.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.990
Because you also recall that
when we talked about functions

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.710
that were not 1:1, we could
always break them down into a

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.240
union of 1:1 functions.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.550
For example, notice in the part
of the curve here which

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.300
I've accented, namely, the
domain from minus pi over 2 to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.720
pi over 2, notice that on that
domain, the sine is 1:1.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.730
And it's certainly onto the
interval from minus 1 to 1.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.410
In other words, every value of
the sign is taken on once and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.710
only once on the interval from
minus pi over 2 to pi over 2.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.050
So you see, if I disregarded
everything but this part of

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.400
the curve, and how
could I do that?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.050
What shall I name
this function?

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.760
Well, why not do something
like this.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.280
Let me invent a new name.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.150
Let me call this curve ''s sub
0' of x' where ''s sub 0' of

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.370
x' is defined to be 'sine x'
provided that 'x' is in the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.560
closed interval from minus
pi over 2 to pi over 2.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.590
Again, be very, very careful.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.330
Recall that when we talked about
defining functions, we

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.050
said that to specify two
functions as being equal it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.570
was not enough that the function
machine was the same,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.940
the inputs had to be the same.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.935
In other words, two functions
had to be equal.

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:29.190
Or to be equal, the two
functions had to have

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.030
precisely the same domain.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.430
So notice in this sense there
is a big difference between

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.310
''s sub 0' of x' and the
function that's being

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.610
called 'sine x'.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.840
What is the big difference?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.680
Well, for the function that's
called 'sine x', the domain is

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.710
all real numbers.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.530
So the function called ''s sub
0' of x', the domain is only

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.060
the closed interval from minus
pi over 2 to pi over 2.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.600
Now again, there's nothing
sacred about picking this

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.770
particular interval.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.220
What I could have done was
define say, another curve,

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.590
which I'll call ''s
sub 1' of x'.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.160
''s sub 1' of x' will be
the function 'sine x'.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.310
But now, the domain will be
shall we say, from 3 pi over

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.820
2, or from pi over
2 to 3 pi over 2.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.980
In other words, notice that this
portion of our sine curve

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.110
is also 1:1, and runs the full
gamut of values that the sine

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.390
can take on from 1 to minus 1.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.490
And by the way, I
don't have to be

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.140
prejudiced this way either.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.490
I could just have easily have
worked with negative values.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.590
In other words, I could have
invented say another curve,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.740
which I'll call ''s sub minus 1'
of x', where this subscript

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.070
simply means I'm going in
the opposite direction.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.650
''s sub minus 1' of x' might
just has well have been what?

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.180
The curve 'sine x'.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.770
But now again, how are all of
these things differing?

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.360
Only in the choice
of the domain.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.280
See now the domain would be
from minus 3 pi over 2 to

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.860
minus pi over 2.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.730
Again, in terms of the picture,
this portion here

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.740
would be fine.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.460
You see what I can do is break
up this curve that fails to be

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.500
single valued by-- not
single valued.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.060
Fails to be 1:1 by a
long shot, into a

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.500
union of 1:1 curves.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.190
In fact, if I wanted to use
some fancy mathematical

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.000
language, which I'll
write down just to

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.100
look impressive here.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.730
But if it bothers you,
ignore it completely.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:40.070
I guess what I'm really saying
is, I could have defined 'sine

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.930
x' to be the union ''s sub n'
of x' as 'n' goes from minus

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.950
infinity to infinity.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.920
Meaning what?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.050
Take all of these pieces with
these integral subscripts and

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.090
form their union, and that
infinite union gives you back

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.300
the entire curve.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.050
Well, what am I making
all this issue about

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.330
in the first place?

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.500
You see, we can't have an
inverse function unless our

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.030
original function is 1:1.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.210
In fact, let's see
what does happen.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.580
Remember how we invert
the function?

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.870
In other words, how do you get
from the graph of 'y' equals

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.660
'f of x' to the graph of 'y'
equals 'f inverse of x'?

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.490
Recalling from our previous
lecture on this topic, what

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.700
you essentially do, well, if
you're good at visualizing,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.720
you just reflect with respect
to the 45 degree line.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.150
If you're not so good
at visualizing, what

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.400
you do is, is what?

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.170
You first rotate this thing
through 90 degrees and then

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.950
flop the thing over.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.220
And I've taken the liberty
of doing that over here.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.060
I take my curve and again, this
would be very effective

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.780
if I had overlays and wanted
to slide these for you.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.880
I think it's something that
you can see on your own.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.450
So all I'm doing is what?

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.590
I rotate this thing through
90 degrees and then

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.130
flop over the result.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.850
And now this curve will be the
graph 'y' equals inverse sine

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.350
of 'x' provided you can
have an inverse.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.290
You see in the old math, this
was fine because multi-valued

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.290
functions didn't bother
us at all.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.010
However, what is clear is notice
that in this particular

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.810
sense, the accented curve from
before becomes this little

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.750
region here.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.790
And notice that the function
that I defined to be 's sub 0'

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.860
does have an inverse.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.190
In other words, in terms of my
new coordinate system, I can

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.240
define what?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.160
The curve 'y' equals the
inverse of 's sub 0'.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.990
The idea being what?

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.250
That I cannot talk about
the inverse sine.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.860
Now the reason I bring this up
is you'll notice that in this

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.070
text, in most every text, people
do use this notation.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.890
And they get around it
in a rather cute way.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.750
As you read the text you will
notice the phrase called

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.070
principal values.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.900
Let me show you what
I mean by that.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.850
What happens in the typical text
is they'll say look it.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.850
By 'y' equals 'inverse sine
x', we mean that 'x'

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.860
equals 'sine y'.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.990
But that 'y' is restricted to be
between the range of minus

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.010
pi over 2 and pi over 2.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.450
This is called the range
of principal values.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.500
Now you see, this sometimes
causes people to be a little

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.890
bit upset because why do you
have to make this restriction

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.210
since nothing here seems
to indicate that?

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.310
All I hope that you can see
from my discussion--

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.950
and this will also be written up
in our supplementary notes,

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.600
so if you need some
reinforcement from what I'm

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.500
doing in the-- not from what I'm
doing the lecture, but in

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.320
addition to what I'm doing in
the lecture you can get this

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.370
from the notes too.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.080
But what I want you to see is
that what the average book

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.620
defines to be 'y' equals inverse
'sine x', and then

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.100
puts in the so-called principal
values, simply turns

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.560
out to be what I'm calling
''s sub 0' inverse'.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.780
After all, what was 'y' equals
''s sub 0' inverse x'?

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.820
That would be rewritten how?

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:11.200
That's equivalent to saying 'x'
equals ''s sub 0' of y'.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.610
But ''s sub 0' of y' was
defined to be what?

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:22.270
'Sine y' provided that 'y' was
in the range from minus pi

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.870
over 2 to plus pi over 2.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.260
So far so good.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.606
At least that's one
man's opinion.

00:09:30.606 --> 00:09:34.370
What I'd like to show you now
is again, the beauty of what

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.010
inverse functions means.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.620
That from this point on, I can
now, for example, in terms of

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.920
calculus, get every single
calculus result I need about

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.450
derivatives of the inverse
trigonometric functions just

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.050
by restating them in terms
of the ordinary

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.390
trigonometric functions.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.190
For example, suppose somebody
were to say to me, find the

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:02.100
derivative of inverse sine of
'x' with respect to 'x'.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.430
Again, keeping in mind now what
this means, otherwise I

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.670
don't have a function.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.510
I have to have this thing
single-valued.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.860
This thing does it for me.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.770
Look it, do I know
how to find the

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.060
derivative of the sine function?

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.150
The answer is yes, I do.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.040
We've already done that.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.830
That was the last assignment,
in fact.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:24.240
In other words, from 'x'
equals 'sine y',

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.750
can I find 'dx dy'?

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.850
Certainly.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:34.550
'dx dy' is 'cosine y'.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.560
Now, look it.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.160
We didn't want 'dx dy',
we wanted 'dy dx'.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.530
But since we're on a 1:1 strip
here where the inverse

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.520
function does exist, notice that
the relationship between

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.930
'dx dy' and 'dy dx'
is that they are

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.130
reciprocals of one another.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.640
That was exactly one of the
nice properties of this

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.400
notation that we've
talked about on

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.950
several occasions before.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:04.930
In other words, 'dy dx'
is '1 over cosine y'.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.310
By the way, I like this better
than saying things like the

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.340
reciprocal of cosine
of secant.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.010
I think when you print a book
people like to use secant

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.400
instead of 1 over the cosine
simply because you can get

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.530
everything on one line and
don't have to write

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.710
fractions this way.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.730
But that is not a major
concern here.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.500
What I do want you to see is
given that 'y' equals 'inverse

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.910
sine of x', can I find dy dx?

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.010
The answer is yes.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.560
And by the way, notice
that this is

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.180
perfectly well defined.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.850
Namely, for a given value of
'y', 'cosine y' you see a

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.410
single value.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.800
For a given number, it
has only one cosine.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.640
You see, I don't need

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.680
single-valuedness to get this result.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.060
The place I have to be careful
about inverse functions

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.140
existing is that since there
are many different x-values

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.350
that correspond to the same
y-value, if I don't specify--

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.580
you see, if I have a
multi-valued function, if I

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.880
don't specify what branch I'm
on the trouble will not come

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.940
in when I'm looking for 'dy dx'
at a given value of 'y'.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.420
It's that 99 times out of 100,
when you're looking for 'dy

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.070
dx', 'y' is given as
a function of 'x'.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.900
In other words, you want to be
able to convert this in an

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.720
ambiguous way into a
function of 'x'.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.240
That's the question
that comes up.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.200
There is nothing wrong
with this answer.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.800
In other words, I can write
down that 'dy dx' is

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.070
'1 over cosine y'.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.040
But somebody can say
to me, I'd like the

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.170
answer in terms of 'x'.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.400
By the way, how can I get this
answer in terms of 'x'?

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.140
That's an interesting
question sometimes.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:52.280
Recall that 'y' equals
inverse sine of 'x'.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.630
The same as what?

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.790
'x' equals 'sine y'.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.790
Now what identity do I know?

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.550
I know that sine squared plus
cosine squared is 1.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:11.050
'x squared' is 'sine
squared y'.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.110
Now what do I know?

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:18.510
I know that 'cosine squared y'
is '1 - sine squared y'.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.930
So 'cosine y' is plus or minus
the square root of '1 - sine

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.100
squared y'.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.470
That's plus or minus the square

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.660
root of '1 - x squared'.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.710
Notice by the way, in this
notation that 'y' wasn't any

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.000
old number. 'y' had to
be in what range?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.610
'y' had to be between minus
pi over 2 and pi over 2.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.490
And as long as that's the case,
notice that in that

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.990
range the cosine is positive.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.110
That makes the negative
sign redundant.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.380
And by the way, that negative
sign would not be redundant if

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.960
we hadn't restricted our range
to making the curve

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.930
single-valued and 1:1.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.170
You see, it's the restriction
that 'y' has to be between

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.860
minus pi over 2 and pi over 2
that makes this the positive

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.160
square root.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.800
In other words then, what
we see is what?

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:22.880
That therefore 'dy dx' is equal
to '1 over cosine y'.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:29.850
That's 1 over the square root
of '1 - 'x squared''.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.940
And that's a rather interesting
result.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.240
It's a rather straightforward
result.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.120
I would like to make a few
comments about this thing.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.560
And one of them is what I want
to summarize with later too.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.960
Suppose you are given the
problem of saying, I would

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.980
like to trace a curve, or plot
a curve, and all I know about

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.680
that curve is that its
derivative at any point is 1

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.190
over the square root of 1
minus the square of its

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.690
x-coordinate.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:02.320
Do you have to know any
trigonometry to understand

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.240
that problem?

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.470
In other words, notice that
this expression in no way

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.270
utilizes trigonometry.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.890
Yet to solve this problem, it
appears from what we've shown

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:14.840
is that what?

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.730
That given that the slope is
this, the curve itself turns

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.150
out to be 'y' equals
'sine inverse x'.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.100
And that is an inverse
trigonometric function.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.790
And so here's a very important
reason as to why the

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.110
trigonometric functions
are that important.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.730
The inverse trigonometric
functions.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.860
Namely, inverse trigonometric
functions can

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.900
wind up as being what?

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.400
The inverse derivative of
a function which is

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.690
non-trigonometric.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.860
And that's reason enough
to study these things.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.020
Again, as I told you in my
last lecture, I was sadly

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.070
mistaken when I thought that
trigonometry belonged solely

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.270
to the surveyor.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.190
I mean, look at all the
different places that this

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.570
material comes up in.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.520
And if you don't like practical
applications, at

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.220
least observe that all we're
really doing here is

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.260
discussing inverse functions in
terms of function itself.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.850
In other words, the result that
we've shown now is that

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.560
the integral of 1 over the
square root of '1 - 'x

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.680
squared'' is 'inverse sine
x' plus a constant.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.420
By the way, since there is such
a connection between the

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.880
inverse trig functions and the
regular trig functions, and

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.720
since the trig functions lend
themselves to geometry rather

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.850
nicely, I thought I would like
to show you here a rather nice

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:38.930
device that allows you say, to
solve problems like this if

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.040
you weren't given the
answer in advance.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.000
In other words, you'll notice
that in our problem by sort of

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.590
working backwards, we found
that the answer to this

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:53.980
problem was 'inverse
sine x + c'.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.170
And the question is, what if
we hadn't been given this?

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.500
Is there a way that we
could've utilized the

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.890
knowledge of trigonometry,
classical trigonometry, to get

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.829
a hint as to how to do this?

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:10.760
And not only is there such a
way of doing this, but the

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.140
method turns out to be so
important that later in the

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.520
course, in the section called
'techniques of integration',

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.010
this comes up under the very
special name of trigonometric

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.109
substitution.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.550
It works something like this.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.160
Whenever you see the sum or the
difference of two squares,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.200
think of a right triangle.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:35.730
For example, in this case, if
I call the hypotenuse 1 and

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.710
one of the sides 'x', and call
this angle theta say, the

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.110
third side of the triangle
is the square

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.380
root of '1 - 'x squared''.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.990
And now if I think of this this
way, what is the easiest

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.850
relationship that allows me
to express theta as a

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.700
trigonometric function
involving 'x'?

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.315
There are many trigonometric
relationships I can reach from

00:17:58.315 --> 00:17:59.210
this diagram.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.420
But it appears that the easiest
one is the one that

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.560
says 'sine theta' equals
'x' over 1.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.950
In other words, 'sine
theta' equals 'x'.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.300
And now you see from this using
differential notation

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.120
and the like--

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.520
and again, the technique will be
drilled into you and you'll

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.750
get plenty of opportunity
for using this in the

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.260
exercises in the text.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.110
But for now, I just want you to
get to see an idea of how

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.410
the trigonometry does
come back into this.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.620
Notice that from this diagram
I get this relation.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.670
Now taking the differential of
both sides and notice that I'm

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.270
working with the ordinary trig
functions here, which I

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.510
allegedly know at this stage.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.860
I also know from this triangle
that the square root of '1 -

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.380
'x squared'' is 'cosine
theta'.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.330
Therefore, if I make these
substitutions in the integral

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.250
'dx' over the square root of '1
- 'x squared'', using the

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:59.210
differential notation 'dx'
becomes replaced by 'cosine

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.550
theta 'd theta''.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:07.370
The square root of '1 - 'x
squared'' becomes replaced by

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.060
'cosine theta'.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.780
These cancel.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.110
The integral then turns out to
be what See the integral of 'd

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:17.200
theta' is 'theta'
plus a constant.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.170
But what was 'theta'?

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.220
Theta was what?

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.870
'Sine theta' was 'x', so 'theta'
is the number whose

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.120
sine is 'x'.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:36.600
Notice how the trigonometry
comes in and helps us to solve

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.610
a particular problem.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:43.700
A particular problem that might
not have seemed that

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.740
obvious if we hadn't have
used the trigonometry.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.000
And again, let me point out
where we've used the fact that

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.630
we're using 1:1.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.460
You see, when we drew this
particular triangle, we

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.890
assumed that 'theta' was
in the first quadrant.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.880
The angle could have been any
place if we're thinking of it

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.790
as an angle.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.480
And knowing the sine only
determines the cosine up to a

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.680
plus or minus.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.320
In other words, technically
speaking, this should've been

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.210
plus or minus over here.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.850
But the fact that for principal
values 'theta' must

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.600
be between minus pi over 2 and
pi over 2, and since the

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.880
cosine is positive in that range
that was why we were

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.010
able to get rid of the
negative sign.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:28.070
So again, all I want you to see
from this is the fact--

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.890
and this is very important.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.120
That aside from the inverse
trigonometric functions being

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.830
rather important, we can study
them completely by giving a

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.200
short lecture because everything
that we have to

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.020
know primarily came from
previous lectures.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.970
The hard part as is often the
case with inverse function

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.560
notation is that you may not be
familiar with the language

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.710
that rapidly.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.210
I sometimes, when I was first
learning, had to think twice

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.890
about notation like this.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.730
Let me start something
new here.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.600
I'll start at the bottom
and work up.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.940
When people wrote down
identities like this, I found

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.490
it very difficult to think
in terms of those.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.170
What does this say?

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.770
It says that the 'inverse cosine
of x' is pi over 2

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.290
minus the 'inverse sine of x'.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.630
And I couldn't remember why
that would be true.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.910
Yet the funny part is, if I
let-- see let's go back to the

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.080
top now and start.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.090
If I let 'y' equal 'inverse
cosine x' and tried to draw

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.050
what that really says--

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.340
see again, I have to be
careful about 1:1

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:32.990
and what have you.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.480
But if I just mechanically
translated this,

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.520
this would say what?

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.630
'x' equals 'cosine y'.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.120
'Cosine y' is 'x'.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.880
That's 'x' over 1.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.150
I've written it that way.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.430
Well, look it.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.870
If this angle is 'y', it's kind
of clear that this angle

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.550
is 'pi over 2' minus 'y'.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.660
Now in this familiar
environment, how difficult is

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.160
it for me to see that
the sum of these two

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.330
angles is pi over 2?

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.160
You see, in that familiar
environment it's almost so

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.870
obvious I wonder why anybody
would want to

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.340
point it out to me.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.730
Yet notice that from here,
how do I read this?

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.290
See what's another
name for 'y'?

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.340
In the angular system here,
'y' is that angle

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.700
whose cosine is 'x'.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.370
It's 'inverse cosine x'.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.700
What's 'pi over 2' minus 'y'?

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.230
'pi over 2' minus 'y' is that
angle whose sine is 'x'.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:28.470
See notice that the side that's
adjacent to 'y' is

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.630
opposite 'pi over
2' minus 'y'.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.720
At any rate, 'pi over 2'
minus 'y' can be named

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.130
'inverse sine x'.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.490
And so from this simple thing,
simple because the language is

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:43.170
familiar to me, I get down to
the result that inverse

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.570
'cosine x' plus 'inverse
sine x' is pi over 2.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.640
From which, of course, the step
here is a triviality.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.980
See again, when we often deal
with inverses, one of the

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.250
fringe benefits that we have is
that when we get stuck, we

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.270
can always reduce the
given result.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:05.850
Reverse the terminology so to
speak and return from the

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:10.450
inverse language to the
original language.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.280
Now again, let me point out that
once you have a result

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.000
like this all the results
of calculus work

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.500
the same way as before.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.650
For example, suppose somebody
says to me, gee, I wonder what

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.400
the derivative of 'inverse
cosine x' is

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.930
with respect to 'x'?

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.220
To be sure, I could go all
through this again and mimic

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.250
the results of getting
the derivative

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.640
for the inverse sine.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.490
But notice now, by this result,
this is just the

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:42.680
derivative with respect to 'x'
of pi over 2 minus the

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.130
'inverse sine of x'.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.080
But this is the derivative
of a difference.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.290
And a derivative of a difference
is the difference

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.430
of derivatives.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.720
And pi over 2 is a constant.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.040
So the derivative of
pi over 2 is 0.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.190
I already know how to
differentiate 'inverse sine of

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.820
x', I've done that before.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:03.650
So I want what?

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.110
Minus that derivative.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:10.760
I want 'minus 'd dx' 'inverse
sine of x''.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.130
And that in turn is just what?

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.420
Well, I'll write it over here.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.200
It's just minus 1
over the square

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.180
root of '1 - 'x squared''.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:25.210
And again, another result
but obtained with a

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.620
minimum of new knowledge.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:33.360
Now, I could go on but I think
that from here on in, it's

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.080
much easier for you to dig out
what you want on your own.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.200
I had some other material that
I thought I would give you,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.380
but I think that this will just
turn out to be a little

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.500
bit on the boring side now.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.590
Not boring, but in the sense
that either you see what I'm

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.580
driving at or you don't.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.480
And what I'd like you to do now
is simply to go and see

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.540
how much of this material
on inverse trigonometric

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.700
functions is yours now
free of charge.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.280
If I have to pick one thing I
want to caution you about,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.590
don't be upset by the language
called 'principal values' and

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.550
what have you.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.090
Everything comes out in the wash
if you recognize that we

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.440
legally cannot define an inverse
function unless we

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.840
have a 1:1 function
to begin with.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.290
So we must take the multi-valued
trigonometric

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.240
function and view it as
a union of 1:1 curves.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.730
And then you see if you want to
pick a different principal

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.880
value, I think if you understand
what's happening

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.000
basically, you'll be able to
do this thing on your own.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.860
In any event though, I think
this is enough on what we call

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.870
the 'inverse circular
functions'.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:45.550
So until next time, goodbye.
