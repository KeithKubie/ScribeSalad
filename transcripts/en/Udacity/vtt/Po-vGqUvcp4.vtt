00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.543
A mutation causing GABA to bind alcohol

00:00:02.543 --> 00:00:05.099
more efficiently, would lead to even more

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.584
activity of the GABA receptor pathway and

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:10.140
thus even greater delays in reaction times

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.670
and an increase in relaxation. If we prevented GABA from binding alcohol at all,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.350
then we wouldn't get any GABA activity and so we wouldn't see these effects.
