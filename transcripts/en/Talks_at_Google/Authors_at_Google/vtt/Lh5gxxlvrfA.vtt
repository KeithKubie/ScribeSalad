that we work and live.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.440
Her latest book, which
she'll discuss today,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.210
is "Wake Up to the Joy

of letting go of what
doesn't work for you

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.470
and finding what does.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.580
So please be sure to pick up a
copy of the book from the back.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.320

to Agapi Stassinopoulos.

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:37.800
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Well hi there everybody.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.440
How is everybody doing today?

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.450
Pretty good?

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.100
I just love this idea
of eating and talking.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.180
It's a very Greek tradition.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.150
We're always eating.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.460
I don't know if any of
you have been to Greece.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.980
And feel free to move
closer if you would like.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.740
I like to be able
to see you all.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.690
And I'm so thrilled to be
here in New York City speaking

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.300
to you about one of
my favorite subjects

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.490
in the world, which is joy,
happiness, and calmness.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.360
So wanted to ask if anybody
here would like to experience

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.930
more joy in their lives?

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.630
How about calmness?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.670
How about happiness?

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.560
All right, so what about
a little more fulfillment,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.300
creativity?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.440
How about a feeling of
feeling that everything is OK?

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.150
Yes, me too.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.150
So one of the best things
to start with all this

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.370
and to get more into our own
zone of calm and happiness

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.310
I have found is dancing.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.610
So I would like to all
stand up for a minute--

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.560
you can put your
food on the side--

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.290
and join me in just
moving our bodies

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.550
to one of my favorite
songs by Pharrell called,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.510
everybody, "Happy."

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.822
OK Greg, hit it.

00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:09.590
[MUSIC - PHARRELL, "HAPPY"]

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.190
And basically you can actually
pick up someone and dance

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.110
with them if you like.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.110
You can move your shoulders.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.500
You can move your hips.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.354
Nicole, where are you?

00:03:28.354 --> 00:03:32.490
Nicole said to me, you
can always dance alone.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.750
You can clap.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.080
And then you can
turn to somebody,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.320
and you can actually do that.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.210
My goodness, Googlers are shy.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.506
Nobody is dancing with anybody.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.730
All right.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.330
This is the country
western way of moving.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.218
And you can move hands.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.800
And I'm happy.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.120
Come along if you feel
like a room without a view.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.420
Nicole is doing great.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.490
OK, thank you.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.950
Thank you.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.444
Have you found
that when you move,

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.860
you actually start
to feel better?

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.270
And have you found that when
you actually breathe deeply,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.630
you start to feel better?

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.280
If you agree, you can
actually raise your hand.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.050
Because part of the amazing
things as human beings

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.730
is I have discovered that
what gets us really stuck

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.270
is we stay stuck in our heads.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.130
And in this book, one of
the chapters, chapter three,

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.460
is called "Making Your
Health a Priority."

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.600
And I have about three pages
about facts about the body.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.240
And one of the things
that we talk a lot about

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.270
is that we have about
70,000 thoughts a day.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.580
And about 70% of the
thoughts are negative.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.150
So what causes us
to feel stressed

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.590
is not so much what we do,
but pretty much how we think

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.160
about what we do and what we
think of ourselves while we're

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.940
doing it.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.460
So in my journey, or when
I started from Greece

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.040
and I went to London
and I started acting,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.510
and went to Los Angeles to do
a movie that didn't work out,

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.570
I started to discover
that my path was

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.700
very much about
connecting more deeply

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.070
and getting to
know about myself.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.200
So everything that
happened in my life,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.150
and everything especially
that didn't happen,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.800
led me to find a more
deep connection to Agapi,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.480
and to find out who I
was and what was about.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.600
So when I wrote this book
about two months ago,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.320
it was like a whole
collection of all the things

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.830
I learned in my life,
and especially the things

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.400
that we call hard in our lives.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.770
Has anybody here ever
gotten everything they want?

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.420
See, not me either.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.150
Has anybody here
ever gotten things

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.440
that they really went after
but they didn't happen?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.840
Could be relationships.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.090
Could be work.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.690
Could be that we
want more money.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.520
Could be that we want
greater position.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.320
Could be that we want
greater things in our lives

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.330
in terms of creativity, but
they don't actually happen.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.910
And what we mostly
do when that happens

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.110
is we start to make
judgments about ourselves.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.290
And we start to feel that there
is something wrong with us.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.900
And we as human beings
have this tendency

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.620
that I found as I was
traveling around the country,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.950
and I spoke to thousands of
people for my previous book

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.390
"Unbinding the Heart," that
there was a universal theme

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.740
of human nature.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.580
And that theme was that there
was a fundamental feeling

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.740
of lack, a fundamental feeling
that we were lacking something,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.860
that we didn't have
it all together,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.890
when no one out there
has it altogether,

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.220
and that we were judging
our journey as we

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.840
were taking our journey.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.260
We were judging the things
that didn't happen to us.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.890
People were actually
feeling a sense

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.930
that they wanted to be
more fulfilled, that they

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.650
wanted a more calm, they
wanted a greater happiness.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.650
And part of it was that
people were not really giving

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:13.130
themselves the opportunity to
discover more about the times

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.420
in your life where
you stop and you pause

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.960
and you get to really find
out a little more about what

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.460
you are about.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.610
So a lot of the things
that happened in my life

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.230
were very disappointing, like
my career never happened.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.780
Has anybody ever had
disappointment in their lives?

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.610
And that disappointment were
things that I felt, well,

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.950
would I ever find
my own expression?

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.740
Would I ever find what
I was meant to do?

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.780
And the disappointment was worse
because I made myself wrong.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.600
And I judged myself for the
things that were not happening.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.740
So the feeling of lacking,
of not feeling enough-- and I

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.070
wrote in this book a whole
chapter that's called "Enough

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.900
of Not Feeling Enough."

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.840
And basically we
feel we're not enough

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.110
when we don't get the
things we want in our lives.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.010
So I wanted to dispel
that myth, and really

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.010
start to look at
ourselves from a place of,

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.620
we are like a masterpiece
at the same time

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.800
as a work in progress, and
that life sort of goes on

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.150
from day to day.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:26.190
But we stop connecting with
the things that bring us joy.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.880
So in my whole
path and evolution

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.640
of how I discovered things
was that, fundamentally, I

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.730
had to stop judging
myself for all the things

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.640
I wasn't getting,
and realize what

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.450
was the thing that I needed
to take care of myself.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.630
And taking care of
myself meant returning

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.510
to the source of
my own connection

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.080
with something that
was bigger than myself.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.790
Dispelling the myth that there
is something wrong with us

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.730
is something that we
must all do because we

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:10.560
have 37.2 trillion cells in
our body, making life for us

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.280
right now.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.620
Can everybody just say
that, 37.2 trillion cells?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.560
37.2 trillion cells,
can you say that?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.237
AUDIENCE: 37.2 trillion cells.

00:10:21.237 --> 00:10:23.445
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Can
you say it a little louder?

00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:27.360
AUDIENCE: 37.2 trillion cells.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.880
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
And can you possibly

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.630
imagine that these
cells are making life

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.825
right now, making us?

00:10:36.825 --> 00:10:38.220
Cells are dying.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.730
Cells or being reborn
cells are creating

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.110
and life is happening
despite of ourselves.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.600
Isn't that an amazing
phenomenon to realize

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.420
that there is a life force,
and the life force is really

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.520
breathing us?

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.710
And our very breath is
the portal to a bigger

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.455
thing than who we think we are.

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:05.670
Our very breath is
the breath of life.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.890
So I discovered
little by little--

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.150
Nicole was here hosting me
today, was welcoming me,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.370
said to me, "How long
have you been meditating?"

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.150
How many people here meditate?

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.440
That's so great.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.790
And how many people would
like to learn how to meditate?

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:27.560
So, again, dispelling the myth
of meditation, that meditation

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.490
is hard, I realized that
I started meditating

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.920
when I was 12 years old.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.550
My mother taught me
and my sister Arianna

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.620
how to meditate and to do yoga.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.954
But of course, you know,
when you're 12 years old,

00:11:41.954 --> 00:11:43.370
you don't really
want to meditate.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.540
You just want to have
fun with the boys.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.560
And really you want
to have fun in life.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.480
So I stopped meditating.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.590
And then I discovered that
what I really wanted to do

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.130
is just dance and sing and act.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.680
But later in my life when I
was getting very stressed,

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.500
when I was in Los Angeles
trying for my acting career,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.930
I rediscovered meditation.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:12.030
And what it started to do for
me is take me deeper to myself.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.340
So meditation was a
practice that took me out

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.460
of my own negative
thinking of myself,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.730
and started to connect me
with a part of myself that

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.870
is real and alive and
it is the spirit in me.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:31.100
And that spirit was kind of
waiting for me to connect

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.220
with myself in a deeper way.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.140
With everything else
in life, it's practice.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.060
It's microscopic
steps every day.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.200
And doing something every
day started to change me.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.480
I started to realize that
the most important thing was

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.960
to make something
like my practices,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.720
but to also bring
my joy in them.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.290
That if I was doing it
without my own heart--

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.620
and you know, there's so much
talk now about mindfulness.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.560
But I realized that what I
had to do more than anything

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.500
is open up my heart
to my own self.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.150
And to do that, which I called
the art of loving yourself,

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.240
had to do with a deeper
acceptance of myself,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.990
deeper acceptance of all the
things I thought I couldn't do,

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.930
that I was not good enough,
that I was inadequate.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:30.140
And then as I started to open
up to a compassion and a love

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.530
for myself, a
forgiveness of myself,

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:39.360
an appreciation of who I was,
everything started to flourish.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.510
It was absolutely
amazing, that really we

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.320
hold the treasure of who
we are in our very hands.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.590
But we have to back
away and disconnect

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.760
from the world to connect back
to who we think we have inside.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.640
And the way we start to do
that is by a certain reverence

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.200
and gratitude.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.180
Have you ever realized that
if we lived in gratitude,

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.670
our whole life would
be transformed?

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.890
I want to ask you if you
have ever felt something

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.740
where you were doing something
and you are taking yourself

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.760
for granted?

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.250
How many people here take
themselves for granted,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.400
or life, or
everything around us?

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.080
Have you ever had an
experience where you were like

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.090
shook and you said, oh my
God, if this goes well,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.230
I will never again take
anything for granted?

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.020
And then you go back and you
take something for granted.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.500
And it could be like we
are stuck on the subway

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.340
and you don't know
what's going to happen.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.260
And you're stuck on the subway.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.830
It's happened to me where I
would be stuck for an hour.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.390
And you can hardly breathe.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.880
And you say, whenever
the subway now

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.340
gets back to its
destination, I will never

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.720
complain about anything.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.120
Did that ever happen to you?

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.390
And then what happens to us?

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.940
We go back and we
complain about everything.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.680
Well, in this book, I wrote
a chapter called "Gratitude,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.050
Reverence, and Oh My God."

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:12.180
And it was really about
being taught from life itself

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.980
about gratitude,
because life has

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.680
a way of really
humbling us and making

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.140
us understand that there
is something bigger

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.010
than ourselves.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.360
So one day I was going
to Montana to speak,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.040
and there was a
snowstorm in New York.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.220
And while I was going to
the airport, I arrived there

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.890
and I realized that
my plane was canceled.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.380
So I had to go back to New
York and leave the next morning

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.140
at 5:00 AM, and then
arrived in Montana.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.400
It was a very hard trip.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.630
I was speaking to a lot
of hospital practitioners

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.410
and patients.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.380
And it was just intense.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.270
And on my way back, I
stopped in Salt Lake City.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.880
And we arrived there
only to find out

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.260
that the plane was
canceled, and that we

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.250
had to get back to sleep
in Salt Lake City, and then

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.550
the next day to leave
again at 5:00 AM.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.860
Well I arrived there, and
I was absolutely bitching.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.470
And I said, "I can't believe
this is happening to me.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.400
This is so hard.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.590
This has been a horrible trip."

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.790
And I was complaining.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.550
And suddenly-- has
anybody ever done that,

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.110
when you just kind of--

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:27.210
you feel like life is
tragic at that moment.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.580
And it's catastrophic
thinking, right?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.130
It's like things
couldn't be worse.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.760
And there's zero
gratitude in you.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.870
And I heard this voice
inside that said,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.102
start thanking everything.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:45.060
And I looked around and
there was no one around

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.820
except me really telling myself,
start thanking everything.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.910
And so I started to thank first
of all that the plane landed.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.540
And then I started to thank
that I had a chair to sit on

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.150
and I had a credit card
and I could go to a hotel

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.510
and that I had a phone, a
cell phone, that was working.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.040
And then I started
to thank the fact

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.030
that I had a family that
I love that I could call.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.849
And one thing after another--
within three minutes,

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:18.210
a friend of mine called me
and said, "Where are you?"

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.000
And I said, "I'm
in Salt Lake City.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.410
My flight has been canceled."

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.940
And she said, "Oh
that's so funny,

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.450
because I'm coming to Salt
Lake City tonight at midnight.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.040
And I have a suite at the hotel.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.390
I'm speaking there.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.190
Why don't you go stay there?

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.390
You can stay in the
big room in the bed.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.390
I'll sleep on the couch.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.181
And tomorrow I'll take
you to the airport."

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.250
It was amazing.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.100
And that's exactly what I did.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.620
I went to the hotel.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.050
I stayed in the
big king sized bed.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.730
I ordered room service.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.140
I watched TV.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.000
I had a fantastic night.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.520
At 5:00 AM, my
friend woke me up.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.720
She drove me to the airport.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.230
And I got on that flight.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.150
And I was so grateful.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.630
I was grateful for the
cold coffee that was lousy.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.610
I was grateful for
the stewardesses

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.820
who were not particularly nice.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.160
I was grateful for everything.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.140
And this gratitude changed--

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.260
that moment I remember
changed my life.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.690
And I have that
story in the book.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.000
And from then on I said,
what would life be like

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.530
if I lived life as
a thank you, if I

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.720
lived every day as a thank you?

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.890
And I want to challenge you.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.720
I want to sort of
call you to action

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.300
and say, would you take a day--

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.120
would you take a day and
think of nothing else

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.900
but just thank you,
thank you for everything?

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.780
So I'm just going to
go around the room

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.702
and just say one thing
you are thankful for.

00:18:47.702 --> 00:18:50.324
AUDIENCE: The fantastic
brownie I just ate.

00:18:50.324 --> 00:18:51.990
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Fantastic brownie.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.120
I want one of those brownies.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.172
I'm going to have
one afterwards.

00:18:56.172 --> 00:18:57.940

environment here.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.372

Boy, the best, the best.

AUDIENCE: Family.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.160

AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Yoga, yes.

00:19:19.735 --> 00:19:22.585
AUDIENCE: Well you just
said living in New York,

00:19:22.585 --> 00:19:24.010
so I'll say living in America.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.676
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Living in America.

00:19:25.676 --> 00:19:27.942
Yes, yes, me too.

00:19:27.942 --> 00:19:30.400
AUDIENCE: Having the
greatest daughter ever.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.150
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
The greatest what?

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.080
AUDIENCE: Daughter.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.610
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
The greatest daughter.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:34.651
How old is your daughter?

00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:35.260
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.730

God bless her.

AUDIENCE: Indoor plumbing.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.240
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Indoor plumbing.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.775
Oh, I had this
experience yesterday.

00:19:44.775 --> 00:19:47.710
And I said, "Our
shower wasn't working."

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.990
And that made it work.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.070
And we had hot water.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.400
And I said, I'm thankful for
hot water and shower pressure.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.710
That was the other thing.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:57.460

And you?

00:20:02.712 --> 00:20:06.610
Somebody, there,
you, behind, you.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.110
Yes?

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.820
AUDIENCE: I was the one
that said indoor plumbing.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.945
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Oh,
you said indoor plumbing.

00:20:10.945 --> 00:20:12.380
Yes?

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.780
AUDIENCE: I think maybe
the ability to run.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.670
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Ability to run, yes.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:18.670
AUDIENCE: Internet.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.170
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Internet.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.015
AUDIENCE: The opportunity
to come to talks like this.

00:20:23.015 --> 00:20:24.640
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
That's beautiful.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.280
Thank you.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.303
Thank you.

00:20:27.303 --> 00:20:29.568
AUDIENCE: Ibuprofen.

00:20:29.568 --> 00:20:30.480
Ibuprofen.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.813
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Ibuprofen.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.465
Then we have the lady behind.

00:20:36.465 --> 00:20:37.645
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:37.645 --> 00:20:39.270
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
What did you say?

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.853
I didn't hear.

00:20:39.853 --> 00:20:40.530
AUDIENCE: Light.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.905
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Light, yes.

00:20:43.998 --> 00:20:45.456
AUDIENCE: Actually
the same as him.

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:48.106
I'm just really happy that
we these opportunities here

00:20:48.106 --> 00:20:50.129
at Google [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:50.129 --> 00:20:51.462
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Beautiful.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.017
Yes, anybody?

00:20:56.017 --> 00:20:57.350
AUDIENCE: Public transportation.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.236
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Yes, thank you.

00:20:59.236 --> 00:21:00.202
AUDIENCE: Health.

00:21:00.202 --> 00:21:01.410
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Health.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.260
AUDIENCE: Family.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.440
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Family.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:04.940
What?

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.530
AUDIENCE: Movement.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.030
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Movement, yes.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.130
Chris?

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.480
AUDIENCE: The opportunity to
come to these [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.325
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Thank you.

00:21:12.325 --> 00:21:14.567
AUDIENCE: For my
[INAUDIBLE] or my kids.

00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:15.900
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS: Your kids.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.400
Bridget?

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.290
AUDIENCE: My sister.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:17.850
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Your sister.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.844
AUDIENCE: Food to eat.

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:20.260
AGAPI STASSINOPOULOS:
Food to eat.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.220
Thank you.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:21.960
Yes, me too.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.890
I'm grateful for my
sister too as well.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.210
So I started to think about how
our brain can actually change

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.320
and we can train our brain,
because so much of our stress

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.760
comes from the mind and the
brain and the emotional state.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.450
And I started to think how
if I changed my thoughts

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.000
and if I changed
it into gratitude--

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.110
and every night I want to
really encourage you, for those

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.750
of you who write in a journal--

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.680
I saw Chris has a beautiful
notebook and a pen.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.380
And she says, "I like to take
time out of my computer."

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.380
And I love to take out of
my computer and my phones.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.150
And I find that
when I disconnect

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.820
and I go into my journal and
I just write things down,

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.780
I start to connect more deeply
with myself, my emotional life.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.670
Poems have come out of me.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.210
This whole book came
out of reflection

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.270
and disconnecting from
the world to connect back

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:22.480
to me, and to something that
is much more bigger than who

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.490
we are and taking
time out of what

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.070
limits me to the part
of me that is unlimited.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.250
And as I write, I
start to experience

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.210
that other creative
energy that we all have.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.860
There's a chapter
in the book where

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.550
I call a lot about how to
tap into your creativity.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.580
Because people sometimes
think, well, I'm not creative.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.480
I'm not creative like
Mozart or Ernest Hemingway

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.310
or Picasso or Baryshnikov
or the great dancers,

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.470
and I can't sing like Adele.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.110
Well, who can?

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.720
But we can all
sing in the shower.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.910
I think Craig was there
and I said, do you dance?

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.790
And he said, "Well I dance
when I'm by myself, because I

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.230
don't like to be seen."

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:13.450
But it's like when we actually
stop ourselves and say, well,

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.550
creativity is
inherited in all of us.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.400
And we can be creative.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.290
If we remember when we
were little kids and you

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.490
were all creative, and that
creativity is really in us.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.020
And each person, no
matter how busy we are,

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.000
we can all tap into
our own creativity.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.020
It's how we do things.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.240
How do we bring back the joy?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:42.060
So how we wake up to the
joy is by giving ourselves

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.780
permission to get
out of our own stuff,

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.570
to get back to the
part of us that really

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.960
knows how to do our lives
in a calmer, happier, more

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.120
joyful way.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.800
Taking time out every day
to be present with yourself,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.750
because all of us get from
one thing to the other

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.040
and we got to do, got to do,
got to do, the deadlines,

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.340
and taking time
to teach ourselves

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.070
and retrain is like going to
the gym where you actually

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.810
start to train your muscles.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:18.150
I mean, none of us go to the
gym once and build biceps.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.250
It's sort of like
over and over again.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.540
And that discipline,
that devotion,

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:29.850
and that discernment of what
is more important for us daily

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.250
is where, I think,
distinguishes a human being

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.020
from being a happier,
more fulfilled

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.530
human being, a human being
that includes themselves

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.010
in their lives, includes
their emotional life

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.890
and connects with themselves.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:49.740
And then you become more
awake in who you are.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.930
And the other habit is the habit
that really can take you down.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:59.130
And each day is a choice.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.860
How do we choose to
really be more present?

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.920
And how do you choose
to be more heartfelt?

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.620
Because ultimately
if you ask me,

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.580
Agapi, what is the secret
to happiness, I would say,

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.720
the secret to happiness is
keeping your heart open.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.220
When our hearts are open--

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.340
how many of you have felt
when your heart is open,

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.080
like the gentleman who
said my little girl who

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.230
is two years old,
I mean, already you

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.680
feel the openness of his heart
as he talks about his daughter.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.680
But imagine being like
that throughout the day

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.780
when he's with his
employees and when

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.900
he is with colleagues,
when he's with his friends,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.900
and when he is with himself.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:47.230
So how do we bridge the
separation between our heart

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.820
and ourselves?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.970
And that's part of, when we
do a little guided meditation

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.670
afterwards, that's what
I would love to teach you

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:59.460
all is how do you get back
to being your bestest,

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.760
your bestest friend, your
kindest, most loving friend.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.380
There is an
expression that I love

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:10.120
that says treat yourself as if
you were someone inexpressibly

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.860
dear to you.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.640
Treat yourself as if you were
inexpressibly dear to you.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.000
Treat yourself like you really,
really would treat someone

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.950
you really, really loved.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.610
And then something
happens in the world

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.460
where our magic
starts to happen,

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.390
where we don't start to
disconnect from ourselves.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.220
Because what really stresses us
is living a disconnected life.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:41.290
And I'm sure all of you here
have felt this incredible surge

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.330
when we have a
connection with an idea,

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:46.210
with another human being,
with our colleagues,

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.120
with work, where you
feel suddenly connected.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.280
Isn't that the most
wonderful feeling?

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.040
But it takes energy.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.020
It takes consciousness.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.210
It takes not being on autopilot.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.060
Because when we are on
autopilot, we [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.770
automatic.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:05.890
And life doesn't happen
we're on our automatic.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.970
Life happens when we
actually wake ourselves up.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.070
And it's really
waking up to our joy.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.990
But how do you wake
up to your joy?

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.520
You also have to admit that
lesser feelings, the feelings

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.910
that we have that
we call negative,

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.470
so that when you're
feeling disconnected,

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:29.290
separate, upset, sad,
rejected, angry, people

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:35.150
who feel tremendous loss,
if we numb ourselves

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:40.330
to those feelings, we're going
to numb ourselves to our joy.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.900
So in Greece, I don't know how
many of you have been there,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.610
but I want to tell
you, in our vocabulary,

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.090
we don't have the word fine.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:50.740
When you ask
somebody, how are you,

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.170
they say, I'm really,
really upset today.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.190
Why are you upset?

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.830
Well because this person didn't
do what I asked them to do,

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.410
or because my boyfriend
came up too late at night.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.670
And then you say he did?

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:01.840
You say yes, he did.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.840
Well you say, well, let's
go kill the bastard.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.580
Because you know,
Greek tragedies--

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.250
you've heard of
Greek tragedies--

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.470
emotions are very big.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.770
And we give ourselves
permission, Italians, Greeks,

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.080
Spaniards, you
know, Latin people,

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.640
they give themselves
more permission

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.710
to express their emotions.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.780
And what happens when you
express your emotions?

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.350
You feel a sudden
aliveness, true?

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:32.620
So numbing ourselves to
our feelings that we judge

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.680
is also numbing
ourselves to our joy.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.850
So how did you get into the
feelings that you judge?

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.950
You voice them.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.500
You tell a friend.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.280
Again, in Greece we
don't have therapists.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:47.946
We have friends.

00:28:47.946 --> 00:28:49.670
We talk to them forever.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.600
Talk to your friends.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.700
How many people have
had this release when

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.280
you have a safe place
with a friend to say,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.360
this is what's going on.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.140
I'm not happy here.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.670
I'm not really happy in
the relationship when

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.530
you find that a
relationship isn't going

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:07.040
or you want more love or
you want more connection.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.890
And part of what happens in
our culture is we isolate.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.600
We hide from each other.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.290
We feel a shame of
our own separation,

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.600
of our own loneliness,
of our own feelings

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.430
that are not elevated.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:23.757
That's not good.

00:29:23.757 --> 00:29:25.340
And I'll tell you
why that's not good,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.130
because that's part of
what makes us human beings.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:34.460
So when we face the true nature
of what we are experiencing

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.790
in the moment, we can
release ourselves from it

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.940
and go to another place
that is calm, that is happy,

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.350
and that is joyful.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.300
Am I making sense to all of you?

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.160
Are you with me?

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.800
And where do we start with that?

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.990
We start by saying to
ourselves, I give you

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:55.040
permission to be all of you.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.980
And it's like being
there for ourselves

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:03.000
no matter what's going on,
not in just the good times.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.250
The most unhappiness
happens is because we

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.400
suffer from self-abandonment.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:14.160
We abandon ourselves at the most
critical moments of our lives.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.790
Everybody has gone through
a breakup in a relationship

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:21.180
where you suddenly feel,
he doesn't love me.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.470
She doesn't love me.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.430
There's a breakup.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:27.390
And at that moment, not only
that person leaves, but then

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.340
we leave ourselves.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.440
Because now we've
judged ourselves.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.140
We've made ourselves
feel less than.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.300
We feel love will
never happen again.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.510
We do catastrophic thinking.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:43.170
So part of this whole book is
I collected all this material

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.710
and all these stories from
everybody I learned out there.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.170
And I realized that
we're all the same.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:50.660
It's extraordinary.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.990
We are all the same.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.820
We all have the same issues.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.160
It's just they look different.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.500
Mine is the Greek
version, for example.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:06.480
And men, women, we all want
more of the good things in life.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.670
And we are scared to show
each other who we really are.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.210
We're scared to show our hearts.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.170
We're scared to reach
out, to connect.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:19.690
Because why do you
think we're scared?

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.890
Because we feel we're
going to be rejected,

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.180
or because we feel people
are going to see us

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.880
and they're not going
to really like us.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:34.330
And the human heart longs
to be known, to be seen,

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.600
to be shared, and to
live in gratitude.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.060
Our human heart,
the physical heart,

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:49.870
beats 28.2 billion
times in a lifetime.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.010
It beats.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.150
It's the same heart
that in Bridget,

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.970
in Greece, in Nicole, in Agapi--

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.670
I don't know all your names--
in Bert, in Alexander,

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.890
it's the same heart.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.420
It's the same beat.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.720
But we as humans separate.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.690
And we separate even
from people we love.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.230
And we're afraid to reach
out and connect with them

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:16.650
and look in their eyes
and say, I love you.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:20.430
And we are afraid to
really bring that love back

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:25.060
to ourselves, because we
feel it might go away.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.140
So how do you open the channels?

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:32.340
Meditation, pausing is one
of the most amazing ways

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.000
to open the channels.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.170
Kindness, caring, where
you start to realize,

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.450
it's like a thought and mindset.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.210
You start to look at people
and you know they're not really

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:45.800
much different than me.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.200
And that gives you
permission to open up.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.340
And what is extraordinary
I found in my life

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.790
is that we are transparent.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.980
Have you ever been in a
room and somebody walks in

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.794
and you know exactly
how they're feeling?

00:33:00.794 --> 00:33:01.670
You know.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.510
You know if they're upset.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.340
You know if they're happy.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.600
You know if they are
having a difficult moment.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.400
How do we know?

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.670
Because our intelligence of
our heart is way bigger than we

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.310
give it credit.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:25.270
Our intelligence of who we
are, if we gave ourselves

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:29.470
a chance, if we gave
ourselves permission,

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:35.220
is way bigger than the
intelligence of our brain.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:40.610
Now getting to that, connecting
with that, is magic--

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:42.570
magic.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.650
To miss that opportunity
in your lifetime

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.340
is such a shame, to
miss the opportunity

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.740
to connect with that
intelligence, the intuition,

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.930
your wisdom.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.990
So I want to encourage
you all to start

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:01.580
connecting with that part
by actually writing down.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.780
You can just take a journal
and say, the wisdom of my heart

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.920
is now speaking to me,
and open up the channels.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.380
It's more like you're
giving it permission

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.270
and you're going
beyond the mind,

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:21.949
the chatter of the mind, the to
do list, into the to be list.

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:25.040
And then you start to
walk with your presence.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:30.469
You know, we all have a soul and
a spirit, but we don't see it.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:32.960
We see the physical body.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.870
But you know all the
masters and all the mystics

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.139
talk about the soul.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:42.699
To get to the soul, you
have to invite it in,

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.610
because the soul is sort of
hanging somewhere in there.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:49.719
So I encourage you, as I said,
to live a day as a thank you,

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.840
to live a day, take a
day, and just invite

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.940
your soul in while you're
in your computers, when

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.520
you're doing your
deadlines, while you

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.130
are busy with everything.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:04.670
Just have soul awareness,
spirit awareness.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.990
It comes right from
your own breath,

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.290
because the breath
carries that spirit.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.010
That's why all meditation
say, go back to the breath.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.170
And that's where we
are going to do now

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.910
because we have a little time.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:22.710
We're going to go back and
connect with our own breath.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.970
So make yourself comfortable.

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.350
Open your hands a
little bit to receive.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.040
Check your shoulders.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.045
Relax your feet.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.140
Relax your neck, and take
a deep breath and exhale.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.240
And just take a deep breath.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.380
And this time as you
take a deep breath,

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:51.210
imagine that this breath
is filling your whole body

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.610
all over your head
and down to your feet.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:01.020
We're going to play
some very soft music.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.230
And I want to ask you right
now, as you take a breath

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:08.815
and you exhale, exhale your
tensions, your worries.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.820
Exhale anything
that's stopping you

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.740
from being fully
present in this moment.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.310
And focus on your heart.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.850
As you breathe in this time
and you focus on your heart,

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:44.520
soften your heart, and bring
in your awareness something

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.570
or someone you love.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:58.370
And let your heart become
so tender and open.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:13.770
This time as you breath in,
allow your breath to slow down,

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.880
to the count of four--

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:22.780
one, two, three, four.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:29.550
And as you exhale,
four, three, two, one.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.900
Start to think good thoughts.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.360
Start to think
wonderful good thoughts

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:53.080
about yourself, all the
good things in your life.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.770
And just say thank you.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.520
Thank you for this moment.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.730
Thank you for my breath.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.870
Thank you for my health.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.610
Thank you for this
work possibilities.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.870
Thank you for my aliveness.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:26.440
Thank you for my hands, my eyes
that see, my ears that hear.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:38.830
And start to open up a space
inside of you that begins

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:42.550
to see with your inner eye.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:54.210
Start to fall back
into yourself.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:39:03.140
Beyond the idea of
who you are live

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.600
the being of who you truly are.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.180
Let that be shown to you.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:30.160
And as you receive
your next breath,

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.660
be in awe of your breath.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:40.930
Where is my breath coming from?

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.160
How amazing it is
to be breathed.

00:39:52.485 --> 00:39:56.710
It's the same breath
that breathes all of us.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.860
And the best response is
to just say thank you.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.470
And open your heart to yourself.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.830
Allow that inner
light that we all

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:28.440
know and sense to
start to fill you up,

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.490
a light that comes
above your head

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:37.440
and connects you to your
heart, your emotional center,

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.675
fills your body, and your whole
energy with this inner light.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.480
You might want to
take your right hand

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.110
and place it in your heart,
just to connect with yourself.

00:40:59.216 --> 00:41:01.090
And you might want you
to take your left hand

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.040
and place it in your belly.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.315
That's where the emotional
center is of all our emotions.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:17.920
And start to feel how amazing
it is to take deep breaths,

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.895
slow breaths.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:28.690
And as you exhale, imagine that
there are waves of calmness

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:31.060
that turn into waves of joy.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.600
Start to be filled
with sunbeams inside,

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.970
like the sunbeam is
warming and illuminating

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.414
your consciousness.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:58.290
And this time as you breathe
in, look into yourself

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.570
and tell yourself thank you.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:03.790
Thank you.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.130
Thank you for all you do.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:14.940
Thank you for all
you have overcome.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.815
Thank you for your caring.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:30.680
Slowing down the breath
is the greatest gift

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:39.890
to give to ourselves, because
then we become present,

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:45.735
and we give ourselves the signal
that there is plenty of time.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:56.850
Time expands when we breathe
fully into our capacity.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:13.810
Allow your thoughts to float by
like clouds in the sky, nothing

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:14.310
to do.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:24.010
Just opening your heart
more deeply to yourself.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:39.200
37.2 trillion cells
are breathing you,

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.270
making you happen.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:49.160
The life force in
you is a miracle,

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.110
a miracle beyond ourselves.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:09.926
And the only response is thank
you, and gratitude to the life

00:44:09.926 --> 00:44:15.350
force, to the miracle
of life that is in you

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.040
and each person you meet.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:34.070
Whenever you feel
disconnected, remember,

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.880
this is a place to
come right back to you,

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:45.650
knowing that you are more
than enough, that all is well

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:46.265
in your world.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:58.990
And there is so many
possibilities to love more,

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:04.990
to have more joy, and to open
up to the gift of our lives.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:24.510
Take a deep breath and
let this breath fall now,

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.470
and fill you to capacity
in your own breath,

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:38.020
sending a wave of energy to
your work, your coworkers,

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:51.160
your family, your loved
ones, sending this energy,

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:59.850
this presence, this calmness
to the world that needs it.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:07.460
Like a canopy of
calmness, see everything

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:14.030
you touch from now on,
this moment, embraced

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.020
by this energy.

00:46:19.046 --> 00:46:24.060
It is available to you 24/7.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.090
Take it in.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:39.300
You can go to a deeper
place inside of you.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:55.950
And very gently smile
inside, like an inner smile,

00:46:55.950 --> 00:47:01.110
as if you know something that
is the secret of your life.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:08.270
Smile inside and smile outside.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:31.620
And in this moment of peace
that you've created here

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:42.020
for yourself, place everything
that feels more difficult

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:46.500
or a struggle or you
would like more of,

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:54.020
place it in this energy of
creativity, of possibility,

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.045
of calmness, and of peace.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:03.710
And in your creative
imagination,

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:09.140
start to see your day,
your days, and your life

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.090
the way you would like it to be.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:14.947
Charge it.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:19.330
Infuse it with good energy.

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:27.160
And start to see more
of, of the things

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.590
you would like in your life.

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.950
More of whatever you
would like, start

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:41.160
to see it and create
it, remembering

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:48.390
that you are a co-creator with
that life force in you, never

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:49.740
alone.

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:55.380
You can always return to that
place that is breathing you,

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:59.106
that is making your
life happen right now.

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:03.050
What a gift.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:35.680
And very gently
whenever you're ready,

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:43.000
start to move your shoulders
a little bit and your neck.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:50.417
And you can shake your
hands and your feet.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:58.412
And whenever you're ready,
you can open your eyes.

00:49:58.412 --> 00:50:02.290
And just take a deep breath
and extend your arms.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:08.380
And with a sound like ah, as
if you are just coming back

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.900
to this life for a moment.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:15.550
And one more breath
to the sound, ah.

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:16.960
And shake your shoulders.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.135
And just smile.

00:50:19.135 --> 00:50:22.855
Did that feel much calmer?

00:50:22.855 --> 00:50:25.480
Did everybody feel--
everybody felt so--

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.970
looking so beautiful and calm.

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:31.780
You would think that we were
over at the Himalayas actually.

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.270
Everybody kind of was glowing.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:39.910
So my friends, I just want to
invite you to give yourself

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:44.980
time, time to return to
yourself in your busy day

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.290
while you are in the
computer, while you

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:51.010
have all your deadlines,
just to remember,

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.170
never shut off your breath.

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:56.560
Give yourself this
conscious way of breathing.

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.230
That in itself can
change your life.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:01.720
Start thinking of all the
thoughts of what you want

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.780
to create rather than
what you don't want.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.090
Start thinking,
or write it down.

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:09.300
I want more of
that, more of that.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.300
Is it material?

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.350
Is it physical?

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:12.100
Is it emotional?

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.080
Is it mental?

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.200
Is it spiritual?

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.130
It doesn't matter.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:20.710
Make yourself into this
precious, amazing gift

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.180
of your life.

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:23.750
Don't take it for granted.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:25.960
Remember my story on the plane.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:30.970
In an instant in gratitude,
your life is transformed.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:34.090
Look at people and acknowledge
them for who they are.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.820
Appreciate them
over and over again.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:39.160
Don't wait for special
occasions, birthdays,

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.130
and Christmas and
Easter and holidays.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:45.280
Every day is your precious life.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.870
As you read this book, the
way I wrote it for 52 chapters

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.930
is because you can
open it at any chapter.

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:55.570
You can take it and
say, I just need

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:58.360
a little help with
something, and just open it,

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.250
and there it is.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:04.150
Suddenly you read "The
Gift of Intimacy."

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:07.840
Well, who would have thought
there's a gift in intimacy?

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.490
So you open it.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:10.720
Keep it by your bedside.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.170
Make it like your
companion where you just

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:17.230
want to get a little nugget,
a little inspiration.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:21.160
I wrote this book out
of my life's experiences

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.340
of what I learned in
my life to overcome

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.000
my own challenges, my own
difficulties, my own stuckness,

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.580
my own ideas that I was failing.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.850
I wrote it in a way to
show that there is always

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.820
an available new
path for all of us.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.420
When I did the audio, I
put 32 guided meditations.

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.250
Why guided meditations?

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:46.900
Because like I did before with
all of you, when you're guided,

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.810
your mind can stay
a little more still,

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:53.110
till you learn to
be so quiet inside

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:55.930
and you listen to that
inner voice that's

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.180
always telling you, go there.

00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.440
Don't go there.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.010
Do this.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.120
Don't do this.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.740
Connect with so-and-so.

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.060
It gives you signals.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:06.520
Like we talked
before, you always

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.830
are told of what's going on.

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:10.930
But we must listen.

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:12.640
We must listen to
the intelligence

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.551
of who we are, and not to just
give over to the little monkey

00:53:16.551 --> 00:53:17.050
mind.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:18.340
Are you with me?

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.120
Yes?

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.920
Write down every
night the things

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.690
you did that made you happy.

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:23.950
Your happiness matters.

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:25.270
You matter.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:27.400
Write down the things
that bring you joy.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.000
And find somebody to
be your joy buddy.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.290
It's important to have
a joy buddy to remind

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:35.320
you to bring your joy and say,
what did you do for your joy

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.880
today?

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.190
And write down three things
that you're grateful for.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:45.010
Gratitude-- joy triggers is a
shift to having a better life.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:46.150
It's not going to happen.

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:50.870
Having a happier life is not
going to happen automatically.

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:55.450
So I want to leave you with
one of my favorite quotes

00:53:55.450 --> 00:54:01.330
by Ian Thomas that says,
"Everyday, life will drag you

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:04.090
by the hand and say
this is important

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.640
and this is important,
and take care of this,

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.500
and this is what matters.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.990
And it's up to you to
take your hand back,

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:16.900
put it in your heart, and
say, no, this is important."

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.400
So honor your heart.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.330
It knows.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:20.800
It speaks.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.810
And it has things to tell you.

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:24.250
Listen to it.

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:29.060
It's a really powerful
intelligence we've been given.

00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:36.550
37.2 trillion cells want
to connect with you.

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:40.640
You owe it to yourself to
connect back to you and then

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.590
with each other.

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:43.520
Thank you.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.650
It has been an honor
and a privilege

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:48.400
to speak to this
amazing Google team.

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:53.510
I hear that Google employees are
the happiest employees around.

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.700
And I want to make
sure that is so.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:55:01.040
So I wanted to contribute my
own wisdom and my own happiness

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.150
to bring you more
joy in your life.

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:10.940
Because if we miss the
joy, we've missed a lot.

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:14.010
Don't miss the joy that's
available to all of us.

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:16.350
Thank you so much from
the bottom of my heart.

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:16.880
Thank you.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.930
[APPLAUSE]
