we're going to do a silly one today

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260
we're going to do a silly one today
 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.389
we're going to do a silly one today
we're going to talk about a special

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399
we're going to talk about a special
 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.800
we're going to talk about a special
number we like doing videos about

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810
number we like doing videos about
 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.240
number we like doing videos about
special numbers and we're gonna do a

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250
special numbers and we're gonna do a
 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.920
special numbers and we're gonna do a
prime because we do love our prime

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930
prime because we do love our prime
 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.020
prime because we do love our prime
numbers as well it's quite a big prime

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030
numbers as well it's quite a big prime
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.419
numbers as well it's quite a big prime
number so I'm gonna write it out so it's

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
number so I'm gonna write it out so it's
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.400
number so I'm gonna write it out so it's
going to start 357 six Tilian so it's

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
going to start 357 six Tilian so it's
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.029
going to start 357 six Tilian so it's
already going to be big 686 quintillion

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039
already going to be big 686 quintillion
 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.220
already going to be big 686 quintillion
312 quadrillion 646 trillion 216 billion

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230
312 quadrillion 646 trillion 216 billion
 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.860
312 quadrillion 646 trillion 216 billion
567 million six hundred and twenty-nine

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
567 million six hundred and twenty-nine
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.450
567 million six hundred and twenty-nine
thousand one hundred and thirty-seven so

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
thousand one hundred and thirty-seven so
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.500
thousand one hundred and thirty-seven so
it's a massive 24 digit prime number but

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
it's a massive 24 digit prime number but
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.340
it's a massive 24 digit prime number but
this is why it's special because if I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350
this is why it's special because if I
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.760
this is why it's special because if I
remove the first digit the three from

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
remove the first digit the three from
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490
remove the first digit the three from
that number the remaining number here

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
that number the remaining number here
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770
that number the remaining number here
starting with the five is also a prime

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
starting with the five is also a prime
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990
starting with the five is also a prime
number and if I do that again if I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
number and if I do that again if I
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.150
number and if I do that again if I
remove the five the remaining number

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
remove the five the remaining number
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.400
remove the five the remaining number
starting with the seven is also a prime

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
starting with the seven is also a prime
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.250
starting with the seven is also a prime
number and that will be true all the way

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
number and that will be true all the way
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.480
number and that will be true all the way
down so up to here 629 thousand one

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
down so up to here 629 thousand one
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.399
down so up to here 629 thousand one
hundred thirty seven is a prime number I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
hundred thirty seven is a prime number I
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320
hundred thirty seven is a prime number I
can remove the digit the next number

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
can remove the digit the next number
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.840
can remove the digit the next number
will be trying all the way down to seven

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
will be trying all the way down to seven
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.539
will be trying all the way down to seven
so it's always trying when I truncate

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549
so it's always trying when I truncate
 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490
so it's always trying when I truncate
from the left so it's got a left

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
from the left so it's got a left
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.149
from the left so it's got a left
truncate able pry and are finitely many

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
truncate able pry and are finitely many
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.120
truncate able pry and are finitely many
of them and that is the largest one and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
of them and that is the largest one and
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.390
of them and that is the largest one and
I learnt this from my friend Rob east

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
I learnt this from my friend Rob east
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460
I learnt this from my friend Rob east
away who has been on numberphile he's a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
away who has been on numberphile he's a
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.499
away who has been on numberphile he's a
mathematician as well and he gave me

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
mathematician as well and he gave me
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.100
mathematician as well and he gave me
this pencil with the number written on

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
this pencil with the number written on
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.550
this pencil with the number written on
it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
it
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.410
it
there is the number printed on the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
there is the number printed on the
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.020
there is the number printed on the
pencil so no matter how much I sharpen

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
pencil so no matter how much I sharpen
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.120
pencil so no matter how much I sharpen
this pencil I'm always going to have a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
this pencil I'm always going to have a
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.160
this pencil I'm always going to have a
prime number which I think it's wise

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
prime number which I think it's wise
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.960
prime number which I think it's wise
written on the other side of this pencil

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
written on the other side of this pencil
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.020
written on the other side of this pencil
there you go always in our prime it's a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
there you go always in our prime it's a
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.560
there you go always in our prime it's a
kind of a joke kind of a joke so this is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
kind of a joke kind of a joke so this is
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.749
kind of a joke kind of a joke so this is
a left from K table prime let me show

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
a left from K table prime let me show
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.429
a left from K table prime let me show
you how you can create them because

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
you how you can create them because
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530
you how you can create them because
they're not that hard to create so let's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
they're not that hard to create so let's
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.109
they're not that hard to create so let's
start with the last digit so the last

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
start with the last digit so the last
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.400
start with the last digit so the last
digit could be you know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410
digit could be you know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.690
digit could be you know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
or 9

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
or 9
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.510
or 9
my last digit could be any of the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
my last digit could be any of the
 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.670
my last digit could be any of the
but it has to be Prime as well because I

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680
but it has to be Prime as well because I
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.190
but it has to be Prime as well because I
want a Prime at the end so wine is not a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200
want a Prime at the end so wine is not a
 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.340
want a Prime at the end so wine is not a
prime - we could have a prime - at the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350
prime - we could have a prime - at the
 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.840
prime - we could have a prime - at the
end but that's not going to be able to

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
end but that's not going to be able to
 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.730
end but that's not going to be able to
be extended very much we could have

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740
be extended very much we could have
 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.680
be extended very much we could have
three as a prime number at the end four

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690
three as a prime number at the end four
 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.660
three as a prime number at the end four
we're not gonna have at the end five

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670
we're not gonna have at the end five
 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.090
we're not gonna have at the end five
could be at the end six no not a prime

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100
could be at the end six no not a prime
 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.750
could be at the end six no not a prime
seven maybe eight not a prime and nine

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760
seven maybe eight not a prime and nine
 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.460
seven maybe eight not a prime and nine
it's not a crime so it's going to have

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470
it's not a crime so it's going to have
 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.440
it's not a crime so it's going to have
to end with one of these numbers but

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450
to end with one of these numbers but
 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.050
to end with one of these numbers but
let's just try now to extend it back so

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060
let's just try now to extend it back so
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.220
let's just try now to extend it back so
we're going to extend it back to the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
we're going to extend it back to the
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.560
we're going to extend it back to the
left and make a two-digit number let's

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570
left and make a two-digit number let's
 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.050
left and make a two-digit number let's
go with the seven okay let's make a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060
go with the seven okay let's make a
 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.690
go with the seven okay let's make a
chain here let's go from the seven well

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700
chain here let's go from the seven well
 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.070
chain here let's go from the seven well
then if I extend it it's going to be

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080
then if I extend it it's going to be
 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.030
then if I extend it it's going to be
either 17 or 27 or 37 47 or 57 or 67 or

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040
either 17 or 27 or 37 47 or 57 or 67 or
 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.950
either 17 or 27 or 37 47 or 57 or 67 or
77 87 or 97 so which of these are prime

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960
77 87 or 97 so which of these are prime
 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.020
77 87 or 97 so which of these are prime
17 is a prime 27 that's not prime 37 is

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030
17 is a prime 27 that's not prime 37 is
 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.620
17 is a prime 27 that's not prime 37 is
prime 47 is prime 57 is not 67 is prime

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630
prime 47 is prime 57 is not 67 is prime
 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.920
prime 47 is prime 57 is not 67 is prime
77 that's not a prime 87 is not a prime

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930
77 that's not a prime 87 is not a prime
 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.860
77 that's not a prime 87 is not a prime
97 is a prime so let me just do a couple

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870
97 is a prime so let me just do a couple
 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.110
97 is a prime so let me just do a couple
more steps let's go from the 47 and

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120
more steps let's go from the 47 and
 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.350
more steps let's go from the 47 and
extend that further back 147 perhaps or

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360
extend that further back 147 perhaps or
 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.620
extend that further back 147 perhaps or
two four seven three four seven nine

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630
two four seven three four seven nine
 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.380
two four seven three four seven nine
four seven and we keep extending this if

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390
four seven and we keep extending this if
 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.000
four seven and we keep extending this if
we want to let's find a prime on that

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010
we want to let's find a prime on that
 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.150
we want to let's find a prime on that
list so nine four seven is a prime I'll

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160
list so nine four seven is a prime I'll
 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.120
list so nine four seven is a prime I'll
go like extend that back another step so

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130
go like extend that back another step so
 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.610
go like extend that back another step so
this could be one nine four seven

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620
this could be one nine four seven
 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.060
this could be one nine four seven
perhaps four to nine four seven oh nine

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070
perhaps four to nine four seven oh nine
 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.230
perhaps four to nine four seven oh nine
nine four seven I'm gonna extend another

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240
nine four seven I'm gonna extend another
 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.150
nine four seven I'm gonna extend another
step here I'm gonna go from this number

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160
step here I'm gonna go from this number
 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.560
step here I'm gonna go from this number
I know this is a prime so I'm going to

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570
I know this is a prime so I'm going to
 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.720
I know this is a prime so I'm going to
go from here next try and extend that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730
go from here next try and extend that
 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.540
go from here next try and extend that
back just do another step so this is

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550
back just do another step so this is
 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.440
back just do another step so this is
three nine four seven 3947 so that could

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450
three nine four seven 3947 so that could
 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.030
three nine four seven 3947 so that could
now be one three nine four seven or two

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040
now be one three nine four seven or two
 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.300
now be one three nine four seven or two
three nine four seven nine three nine

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310
three nine four seven nine three nine
 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.540
three nine four seven nine three nine
four seven I'm going to stop at this

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550
four seven I'm going to stop at this
 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.090
four seven I'm going to stop at this
step because if we do the checking

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100
step because if we do the checking
 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.849
step because if we do the checking
through none of these are prime this one

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859
through none of these are prime this one
 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.340
through none of these are prime this one
three nine four seven is not a trying to

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350
three nine four seven is not a trying to
 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.230
three nine four seven is not a trying to
three nine four seven is not a prime

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240
three nine four seven is not a prime
 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.200
three nine four seven is not a prime
three three nine four seven not a prime

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210
three three nine four seven not a prime
 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.710
three three nine four seven not a prime
to prime none of these are primes so the

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720
to prime none of these are primes so the
 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.680
to prime none of these are primes so the
chain stopped the chain is terminated so

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690
chain stopped the chain is terminated so
 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.540
chain stopped the chain is terminated so
the last prime we had there in that

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550
the last prime we had there in that
 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.110
the last prime we had there in that
chain was three nine four seven so

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120
chain was three nine four seven so
 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.020
chain was three nine four seven so
that's the end point for the chain that

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030
that's the end point for the chain that
 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.719
that's the end point for the chain that
we had a number of endpoints that you

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729
we had a number of endpoints that you
 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.430
we had a number of endpoints that you
can make just doing this kind of method

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440
can make just doing this kind of method
 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.409
can make just doing this kind of method
there's one thousand four hundred and

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419
there's one thousand four hundred and
 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.670
there's one thousand four hundred and
forty two of these endpoints so those

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680
forty two of these endpoints so those
 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.830
forty two of these endpoints so those
are going to be the largest Prime in the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840
are going to be the largest Prime in the
 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.230
are going to be the largest Prime in the
chain and the largest one of them is

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240
chain and the largest one of them is
 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.050
chain and the largest one of them is
this 24 digit number I've written out

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060
this 24 digit number I've written out
 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.480
this 24 digit number I've written out
but clearly you can see there are only

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490
but clearly you can see there are only
 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.730
but clearly you can see there are only
finitely many because once you get to an

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740
finitely many because once you get to an
 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.710
finitely many because once you get to an
end point they can't be extended any

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720
end point they can't be extended any
 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.219
end point they can't be extended any
further to the left so that's left from

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229
further to the left so that's left from
 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.920
further to the left so that's left from
capable primes so we do write to create

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930
capable primes so we do write to create
 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.270
capable primes so we do write to create
a book just to show you the largest one

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280
a book just to show you the largest one
 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.499
a book just to show you the largest one
that's possible I'll show you the

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509
that's possible I'll show you the
 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.360
that's possible I'll show you the
largest right truncated will prime so

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370
largest right truncated will prime so
 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.610
largest right truncated will prime so
this is just a bit of fun really so it's

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620
this is just a bit of fun really so it's
 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.460
this is just a bit of fun really so it's
a silly thing I know however if I used a

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470
a silly thing I know however if I used a
 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.960
a silly thing I know however if I used a
different base because this is a base

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970
different base because this is a base
 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.149
different base because this is a base
ten thing I use a different base if I

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159
ten thing I use a different base if I
 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.089
ten thing I use a different base if I
used a larger base base twelve base 20

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099
used a larger base base twelve base 20
 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.550
used a larger base base twelve base 20
or base 100 or something like that then

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560
or base 100 or something like that then
 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.399
or base 100 or something like that then
each step here would have longer lists

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409
each step here would have longer lists
 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.189
each step here would have longer lists
and if the list is longer then they're

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199
and if the list is longer then they're
 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.170
and if the list is longer then they're
more likely to hit a prime so you're

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180
more likely to hit a prime so you're
 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.060
more likely to hit a prime so you're
going to end up with longer chains you

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070
going to end up with longer chains you
 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.279
going to end up with longer chains you
actually end up with bigger left

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289
actually end up with bigger left
 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.529
actually end up with bigger left
truncate of all Prime's if you do it in

truncate of all Prime's if you do it in
 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.050
truncate of all Prime's if you do it in
a different base or a larger base for

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060
a different base or a larger base for

right to incapable primes the biggest

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590
right to incapable primes the biggest
 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.680
right to incapable primes the biggest
one we have is 73 million nine hundred

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690
one we have is 73 million nine hundred
 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.110
one we have is 73 million nine hundred
and thirty nine thousand 133 so now if I

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120
and thirty nine thousand 133 so now if I
 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.790
and thirty nine thousand 133 so now if I
start removing digits from the

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800
start removing digits from the
 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.370
start removing digits from the
right-hand side we will always have a

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380
right-hand side we will always have a
 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.300
right-hand side we will always have a
prime if I allowed one to be a prime we

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310
prime if I allowed one to be a prime we
 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.950
prime if I allowed one to be a prime we
could have a larger number we could have

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960
could have a larger number we could have
 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.709
could have a larger number we could have
this number one billion nine hundred and

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719
this number one billion nine hundred and
 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.290
this number one billion nine hundred and
seventy-nine million three hundred and

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300
seventy-nine million three hundred and
 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.810
seventy-nine million three hundred and
thirty nine thousand three hundred and

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820
thirty nine thousand three hundred and
 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.629
thirty nine thousand three hundred and
thirty nine so this is a prime number

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639
thirty nine so this is a prime number
 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.700
thirty nine so this is a prime number
and if we remove digits from the right

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710
and if we remove digits from the right
 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.399
and if we remove digits from the right
we always have a prime number but we end

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409
we always have a prime number but we end
 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.649
we always have a prime number but we end
up with one and one isn't a prime number

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659
up with one and one isn't a prime number
 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.060
up with one and one isn't a prime number
so I don't know why I even mentioned it

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070
so I don't know why I even mentioned it
 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.790
so I don't know why I even mentioned it
let's have a look at left and right to

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800
let's have a look at left and right to
 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.770
let's have a look at left and right to
incapable Prime's is there primers on

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780
incapable Prime's is there primers on
 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.230
incapable Prime's is there primers on
both lists and yes there is the large is

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240
both lists and yes there is the large is
 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.209
both lists and yes there is the large is
one of those that we can find seven

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219
one of those that we can find seven
 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:39.340
one of those that we can find seven

hundred and thirty nine thousand three
 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.530
hundred and thirty nine thousand three
hundred and ninety-seven so that is left

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540
hundred and ninety-seven so that is left
 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.020
hundred and ninety-seven so that is left
on capable and it's right from

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030
on capable and it's right from
 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.690
on capable and it's right from
catapulted on both the lists although we

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700
catapulted on both the lists although we
 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.030
catapulted on both the lists although we
are don't think we can truncate

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040
are don't think we can truncate
 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.080
are don't think we can truncate
simultaneously because we're not going

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090
simultaneously because we're not going
 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.610
simultaneously because we're not going
to get prime numbers if we do that

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620
to get prime numbers if we do that
 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.020
to get prime numbers if we do that
what's the longest you can do

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030
what's the longest you can do
 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.040
what's the longest you can do

well I is an interesting question

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810
well I is an interesting question
 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.380
well I is an interesting question
because what about if we can remove the

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390
because what about if we can remove the
 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.920
because what about if we can remove the
digits in any order we want four hundred

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930
digits in any order we want four hundred
 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.740
digits in any order we want four hundred
and fifteen thousand six hundred and

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750
and fifteen thousand six hundred and
 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.340
and fifteen thousand six hundred and
seventy three and I'm gonna delete not

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.350
seventy three and I'm gonna delete not
 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.960
seventy three and I'm gonna delete not
just from the ends I'm going to delete

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970
just from the ends I'm going to delete
 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.070
just from the ends I'm going to delete
the one yeah it's gone so I've got this

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080
the one yeah it's gone so I've got this
 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.230
the one yeah it's gone so I've got this
number now forty five thousand six

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240
number now forty five thousand six
 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.700
number now forty five thousand six
hundred and seventy three and that's a

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710
hundred and seventy three and that's a
 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.110
hundred and seventy three and that's a
prime number now I'm going to delete

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120
prime number now I'm going to delete
 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.790
prime number now I'm going to delete
another digit I will delete the three

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800
another digit I will delete the three
 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.790
another digit I will delete the three
for this one so now I've got four

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800
for this one so now I've got four
 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.980
for this one so now I've got four
thousand five hundred and sixty-seven

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990
thousand five hundred and sixty-seven
 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.400
thousand five hundred and sixty-seven
now if I've got that I'm gonna delete

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.410
now if I've got that I'm gonna delete
 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.640
now if I've got that I'm gonna delete
the five in this case to get four

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:33.650
the five in this case to get four
 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.380
the five in this case to get four
hundred and sixty seven which is a prime

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:35.390
hundred and sixty seven which is a prime
 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.290
hundred and sixty seven which is a prime
and now I'll delete the four so to make

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300
and now I'll delete the four so to make
 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.750
and now I'll delete the four so to make
67 which is a prime and now thing I'll

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:40.760
67 which is a prime and now thing I'll
 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.030
67 which is a prime and now thing I'll
delete the six to get a seventh okay I

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.040
delete the six to get a seventh okay I
 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.030
delete the six to get a seventh okay I
create this chain of primes but I'm

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.040
create this chain of primes but I'm
 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.590

want so those are called deletable

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:49.430
want so those are called deletable

primes and it is thought that there are

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720
primes and it is thought that there are
 

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.920
primes and it is thought that there are
infinitely many of those but that is

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:56.930
infinitely many of those but that is
 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.540

delete will still leave you with a prime

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:09.830
delete will still leave you with a prime
 

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.320
