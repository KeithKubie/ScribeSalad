How does an Etch a Sketch Work?

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.540
An Etch a Sketch is a remarkably simple device.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.930
The primary components are just a small sheet
of glass; a stylus controlled by two knobs;

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.900
very fine aluminum powder; and tiny plastic
beads.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.439
The tiny beads are mixed in with the powder
to make sure the powder will continue to flow

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.329
evenly and not get clumped together, as well
as aid in the re-coating process when you

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.760
shake the Etch a Sketch.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.190
Each knob is connected to either a horizontal
or a vertical rail, which in turn is connected

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.820
to a pulley system.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.940
This is all connected to the stylus via a
very stiff wire.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.710
Among other things, aluminum powder has an
interesting property in that it sticks to

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.370
quite a lot of things, including glass, via
an electrostatic charge.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.100
So by turning an Etch a Sketch upside down
and shaking, you effectively coat the glass

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.930
with a thin layer of aluminum powder, which
then adheres to the glass fairly well.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.050
The stylus then simply scrapes off the aluminum
powder from the glass wherever it’s touching.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.580
The lines this creates are black simply because
there is no light inside the Etch a Sketch

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:24.480
except what comes through 
the lines you’ve created.
