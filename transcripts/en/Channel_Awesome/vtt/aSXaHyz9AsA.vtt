00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.300
So there's two movies everybody was warning me about when I was beginning doing these direct-to-dvd sequels.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.480
One was the third Beauty and the Beast and you can rightfully see why

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.000
And the second was Kronk's New Groove.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.880
This is one of the Disney sequels everybody points to when they wanna say how bad they can get.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.360
And...yeah. It's not good.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.660
It's just a bunch of unfunny stories with unfunny jokes.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.000
I guess it's a little difficult to be offended when it's obviously not trying that hard.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.740
I mean don't get me wrong, there's obviously money thrown into the animation and it...moves a lot.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.780
But the slapstick is pretty dull, the jokes all fall flat,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.700
and I just felt like I watched a whole bunch of nothing.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.260
The film centers around the henchman Kronk, played by Patrick Warburton.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.280
He's nervous because his disapproving father is coming in to visit and and thus we go into three different stories about

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.220
what were they again? The evil villain wants him back as a henchman,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.360
a romance that blooms with a counselor,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.160
and him trying to convince his father that he has everything he's been looking for.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.280
All of them are pretty forgettable.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.660
I guess on the one hand, I can see why people would be so upset because a lot of people REALLY like the first movie.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.580
I just kind of thought it was okay.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.140
But to its credit it had A LOT more laughs than this movie does.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.620
In fact, half the movie is just trying to cash in on those laughs again.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.740
Remember the devil and angel in the first one?

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.500
They do that like twenty times in this!

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.540
Hell, even the little kids get an angel and devil.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.500
And half the jokes don't make any sense!

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.060
The devil makes fun of the angel because he wears a dress.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.400
They all wear dresses! It's the time period!

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.460
Some of these jokes have great build up but then no payoff.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:53.100
When Kronk is about to be reunited with the villain, there's ALL these jokes about "beware the cat" "the cat's gonna get you" and all these other feline jokes.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.660
Obviously they're building up that the villain is still gonna be a cat.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.340
Which is a funny idea, this little cat bossing him around and trying to do all these evil things. That's funny!

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.380
But no, all she has is a tail!

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.600
How is that humorous? That's not fun!

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.520
How much funnier would it be if this whole story happened while she was a cat?

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.400
A teeny, tiny cat, that'd be a lot more humorous!

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.160
On top of that, there's a lot of great talent that they got for this movie.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.980
Patrick Warburton, Eartha Kitt, Tracy Ullman, John Mahoney, John Goodman

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.060
These are all funny voices that belong to funny actors, yet none of them are allowed to be funny.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.620
They just kind of show up, say the lines, and say them well, they're just not funny lines to say.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.660
There's even a totally pointless cameo from David Spade as the emperor. He literally just comes in to say he's in the movie.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.520
Nothing else. And he'll come in, say a few lines, and then just disappear.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.980
Hell! The way I'm describing that sounds funnier than how they actually do it!

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.840
It's just kind of confusing and awkwardly done.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.840
The slapstick is also kind of boring.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.960
They just kind of bounce around, and move in exaggerated ways but,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.600
it doesn't feel like there's any focus or control. There's just big movements going on because that's what kids like to watch, right? Right?

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.840
So okay, obviously this is not a good movie. Is it god-awful?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.160
Ummmm... I don't know. I guess it kind of depends.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.680
Maybe because I've seen so many BAD comedies that REALLY hurt after a joke is told, I don't see this one AS offensive.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.000
It's kind of like a joke you see on Family Guy or an Adam Sandler movie where when it's told and it's bad, it's REEEALY bad.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.100
Like, you're put in a BAD mood?

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.080
Here to its credit, the movie seems so determined to get itself over with as quickly as possible that the joke just kind of fly by.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.620
They never linger, there's no awkward pauses, it's just kind of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.000
joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, and then the movie's done.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.900
It clearly doesn't have that much to say or what it does have to say it doesn't try that hard at.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.720
So for me, it's just one of those movies that goes in one ear and out the other.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.160
Ya I wish it could've been better because the villains I thought were the best part of the first movie.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.860
But for what it is, it's just

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.660
Bad.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.100
Not the worst. Not insulting. Just bad.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.600
If you have little kids that want to see some cartoons bouncing, I guess it's fine.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.740
But if you're a fan of The Emperor's New Groove, or even not a fan,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.640
Ehhh, I recommend just watching a funny Looney Tunes.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.160
Dance away from this as fast as you can.
