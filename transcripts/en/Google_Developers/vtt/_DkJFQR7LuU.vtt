TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.640
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.970
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.760
Android KTX is a set
of extensions designed

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.630
to make writing Kotlin code
for Android more concise,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.400
idiomatic, and pleasant.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400
It provides an API layer on
top of both Android framework

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.640
and support library, and the
preview is now available.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.190
Head on over to the post,
linked in the description

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.870
below, for a video, code, and
a link to the GitHub repo.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.200
The new server timing
API in Chrome 65 Beta

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.960
allows web servers to pass
performance timing information

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.610
via HTTP headers to browsers.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.770
This new API provides you with
a more complete performance

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.930
picture that includes
the speed of both

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.450
the client and the server.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.140
Other features in this release
are listed on the post.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.010
Beginning in July 2018, with
the release of Chrome 68,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
Chrome will mark all
HTTP sites as not secure.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
HTTPS is easier and
cheaper than ever before,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.270
and it unlocks both
performance improvements

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.740
and powerful new features that
are too sensitive for HTTP.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.720
Head on over to the
post for a set-up guide

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.650
that will help you get started.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.510
Cloud TPUs are now available in
beta on Google Cloud Platform

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.660
to help machine learning
experts train and run their ML

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.060
models more quickly.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.140
TPU stands for Tensor
Processing Unit,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.710
and each Cloud TPU board
contains four custom chips

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.320
that Google has designed
in-house, specifically

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.790
for machine learning.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.920
You'll need to request
quota to get started.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
More details and the sign-up
form are on the post.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.070
GPUs in Kubernetes
Engine are now

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.010
in beta and ready to be
used widely, from the latest

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.020
Kubernetes Engine release.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.720
Using GPUs in Kubernetes
Engine can turbocharge

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.480
compute-intensive applications
like machine learning, image

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.990
processing, and
financial modeling.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.910
Universal App
Campaigns make it easy

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.130
for you to reach users and grow
your app business at scale,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.490
and we recently launched a
new interactive education

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.080
program for them.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.970
For more details and
a link to the course,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.910

I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.340
Thanks for watching another
episode of The Developer Show.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.810
To catch some of our
prior week's episodes,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.880
they're right over here.
