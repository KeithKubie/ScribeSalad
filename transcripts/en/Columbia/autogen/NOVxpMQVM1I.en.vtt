because Albania is not a place to go but
 

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.240
because Albania is not a place to go but
it's a place to always go back so once

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:14.250
it's a place to always go back so once
 

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.100

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400
is how to make them come first time and
 

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.180
