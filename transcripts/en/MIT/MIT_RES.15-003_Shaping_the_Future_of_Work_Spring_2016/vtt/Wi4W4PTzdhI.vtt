00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.350
Welcome to the
launch of our course

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.210
on shaping the future of work.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.400
Together, over the
next seven weeks,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.830
we'll explore how to expand
the number of good jobs,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.130
career opportunities,
and workplaces

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.490
that help us all realize our
dreams, our aspirations we

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.410
have for work.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.490
For our family lives
and for building

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.230
sustainable successful
enterprises,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.300
and for our societies.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.380
But before we talk
about that, let's talk

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.500
about some of the
difficulties we've

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.670
experienced in the
last week or so.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.270
I want to begin with the
statement of solidarity

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.830
for our colleagues in
Europe and in Asia,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.860
in light of the terrible
tragedies that have occurred

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.150
in Brussels and in Pakistan.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.700
Today, we are all
sharing our concern

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420
that there have been
over the past 18

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.060
months, 75 bombings
in over 20 countries,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.330
killing over 1,300 people.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.370
We think about the grief and the
pain that so many nationalities

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.060
and religions and people
of different cultures

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.870
all over the world
have been experiencing.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.370
And we are with them together.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.780
My fellow of course team
members here at MIT and I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.060
feel profoundly sad at
yet, more acts of violence.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.550
We condemn them.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.890
We are committed to addressing
the causes of violence

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.470
in our societies and
in our workplaces,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.670
and to doing everything
we can to help

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.710
resolve these differences before
they devolve into terrorism.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.010
Above all, this course
rests on the principle

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.010
of respect for diversity in
our world, in our work places.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.480
We had planned to
show a bit later

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.080
in the course, a 20 minute
video interview with Mary Rowe,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.770
one of the world's leaders
in managing diversity

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.250
and workplace conflicts.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460
Mary outlines the
ways that we can

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.780
address these
tensions and the anger

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.130
that they show in our society,
and that sometimes do spill

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.200
over to our places of work.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.130
But given the events
in Europe and Asia

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.970
and other parts of
the world, we'll

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.199
post that interview this
week so we can start

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.160
discussing these issues now.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.800
So we invite you to
watch Mary's interview

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.500
and use it in the
discussion forum

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.150
to comment on how issues
of diversity, inclusion,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.040
and the management
of inequities can

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.800
be addressed in your workplace
and in your job experiences.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.660
We can design a
better future as we

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.310
help each other shape this
aspect of our workplaces

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.250
in a positive way.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.700
I invite you also to
get started by sampling

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.660
the rich array of other videos
that we have posted this week.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.300
We have welcoming comments from
national and internationally

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.420
renowned leaders from
all over the world.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.870
The US secretary of
labor, Tom Perez,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.190
the director general of
the International Labor

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.920
Organization, Guy Ryder.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.630
The secretary treasurer
of America's largest union

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.530
federation, Liz Schuler.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.510
And our course team's human
resource management expert,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.440
Lee Dyer.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.680
We include this
diversity of voices

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.960
to show how all of
these communities

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.840
need to work together to
shape the future of work

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.760
for you and for all the parties
that have a stake in it.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.150
And don't miss our three
minute animated video

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.190
summarizing 3,000 years
of the history of work.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.940
I think you'll enjoy it.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.850
Then we move on to other
videos and readings

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.740
that discuss the challenges
and exciting opportunities,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.410
innovations occurring
in our workplaces today.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.680
These set the stage for a much
more in-depth conversation

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.310
about these issues
in the weeks ahead.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.290
We also note in your
discussion forum

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.880
that you already
started, that some of you

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.780
are concerned about
how the issues of jobs

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.720
and the future of work
are being discussed

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.160
in the presidential campaign
in the United States.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.430
Some of you have lamented
that yes, they talk about jobs

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.780
but don't have a vision
for the future of work.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.640
Well, maybe it's our
job to bring our voices

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.350
into these conversations as
we will try to do, and really

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.480
lay out a vision for
what work could be,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.460
what the real needs
of workers are,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.240
what the real needs of
businesses are today.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.519
So maybe we can add our
voices to this discussion.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.829
So welcome, join us.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.960
Look forward to having
you engage with us

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.950
and helping to see if we can use
our collective efforts to shape

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.250
the future of work.
