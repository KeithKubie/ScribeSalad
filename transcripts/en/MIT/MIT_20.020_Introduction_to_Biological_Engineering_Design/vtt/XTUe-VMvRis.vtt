00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:08.796
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Hi Dude!

00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:09.596
What are you up to?

00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:11.626
&gt;&gt; Dude: I'm picking a promoter
to use to in Buddy.

00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:14.856
I need a promoter that is always
on that will make Buddy be red.

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:17.456
&gt;&gt; Izzy: So why are you poking
at the computer screen?

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:19.056
&gt;&gt; Dude: Well how else do I pick one?

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:22.576
I don't know which one to use so I
figured I'd leave it to chance to decide.

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:27.216
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Well why don't you use some of the
promoter characterization data available

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:30.046
on the Registry of Standard
Biological Parts to decide?

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:31.716
&gt;&gt; Dude: What is promoter measurement data?

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:32.586
&gt;&gt; Sally: Hi Dude.

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:36.956
Hi Izzy. Sounds like you two are
having an interesting conversation.

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:37.146
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Yeah.

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:41.436
I was just about to tell Dude how
to use promoter measurement data

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:43.316
to pick the right promoter for Buddy.

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:47.226
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well before you get into those
details it might be worth chatting a bit

00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:48.686
about measurement in general.

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:51.736
Why synthetic biologists measure part function?

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:55.536
What measurements they make and how
they do the measurements before getting

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:57.316
into the details of the data itself?

00:00:57.786 --> 00:00:58.566
&gt;&gt; Izzy: That's true!

00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:00.206
&gt;&gt; Sally: Why don't we take a walk?

00:01:00.446 --> 00:01:02.016
Get some fresh air while we talk.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.426
Measurement is a key aspect
of science and engineering.

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:08.356
It lets you quantify the
function of a part or component

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:10.886
and compare its function to that of others.

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:14.795
Unfortunately in synthetic
biology, we're still figuring

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.836
out what are the most useful measurements
to make for genetic parts and devices.

00:01:18.836 --> 00:01:19.726
&gt;&gt; Dude: What do you mean?

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.686
Why don't we just measure
everything for every part?

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:27.646
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well that can pretty quickly lead both
to a lot of wasted time in making measurements

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:30.326
that don't matter as well as an
overwhelming amount of information.

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:35.976
Ideally, we'd like to be able to only measure
those characteristics of a part that you need

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:39.946
to know in order to decide whether the
part will work in your system of interest.

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:42.676
&gt;&gt; Izzy: For example, when I
bought a computer recently,

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:47.056
I cared about how big the hard drive
was and how much memory it had,

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:50.466
because those were two performance
metrics that I could use to figure

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:53.196
out whether the computer would
be sufficient for my needs.

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:55.586
&gt;&gt; Dude: Well in the case of
Buddy, I just need to know

00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:57.556
which promoter to use that will make him red.

00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.086
&gt;&gt; Izzy: But how red do you want Buddy to be?

00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:02.746
Should Buddy be pink, red, or dark red?

00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:05.666
To make decisions like that, you
might need to know a bit more

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:07.576
about how strong the promoter is.

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:08.856
&gt;&gt; Sally: Exactly.

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:13.716
Another measurement you might care about is
how long the part works before it breaks.

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:17.756
Genetic parts can "break"
as Buddy grows and divides.

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:23.116
For example, mutations or deletions can
happen that interfere with part function.

00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:27.996
So depending on how long you expect Buddy
to stick around, you might choose promoters

00:02:27.996 --> 00:02:29.926
that are more or less genetically stable.

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:30.946
&gt;&gt; Dude: Whoa!

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:34.666
I had no idea that measuring part
function could be so complicated!

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:39.356
Well I think I am going to find myself
a strong promoter from the registry.

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:43.376
I've decided that I want
Buddy to be very dark red!

00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:44.376
&gt;&gt; Sally &amp; Izzy: Have fun!

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.326
&gt;&gt; Sally &amp; Izzy: Jinx!
