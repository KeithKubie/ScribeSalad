00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.290
Now that you've learned the difference between objective and subjective

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.510
measures, let's see if you can identify some examples. Participants reported

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.740
how often they watched television per week. Researchers measured the number of

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.910
hours children watched television per week. College students reported the

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.050
number of hours they studied per week. Researchers measured the heart rate of

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.280
students watching a horror movie. Researches measured the number of pounds

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.479
students lost after running three times a week for one month. For each of the

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:32.780
examples given, check whether you think it is an objective measure or a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.610
subjective measure.
