CHRIS BROADFOOT: All right.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.840
Santa.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.000
Santa.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.650
Santa.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.890
ANKUR KOTWAL: Ho.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.260
Ho.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.630
Ho.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.130
Ho.

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:12.470
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Hi, my
name is Chris Broadfoot.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.430
I work on the Google Maps
Developer Relations team

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.190
based in Sydney.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.367
And in my 20% time, I
was a technical lead

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:19.962
for Santa Tracker.

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:21.420
ANKUR KOTWAL: Hi,
I'm Ankur Kotwal.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.340
And I'm on the Android
Developer Relations team.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.200
In my 20% time last year, I
did Santa Tracker as well.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.290
I was a mobile technical lead.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.000
So thank you for
joining us today.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.649
We have what will be
hopefully a fun talk for you.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.440
We're going to give
you an overview of what

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.460
Santa Tracker is as a project.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.670
Then we're going to talk
about how we built it.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.850
And then we'll talk about
some interesting technical

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.270
considerations that we
found along the way.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.650
But really, the
key take away here

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.570
is that Santa Tracker was built
on Google's Developer platform

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.280
using technology that you
can use today and build

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.300
similar solutions yourself.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.580
So let's go back to
the very beginning.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.550
In 2004, 10 years
ago, Google acquired

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.290
a small company called
Keyhole who had a product also

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.660
called Keyhole.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.860
Keyhole actually
became Google Earth.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.330
But in 2004, one
of the engineers

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.770
on the product, Brian, decided
to put up a route of Santa

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.130
traveling the world.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.940
He did this as just a small
little project on the side.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.080
And he published it
on the Keyhole BBS.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.440
He had the back end
running on a single server

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.160
and thought a few people from
this BBS may download it.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.290
He actually had 25,000
unique visitors that night.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.430
And we were just blown away.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.890
It was great.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.710
And we've continued that Google
Santa Tracker tradition now

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.830
for 10 years.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.105
So let's see what it
looked like in 2013.

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:57.087
Click.

00:01:57.087 --> 00:01:59.470
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.340
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So we
built a brand new village

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.450
with the countdown.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.930
We had some great
animated videos.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.180
We had games,
interactive HTML5 games.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.990
And of course, you can track
Santa across Google Maps.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.430
ANKUR KOTWAL: We also
had an Android app

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.060
where you could follow Santa.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.676
And we integrated
with Chromecast

00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:21.300
so you could see him
on the big screen.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.150
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So we provided
interesting statistics.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.560
You can track center
across Google Earth

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.925
and across the whole web
using a Chrome extension.

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:42.550
So we had great HTML5 games
that worked well in mobile.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.700
And we sprinkled Santa
across all Google products,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.655
so Google Maps, on Google
Maps on desktop as well.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.104
ANKUR KOTWAL: That was
Santa Tracker 2013.

00:02:56.104 --> 00:02:57.770
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So
I'd like to give you

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.350
a little bit of an overview
just on the website.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.800
We rebuilt this the
ground up to showcase

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.530
the best of Google's
Developer platform.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.980
So as you can see,
there's village

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.240
has a countdown where you
can see the time Santa's

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.840
going to take off
and these houses that

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.890
unlock throughout the
month of December,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.690
kind of like an advent calendar.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.870
So we have these scenes,
just CSS animations, games,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.960
and Easter eggs.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.970
So when you click the
balloon, it just takes off.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.265
It's got some audio
effects as well.

00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:33.800
This is one of my
favorite games.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.350
It's a physics game
called Gumball.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.280
And you just rotate
the field of play.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.390
And you drop these
balls into the hopper.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.319
ANKUR KOTWAL: We were able to
bring this to Android as well.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.360
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, so
the one was really fun.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.850
And I think this was our
top used game, actually.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.880
So we had this menu that
demonstrated the advent

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.330
calendar.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.746
And these things
actually unlocked

00:03:54.746 --> 00:03:57.050
throughout the
month of December.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.750
So you can see the
great CSS animations.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.900
We really pushed the
limits of the web.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.840
So we even created
a WebGL HTML5 game.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.760
This is based on Instrument's
Chrome Experiment.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.280
And Santa dives into
your favorite city.

00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:19.320
There's these really
silly audio effects

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.570
that are kind of charming.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.850
And he just dives through the
candy canes onto a Google map.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.220
So yeah, everything's WebGL.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.770
All of the clouds are WebGL.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.860
And the Google Map
underneath is transformed

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.680
using CSS transformations.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.260
It's really cool.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.619
So we also sprinkled Santa
throughout Google products.

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:40.410
This is what it looked
like on Google Maps.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.480
It just prompted people
to go into the website.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.360
And the street view Pegman
donned a Santa hat as well.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.550
So we introduced him into
our mobile applications

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.120
as well, just a card on
our maps application.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.310
And you could actually track
him in the Google Earth

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.230
application using a KML tool.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.730
ANKUR KOTWAL: So Santa
Tracker actually covers

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.460
a lot of Google technology.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.520
As I said, it's built on the
Google Developer platform.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.940
And it's a great way for
us in developer relations

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.640
to prove our technology
as well, because it

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.120
has a seamless
experience from mobile

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.680
to web and through the back end.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.402
And so we'd like to show
you what that is right now.

00:05:21.402 --> 00:05:23.110
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Right,
so as Ankur said,

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.160
anyone can build this.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.000
We're using our
developer platform.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.330
So we had too main experiences.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.230
We had the web application and
the Android native application.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.760
Both of them made heavy
use of Google Maps API, one

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.670
of my favorite APIs,
and were both powered

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.570
by a Go runtime App
Engine application, which

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.920
we called the Santa Tracker API.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.454
Now this is just
our internal API.

00:05:51.454 --> 00:05:54.120
But if you do want to build your
own Santa Tracker and use this,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.940
please do get in touch with me.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.840
We'd would love to have everyone
tracking Santa using this.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.110
So it's provided two main
pieces of functionality,

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.272
synchronizing time, so
if people's computers

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:07.980
didn't have the right
time, then everyone

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.465
would be tracking Santa at
the right time, and also

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:15.679
a feed of his previous
and next destinations.

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.345
So all of our clients
would periodically

00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:21.850
re-request this information so
that they get Santa's latest

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.350
location.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.240
So each destination also
provided a bunch of metadata,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.610
such as when Santa arrived
there, when he departed,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.981
the population, and the number
of presents he delivered up

00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:39.480
until that point, so not the
number of presents he delivered

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.510
at that stop, but all
the way up until then,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.490
a localized city and region
name, which we showed

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.580
in the tracker,
and the location.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.600
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yup.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.350
It worked.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.850
Yeah,

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.270
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
So this API let us

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.680
reach many, many people
around the world,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.980
providing internationalization
into 34 languages.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.130
You can see our
diverse audience here.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.990
So we had people from all
sorts of different locations

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.200
and languages.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.875
And you can see the US accounts
for about 32% of our audience.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.450
When reaching a wide audience,
it was also really important

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.110
that we support a
variety of screen sizes.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.650
So this is a mock that
we got from a designer,

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.580
showing how we'd get the
advent calendar to fit

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.280
to a small screen.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.630
You can see the--
well, actually,

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.400
first you can see the locking
as we go through the month.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.380
But you'll see some
of the UI elements

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.580
disappear as the
screen get smaller.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.930
The back button for
the Go To Village

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.380
collapses into separate row.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.650
And the icons go from four
by six to six by four.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.210
So I'm just going to show you
a couple videos showing you

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.910
how this works.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.090
So this is our village.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.560
There's a few break points.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.080
You can see the
countdown gets smaller.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.320
We hide a bit of
text just so that we

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.390
can show those graphics.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.030
Because we feel they're more
important than that little bit

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.210
of text.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.390
Some of the buttons
disappear and rearrange

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.050
to fit the smaller
screen as well.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.710
So on the advent calendar,
everything sort of

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.880
gets smaller.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.660
The icons have a few breakpoints
to get smaller as well.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.042
And you'll see the Go To
Village button collapse

00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:34.875
into a separate row.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.179
And of course the dashboard,
which is quite complex

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:44.350
and shows a whole bunch of
different statistics for Santa,

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.280
the text gets smaller as the
screen size gets smaller.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.830
And all of those statistics go
from three by two into a list.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.340
So when building the
site, performance

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.520
was really important.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.480
We wanted to make sure
people were engaged,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.760
that the site loads quickly,
the games are responsive.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.840
And the Chrome Developer Tools,
particularly the timeline view,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.670
is really important for that.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.340
When we added snow, we saw an
immediate drop in frame rate,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.397
probably for about 50 frames
per second down to 10 or 15.

00:09:21.397 --> 00:09:22.980
And we used the
Chrome Developer Tools

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.590
to figure exactly-- figure out
exactly what Chrome was doing.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.490
So it turned out
whenever a piece of snow

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.940
fell to the bottom
of the page, it

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.030
was triggering a whole
page re-layout, which

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.260
is quite expensive.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.880
And we had a lot of snow.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.470
So the Chrome Developer Tools
were really useful there.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.761
There were also really good for
testing your responsive layout,

00:09:42.761 --> 00:09:43.260
right.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.840
You can emulate mobile devices.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.010
And the Web Fundamentals website
is a really good resource

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:55.640
for both performance and
multi-device layouts.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.790
To keep the site responsive,
we used a module system.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.140
So each of those experiences we
crafted into a separate module

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.840
so that the site loaded really
quickly upon first load.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.980
When the user goes
into a game, they

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.920
load that module,
which preloads all

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.420
of its assets such
as images and audio

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.624
and shows a loading bar
like this to the user, just

00:10:19.624 --> 00:10:21.040
to keep them
informed and engaged.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.070
We made really heavy use of
Google Analytics as well,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.290
not just to figure out
where people were engaged

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.831
and where we could
make improvements,

00:10:32.831 --> 00:10:34.750
but also to track all
of the errors that

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.310
happened on the page.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.610
So by adding a global
error listener,

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.540
we were able to send those
errors over to Google Analytics

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.900
to figure out any problems that
we were having in production.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.620
We actually found a bug that
was only manifesting in IE 10

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.130
in Japanese, which
was really strange.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.700
It went straight to the top.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.920
And we were able to fix it.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.461
This is something
that we never would

00:10:57.461 --> 00:10:58.890
have found during
manual testing.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.100
ANKUR KOTWAL: So let's
talk about the Android app.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.600
So you'll see here, this is
what our village looked like.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.570
And just like the web, this
was a 12,000 pixel wide image

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.210
that we're rendering.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.320
In fact, it's not
a single image.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.420
There's multiple
layers of images here.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.110
We use a technique called
Parallax scrolling, where

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.340
the clouds are actually
scrolling at a slower

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.360
rate that the foreground,
than the village itself.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.560
And in order to accomplish
this sort of rich detail,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.810
we actually built
a set of-- a code

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.276
was written using the
Canvas API on Android.

00:11:38.276 --> 00:11:39.900
We found, though,
with the Android app,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.590
we didn't have an
advent calendar

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.380
event for every single day.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:49.680
So instead of having advent
items on the actual village

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.880
itself, we started using
these bigger marker pins.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.600
We actually prototyped using the
Navigation Drawer here as well.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.530
And we found that the
Navigation Drawer, which

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.310
is a fairly standard and
common patent on Android,

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:05.130
didn't really fit well with
the Santa Tracker experience.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.120
The Navigation Drawer is really
there for primary navigation.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.510
And you typically need more
items in that Navigation Drawer

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.590
in order to fill it up.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.950
Otherwise, it just looks empty.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.380
Also, because we were building
what looked like a fairly

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.650
custom experience,
almost like a game,

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.790
it made more sense to build a
very rich and visual navigation

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.110
menu, rather than
just using the Drawer.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.570
But really, the question that
we ask ourselves time and time

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.180
again is, why do we want
to build native app?

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.270
And it was really
down to performance.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.070
We wanted to build
this rich experience

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:45.860
and have it performed very
well for our mobile users.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.810
We also built these games that
you see on the left hand side.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.270
And so we were able to take
advantage of the accelerometer

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.130
on the tilt game, as well
as on the jet pack game.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.590
We had-- it's actually
kind of an action game

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.950
where the-- and we'll
see a video in a minute.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.330
But the elf flies
around the screen.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.860
And you have to
collect presents.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.690
So it was really important
that that game, and those sorts

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.640
of experiences, stay responsive.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.080
And we could only really get
that level of responsiveness

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.120
again through a native app.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.060
The other advantage
of being a native app

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.270
is that we implemented
notifications.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.810
In fact, just one notification,
and that notification

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:25.530
went off when Santa took
off on Christmas Eve.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.370
And it was really fun, because
suddenly we started to see all

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.250
of these people posting on
Google+ and Twitter that, hey,

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.550
my phone just told
me Santa's taken off.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.050
And they would tap
that notification

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.730
and jump straight into
that map experience.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.110
But one bit of feedback that
we had from our early testing

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.060
was, make that
notification silent.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.480
And make sure it doesn't
vibrate the phone or tablet.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.500
Because when Santa takes
off, around half the world

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.290
is asleep.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.519
So they didn't want to get
woken up at 3:00 AM just

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:56.185
because Santa's flying
around the world.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.320
One of my favorite
part of the app

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.070
was the ability to use the
Google Maps API for Android.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.190
And you know, that the best
thing for me for this API

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.840
is the use of the camera.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.440
And so it's not
just a 2D camera.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.070
It's actually a 3D camera.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.590
So you'll see as Santa
arrives here at Sydney,

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.180
the camera zooms in but
also tilts ever so slightly

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.410
to give a really good
sort of perspective.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.340
And as you zoomed in on various
cities around the world,

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.420
where we had support for it,
3D buildings show up as well.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.790
And they start
popping up on the map.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.300
It just gives a really
immersive experience.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.290
Another part of adding
immersiveness to our map

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.350
here was the way that we wanted
the camera to follow Santa.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.060
We really wanted it to feel
like there was someone holding

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.890
a camera from way up high,
kind of keeping track of Santa

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.110
as he traveled.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.190
And in order to do
so, we made sure

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.090
that Santa wasn't always at
the center of the screen.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.840
So you'll often
see that the camera

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.670
rotates and spins around.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.900
And sometimes it actually
gets ahead of Santa

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.240
and waits for Santa to catch up.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.710
And sometimes it falls behind.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.310
And then it catches up.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.190
So we were able to put
these sorts of effects

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.450
in to just make the experience
that much more immersive.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.550
We called this Santa Cam.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.090
Yes, I know-- very original.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.780
On Android, we wanted this app
to be available everywhere.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.830
So again, like a web experience
where we were typically

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.040
targeting Chrome,
Gingerbread devices

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.750
would have been excluded from
using Chrome for Android.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.420
We wanted to make
sure that this app was

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.320
available to all of those users.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.150
And we wanted to make sure it
was available across screen

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.590
sizes and form factors.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.790
So we built a responsive
layout on our apps as well.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.300
Now, if you look at the middle
screen shot and the screen shot

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.159
to the very right,
you'll see that we've

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:54.450
got a difference between
portrait layouts and landscape

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.560
layouts.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.720
We've vertically stuck
the portrait layout,

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.880
whereas on landscape we've got
the two views side by side.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.460
But we were also able to put
in this little summary mode

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.180
that you can see on the phone on
the left, where you can get rid

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.100
of the dashboard and
see more of the map

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.416
and see Santa travel
around the world,

00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:13.290
and just have a little
summary at the bottom.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.100
And that summary was like
a carousel, where we still

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.870
wanted to show those various
statistics from the dashboard,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.010
but we just swiped
them along one by one.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.420
Wed' show how many
presents were delivered,

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.860
or what his previous
destination was, or how long

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.045
he had been in flight.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.420
Games.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.060
This was really fun
building and testing.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.320
So this game you see
here is the jetpack game

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.920
written by an engineer
on our team, Bruno.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.170
And it was actually built
using a custom OpenGL

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.650
engine that he wrote in Java.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.410
And yeah, this one was one
that we certainly played a lot

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.791
when we were testing the game.

00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:54.794
For the other two games, if
you look at the tilt game

00:16:54.794 --> 00:16:56.460
at the bottom left,
and you can't really

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.820
see the tilting here, but
in order to control it,

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.820
it uses the
accelerometer, as well as

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.980
the memory match game
on the right hand side.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.930
They just use the standard
Android view hierarchy.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.640
Because we were able to,
again, build a very custom

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.300
look and feel and make
it feel like a true game

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.619
without having to go to
the extent of building up

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.680
a whole engine for it.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.200
Again building using
the right tools

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.280
for the job was-- for the type
of job you have, was paramount.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.400
We wanted the
jetpack race, again,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.350
to be faster in fluid
whilst being responsive.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.720
And in fact, when Bruno
tested it on the Nexus One,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.500
he got something like
45 frames per second,

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.280
with something like 25
presents on screen at a time.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.742
And so you can imagine
on a device that old

00:17:39.742 --> 00:17:41.950
when it performed that well,
from that point forward,

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:47.104
everything was just fast
and fluid from there.

00:17:47.104 --> 00:17:50.270
But playing games is great.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.400
But what I like to do is I
like to play games with others.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.920
And these games were
still single player games.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.750
So we started integrating
Play Game services

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.990
into Santa Tracker.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.010
What Play Game services allows
you to do is sign in with

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.810
your Google+ account and then
participate in the leader

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.410
boards and earn achievements.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.820
So from our point
of view, it was

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.650
a way of driving
engagement in the app.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.700
But it took off in a way that
we hadn't really anticipated.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.660
For starters, people that
used the Santa Tracker

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.280
app are much better
gamers than our team.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.900
In the first 15 minutes
or so of the app being

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:30.630
live, our scores had been,
best scores, had been eclipsed.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.520
The important thing about the
integration with the Play Game

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.970
services here was how we
suggested users sign in.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.587
So what you see
with a lot of games

00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:42.420
these days is that as
soon as you launch it,

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.150
it prompts you to say sign
in with your credentials.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.410
We didn't want to be
so aggressive about it.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.220
What we did instead is
that we waited for the user

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:50.940
to play the game.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.900
And then on the score,
on the high score

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.110
screen at the bottom,
you'll see we ask them,

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.560
would you like to sign
in to unlock achievements

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.080
and participate
in leader boards.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.610
And our sign in rate was
actually very, very high.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.970
People really loved
being a part of this.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:11.300
So in the months leading up
to Santa Tracker's launch,

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.820
Google announced a new
product, Chromecast.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.540
And immediately,
we were fans of it.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.560
We wanted to see Santa
on the big screen.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.310
So Google Santa Tracker was
actually one of the early apps

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.340
to integrate with Chromecast.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.800
integrating with Chromecast,
however brought new challenges.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.910
One, it was a big, huge screen.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.810
And it was meant to be
a lean back experience.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.620
So that meant we needed to
take all of the controls

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.100
away from the user.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.800
So you might be able to--
is you might have controls

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.720
on your website or on your phone
to zoom and move Santa around.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.190
But we wanted to take that away.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.310
Your phone or your tablet
effectively acts like a remote.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.680
So you would drive
it from the phone,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.620
but you wouldn't necessarily
have any interactive controls

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.590
on screen.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.960
Chromecast by the way, the
intention of Chromecast

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.100
is that you don't
mirror what you're

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.800
seeing on your phone or tablet.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.870
What you do is you launch
an experience on there

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.630
that's tailored for that screen.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.300
In fact, Chromecast, the
physical size of a Chromecast

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.260
is about the size of
a USB flash drive.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.140
It's actually a
low power device.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.280
But it runs the Chrome browser.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:28.682
So when you cast to the TV,
it actually ran the website.

00:20:28.682 --> 00:20:30.140
And some of those
performance tools

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.020
that Chris mentioned
earlier really

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.650
became important, because
it's a low powered device.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.620
So some of the differences
that you might have seen,

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.110
lower snow densities, or fewer
concurrent audio streams.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.194
So we definitely tailored
the experience for it.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.270
So on December 24th, Santa
takes off regardless of

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.690
whether we're ready.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.880
So it's a really interesting
engineering project.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.880
Because we can't slip up.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.890
So it's really
important to us that we

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.790
make sure we deliver a fantastic
experience on that day,

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.850
because there is no
way for us to really

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.600
revise it from
that point forward.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.820
So let me show you some of
the techniques that we use.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.010
This is what the desk of a
typical Android Google Santa

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.060
Tracker engineer looks like.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.920
Most of our colleagues
walk past our desk

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.780
and don't believe
that we're working.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:27.100
But this is the way we kind
of test Santa in flight.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.040
And you'll see here that
we don't have 3,000 Android

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.800
devices, because
it doesn't actually

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.520
require that many to test
this kind of experience.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.270
You have a mix of form factors.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:37.300
So we have some tablets.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.550
We have some phones.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.860
And we have a mix
of screen sizes.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.750
And within these
devices as well,

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.030
we have a mix of
operating system versions,

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.140
different versions of Android.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.910
And basically, we
were able to represent

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.830
the majority of
Android devices just

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.870
with a fairly small collection.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.840
Leading up to it,
however we also

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.780
need to do full simulations
of Santa in flight.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.402
We call those dry runs.

00:22:01.402 --> 00:22:03.110
And this is where the
whole Santa Tracker

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.580
team, regardless
of whether you're

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.163
working on the mobile
Apple, or you're

00:22:06.163 --> 00:22:09.070
working on the web or the
back end, we all get together

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.950
and we simulate Santa
journeying across the world.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.120
Now in that simulation,
we have to assume

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.630
where Santa's going to land.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.500
Because on the day, I mean we
find out just in time updates

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.100
from Santa in terms of
his position, right.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.280
So we make something
up for the simulation.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.390
And we go through the whole day.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.810
And all of us, we have phones,
and tablets, and laptops,

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.380
and desktops sort
of simulating Santa.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.870
We want to make sure
that if you turned it on

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.760
at the beginning of his
journey, 25 hours later

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.720
when he finishes, you're
able to run that through.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.860
And we don't run into
any performance problems

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.690
or stability problems.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.590
This photo here is actually of
the Google Sydney reception.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.750
One of our engineers, Jan-Felix,
got a little bit carried away

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.790
with the dry run
and took is Nexus 10

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.640
and hooked it up to our big
screen in the reception.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.690
And we basically took
it over for the day.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:01.200
So on that 15th of December when
we had visitors in that office,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.720
they were very
confused as to why

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.104
Santa was flying
across their screens.

00:23:06.104 --> 00:23:07.770
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah,
so as Ankur said,

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.811
we need to make sure that
all of the applications

00:23:09.811 --> 00:23:11.040
work functionally.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.220
We also need to make sure that
they can take all of the load.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.960
We see over 100,000 concurrent
users on the website

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.060
at some points in time.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.950
And at other points in
time, over 50% of those

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.160
were from mobile.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.750
This is what the traffic
shape looks like.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.920
When I first joined
the team, I was

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.230
told that we just get
a barrage of users.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.730
But that's actually
not quite true.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.230
It's, as you can see, it's
kind of a gradual growth

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.170
which plateaus.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.810
And then they all fall
off as Santa touches

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.560
down in the North Pole.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.300
So to make sure the back ends
work, all of our apps work,

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.290
we run load tests.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.850
You can see the App
Engine dashboard

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.050
while we're running
one of our load tests.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.390
So we actually took this one up
to 10,000 queries per second.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.900
And by taking it up that
far, we were pretty confident

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.320
that we were going to be able
to support the main event.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.120
You can see the average
of our instances

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.780
was to 250 queries for second.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:14.010
But we saw some of
them far up to 800 QPS,

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:14.950
which was very good.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.330
And I think this is
largely due to the Go

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.510
runtime on App Engine,
which is really, really high

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.342
performance.

00:24:22.342 --> 00:24:24.300
You can see the memory
consumption is quite low

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.860
as well, which is really good.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.910
This is what a graph from one of
Google's front end service-- oh

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.870
sorry, back end
service, looks like.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.920
So I think this is from our
Google Maps tile server.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.540
You can see on either
side of Christmas Day,

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.490
the traffic is
relatively smooth.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.100
But during Christmas Day
while Santa is running,

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.000
the traffic gets
really, really spiky.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.430
You'll also notice that
the volume of traffic

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.350
isn't that much higher either.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.360
This is because
the whole of Google

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.260
experiences a
little bit of a dip,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.380
so Santa Tracker kind of fills
that gap, which is really good.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.890
Just keeping our
back ends in shape.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.300
So the spiking
nature of the traffic

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.410
is primarily because
everyone is looking

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.940
at the exact same thing
at the exact same time.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.210
So everyone is hitting
the same kind of requests.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.800
And the largest
spikes I think are

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.050
because when Santa's
traveling quicker,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.720
say for example, over
the ocean, or just

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.200
quickly across a continent
or something like that,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.820
then people are requesting
many, many more tiles.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.315
So we try to smooth that spiky
traffic using a technique

00:25:30.315 --> 00:25:31.950
called jitter.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.460
So the top half of this slide
shows our internal flags,

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.820
which we can change
during the event.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:43.410
And that lets us
delay people randomly.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.780
And we start with two minutes.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.890
So we try to smooth people
out over a two minute period.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.770
So if you opened your phone
and your desktop machine,

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.110
you may not actually see Santa
in exactly the same position.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.660
But they'll be pretty close.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.430
We can also control how
often our clients re-request

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.260
these flags.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.610
And we jitter those
as well, of course,

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.060
just to make sure that the
traffic to our API server

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.440
is also quite smooth.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.620
So these flags are stored
in the App Engine data store

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.140
and are cached using
Memcache, and also

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.820
with the local instance cache.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.850
It doesn't really matter if
these flags are bit stale.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:26.200
So we can just cache
them in memory.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.820
And those flags come
down to the client

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.970
when they're re-requesting these
flags periodically as well.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.970
So you'll see the time
offset field there.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.290
And that should
be the same value

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.600
throughout that
user's experience.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.910
So once you're delayed,
you're delayed that amount.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:49.060
We also use this
endpoint to safeguard

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.760
against unexpected events.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.320
We haven't actually
had to use these flags.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.770
But we're able to turn
off entire experiences.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.780
For example, we could shut down
the tracker map on the Android

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.990
application, or switch
off the entire website

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.220
using these flags.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.690
We can also disable
particular features,

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.210
like the tracker
or Google Earth.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.959
Or there was some
problem with our photos,

00:27:08.959 --> 00:27:11.074
we could just turn off
the photos as well.

00:27:11.074 --> 00:27:12.240
We just kind of added these.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.050
It was really lightweight to
add these in our code base.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.250
So we just had a whole bunch.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.870
We can also make Santa
fly higher or lower

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.050
using Google Earth.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.270
And that directly
affects the number

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.210
of requests that are being sent
to our Google Earth back ends.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.840
ANKUR KOTWAL: So we use these
flags even in the mobile apps.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.290
So for those of you that tried
to unlock the games early,

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.200
this is why you
couldn't get through.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.460
But with that, we just want to
first thank our Santa Tracker

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.256
team.

00:27:42.256 --> 00:27:44.130
But we also want to
thank you for joining us.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.700
We have collected a whole
bunch of references.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.680
You would have seen
reference documents

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.120
throughout the presentation,
things like web fundamentals

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.990
or the Android
design guidelines.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.970
We've collected them on one
page for you at this short URL.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.930
And from there, you can
also provide feedback

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.410
for this session.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.840
So thank you for joining us.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.580
And we have time for questions.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.320
So if you would like to come
up to the mics and ask any,

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.680
here's your opportunity.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.992
Thank you.

00:28:10.992 --> 00:28:12.480
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Thanks.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:18.432
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:23.392 --> 00:28:24.849
ANKUR KOTWAL: There we go.

00:28:24.849 --> 00:28:25.390
That's right.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:25.820
Don't be shy.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.320
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
I've got questions.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.260
ANKUR KOTWAL: Oh,
you've got questions?

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.760
AUDIENCE: So do
you guys have kids?

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.190
And did they ask you
to ask Santa things

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.959
because they know
that you work on this?

00:28:35.959 --> 00:28:37.500
ANKUR KOTWAL: So a
two part question.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.270
So I'll answer the first part.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:44.950
Yes, and my kid basically
throughout this project

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.200
found that he would
see more of Santa

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.270
as the project got
deeper and deeper.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.840
So he learned to recognize
all of our visual assets.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.360
But he actually learned to
recognize even the music.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.480
So even if I was a
testing like late

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.256
at night in a room on the
other end of the house,

00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:02.630
he would run around
going, Santa.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.790
I can hear Santa.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.870
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
It's quite traumatic.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.650
ANKUR KOTWAL: For me too.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.289
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.830
AUDIENCE: Ok.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.735
So this is a very
interesting project.

00:29:14.735 --> 00:29:18.160
I wonder how many engineers
are actually involved

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.515
and how much effort is spent.

00:29:20.515 --> 00:29:21.640
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It varies.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.270
Like we have-- so Ankur and
I and a couple others kind

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:25.920
of core team.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.060
We spend a lot of
time over December.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.304
We've got people that are
20%, sort of like 10%,

00:29:31.304 --> 00:29:32.970
especially those that
are integrating it

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.050
into the products they work on
every day, like Google Maps.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.280
So there's quite a
varied number of people.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.000
Yeah.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.010
It would be in the
tens, I would say.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.410
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.580
AUDIENCE: Around ten?

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.955
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
No, in the tens,

00:29:46.955 --> 00:29:49.877
but like 10 to tend
to like 30 or so.

00:29:49.877 --> 00:29:52.460
ANKUR KOTWAL: So I mean, so if
you saw one of the screen shots

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.410
that we had, we
had on Google Maps,

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.430
we had Pegman
having a Santa hat.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.210
Like that will be one
of the engineers that

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.040
works in that team.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.180
So it's not a lot of effort
for them to just change

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.690
Pegman for that
duration, which is

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.710
why Chris is like,
the effort varies.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.670
But the core Santa Tracker
team is about 10 plus people.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.276
But there's more people that
get involved on the periphery.

00:30:13.276 --> 00:30:14.100
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:14.600
Thank you.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.740
AUDIENCE: So I realize
Santa's on vacation right now.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.320
Is there any way to find
him, like get him back,

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.749
just to show my friends what
this whole thing looked like?

00:30:27.749 --> 00:30:29.540
ANKUR KOTWAL: You can
send them the YouTube

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.665
link for this presentation.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:33.960
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.793
CHRIS BROADFOOT: There
isn't, unfortunately.

00:30:35.793 --> 00:30:37.690
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah,
unfortunately not.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.190
But he'll be back
again in December,

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:40.315
if they can wait that long.

00:30:43.152 --> 00:30:44.650
All right.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.920
AUDIENCE: Did you guys have any
time to run usability testing?

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.260
Because this is like a secret--
it cannot be seen before

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.640
Christmas in a way.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.310
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, we don't.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.280
And that would be really good.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.267
Like once we started adding--
well, it would be nice to.

00:31:00.267 --> 00:31:02.600
Once we started adding a lot
more things to the village,

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.730
it got quite difficult to
let people navigate around.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:09.649
Which is why we added
that six by four menu.

00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:11.440
Because the village is
really, really long.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.092
You've got to scroll around.

00:31:13.092 --> 00:31:14.800
And that's kind of
the fun of it as well.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.949
You kind of explore the village
as well and enter experiences.

00:31:18.949 --> 00:31:20.740
ANKUR KOTWAL: I might
just clarify on that.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:26.710
We for things like Android
and Google Cast or Chromecast,

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:29.610
we certainly have design
guidelines and UX guidelines.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:33.320
So we have to definitely
be compliant with those.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.880
And we have a team internally
that also reviews our own apps

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.000
and makes sure that
they meet that criteria.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.210
So we do rely on the
same documentation that's

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.010
available to developers
everywhere to make sure

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.827
that we're doing the
right thing as well.

00:31:48.827 --> 00:31:49.910
AUDIENCE: Thanks for that.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.360
It's a really
interesting project.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.100
I was just wondering
whether there

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.770
was any stats available on how
long it took Santa to deliver

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:01.770
each present, or to go
between different locations.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:02.616
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Oh.

00:32:02.616 --> 00:32:05.040
ANKUR KOTWAL: His whole
journey's like 25 hours.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.540
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
He flies at-- well,

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.430
we don't really know
how he flies as well.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:12.239
I think it's beyond the
speed of light, I think.

00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:12.780
I don't know.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.626
We calculated.

00:32:13.626 --> 00:32:14.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I guess.

00:32:14.876 --> 00:32:16.360
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah,
there's some strange physics

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.230
going on there.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.546
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah, those
reindeers are pretty quick.

00:32:19.546 --> 00:32:20.254
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:32:23.892 --> 00:32:24.600
ANKUR KOTWAL: OK.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.516
Well, we'll be around.

00:32:25.516 --> 00:32:27.960
So thank you very
much for your time.
