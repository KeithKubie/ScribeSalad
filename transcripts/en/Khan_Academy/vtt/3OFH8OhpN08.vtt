00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
 

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.840
Let's say that this circle right
over here represents one whole.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.140
And we've divided this circle
into one, two, three, four,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.220
five equal sections.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:20.784
So each of these sections
represents 1/5 of the circle.

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:21.950
And we've seen this already.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.680
1/5, 1/5, 1/5, and 1/5.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.161
And if we were to then
color in some of this-- So,

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.410
let's say we were to color
in three of these sections.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.620
So, that's one of the
sections right over there,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.480
another one right over here.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.270
So, we've colored
in two of the fifths

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.520
and then three of the fifths.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.800
Notice, you put those
three 1/5's together,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.450
how much have we now shaded in?

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.440
We've shaded in
3/5 of the whole.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.200
So the fraction that's
actually shaded in now is 3/5.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.960
3/5 is what's shaded in.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.960
Now let's do something
in some ways a little bit

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.040
simpler but also in some
ways kind of interesting.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.620
Let's start with
the whole again.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.400
So, once again,
this is one whole.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.110
Let me label it.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.825
One whole.

00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:13.950
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.170
And instead of dividing it
into five equal sections,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.250
I'm just going to divide
it into one equal section.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.810
So, if I were to shade
this in just like

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.360
that-- so I'm shading in my one
whole, my one equal section,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.020
how many of the equal
sections are now shaded in?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.080
Well, just to remind ourselves,
there is one equal section,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.870
and I have shaded in exactly
one of those one equal section.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.640
I've shaded in the whole thing.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.310
Or I could say that 1/1--
which you'll never hear someone

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.970
actually say-- is
shaded in, or I

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.950
could say that the whole
thing is shaded in.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.970
So this is equal to one whole.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.750
So that's a whole.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.700
That's interesting.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.820
And I want you to keep
in mind, remember, look.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.740
We literally have one,
two, three fifths,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.480
and we literally call that 3/5.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.830
Now, this is one whole.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.350
Now, what happens if we were
to do this multiple times?

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.780
Let me copy and paste that.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.590
So now I have another
one whole and then

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.240
another one whole
right over here.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.490
So now, in total, how
many wholes do I have?

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.650
Well, I have three.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.800
One, two, three wholes.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.540
And I've actually
shaded in three wholes.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.872
So this one right over
here is equal to-- Let

00:02:30.872 --> 00:02:33.390
me make sure I label it right.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.400
This right over
here is equal to,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.590
if I were to take
the combination,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.890
this is equal to 3.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.997
3 wholes.

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.580
Or if I were to think of it in
terms of numbers, just a number

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.880
line, literally, this would
represent the number 3.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.740
But what's another way
I could represent it?

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.610
Notice when I took a 1/5,
another 1/5, and another 1/5,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.660
I could call that 3/5.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.260
So now if I take one 1/1,
another 1/1, and another 1/1,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.260
well, I should be able to
call this 3/1, or 3 firsts,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.920
or however you want to call it.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.020
So I could call this 3 firsts.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.200
So this is interesting.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.730
Now we're seeing where the
top number on a fraction

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.540
is larger than the bottom one.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.910
But another way of thinking
about this fraction symbol

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.260
is that it's division.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.160
So you could view this as 3
divided by 1 is equal to 3.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.050
Or you could say, well,
look, 1 over 1 is a whole,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.800
and I now have three of them,
so this is equal to 3 wholes.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.147
So 3/1 is the same
thing as the number 3.

00:03:36.147 --> 00:03:37.980
And let me make sure,
let me emphasize that.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.050
Let me draw this
on a number line.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.120
So once again, let me
go all the way to 3.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.150
So 0, 1, 2, and 3.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.150
So one whole gets us exactly
one jump on the number line.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.630
So this right over here,
that gets us to 1/1.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.340
We do another jump, now
we've gotten 2 firsts,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.289
I guess you could say.

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:07.080
We've essentially taken
two of these jumps.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.450
Each jump is 1/1.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.990
Now we are at 2/1, which
is the same thing as 2.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.300
You take another jump,
and we essentially get to,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.861
or we do get to 3/1, which
is the exact same thing as 3.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:22.361
