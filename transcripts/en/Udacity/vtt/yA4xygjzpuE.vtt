00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.830
Well Laura we've heard all
about current care from you and

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.450
others here at
the Rhode Island Quality Institute, but

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.240
I want to come back to you and
let's look out in the future.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.219
What is the future of current care and
of HIE and is there anything that you

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.760
really want our students to
take away from this interview?

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.750
&gt;&gt; I think that HIEs have focused
historically on providing information

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.660
to physicians, hospitals, providers,
long term care and so forth.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.830
By the time they see this,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.020
we're going to be turning the power of
the HIE toward consumers and people.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.360
We know from McGuinness' research that
in terms of the greatest predictors of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.690
morbidity and mortality,
our health care system is only 10%.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.930
We're 85% of where the money is spent
but it's only 10% of the impact.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.960
More and more care is
migrating out of the hospital,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.400
out of primary care doctors offices
into the community and into the home.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.640
So, we are busy building
an opportunity for patients to

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.130
look directly into their current care
record, to upload their own information,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.980
be it biometrics that they're wearing an
embedded to manage their blood pressure.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.430
Or their measure their glucose or
their Fitbit, or

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.750
whatever device they're wearing.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.230
We know that when we go to Appapalooza
events, the inventors get up and

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.980
say we have the coolest app since sliced
bread, and the greatest thing about it,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.040
we're going to be able to send your
data directly to your doctors.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.628
We know the doctors in the audience
are going [SOUND] I can't take

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.194
in data from every device.

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:32.371
We can take in data, we can organize
it and we can use direct to alert

00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:37.760
physicians when something is going on in
the home that they need to know about.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.060
Where on, if they act upon that,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.410
then they can prevent an admission, they
can prevent a patient with congestive

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.120
heart failure picks up seven pounds in
two days, we'll alert your care manager.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.600
That patient will home with
their family on Friday night and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.930
not drowning in their
own fluids in an ED.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.220
So I think it's that idea of beginning
to look at the quantified self,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.010
mobile health, and
how HIEs will begin to integrate

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.470
that information into that record so
it is all one comprehensive record.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.140
Problem with a lot of mobile
health right now is it definitely

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.479
collects your data and it sends it
up to your mobile health platform,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.300
not integrated with anything else.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.130
So I think it's that, and the idea that
we will use direct in the future because

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.640
while I may want my 70-year-old mother
to use the current care platform,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.540
my guess is that she
won't be using that.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.010
I'll want a proxy message to come to me.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.340
And so I will want an alert from
our hospitals that tell me,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.040
your mom just got admitted to an ED,
because my mom lives in Colorado and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.880
I live in Massachusetts and
Rhode Island.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.390
So, I'm going to want an alert.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.030
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like any physicians
out there watching this interview and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.280
worried about meeting the VDT
requirements of meaningful use stage

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.020
two, should just pack their bags and
move to Rhode Island.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.810
You're going to do it for them.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.370
&gt;&gt; We'd love it.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.410
Because with our portal we do have the
view download and transmit capability.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.110
And so we're, give the ability for
someone to get their complete

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.510
longitudinal record and
current care in the PDF form.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.560
They can put it on a USB drive, they can
email it to their daughter, whatever.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.250
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.760
&gt;&gt; My pleasure.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.996
&gt;&gt; I appreciate your allowing us
to come up today, talk to you and

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:10.760
some of your stuff.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.350
Thank you.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.000
&gt;&gt; It's been a pleasure.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.500
Thank you.
