00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
Vsauce!

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.630
Kevin here, with a really simple question.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:12.780
Do you want this box of 1000 candies and a
mystery box which contains either nothing

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.740
or a million candies?

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.070
Or... do you want just the mystery box?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.340
Obviously you’ll take both boxes because
you’re getting the mystery box either way.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.300
Might as well grab some guaranteed candy too,
right?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.300
Right.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.300
Wrong.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.300
Maybe.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.350
Honestly, I don’t know.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.140
The thing is...

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.160
When it comes taking both boxes or just the
mystery box, almost everyone watching this

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.260
video will be absolutely sure that they know
the right answer.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.579
This is barely a problem, let alone one you’ll
never solve.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.980
But here’s what’s interesting…

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.979
Half of you will be certain that the obvious
answer is to take both boxes, and the other

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.310
half of you will be just as sure the obvious
answer is to take only the mystery box.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.720
How is that possible?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.479
And why is there suddenly a Grandayy genie
on my table?

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.260
Let’s dissect this problem.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.580
Box A has clear value.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.859
It’s literally clear -- you can see that
the contents are 1000 candies.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.540
The issue is Mystery Box B.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.770
The contents of Box B are determined in advance
by our omniscient, all-knowing Grandayy genie,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.810
who predicts what you’ll choose with near-perfect
accuracy.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.970
If he predicts you’ll choose both boxes,
he’s put nothing in Box B.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.290
If he predicts that you’ll only choose mystery
Box B, he’s placed… a million candies.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.990
You can’t see inside Box B, you can’t
touch it, and you don’t know what the genie

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.320
has predicted before you actually choose.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.670
Here’s a question.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.259
Who even came up with this?

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.860
Did I just make this whole thing up?

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.950
No.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.200
Theoretical physicist William Newcomb devised
this problem in 1960.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.200
And a decade later, philosopher Robert Nozick
detailed the deep philosophical fracture that

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.270
makes the two equally-obvious choices both
right and both wrong.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.840
It’s a contradiction.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.629
It’s an antinomic paradox.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.660
Here’s why.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.510
If you decide to take both boxes, the genie
will likely have predicted that and put nothing

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.190
in mystery Box B -- maybe genies don’t like
greedy players or something.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:53.459
So if you choose both Box A and box B, you’ll
wind up with only a few handfuls of candy.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.150
If you decide to take only mystery Box B,
the genie will almost certainly have predicted

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.069
that, too, and put a million candies inside…
maybe as a reward for your courageous choice.

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.530
Either way, it’s now obviously better for
you to take mystery Box B because a million

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.520
is a much better prize than 1000.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:25.550
That’s one way to look at this problem,
and in a 2016 poll from The Guardian, 53.5%

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.879
of over 30,000 survey respondents chose to
take only mystery Box B. Here’s what the

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.260
other 46.5% thought:

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.940
The genie has already either put a million
candies in the mystery box… or not.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.040
He could’ve setup the boxes a day, a week,
a month ago!

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.620
The candy isn’t going to suddenly appear
or disappear based on your decision.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.879
If he’s filled Box B with candy and you
take both boxes, you’ll get a million plus

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:08.019
1000 more from Box A, which you can eat right
away to celebrate your amazingly clever rationale.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.370
If he didn’t fill Box B… he just didn’t.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.680
You take both boxes and win your small prize
and this way you don’t walk away empty-handed.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.269
You can’t really lose.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:29.159
Worst case scenario, the mystery box is empty
but you still get 1000 pieces of candy which

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:34.030
is 1000 more than zero.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.979
So should you take both boxes or just Box
B?

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.620
What is actually going on here?

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.819
Why exactly has Newcomb’s Paradox confounded
minds for decades?

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.480
Because it’s pitting two equally valid methods
of reasoning against each other: Expected

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.139
Utility and Strategic Dominance.

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.900
Let’s recap the two options with a little
math… so we can get serious.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:11.099
You may not have a sweet tooth, so let’s
switch prizes from candy to money: Box A now

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:18.919
contains $1,000, and Box B either has $1 million
dollars or no dollars.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.389
First, we can see our possible outcomes with
a simple payoff matrix.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.909
Basically, we’ll just write out the four
scenarios.

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.120
Excuse me, Grandayy.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:36.460
If the genie predicts you’ll take Box B
and you choose Box B, you’ll get $1,000,000.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.479
If he predicts you’ll take Box B but you
choose both boxes, you’ll win $1,001,000

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.449
-- the million in Box B and the $1,000 in
Box A.

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:53.469
If he predicts you’re greedy and will take
both boxes but you choose just Box B, then

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.050
you get zero dollars.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.509
And if the Genie’s prediction is both boxes,
and you choose both boxes, your prize is just

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.969
the $1,000 from box A.

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:09.629
To put it another way, these are the outcomes
when his prediction is right and these are

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.050
the outcomes when his prediction is wrong.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.259
Okay.

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.189
We mapped out the potential outcomes, now
what?

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:24.110
How do we figure out which choice is right?

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:32.069
Well, we can actually calculate how valuable
a choice is to you -- that’s Expected Utility.

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.399
It’s like the math of making a decision.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:42.219
You simply take the result of a choice and
multiply it by the probability of the outcome.

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:47.159
That’ll give you a numerical value to help
inform your decision.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:51.849
So, let’s say the genie has a 90% chance
of predicting right.

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:57.240
We’d calculate the expected utility of choosing
both boxes like this:

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.050
A 90% chance he’s right means there’s
a 10% chance that he’s wrong.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:09.279
So if we choose both boxes, there’s a 10%
chance we win two money-filled boxes and a

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:13.190
90% chance that we’re left with just the
$1,000.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:21.119
We multiply the .1 probability that he’s
wrong by the payoff of $1,001,000 from both

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:27.689
boxes and add that to the 90% chance he’s
right, which means Box B would be empty -- so

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:34.439
that’s .9 multiplied by just the $1,000
Box A payoff.

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:38.439
This equals $101,000.

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:44.759
If we assume that the genie is right 9 times
out of 10, each time we chose both boxes,

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:47.830
we’d theoretically gain $101,000.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:54.629
Now let’s find the Expected Utility of choosing
only Box B so that we can compare the two

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:58.159
values and determine the best choice.

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:04.550
We get a million dollars if we choose Box
B when the genie predicts our choice correctly.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:11.599
If we stick with his 90% accuracy rate, we
multiply .9 by the $1,000,000 payoff and then

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:21.059
add .1 times the $0 from the empty box when
he’s wrong for a theoretical gain of $900,000

00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:22.059
per game.

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:28.409
By using Expected Utility as a reasoning framework,
the best choice is to take only mystery Box

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:35.219
B, because an average payoff of $900,000 is
clearly better than $101,000.

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:36.550
Obviously!

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:42.129
That’s the right way to solve this problem.

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:43.310
Until it isn’t.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:49.360
The Dominance Principle waltzes in and shouts,
“In which scenario can I win the most?”

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:56.709
Because, look, the genie has put the money
in the mystery box or he hasn’t, your choice

00:08:56.709 --> 00:09:04.279
comes down to taking whatever is in that box,
or taking whatever is in that box plus Box

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:05.279
A.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:11.850
The mystery box has a value of n, and the
genie has determined that value in advance.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:20.250
n is either $0 or $1 million dollars, so your
choice is between taking n or taking n + $1,000.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:27.269
So no matter what’s inside Box B, your decision
is: do you want just something, or do you

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:29.879
want something plus $1,000 bucks?

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:36.079
You’re gonna get the something either way,
so you might as well grab the extra cash.

00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:40.620
That’s the right way to solve this problem.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:48.050
Until the Expected Utility people come back
and prove that it… isn’t.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.620
Newcomb’s Paradox presents a problem with,
what mathematician Martin Gardner described

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.199
as, two flawless arguments that are contradictory.

00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:03.069
Choosing just Box B makes perfect sense.

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:07.070
Choosing both boxes makes perfect sense.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:12.430
So… are you still certain one is the obvious
answer?

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:18.510
Are we only left with our own personal perception
of the proper solution?

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.540
I don’t know.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:28.710
Piet Hein, a puzzlemaker, mathematician, and
poet summarized this confusion when he wrote:

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:34.470
“A bit beyond perception’s reach
I sometimes believe I see

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:43.990
That Life is two locked boxes, each
Containing the other’s key.”

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:50.670
My question is: are you team Both or team
just B?

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.769
Thank you for subscribing to me.

00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:58.380
