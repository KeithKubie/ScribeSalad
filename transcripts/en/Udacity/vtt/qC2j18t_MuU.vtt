00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.916
We had a lot of practice with this when we were working with factoring earlier

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:08.071
on. We're just working in the opposite direction this time, almost. When we look

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.560
at the multiplied out version of x minus h squared, we notice that this constant

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.912
term at the end, h squared, is just equal to the coefficient of the middle term

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:21.682
divided by 2 and then squared. So if we do that same thing to the negative 8

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:27.163
here, we know that our constant at the end or h is going to be equal to negative

00:00:27.163 --> 00:00:31.603
8 over 2, the quantity squared. Negative 8 over 2 is negative 4, and negative 4

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:32.335
squared is 16.
