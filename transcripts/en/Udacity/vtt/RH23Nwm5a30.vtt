00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.830
This realization about
the Vandermonde matrix

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.130
leads us to the inverse
fast Fourier transform.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.250
We're given the values of a polynomial
at the roots of unity, and

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.960
we want to recover the coefficients
of that polynomial.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.620
The algorithm is fantastically simple,
given what we've established so far.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.670
Just run the regular fast Fourier
transform only passing in the values,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.860
and the inverse of the root of
unity that we used the first time.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.070
Then divide the result by N.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.940
Recall that the values that
we receive as input here

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.680
were equal to the Vandermonde
matrix times the coefficient.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.190
By multiplying the vectors
of these values

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.260
by the Vandermonde matrix parameterized
by omega inverse, we end up with

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.760
n times the identity matrix times those
coefficients, and so we just need to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.360
divide this result by N in order to get
back the original coefficients exactly.
