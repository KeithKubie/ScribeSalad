00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.380
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.050
we were able to figure
out the coordinates of all

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.662
of the vertices for this face
right here of the tetrahedron.

00:00:09.662 --> 00:00:11.870
And so now we can use those
coordinates to figure out

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.620
the coordinates of the center
of that face, which is also

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.570
one of the vertices of
the smaller tetrahedron.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.300
When we figure out
that coordinate,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.758
then we can figure
out the distance

00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:23.560
between that point
and that point,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.950
or between this
point and this point.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.720
And that will give
us the length of one

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.680
of the sides of the
small tetrahedron.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.450
And then we can compare
that to the length

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.310
of the large tetrahedron and
get this ratio right over here.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.400
So let's get the
coordinates of that point

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.560
or this point right over here.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.596
Let's get the coordinates
of this thing.

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:44.970
To do that, we just have to
take the average of the x, y,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.150
and z-coordinates the
vertices of the face.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.370
Now for x, you
can see, hopefully

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.310
maybe you see that this
is sitting on the yz axis.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.600
Actually, let me draw the z-axis
here just for visualization.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410
So z could go up like
that, and then this

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.580
would be the negative z
direction would be going down

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.400
like that.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.300
So this is clearly
lying on the zy plane.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.830
But even if you
didn't see that, you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.000
could just average
the x points here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.480
So we have negative
1 plus 1 plus 0

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.660
over 3, which is
going to be 0 over 3.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.066
And then you could
average the y points.

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:39.090
0 plus 0 plus square root of
3 over 3, all of that over 3.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.710
And then you can
average the z points.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.620
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.550
Average the z's.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.810
0 plus 0 plus 2 square roots
of 2 over the square root of 3,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.540
all of that over 3.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.900
Now this first coordinate right
over here, clearly just 0.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.810
Second coordinate
over here is going

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.754
to be the square root of-- this
is the square root of 3 over 3.

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:05.670
This was hard to read.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.250
Square root of 3
over 3 divided by 3.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.720
So it's the square
root of 3 over 9.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.560
And then we have 2 times
the square root of 2

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.010
over the square root
of 3 divided by 3.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.740
So it's going to be 2
times the square root of 2

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.750
over 3 times the
square root of 3.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.690
This right here
are the coordinates

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.530
for the center of this space
face, this coordinate right

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.430
over here.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.800
Now using that, we can
now find the distance

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.420
between that point
and that point.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.350
We already know this
point's coordinates.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.260
We already know the
center of the base.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.140
We already know that
right over here.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.170
So let's figure out this
distance or this distance,

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.490
the length of a side of
the smaller tetrahedron.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.772
So let's write it.

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:49.730
Let me do it over here.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.490
The length of the side of a
smaller tetrahedron squared

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.480
is going to be our difference
in x value squared.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.910
So this has an x value of 0.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.760
This has an x value of 0.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.100
So 0 minus 0 squared plus
the difference in y values.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.770
Square root of 3 over 9
minus square root of 3 over 3

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.340
minus-- Square root
of 3 over 3, just

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.965
so we have a common
denominator, that's

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:17.906
the same thing as 3
square roots of 3 over 9.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.530
I just wanted to
rewrite it this way so

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.160
that I have a common
denominator, squared.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.040
Plus 2 square roots of 2.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.410
It's getting messy because I'm--
plus 2 square roots of 2 over 3

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.930
square roots of 3 minus
this guy's z-coordinate.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.630
Well, this guy was
on the xy plane,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.290
so it's minus 0,
minus 0 squared.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.307
So this is going to be equal
to-- let me write it here.

00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:43.890
Let me scroll to the
left a little bit

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.380
so I have some space.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.550
So we have a length of the
small tetrahedron squared

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.300
is going to be equal to-- well,
this is just going to be 0.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.960
This right here is negative
2 times the square root

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.570
of 3 over 9 squared.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.060
So negative 2 times the square
root of 3 over 9 squared

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.862
is 4 times 3.

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:07.570
Negative 2 times square
root of 3 squared

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.590
is going to be 4 times 3
over 9 squared, over 81.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.570
So we did that part
right over here.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.510
We had negative 2 times
square root of 3 over 9.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.240
Square that, you
get this over here.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.250
So that turns into that.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.930
And then this term
right over here,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.490
this is just going to be 2
root 2 over 3 root 3 squared.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.860
So it's going to be plus-- so
this is going to be 4 times

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.880
2 over 9 times 3.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.470
Or another way of
saying it, this

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.970
is going to be equal
to-- let's see.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.420
Well, the numerator and
denominator are divisible by 3.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.230
So this is the same
thing as 4 over 27.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.540
So this first term is
4 over 27 plus what

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.280
we have over here, 4 times 2 is
8 over 27, which is equal to,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.980
which is the same
thing as 12 over 27.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.380
You divide the numerator
and denominator by 3.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.440
This is equal to 4 over 9.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.340
So the length of the small side
squared is equal to 4 over 9.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.165
You take the principal
root on both sides,

00:05:20.165 --> 00:05:21.040
positive square root.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.360
We only care about
positive values

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.950
because we're talking
about distances.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.475
So the length of
one side is going

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:27.100
to be equal to the
square root of that,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.900
which is going to be 2 over 3.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.130
So this distance right
here, this length right here

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.140
is going to be 2/3, or
this length right here

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.280
is going to be 2/3.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.070
So what's the ratio of
a length of a big side

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.419
to the length of a small side?

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.710
So the length of a big side
we already figured out the.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.850
Length of a big side is 2.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.420
This thing is 2.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.880
What's the length
of a small side?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.443
Well, based on all the math
we just did, it is 2/3.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.490
Now before we even
cube it, we can

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.760
divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.760
Actually, we can divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.520
by 2, so this becomes 1/2 1/3.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.330
And 1 over 1/3 is
the same thing as 3.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.540
So 3 cubed is 27.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.120
Or I could write it
as 27 to 1, since we

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.170
want to write it as a ratio.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.850
So when you simplify all this,
you really will just get 27.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.000
But if you want to express
it as a ratio, it is 27 to 1,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.620
the volume of the
big tetrahedron

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.790
to the volume of the small.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.640
So that ratio is m over n.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.220
This is equal to m over
n where m and n are

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.837
relatively prime
positive integers.

00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:44.420
These are definitely
relatively prime.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.780
Their only common factor is 1.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.050
Find m plus n?

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:55.700
So 27 plus 1 is 28,
so our answer is 28.
