00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.510
let's do some problems that deal with

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520
let's do some problems that deal with
 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.120
let's do some problems that deal with
equations and inequalities so let's

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
equations and inequalities so let's
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.550
equations and inequalities so let's
start with this problem two here so it

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
start with this problem two here so it
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.740
start with this problem two here so it
says define the variables and translate

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
says define the variables and translate
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.680
says define the variables and translate
the following expressions into

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690
the following expressions into
 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.169
the following expressions into
inequalities so see Part A a bus can

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179
inequalities so see Part A a bus can
 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.650
inequalities so see Part A a bus can
seat 65 passengers or fewer

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
seat 65 passengers or fewer
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.230
seat 65 passengers or fewer
so in Part A let's let let X be the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
so in Part A let's let let X be the
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.140
so in Part A let's let let X be the
number bus can seat can see so the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
number bus can seat can see so the
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.550
number bus can seat can see so the
number of people you can fit in the Box

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
number of people you can fit in the Box
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.650
number of people you can fit in the Box
bus we're gonna call that X and they're

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
bus we're gonna call that X and they're
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.709
bus we're gonna call that X and they're
saying that the bus can feet can fit 65

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719
saying that the bus can feet can fit 65
 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.430
saying that the bus can feet can fit 65
people or fewer so X so X has to be less

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
people or fewer so X so X has to be less
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.959
people or fewer so X so X has to be less
than or equal to 65 and we put that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
than or equal to 65 and we put that
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.549
than or equal to 65 and we put that
equal there that less than or equal

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
equal there that less than or equal
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.279
equal there that less than or equal
because it could be 65 it doesn't say

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
because it could be 65 it doesn't say
 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380
because it could be 65 it doesn't say
definitely less than 65 it could be 65

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
definitely less than 65 it could be 65
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.959
definitely less than 65 it could be 65
passengers or fewer so that's why it's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
passengers or fewer so that's why it's
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.150
passengers or fewer so that's why it's
less than or equal to be the sum of two

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
less than or equal to be the sum of two
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.929
less than or equal to be the sum of two
consecutive integers is less than 54 so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
consecutive integers is less than 54 so
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.530
consecutive integers is less than 54 so
if you say X is first integer and then X

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
if you say X is first integer and then X
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.700
if you say X is first integer and then X
plus 1 is the next they're saying the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
plus 1 is the next they're saying the
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.810
plus 1 is the next they're saying the
sum of these two is less than 54 so X

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820
sum of these two is less than 54 so X
 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.649
sum of these two is less than 54 so X
plus X plus 1 is less than 54 and if you

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
plus X plus 1 is less than 54 and if you
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.999
plus X plus 1 is less than 54 and if you
actually wanted to figure out what X is

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
actually wanted to figure out what X is
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.140
actually wanted to figure out what X is
what the first integer you could just

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
what the first integer you could just
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.840
what the first integer you could just

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069
buy hamburgers at a fast-food restaurant
 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.449
buy hamburgers at a fast-food restaurant
a hamburger costs forty nine cents you

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459
a hamburger costs forty nine cents you
 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.360
a hamburger costs forty nine cents you
have at most three dollars to spend

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370
have at most three dollars to spend
 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.410
have at most three dollars to spend
right in equality for the number of

right in equality for the number of
 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.869
right in equality for the number of
hamburgers you can buy so let's let

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879
hamburgers you can buy so let's let
 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.199
hamburgers you can buy so let's let
let's change it letters let's H be equal

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209
let's change it letters let's H be equal
 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.410
let's change it letters let's H be equal
to the number of hamburgers so the total

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420
to the number of hamburgers so the total
 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.270
to the number of hamburgers so the total
I'm going to spend is the number of

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
I'm going to spend is the number of
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.420
I'm going to spend is the number of
hamburgers times the amount for

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430
hamburgers times the amount for
 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.349
hamburgers times the amount for
hamburger times 0.49 that's the total

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359
hamburger times 0.49 that's the total
 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.420
hamburger times 0.49 that's the total
amount I'm going to spend and that can

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430
amount I'm going to spend and that can
 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.580
amount I'm going to spend and that can
at most be three dollars so it has to be

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590
at most be three dollars so it has to be
 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.240
at most be three dollars so it has to be
less than or equal to three dollars less

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
less than or equal to three dollars less
 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.689
less than or equal to three dollars less
than or equal to three dollars so that

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699
than or equal to three dollars so that
 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:28.729
than or equal to three dollars so that
is our inequality let's do problem 4

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739
is our inequality let's do problem 4
 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.500
is our inequality let's do problem 4
here problem 4 check that the given

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510
here problem 4 check that the given
 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.300
here problem 4 check that the given
number is a solution to the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310
number is a solution to the
 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.470
number is a solution to the
corresponding inequality alright Part A

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
corresponding inequality alright Part A
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.789
corresponding inequality alright Part A
here so the inequality is 2 times X plus

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799
here so the inequality is 2 times X plus
 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.360
here so the inequality is 2 times X plus
6 is less than or equal to 8x and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
6 is less than or equal to 8x and
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.670
6 is less than or equal to 8x and
they're saying that X is equal to 12 is

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680
they're saying that X is equal to 12 is
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.610
they're saying that X is equal to 12 is
a solution let's verify that so if you

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620
a solution let's verify that so if you
 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.759
a solution let's verify that so if you
put a 12 here in a different color if

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769
put a 12 here in a different color if
 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.659
put a 12 here in a different color if
this is a 12 and then this would be a 12

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669
this is a 12 and then this would be a 12
 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.509
this is a 12 and then this would be a 12
so you get 2 times 12 plus 6 so this is

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519
so you get 2 times 12 plus 6 so this is
 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.379
so you get 2 times 12 plus 6 so this is
2 times 18 is less than or equal to 8

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389
2 times 18 is less than or equal to 8
 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:14.710
2 times 18 is less than or equal to 8
times 12 8 times 12 is 96 2 times 18 is

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720
times 12 8 times 12 is 96 2 times 18 is
 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.890
times 12 8 times 12 is 96 2 times 18 is
36 so 36 is definitely less than or

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900
36 so 36 is definitely less than or
 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.069
36 so 36 is definitely less than or
equal to 96 so this X is equal to 12 is

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079
equal to 96 so this X is equal to 12 is
 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.570
equal to 96 so this X is equal to 12 is
a solution Part B

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580
a solution Part B
 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:36.219
a solution Part B
B we have 1.4 times Z plus 50.2 is

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229
B we have 1.4 times Z plus 50.2 is
 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.559
B we have 1.4 times Z plus 50.2 is
greater than 0.4 z and for the solution

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569
greater than 0.4 z and for the solution
 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.430
greater than 0.4 z and for the solution
that Z is equal to minus 9 negative 9 I

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440
that Z is equal to minus 9 negative 9 I
 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.260
that Z is equal to minus 9 negative 9 I
should say always C minus 9 the correct

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270
should say always C minus 9 the correct
 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.990
should say always C minus 9 the correct
wording is negative 9 so let's put a

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000
wording is negative 9 so let's put a
 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.749
wording is negative 9 so let's put a
negative 9 here so it's 1.4 they're

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759
negative 9 here so it's 1.4 they're
 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.980
negative 9 here so it's 1.4 they're
saying that that's one of the solutions

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990
saying that that's one of the solutions
 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.999
saying that that's one of the solutions
times negative 9 plus 5 point 2 is

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009
times negative 9 plus 5 point 2 is
 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:06.189
times negative 9 plus 5 point 2 is
greater than 0.4 times negative negative

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199
greater than 0.4 times negative negative
 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.959
greater than 0.4 times negative negative
9 and I'm just going to use the

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969
9 and I'm just going to use the
 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.540
9 and I'm just going to use the
calculator on this one just for the sake

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550
calculator on this one just for the sake
 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.760
calculator on this one just for the sake
of time you could do that on your head

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770
of time you could do that on your head
 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.260
of time you could do that on your head
if you like so we have on the left hand

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270
if you like so we have on the left hand
 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:28.100
if you like so we have on the left hand
side 1.4 times 9 times negative 9 that's

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110
side 1.4 times 9 times negative 9 that's
 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.170
side 1.4 times 9 times negative 9 that's
equal to minus 12 point 6 so this is

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180
equal to minus 12 point 6 so this is
 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.570
equal to minus 12 point 6 so this is
minus twelve point six plus five point

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580
minus twelve point six plus five point
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.070
minus twelve point six plus five point
two plus five point two is equal to

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080
two plus five point two is equal to
 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.580
two plus five point two is equal to
negative seven point four so this

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590
negative seven point four so this
 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.050
negative seven point four so this
left-hand side is negative seven point

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060
left-hand side is negative seven point
 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.899
left-hand side is negative seven point
four and then they're claiming that that

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909
four and then they're claiming that that
 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.510
four and then they're claiming that that
is greater than this so I can do in my

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520
is greater than this so I can do in my
 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.459
is greater than this so I can do in my
head 4 times 9 is 36

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469
head 4 times 9 is 36
 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.140
head 4 times 9 is 36
I haven't when I put a negative sign

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150
I haven't when I put a negative sign
 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.189
I haven't when I put a negative sign
because the positive times a negative

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199
because the positive times a negative
 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.409
because the positive times a negative
and I have one number behind the decimal

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419
and I have one number behind the decimal
 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.499
and I have one number behind the decimal
point so this is saying negative seven

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509
point so this is saying negative seven
 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.820
point so this is saying negative seven
point four is greater than is greater

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830
point four is greater than is greater
 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.480
point four is greater than is greater
than negative three point six this isn't

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490
than negative three point six this isn't
 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.879
than negative three point six this isn't
true this isn't true if you draw a

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889
true this isn't true if you draw a
 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.580
true this isn't true if you draw a
number line right here so if this is

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590
number line right here so if this is
 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.969
number line right here so if this is
zero this is negative three point six

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979
zero this is negative three point six
 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.670
zero this is negative three point six
this is negative seven point four it's

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680
this is negative seven point four it's
 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.820
this is negative seven point four it's
less than negative three point six so

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830
less than negative three point six so
 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.260
less than negative three point six so
this is not true

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270
this is not true
 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.890
this is not true

zero point two seven times the price of
 

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.660
zero point two seven times the price of
a Lexus so to figure out the price of a

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:56.670
a Lexus so to figure out the price of a
 

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.630
a Lexus so to figure out the price of a
Lexus we just divide both sides by point

00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640
Lexus we just divide both sides by point
 

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.590
Lexus we just divide both sides by point
two seven zero point two seven divide

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600
two seven zero point two seven divide
 

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.310
two seven zero point two seven divide
this side by zero point two seven that

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320
this side by zero point two seven that
 

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.730
this side by zero point two seven that
just becomes a 1 and so you have the

dollars
 

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.420
dollars
so plus let me scroll over a little bit

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:16.430
so plus let me scroll over a little bit
 

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:22.280
so plus let me scroll over a little bit
plus five percent of sales over two

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:22.290
plus five percent of sales over two
 

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.100
plus five percent of sales over two
thousand dollars so if my sales are s my

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:25.110
thousand dollars so if my sales are s my
 

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.990
thousand dollars so if my sales are s my
sales over two thousand dollars are

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000
sales over two thousand dollars are
 

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.730
sales over two thousand dollars are
going to be s minus two thousand dollars

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:30.740
going to be s minus two thousand dollars
 

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.579
going to be s minus two thousand dollars
s minus two thousand dollars right if my

00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:34.589
s minus two thousand dollars right if my
 

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:36.290
s minus two thousand dollars right if my
sales are let's say there's three

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300
sales are let's say there's three
 

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.030
sales are let's say there's three
thousand dollars in a month the sales

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040
thousand dollars in a month the sales
 

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.770
thousand dollars in a month the sales
over two thousand are gonna be three

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:39.780
over two thousand are gonna be three
 

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.920
over two thousand are gonna be three
thousand minus 2000 is gonna be one

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:42.930
thousand minus 2000 is gonna be one
 

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.720
thousand minus 2000 is gonna be one
thousand dollars over two thousand so

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:44.730
thousand dollars over two thousand so
 

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:49.780
thousand dollars over two thousand so
these are our two options let me let me

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:49.790
these are our two options let me let me
 

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.180
these are our two options let me let me
highlight that right over there and they

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.190
highlight that right over there and they
 

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.070
highlight that right over there and they
say for what amount of sales is the

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:55.080
say for what amount of sales is the
 

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.260
say for what amount of sales is the
first option better than the second

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:57.270
first option better than the second
 

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.240
first option better than the second
option and assume there are always sales

00:12:59.240 --> 00:12:59.250
option and assume there are always sales
 

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.710
option and assume there are always sales
over two thousand dollars so they're

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720
over two thousand dollars so they're
 

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.940
over two thousand dollars so they're
essentially saying okay this is always

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:01.950
essentially saying okay this is always
 

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.100
essentially saying okay this is always
going to be non zero right here so we

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:04.110
going to be non zero right here so we
 

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.269
going to be non zero right here so we
want to know the situation where the

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279
want to know the situation where the
 

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:08.480
want to know the situation where the
first option is better better probably

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:08.490
first option is better better probably
 

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.250
first option is better better probably
meaning for me meaning that I'll get

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260
meaning for me meaning that I'll get
 

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.680
meaning for me meaning that I'll get
more money so when is option one going

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:12.690
more money so when is option one going
 

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.930
more money so when is option one going
to be we give you to say greater than or

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940
to be we give you to say greater than or
 

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.090
to be we give you to say greater than or
greater than equal to option two and

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100
greater than equal to option two and
 

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.310
greater than equal to option two and
then we could solve this equation so

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320
then we could solve this equation so
 

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.630
then we could solve this equation so
let's see what we can do the

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:20.640
let's see what we can do the
 

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.460
let's see what we can do the
first thing I might want to do is just

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:22.470
first thing I might want to do is just
 

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.310
first thing I might want to do is just
well let's let's do the first thing let

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320
well let's let's do the first thing let
 

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.410
well let's let's do the first thing let
me subtract 1000 from both sides so if

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420
me subtract 1000 from both sides so if
 

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.420
me subtract 1000 from both sides so if
you subtract a thousand from the left

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:29.430
you subtract a thousand from the left
 

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.050
you subtract a thousand from the left
hand side you're just left with 0.06 s

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060
hand side you're just left with 0.06 s
 

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.510
hand side you're just left with 0.06 s
is greater than or equal to subtract a

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:35.520
is greater than or equal to subtract a
 

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.160
is greater than or equal to subtract a
thousand from the left hand side I'll

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.170
thousand from the left hand side I'll
 

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.690
thousand from the left hand side I'll
take the thousand from here you're left

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700
take the thousand from here you're left
 

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:45.760
take the thousand from here you're left
with two hundred plus 0.05 times s minus

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:45.770
with two hundred plus 0.05 times s minus
 

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:50.360
with two hundred plus 0.05 times s minus
2,000 and then let's see I pi want to

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:50.370
2,000 and then let's see I pi want to
 

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.040
2,000 and then let's see I pi want to
multiply that out this is going to be

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.050
multiply that out this is going to be
 

00:13:52.050 --> 00:14:00.380
multiply that out this is going to be
two hundred plus 0.05 s minus this

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:00.390
two hundred plus 0.05 s minus this
 

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.020
two hundred plus 0.05 s minus this
0.05 that's the same five percent that's

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.030
0.05 that's the same five percent that's
 

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.810
0.05 that's the same five percent that's
the same thing is one twentieth one

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820
the same thing is one twentieth one
 

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:11.270
the same thing is one twentieth one
twentieth of two thousand that's 100 so

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:11.280
twentieth of two thousand that's 100 so
 

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.350
twentieth of two thousand that's 100 so
this is minus one hundred that times

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360
this is minus one hundred that times
 

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.240
this is minus one hundred that times
that is one hundred I'm just

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.250
that is one hundred I'm just
 

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.090
that is one hundred I'm just
distributing this 5 percent or this

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100
distributing this 5 percent or this
 

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.700
distributing this 5 percent or this
point zero five so that's the right hand

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:22.710
point zero five so that's the right hand
 

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.840
point zero five so that's the right hand
side of the equation and on the left

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:23.850
side of the equation and on the left
 

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.330
side of the equation and on the left
hand side we have zero point zero six

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:26.340
hand side we have zero point zero six
 

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.000
hand side we have zero point zero six
and we would just simplify the right

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.010
and we would just simplify the right
 

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.550
and we would just simplify the right
hand side a little bit we have 200 minus

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560
hand side a little bit we have 200 minus
 

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.210
hand side a little bit we have 200 minus
100 so that just becomes 200 minus 100

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220
100 so that just becomes 200 minus 100
 

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.750
100 so that just becomes 200 minus 100
we could just write it as plus 100 right

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760
we could just write it as plus 100 right
 

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.890
we could just write it as plus 100 right
there so our equation is 0.06 is greater

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:42.900
there so our equation is 0.06 is greater
 

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.500
there so our equation is 0.06 is greater
than or equal to zero point is zero five

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:45.510
than or equal to zero point is zero five
 

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:50.060
than or equal to zero point is zero five
oh sorry this is 0.06 s is greater than

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.070
oh sorry this is 0.06 s is greater than
 

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.490
oh sorry this is 0.06 s is greater than
or equal to I don't want to lose that s

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.500
or equal to I don't want to lose that s
 

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.320
or equal to I don't want to lose that s
over there

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:53.330
over there
 

00:14:53.330 --> 00:15:01.250
over there
0.05 s plus 100 now let's subtract 0.05

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260
0.05 s plus 100 now let's subtract 0.05
 

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.160
0.05 s plus 100 now let's subtract 0.05
from s from both sides of the equation

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:04.170
from s from both sides of the equation
 

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:10.280
from s from both sides of the equation
so 0.06 minus 0.05 s is going to be 0.01

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:10.290
so 0.06 minus 0.05 s is going to be 0.01
 

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.620
so 0.06 minus 0.05 s is going to be 0.01
s is greater than or equal to I

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:12.630
s is greater than or equal to I
 

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.450
s is greater than or equal to I
subtracted this from both sides so it's

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:14.460
subtracted this from both sides so it's
 

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.880
subtracted this from both sides so it's
not going to be here anymore is greater

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:16.890
not going to be here anymore is greater
 

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.710
not going to be here anymore is greater
than or equal to 100 and now I just

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720
than or equal to 100 and now I just
 

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:30.320
than or equal to 100 and now I just
divide both sides by 0.01 so 0.01 0.01

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:30.330
divide both sides by 0.01 so 0.01 0.01
 

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.560
divide both sides by 0.01 so 0.01 0.01
that becomes a 1 and then we are left

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:33.570
that becomes a 1 and then we are left
 

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:34.470
that becomes a 1 and then we are left
with

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480
with
 

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.169
with
s to be greater than or equal to what's

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:37.179
s to be greater than or equal to what's
 

00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:40.470
s to be greater than or equal to what's
a hundred divided by 0.01 that's 100

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480
a hundred divided by 0.01 that's 100
 

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.960
a hundred divided by 0.01 that's 100
this is a hundred divided by this the

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:42.970
this is a hundred divided by this the
 

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.179
this is a hundred divided by this the
same thing as 100 divided by 1 over 100

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:45.189
same thing as 100 divided by 1 over 100
 

00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:47.220
same thing as 100 divided by 1 over 100
which is the same thing as a hundred

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:47.230
which is the same thing as a hundred
 

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.749
which is the same thing as a hundred
times 100 a hundred times a hundred is

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:50.759
times 100 a hundred times a hundred is
 

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:55.590
times 100 a hundred times a hundred is
10,000 so option one is definitely

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600
10,000 so option one is definitely
 

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.349
10,000 so option one is definitely
better for you if your total sales for
