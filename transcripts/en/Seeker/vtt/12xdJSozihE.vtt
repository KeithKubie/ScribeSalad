00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.980
Imagine a volcano spewing frozen lava at negative
182 degrees celsius!

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.740
Well, that’s just another day on Ceres.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.220
Hello Earthlings, Ian here for DNews and I
want to tell you about some VERY cool planetary

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.009
science.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.449
Cryovolcanoes — or “ice volcanoes” — are
purely extraterrestrial affairs and are thought

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.900
to be pretty common on the moons and dwarf
planets of the outer solar system.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.919
NASA’s Cassini mission, for example, has
spotted possible ice volcanoes on Saturn’s

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:30.919
moon Titan.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.910
And the New Horizons mission to Pluto has
also seen features that could be created by

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.980
cryovolcanic activity.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.610
Now, NASA has announced that even Ceres, the
closest dwarf planet to the sun, has an ice

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.460
volcano mystery going on!

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.600
You may think you’re pretty familiar with
volcanoes.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.050
These ruptures in the Earth’s crust form
at the edges of tectonic plates, venting molten

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.510
rock from our planet’s mantle, spewing lava
over land and into the oceans and creating

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.630
new rock.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.490
But things get a bit weird when we look elsewhere
in the solar system.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.130
Sure, we know there are extinct volcanoes
on Mars and there are very, very active ones

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.450
on Jupiter’s angry moon Io, but cryovolcanoes
are something else altogether that you won’t

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.450
find on Earth.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.820
These ice volcanoes are found on icy worlds.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.060
And instead of erupting with molten rock,
they erupt volatiles like water, methane and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.490
ammonia.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.800
Volatiles are chemicals that have very low
melting points and for the most part remain

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.500
as a solid inside icy planets and moons.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.570
For example, methane melts when heated to
MINUS 182 degrees Celsius.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.100
As Earth is a pretty warm place, methane is
usually found as a gas here, but on super-cold

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.240
worlds like Pluto, it’s usually found as
solid ice.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.290
BUT -- if something heats the interiors of
these worlds — like radioactive decay — methane

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.300
and other volatiles will melt and erupt to
the surface.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.880
These eruptions can create the ice equivalent
of volcanoes that we are familiar with on

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.790
Earth; just swap out the superhot lava for
extremely cold liquid that spews onto the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.470
surface, rapidly refreezing and creating a
volcano-like mountain.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.320
If you were unfortunate to be standing next
to a cryovolcano as it erupted, you wouldn’t

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.130
be incinerated by molten rock, you’d be
frozen into a block of ice.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.640
So, back to Ceres.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.869
This strange dwarf planet is thought to contain
large quantities of water ice and now NASA’s

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.979
Dawn mission has spotted a solitary mountain,
nearly half the size of Mount Everest, that

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.970
is thought to be a cryovolcano.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.430
This peculiar mountain is called Ahuna Mons
and scientists are trying to work out why

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.760
there appears to be only one.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.540
It’s a bit like the Earth possessing just
one volcano — that doesn’t make much sense.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.019
Although cryovolcanoes are still pretty theoretical,
it's thought that Ceres used to have more,

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.999
but they flattened out out via “viscous
relaxation”.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:30.219
This physical process is known to cause masses
of ice to deform over time, and it’s the

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.719
same process that drives the flow of Earth’s
glaciers into the ocean.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.620
Because of that process, over hundreds of
millions of years, ice-rich cryovolcanoes

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.659
are thought to slowly slump under gravity
and flatten out.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.140
The only reason why Ahuna Mons is still standing
is that it is pretty young, geologically speaking.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.359
This finding only adds strength to the idea
that there’s a LOT of water ice on Ceres,

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.819
but most of it is locked under the surface.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.819

Check out Amy’s video here.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.140
What do you think is more awesome -- an ice
volcano or a regular ol’ lava volcano?
