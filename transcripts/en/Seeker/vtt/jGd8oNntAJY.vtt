00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.870
Humans are obviously pretty excited about
music.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.639
But what if you're a whale, or a cow, or a
dog?

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.790
Do animals like music?

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:21.000
Hello music-lovers, Trace here with the beat
from the street on DNews -- Music is one of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.210
the most basic pleasures humans have.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.080
The oldest surviving musical instruments are
some 40,000 year old bone flutes from southwestern

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.080
Germany.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.350
These ancient bone flutes are of such high
quality as to suggest we'd been making instruments

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.239
for generations.

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.149
Though, we don't really NEED instruments to
make it work, anthropologists have yet to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.969
find a culture that didn't enjoy music, and
according to zoologists it's not just us.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.809
Research out of Boston University and published
in the journal Science, explores the tendency

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.559
of birds and whales to follow the same rules
as human music.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.019
Both birds and whales have the ability to
make sounds that AREN'T musical, but they

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.019
don't.

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.220
They naturally prefer to stay in the realm
of human composition.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.170
Birds have been known to sing in phrases and
rhythms, even adding percussion.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.920
Some use logs to amplify their song, and follow
call and response methods favored by jazz

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920
musicians.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.590
Humpback whale-song uses the A-B-A format
of a musical phrase, followed by a new phrase,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.140
and then a return to an altered form of the
first!

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.340
The Beatles are known for A-B-A style, too!

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.080
The researchers conclude musical penchance
can't just be a human trait, but that animals

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.880
are programmed to enjoy or follow the laws
of harmonics.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.320
A study done in 2001 on English cows found
when cows were played songs while being milked

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.450
the speed of the music affected how much milk
they produced!

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.530
Specifically, the cows liked slow jams.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.049
Fast songs over 120 beats per minute caused
milk production to drop, but slow songs under

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.429
100 beats per minute increased production
by three percent per day!

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.569
Unfortunately, cows seem to hate Jamiroquai.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.819
Which makes me like them less.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.510
Neuroscientists and psychologists have studied
the human brain looking for clues to why we

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.130
love music so much, and we've talked about
some of the connections in the past on DNews.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.810
Neuroscientists at Harvard Medical School
scanned the brains of people listening to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.800
music and found though the left hemisphere
controls language and the right is considered

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.070
the musical half, there was a QUOTE "subtle
interplay," between the two when listening

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.070
to music.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.780
More recently, it was discovered jazz musicians
process music not as an aesthetic pleasure,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.599
but as a LANGUAGE.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.459
Using fMRI scans on jazz musicians, they found
our brains derive meaning from musical phrases

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.160
-- which sounds to ME a lot like like whales
and birds!

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.850
So why do animals like music?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.970
Scientists believe it's built in!

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.820
They like it for the same reasons we like
it, it feels right, but more study is needed.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.200
