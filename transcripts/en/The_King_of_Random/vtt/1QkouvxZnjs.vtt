00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.199
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop Iron man is one of my favorite movies and today

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.240
We're going to be taking a look at how to build our very own Iron Man arc reactor nightlight

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.968
Let's go over the materials that we have and get started building

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.189
I do have quite a few items on the workbench at the moment but most of them are low cost and easy to get your

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.729
Hands on I have a can of some seaside colored spray paint

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.560
I've got some black and some gold acrylic paint a simple paintbrush this cutting board

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.789
I think was 88 cents at Walmart and about the same cost for this small strainer

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.988
These little touch lights come in a pack of two for eight or nine dollars at Walmart

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.659
Sitting underneath our touch light is a piece of foam core board these of course usually come in much larger sheets

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.540
I've just cut a small piece off because that's all we're gonna need for this build

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.449
I have a strip of staple guns staples a

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.270
Standard keyring three small hex head screws some copper wire

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.239
This other matte underneath the rest of this stuff is also supposed to be a form of cutting board it's sold in a three pack

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.779
For about a dollar and it's just a thin flexible plastic

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.559
I have a circle compass an exacto knife a glue gun

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.649
And I have this tool which is designed for punching holes and setting Hardware in leather really

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.339
I'm just going to be using the one tool that punches out a small hole

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.970
It's a little bit smaller than a standard

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.740
Hole punch if you don't have one of these you can easily use a drill bit or a small hot nail for the holes that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.700
We need to punch. It's just going to be used on our thin orange plastic the first pieces

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.529
We need to make are some circles cut out of our thick cutting board

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.610
And they need to be the same diameter as our touch light we want to cut out two circles

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.439
One will just be a disc

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.529
That's the exact same size and shape as the surface of our touch light the second piece will be a ring that almost perfectly matches

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.570
This white border going around our light for the solid disc we can easily just trace out the light

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.549
And it will give us a disc just the right size

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.529
But because we want to add a border on the other one let's try using a compass just the right size

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.039
To measure out the first circle and then keeping our Center in the right spot

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.459
We can measure out a smaller circle within it now the diameter of this light appears to be just barely under three inches

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.110
So if we set our compass to be just under an inch and a half we should get a circle

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.610
that's the same size as the diam or light the specific measurement of our ring should be just exactly the width of the

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.109
Inside of our staples because our staples are later going to fit over this ring

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.640
It's kind of funny

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.049
How this ring looks larger than this one because it's measured on the outside and this one is drawn at the exact interior diameter

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.750
But really these two should come out being the exact same size cutting boards are designed to be tough

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.839
And they're designed to hold up to things like knives and blades

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.259
So this board can be a little bit tricky to get through however

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.910
there are a lot of tools that can cut it really easily if you have a hole saw the right size that would do a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.999
Great job. However in the interest of saving time for the video

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.359
I got my hands on a scroll saw and I'm gonna use that to cut these pieces out

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.090
There's our first disc I want to cut out the inside first and of course

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.239
I can't just pass the blade through but these blades are designed to come off and on really easily so what I'll do is drill

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.328
A hole into the plastic take the blade off fit it through the hole, and then reattach it on the scroll saw

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.000
There we go our ring is now cut out

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.820
Let's clean this up with a little bit of sandpaper, and then we'll be ready to move on

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.649
Now the reason I chose to use this cutting board material is that it's strong rigid and it's excellent at defusing light

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.810
So what we're going to do is have the disc and the ring both sit above our touch light

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.799
And they should give a nice

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.759
Muted glow without being too intense the arc reactor in the movie has a slight blue tint coming off of it

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.649
So let's take our solid disc and paint one side of it with that aqua blue spray paint we have

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.469
We can now see that we get a nice soft slightly blue glow

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.750
Just what we're looking for we now want to take our ring and modify it so that it has ten points

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.660
Going around the circle of what seemed to be

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.830
Magnetic coils of some kind to do that we're going to be using our staples and our copper wire each of the two points

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.669
We'll use two staples

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.789
So it's break twenty staples off of this stick that we have

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.609
We'll want to place our staples over our ring

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.390
Flip it over and then crimp them down, so they're holding on tightly to the ring

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.320
We should have less than one centimeter of a gap in between the two staples

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.630
Once the staples are really well pressed down. They should hold themselves in place pretty well

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.949
You could maybe move them if you tried hard, but overall they're gonna stay where you put them

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.289
Now let's put another set of staples directly across from the first set

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:31.419
With our first two sets of staples installed we now need to evenly spaced out four more sets around on each side of them

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.940
Hopefully the staples are holding on nice and tight to your plastic ring

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.560
But if some of them are a little bit loose you can easily just use a dot of hot glue to hold them in place

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.690
Now that we have all of our staples attached to our plastic ring you need to wrap some of our copper wire

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.869
around the plastic in between the sets of staples

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.229
Let's cut off about a two-inch section that we'll use to wrap around

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.340
That way we won't have to pass all of our wire through our ring as we do the wrapping

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.489
So now on the back of our ring. Let's put a small dab of glue in between two of the staples

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.699
We've then press our copper wire down into that glue

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.259
If you're using really hot glue make sure you don't do that with bare fingers. It'll hurt

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.200
Wrap that around once cross it around the back and then wrap it down a second time

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.610
And we now have a nice

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.169
coil of wrapped copper wire in between our two staples

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.880
So on the back again, let's trim off the excess, so it doesn't wrap around further

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.419
And then we'll glue down the ends of our copper wire and look at that we have our little

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.529
Electromagnet driving our arc reactor or whatever that thing is like I said, it's not very clear the exact function

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.500
So now we just need to do that nine more times

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.770
there we have it all ten of our sections are now wrapped with our copper wire and our ring is looking pretty good on the

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.670
Inside of the arc reactor there are a few

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.100
Concentric rings building up from a spot in the middle that has sort of a mesh grid over it

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.299
We'll be using the metal mesh from this sieve as the grid on the bottom of the arc reactor

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:10.419
And we'll be cutting some concentric rings out of this plastic for the Rings that build up inside the arc reactor

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.999
To begin let's cut off the mesh from the sieve and flatten it out as best we can so that we can measure a flat

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
circle rather than a domed one

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.550
We're doing now fortunately this stuff is quite flexible

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.809
To measure out the size that we want that circle to be we're going to make it match the

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.490
Keyring that we'll be using this will actually end up getting attached to the arc reactor a little bit higher up

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.400
But it's a perfect measure for the size that we want this circle beat

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.949
We now need to cut out five concentric rings the smallest of which should fit nicely

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.039
right over our silver mesh the largest of which

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.080
Should just barely be smaller than the interior diameter of our plastic ring

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.710
We're going to want the smallest ring to slightly overlap the edge of our mesh

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.560
So if we make our first circle just slightly smaller than that we should be able to make the outside of it

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.050
Just lightly larger, and then it will completely cover the edge

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:09.890
So that right there will be the size of our first ring and now we need to have four more of the same thickness

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.410
Extending from it

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.629
There we go our fifth ring and we can see that it just barely fits inside

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.929
The plastic ring with the copper wound around it we need to use our exacto knife and very carefully cut out

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.240
Around each of those circles we just drew

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.230
So now we've got our five circles of ascending size

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.480
And we need to change them to the right color the pieces in the movie look like they're probably made out of brass

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.580
So let's use a nice golden brass colored paint and change these to look like they're made of metal

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:05.310
I'll first add a black base coat onto the plastic as I think that will make the gold show up a little bit nicer

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.789
Our five plastic circles are now painted and looked nice and brass colored now

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:35.100
We need to find a way to attach them at an ascending angle onto our arc reactor our smallest ring needs to be attached to

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.119
Our mesh circle and that will get glued down on the center of our plastic disc

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.340
We're going to want to suspend our ring a little bit above the disk down below

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:57.030
So let's cut out three pieces of our foam core board that will act as struts holding the ring up above the disk

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.609
Our big plastic ring will sit supported up above these pieces

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.200
But we want our smaller brass colored concentric rings to sit nested down inside

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.439
Going from the bottom up to the hype of the top ring

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.219
So now we want to cut from that point down to where our foam core board

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.400
touches our smallest inner brass ring

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.850
And of course we want to cut all three pieces to match that

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.699
I

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:33.699
Have here an equilateral triangle

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.539
That I cut out using a compass and a ruler and I'm just going to use that to mark

00:10:37.699 --> 00:10:41.949
What points to put these supports on so that they're evenly spaced around our circle?

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.789
Now let's quickly hit the sides and sloped parts of these supports with some black paint

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:18.349
Now that we have our supports painted what we're going to do is glue our rings so that they're touching the supports and

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.930
stacked nicely on top of one another

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:27.260
The angle that we've cut the supports out should keep them perfectly spaced as it ascends from one sized ring to the next

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.140
Next piece we need to make is a slightly thicker ring that will go above all of these

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.589
This will have holes going through it all the way around and it's what our

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.889
Hexagonal headed screws will fit into that its widest

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.620
It should have the same diameter as our top ring

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:59.359
But it will be much thicker so its inner diameter will be considerably smaller than our top ring

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.530
We now need to use our poll punch and punch holes going all the way around this ring

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.069
To make sure that I have three that are evenly spaced out

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:28.040
I'm going to use my little equilateral triangle again and just put three marks of where I want those holes to go

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.999
Also be helpful to me to have an inner

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.650
Line that will show where the edge of the hole should go, so I don't end up having

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.469
One hole right here, and one hole right here

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.920
So I keep it in one nice smooth straight line

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.670
Now I have three evenly spaced holes, and I need to fill in all of the gaps between them

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:10.640
With our holes punched we can now take our hex head screws and thread them down through the hole into the plastic

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.460
And now get a good sense of how this is going to work

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:27.520
But the only pieces we still need to cut out are some support struts that go from our three hex head screws

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.580
Into the middle to hold up our silver ring

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.650
We'll cut those pieces out of some more of this semi rigid plastic we can see that

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.869
We aren't going to need those pieces to be very long

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:42.100
They only have to reach from the hex head screw to the edge of our keyring

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.649
Let's add holes into the end of each of these three tabs

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.619
And then we'll bend them to give a little bit of a different shape

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:59.330
To hold up our ring slightly lower than the plastic ring with the holes in it

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:06.740
Now I'm going to use the back edge of this razor blade to add a couple of bends into our plastic

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:18.110
So now we need to attach each of these three tabs on to their respective screws

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.480
It fits nicely over the screw, and let's just add a little bit of hot glue to keep it firmly in place

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.690
With our three supports in their spots

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.550
We can drop in our little ring and now we can mark where we need to cut off the extra plastic

00:14:37.339 --> 00:14:41.828
Now let's add a little bit of glue on all those edges and a fix our ring permanently

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:55.089
We do have a little bit of overlap so let's take our exacto knife and just try and trim a little bit of that off

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.779
Here's our center ring now. Let's use a little bit more of our paint and paint everything that's orange to be black

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.930
At this point it's time to start the final assembly on the piece so first

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.889
Let's glue the outer ring onto the support structure around it

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:40.440
Now the way that these are spaced out our little hex screws will rest nicely right on top of the highest

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.569
Golden ring, so we just need to add a little dab of glue to the bottom of each screw

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.570
And then a fix it onto those rings

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.870
Let's cut three small support pieces out of our foam core board

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.549
Glue them on and then paint everything black before gluing this on to the supports

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:09.958
Then we'll attach the smaller black and silver rings into the center

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.740
In a darkroom this lights up

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:40.199
Beautifully, this of course is more of the display piece arc reactor than something you would want to wear as a costume

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:42.160
It's fairly wide overall

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.870
But you would be able to follow these exact same principles and just make everything

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.739
Shorter if you were trying to make a version that you could maybe mount to your chest as part of a costume

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:52.259
Tony Stark built one of these in a cave
