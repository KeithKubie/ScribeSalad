00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600
progression that this is how they
 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.090
progression that this is how they
evolved in this world so I like that uh

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100
evolved in this world so I like that uh
 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.080
evolved in this world so I like that uh
and we get again we get some ideas again

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090
and we get again we get some ideas again
 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.270
and we get again we get some ideas again
we saw out of how water bending can work

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280
we saw out of how water bending can work
 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.470
we saw out of how water bending can work
a little bit more you can sort of put

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480
a little bit more you can sort of put
 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.290
a little bit more you can sort of put
the water through the leaves and you can

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300
the water through the leaves and you can
 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.830
the water through the leaves and you can
raise that up um which is kind of

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840
raise that up um which is kind of
 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.690
raise that up um which is kind of
interesting how do they freeze the water

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700
interesting how do they freeze the water
 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.490
interesting how do they freeze the water
by the way that's um a little curious

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500
by the way that's um a little curious
 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.850
by the way that's um a little curious
about um now why there's gonna be like a

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860
about um now why there's gonna be like a
 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.080
about um now why there's gonna be like a

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640
deserved uh if you get its ID forget
 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.070
deserved uh if you get its ID forget
about the gravitational pole which is

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080
about the gravitational pole which is
 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.080
about the gravitational pole which is
pretty obvious I'm talking about the

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090
pretty obvious I'm talking about the
 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.690
pretty obvious I'm talking about the
siege of the north I say oh why does the

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700
siege of the north I say oh why does the
 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.520
siege of the north I say oh why does the
moon totally knock out their power which

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530
moon totally knock out their power which
 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.190
moon totally knock out their power which
I to me it's still kind of a question

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200
I to me it's still kind of a question
 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.430
I to me it's still kind of a question
cuz they do have the water and I can see

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440
cuz they do have the water and I can see
 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.410
cuz they do have the water and I can see
it making them weaker but why take away

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420
it making them weaker but why take away
 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.080
it making them weaker but why take away
their power but then again the moon sort

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090
their power but then again the moon sort
 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.780
their power but then again the moon sort
of moves the tide its are like the

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790
of moves the tide its are like the
 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.700
of moves the tide its are like the
movement of the water so that makes a

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710
movement of the water so that makes a
 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.860
movement of the water so that makes a
little bit more sense but then how does

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870
little bit more sense but then how does
 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.560
little bit more sense but then how does
