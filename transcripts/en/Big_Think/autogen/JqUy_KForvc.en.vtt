00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.990
the first step is we can start two ways

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000
the first step is we can start two ways
 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.250
the first step is we can start two ways
we can start with a disease let's say we

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
we can start with a disease let's say we
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.360
we can start with a disease let's say we
want to think about transplant rejection

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370
want to think about transplant rejection
 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.730
want to think about transplant rejection
you try to think about what's happening

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
you try to think about what's happening
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.609
you try to think about what's happening
in the body in your cells at the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
in the body in your cells at the
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.010
in the body in your cells at the
molecular level that's causing your body

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
molecular level that's causing your body
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.189
molecular level that's causing your body
to say yes I need this organ but I did

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
to say yes I need this organ but I did
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.200
to say yes I need this organ but I did
not make it it's not mine and I want

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
not make it it's not mine and I want
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269
not make it it's not mine and I want
this foreign material out of here and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
this foreign material out of here and
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.220
this foreign material out of here and
you think about what are the proteins

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
you think about what are the proteins
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200
you think about what are the proteins
that are at work why are they doing that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
that are at work why are they doing that
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.380
that are at work why are they doing that
and are there any proteins whose

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
and are there any proteins whose
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.130
and are there any proteins whose
function I can modify or change such

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
function I can modify or change such
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.280
function I can modify or change such
that they don't work to reject this

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
that they don't work to reject this
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410
that they don't work to reject this
organ and so you start brainstorming

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
organ and so you start brainstorming
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.410
organ and so you start brainstorming
you're coming up with ideas what might

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
you're coming up with ideas what might
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.029
you're coming up with ideas what might
be happening you're looking at what's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
be happening you're looking at what's
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920
be happening you're looking at what's
known and trying to think about what a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
known and trying to think about what a
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.580
known and trying to think about what a
what what are the points at which I can

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
what what are the points at which I can
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.639
what what are the points at which I can
go to try to to alter this and to figure

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
go to try to to alter this and to figure
 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.389
go to try to to alter this and to figure
it out so that's where the basic process

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
it out so that's where the basic process
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.649
it out so that's where the basic process
actually begins I'll stay with the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
actually begins I'll stay with the
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.710
actually begins I'll stay with the
transplant rejection example so this was

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
transplant rejection example so this was
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.179
transplant rejection example so this was
an idea that one of our researchers and

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
an idea that one of our researchers and
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.450
an idea that one of our researchers and
immunology came up with now he saw a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
immunology came up with now he saw a
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.530
immunology came up with now he saw a
paper published about skid so skid is an

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
paper published about skid so skid is an
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.020
paper published about skid so skid is an
acronym for severe combined

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
acronym for severe combined
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.050
acronym for severe combined
immunodeficiency syndrome so most people

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
immunodeficiency syndrome so most people
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.569
immunodeficiency syndrome so most people
know it as Bubble Boy disease to bubble

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
know it as Bubble Boy disease to bubble
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.940
know it as Bubble Boy disease to bubble
boy movies John Travolta in the 70s and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
boy movies John Travolta in the 70s and
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.670
boy movies John Travolta in the 70s and
the more recent one and basically what's

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
the more recent one and basically what's
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920
the more recent one and basically what's
happening is that the immune system is

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
happening is that the immune system is
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.969
happening is that the immune system is
not functioning and there was a paper

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
not functioning and there was a paper
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.240
not functioning and there was a paper
published about mice that had the skid

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
published about mice that had the skid
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.480
published about mice that had the skid
disease and he had the idea if your

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
disease and he had the idea if your
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.539
disease and he had the idea if your
immune system is what's at work when

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
immune system is what's at work when
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.420
immune system is what's at work when
you're rejecting an organ and you have

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430
you're rejecting an organ and you have
 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.520
you're rejecting an organ and you have
us disease where the immune system is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
us disease where the immune system is
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.029
us disease where the immune system is
not working and we found out because in

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
not working and we found out because in
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.999
not working and we found out because in
this paper they identified a particular

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
this paper they identified a particular
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.370
this paper they identified a particular
protein that wasn't functioning

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
protein that wasn't functioning
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.860
protein that wasn't functioning
properly in those animals so based on

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
properly in those animals so based on
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.290
properly in those animals so based on
just what we call the phenotype the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300
just what we call the phenotype the
 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.200
just what we call the phenotype the
symptoms of that disease they were able

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210
symptoms of that disease they were able
 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.660
symptoms of that disease they were able
to I'd make a link between that protein

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
to I'd make a link between that protein
 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.600
to I'd make a link between that protein
and that function so he thought can we

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
and that function so he thought can we
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.030
and that function so he thought can we
alter that proteins function in patients

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
alter that proteins function in patients
 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.190
alter that proteins function in patients
who might be receiving transplants to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
who might be receiving transplants to
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.740
who might be receiving transplants to
see if we can help them keep their

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
see if we can help them keep their
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.020
see if we can help them keep their
organs that transplanted organs

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030
organs that transplanted organs
 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.420
organs that transplanted organs
healthier and for a longer period of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
healthier and for a longer period of
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.410
healthier and for a longer period of
time so that's one way an example where

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
time so that's one way an example where
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.810
time so that's one way an example where
that came about it's the combination of

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820
that came about it's the combination of
 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.200
that came about it's the combination of
finding out what's known and thinking

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210
finding out what's known and thinking
 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.900
finding out what's known and thinking
about what's known in new ways you know

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
about what's known in new ways you know
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.450
about what's known in new ways you know
that there's the element of creativity

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460
that there's the element of creativity
 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.740
that there's the element of creativity
you go what if and what comes after is

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
you go what if and what comes after is
 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.170
you go what if and what comes after is
that the light bulb like what if we can

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
that the light bulb like what if we can
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.380
that the light bulb like what if we can
do that

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390
 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.450
you
