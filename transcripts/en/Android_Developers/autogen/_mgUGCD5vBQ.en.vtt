they need to have solved to work in a
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.480
they need to have solved to work in a
reliable fashion so we're gonna actually

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
reliable fashion so we're gonna actually

lot of the classic modes all that kind
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.490
lot of the classic modes all that kind
of stuff and we'll have a look at that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
of stuff and we'll have a look at that
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.589
of stuff and we'll have a look at that
later but that's very much the vein of

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
later but that's very much the vein of
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.050
later but that's very much the vein of
the type of multiplayer games that I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060
the type of multiplayer games that I
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.630
the type of multiplayer games that I
want to be talking about today

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
want to be talking about today
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.930
want to be talking about today
so traditionally how do these kind of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
so traditionally how do these kind of
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.500
so traditionally how do these kind of
games work there are several models for

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
games work there are several models for
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.880
games work there are several models for
how to do this but I want to talk about

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
how to do this but I want to talk about
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.740
how to do this but I want to talk about
one very particular one commonly

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
one very particular one commonly
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.740
one very particular one commonly
referred to as dedicated game servers

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750
referred to as dedicated game servers
 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.910

because it has become one of the most

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920
because it has become one of the most
 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.190
because it has become one of the most
prevalent patterns that is used in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
prevalent patterns that is used in
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.570
prevalent patterns that is used in
especially triple-a large-scale

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580
especially triple-a large-scale
 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.460
especially triple-a large-scale
multiplayer games so what does this look

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470
multiplayer games so what does this look
 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.760
multiplayer games so what does this look
like so you might have say a couple of

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
like so you might have say a couple of
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.520
like so you might have say a couple of
players who are like hey I would like to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
players who are like hey I would like to
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.160
players who are like hey I would like to
play a game so cool they take their game

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
play a game so cool they take their game
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.130
play a game so cool they take their game
clients and they usually connect to some

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
clients and they usually connect to some
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.770
clients and they usually connect to some
kind of matchmaking system so this

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
kind of matchmaking system so this
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.300
kind of matchmaking system so this
matchmaking systems job is to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
matchmaking systems job is to
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.070
matchmaking systems job is to
potentially take maybe hundreds of

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
potentially take maybe hundreds of
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.320
potentially take maybe hundreds of
thousands of players take them all in

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330
thousands of players take them all in
 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.270
thousands of players take them all in
and say okay let's look at things like

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280
and say okay let's look at things like
 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.310
and say okay let's look at things like
maybe their skill rating maybe their

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320
maybe their skill rating maybe their
 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.740
maybe their skill rating maybe their
social graph maybe other aspects of

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
social graph maybe other aspects of
 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.290
social graph maybe other aspects of
their gameplay experience and route them

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
their gameplay experience and route them
 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.600
their gameplay experience and route them
together into a single gameplay like

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610
together into a single gameplay like
 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.820
together into a single gameplay like
group that's gonna be a good experience

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
group that's gonna be a good experience
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.160
group that's gonna be a good experience
right like boopie with people who are

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
right like boopie with people who are
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.530
right like boopie with people who are
like wise in my skill level so it's not

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
like wise in my skill level so it's not
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.630
like wise in my skill level so it's not
an unbalanced matched or if there are

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640
an unbalanced matched or if there are
 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.160
an unbalanced matched or if there are
particular friends that I like playing

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170
particular friends that I like playing
 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.509
particular friends that I like playing
with a lot put them together because

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519
with a lot put them together because
 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.160
with a lot put them together because
that's a really fun experience for me

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
that's a really fun experience for me
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.990
that's a really fun experience for me
and so this is a really interesting

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000
and so this is a really interesting
 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.910
and so this is a really interesting
problem because you do have to process

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920
problem because you do have to process
 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.620
problem because you do have to process
potentially thousands and hundreds of

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630
potentially thousands and hundreds of
 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.410
potentially thousands and hundreds of
thousands of players at once but the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420
thousands of players at once but the
 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.539
thousands of players at once but the
idea being that yeah we let's get a good

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549
idea being that yeah we let's get a good
 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.130

gameplay experience happening between

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
gameplay experience happening between
 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.960
gameplay experience happening between
the players that we have available that

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
the players that we have available that
 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.690
the players that we have available that
are online and waiting to play again so

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700
are online and waiting to play again so
 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.430
are online and waiting to play again so
once we've solved that hard problem cool

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440
once we've solved that hard problem cool
 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.190
once we've solved that hard problem cool
we've grouped together our game our

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200
we've grouped together our game our
 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.620
we've grouped together our game our
players we've got a group we then need

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630
players we've got a group we then need
 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.590
players we've got a group we then need
to create a dedicated game server for

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600
to create a dedicated game server for
 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.870
to create a dedicated game server for
them to play on so this could be a whole

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880
them to play on so this could be a whole
 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.910
them to play on so this could be a whole
talking tour of itself but essentially a

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920
talking tour of itself but essentially a
 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.770
talking tour of itself but essentially a
dedicated game server is a full

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780
dedicated game server is a full
 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.440
dedicated game server is a full
simulation of what happens inside your

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450
simulation of what happens inside your
 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.330
simulation of what happens inside your
game like where your players are what

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340
game like where your players are what
 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.190

they're doing it's a Florida if it tells

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200
they're doing it's a Florida if it tells
 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.479
they're doing it's a Florida if it tells
everything what it is that needs to do

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489
everything what it is that needs to do
 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.840
everything what it is that needs to do
so once we have our players together we

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850
so once we have our players together we
 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.479
so once we have our players together we
need to talk to some sort of dedicated

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489
need to talk to some sort of dedicated
 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.449
need to talk to some sort of dedicated
game server manager system and this

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459
game server manager system and this
 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.310
game server manager system and this
systems job is potentially to talk to

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320
systems job is potentially to talk to
 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.350
systems job is potentially to talk to
thousands upon thousands of machines

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360
thousands upon thousands of machines
 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.449
thousands upon thousands of machines
that are distributed around the world

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459
that are distributed around the world
 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.159
that are distributed around the world
right because we need to have these

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169
right because we need to have these
 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.960
right because we need to have these
machines close to our players because

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970
machines close to our players because
 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.050
machines close to our players because
latency matters matters a lot so we're

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060
latency matters matters a lot so we're
 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.279
latency matters matters a lot so we're
gonna talk to a thousands of machines

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289
gonna talk to a thousands of machines
 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.140

great but if you have

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770
great but if you have
 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.619
great but if you have

can't see - and what we're actually

can't see - and what we're actually
doing is we're looking for groups of 16

00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:19.669
doing is we're looking for groups of 16
 

00:12:19.669 --> 00:12:23.469
doing is we're looking for groups of 16
players and so it's gonna run through

00:12:23.469 --> 00:12:23.479
players and so it's gonna run through

its it's splitting that up essentially

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:25.129
its it's splitting that up essentially

its it's splitting that up essentially
really not the best wrapping there but

00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:27.499
really not the best wrapping there but
 

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:29.139
really not the best wrapping there but
you can see that there we're splitting

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:29.149
you can see that there we're splitting
 

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:31.539
you can see that there we're splitting
it up into teams of 16 and then we have

00:12:31.539 --> 00:12:31.549
it up into teams of 16 and then we have
 

00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:33.159
it up into teams of 16 and then we have
like it splits it up into four poles

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:33.169
like it splits it up into four poles
 

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.389
like it splits it up into four poles

about 26 players per second which is not

about 26 players per second which is not
a lot but we can do better

a lot but we can do better

a lot but we can do better
so let's actually do the same thing but

00:12:55.989 --> 00:12:55.999
so let's actually do the same thing but
 

00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:57.699
so let's actually do the same thing but
let's bump that number up to within

00:12:57.699 --> 00:12:57.709
let's bump that number up to within
 

00:12:57.709 --> 00:13:01.659
let's bump that number up to within

can get through a throughput of more
 

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.720
can get through a throughput of more
like 168 players per second so this is

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:37.730
like 168 players per second so this is
 

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.070
like 168 players per second so this is
how we can start to distribute the

lots of game servers we specify how many
replicas we want and then we specify a

replicas we want and then we specify a
 

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:49.580
replicas we want and then we specify a
game server specification and it's the

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:49.590
game server specification and it's the
 

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.769

job of the fleet to ensure that we have

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:51.779
job of the fleet to ensure that we have
 

00:18:51.779 --> 00:18:54.200

it if one of them falls over or maybe

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220
it if one of them falls over or maybe
 

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.159
it if one of them falls over or maybe
one of them ends we make sure we have

00:18:58.159 --> 00:18:58.169
one of them ends we make sure we have
 

00:18:58.169 --> 00:18:59.810
one of them ends we make sure we have
another one spun up and it keeps them

00:18:59.810 --> 00:18:59.820
another one spun up and it keeps them
 

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.419
another one spun up and it keeps them
alive and healthy so here we have the

00:19:02.419 --> 00:19:02.429
alive and healthy so here we have the
 

00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:04.129
alive and healthy so here we have the
sinaitic game server here and we have

00:19:04.129 --> 00:19:04.139
sinaitic game server here and we have
 

00:19:04.139 --> 00:19:08.720
sinaitic game server here and we have
two replicas of it available now this is

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:08.730
two replicas of it available now this is
 

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.769

can actually show you get pods namespace

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.090
can actually show you get pods namespace
 

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.190
can actually show you get pods namespace
we can now see that we have several

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200
we can now see that we have several
 

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.539
we can now see that we have several
components already just sitting there

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:48.549
components already just sitting there
 

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:49.980
components already just sitting there
these are these are just the pots of a

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:49.990
these are these are just the pots of a
 

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.149
these are these are just the pots of a
bonus we actually really don't care

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159
bonus we actually really don't care
 

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:52.190
bonus we actually really don't care
about them too much

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200
about them too much
 

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.769
about them too much
so let's write let's run let's run a

00:20:55.769 --> 00:20:55.779
so let's write let's run let's run a
 

00:20:55.779 --> 00:20:57.180
so let's write let's run let's run a
stenotic fleet like we just saw earlier

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:57.190
stenotic fleet like we just saw earlier
 

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.720
stenotic fleet like we just saw earlier
right so I can apply - F examples some

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:00.730
right so I can apply - F examples some
 

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.190
right so I can apply - F examples some
not ache okay cool

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200
not ache okay cool
 

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.019
not ache okay cool
so this creates a fleet you know what's

00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:07.029
so this creates a fleet you know what's
 

00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:08.519
so this creates a fleet you know what's
really cool about extending kubernetes

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:08.529
really cool about extending kubernetes
 

00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:10.379
really cool about extending kubernetes
as well is all the extensions go through

00:21:10.379 --> 00:21:10.389
as well is all the extensions go through
 

00:21:10.389 --> 00:21:12.269
as well is all the extensions go through
the API all the way down to the tooling

00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279
the API all the way down to the tooling
 

00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:16.710
the API all the way down to the tooling
so I can now say get fleets and if you

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720
so I can now say get fleets and if you
 

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.480
so I can now say get fleets and if you
show me fleets and will see things like

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:18.490
show me fleets and will see things like
 

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.330
show me fleets and will see things like
oh cool we have two desired awesome so

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:21.340
oh cool we have two desired awesome so
 

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.649
oh cool we have two desired awesome so
we had before and two of them are ready

00:21:22.649 --> 00:21:22.659
we had before and two of them are ready
 

00:21:22.659 --> 00:21:24.450
we had before and two of them are ready
we can also look at them slightly

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:24.460
we can also look at them slightly
 

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.889
we can also look at them slightly
differently we can also say get game

00:21:25.889 --> 00:21:25.899
differently we can also say get game
 

00:21:25.899 --> 00:21:28.739
differently we can also say get game
server right we can see we have two that

00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:28.749
server right we can see we have two that
 

00:21:28.749 --> 00:21:29.940
server right we can see we have two that
are available and ready to go as well

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:29.950
are available and ready to go as well
 

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.100
are available and ready to go as well
that's awesome but to game servers

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.110
that's awesome but to game servers
 

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.509
that's awesome but to game servers
boring let's get more let's scale our

00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:36.519
boring let's get more let's scale our
 

00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:39.430
boring let's get more let's scale our
fleet

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440
 
 

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.230
 
I also don't know if you noticed but I

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240
I also don't know if you noticed but I
 

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.670
I also don't know if you noticed but I
get tab-completion on here too

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:42.680
get tab-completion on here too
 

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.450
get tab-completion on here too
I love this say like 200 games service

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:46.460
I love this say like 200 games service
 

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.950
I love this say like 200 games service
that's way more fun right

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960
that's way more fun right
 

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.830
that's way more fun right
much better number and we can look at

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840
much better number and we can look at
 

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.260
much better number and we can look at
this in a couple of different ways so

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:53.270
this in a couple of different ways so
 

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.730
this in a couple of different ways so
here we have a fleet right we currently

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:54.740
here we have a fleet right we currently
 

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.410
here we have a fleet right we currently
have 200 they're gonna start coming up

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:56.420
have 200 they're gonna start coming up
 

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.340
have 200 they're gonna start coming up
to becoming ready

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:57.350
to becoming ready
 

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.500
to becoming ready
they spin up really quick there we go 57

00:21:59.500 --> 00:21:59.510
they spin up really quick there we go 57
 

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.080
they spin up really quick there we go 57
looking great lovely if we come across

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.090
looking great lovely if we come across
 

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.960
looking great lovely if we come across
to here you can actually also start to

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:04.970
to here you can actually also start to
 

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.520
to here you can actually also start to
see some of the metrics that we have

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:06.530
see some of the metrics that we have
 

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.490
see some of the metrics that we have
available to us as well this usually

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:09.500
available to us as well this usually
 

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.760
available to us as well this usually
runs a little bit behind because it

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:12.770
runs a little bit behind because it
 

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.410
runs a little bit behind because it
pulls every 30 seconds it'll pick up in

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:14.420
pulls every 30 seconds it'll pick up in
 

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.910
pulls every 30 seconds it'll pick up in
a sec but we can start seeing things

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:15.920
a sec but we can start seeing things
 

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.150
a sec but we can start seeing things
like rates 5 how many game servers we

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:19.160
like rates 5 how many game servers we
 

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.340
like rates 5 how many game servers we
have what state they're in count per

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:21.350
have what state they're in count per
 

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.230
have what state they're in count per
type so all those sort of metrics that

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240
type so all those sort of metrics that
 

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.790
type so all those sort of metrics that
you need as well for running game

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:24.800
you need as well for running game
 

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.370
you need as well for running game
servers at scale come bundled in with a

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:27.380

ganas similarly you have similar things

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:29.960
ganas similarly you have similar things
 

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.330
ganas similarly you have similar things
in open match but these are the sort of

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:31.340
in open match but these are the sort of
 

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.190
in open match but these are the sort of
things that you shouldn't have to care

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200
things that you shouldn't have to care
 

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.380
things that you shouldn't have to care
about as a game developer this should

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:35.390
about as a game developer this should
 

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.240
about as a game developer this should
just be stuff that you all need how many

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:37.250
just be stuff that you all need how many
 

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.770
just be stuff that you all need how many
game servers you're running is a

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:38.780
game servers you're running is a
 

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.570
game servers you're running is a
standard metric we should all just have

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:40.580
standard metric we should all just have
 

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.610
standard metric we should all just have
this shouldn't be stuff that you have to

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:42.620
this shouldn't be stuff that you have to
 

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.210
this shouldn't be stuff that you have to
build yourself so we can see all sorts

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:46.220
build yourself so we can see all sorts
 

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.920
build yourself so we can see all sorts
it up and this is just one dashboard out

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:47.930
it up and this is just one dashboard out
 

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.780
it up and this is just one dashboard out
of many dashboards that we have inside

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:49.790
of many dashboards that we have inside
 

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:54.850
of many dashboards that we have inside
Ghana's so we have a look over here ok

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:54.860
Ghana's so we have a look over here ok
 

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.260
Ghana's so we have a look over here ok
so this is actually the the dashboards

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:56.270
so this is actually the the dashboards
 

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.610
so this is actually the the dashboards
running is slightly behind but we can

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:57.620
running is slightly behind but we can
 

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.530
running is slightly behind but we can
see we have 200 ready that's amazing

00:22:59.530 --> 00:22:59.540
see we have 200 ready that's amazing
 

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.480
see we have 200 ready that's amazing
so let's uh let's allocate let's do that

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:01.490
so let's uh let's allocate let's do that
 

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.070
so let's uh let's allocate let's do that
that'll be fun

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080
that'll be fun
 

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.090
that'll be fun
- F examples it's not a game server

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:07.100
- F examples it's not a game server
 

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.010
- F examples it's not a game server
allocation so I would probably normally

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:09.020
allocation so I would probably normally
 

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.170
allocation so I would probably normally
do this through an API like I keep

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:11.180
do this through an API like I keep
 

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.670
do this through an API like I keep
saying I'm gonna do it through the ammo

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:12.680
saying I'm gonna do it through the ammo
 

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.530
saying I'm gonna do it through the ammo
file because that's what we're used to

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:14.540
file because that's what we're used to
 

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.270
file because that's what we're used to
using here and I'm just gonna write - oh

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.280
using here and I'm just gonna write - oh
 

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.620

yeah moles so we can see the response

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:17.630
yeah moles so we can see the response
 

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.830
yeah moles so we can see the response
when it finally finishes so boom okay so

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840
when it finally finishes so boom okay so
 

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.540
when it finally finishes so boom okay so
that's given us an allocated game server

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:22.550
that's given us an allocated game server
 

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.580
that's given us an allocated game server
there's a bunch of stuff up top the bit

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:24.590
there's a bunch of stuff up top the bit
 

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.850
there's a bunch of stuff up top the bit
I really care about here is this write

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:27.860
I really care about here is this write
 

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.400
I really care about here is this write
state allocated we have an IP we have a

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:30.410
state allocated we have an IP we have a
 

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.260
state allocated we have an IP we have a
port we have a game server that's been

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:32.270
port we have a game server that's been
 

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.490
port we have a game server that's been
given to us that's essentially

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:33.500
given to us that's essentially
 

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:40.120
given to us that's essentially
sacrosanct so let's play game so it

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:40.130
sacrosanct so let's play game so it
 

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.330
sacrosanct so let's play game so it
sound like fun yeah this is this is the

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:43.340
sound like fun yeah this is this is the

fun bit all right
 

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.240
fun bit all right
let's plug it let's see if I can type

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:49.250
let's plug it let's see if I can type
 

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.960
let's plug it let's see if I can type
really small things in front of it live

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:52.970
really small things in front of it live
 

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.240
really small things in front of it live

is actually good alright so this is

00:24:01.659 --> 00:24:01.669
is actually good alright so this is
 

00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:03.970
is actually good alright so this is
going to connect to the game server that

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:03.980
going to connect to the game server that
 

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.560
going to connect to the game server that
we basically like we spent up to hundred

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:05.570
we basically like we spent up to hundred
 

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.810
we basically like we spent up to hundred
of these entire entire cluster then we

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:07.820
of these entire entire cluster then we
 

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.580
of these entire entire cluster then we
allocated it and it looked into the

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:09.590
allocated it and it looked into the
 

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.070
allocated it and it looked into the
cluster and was like hey let's let's

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080
cluster and was like hey let's let's
 

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.130
cluster and was like hey let's let's
spin up one of these and then there we

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:15.140
spin up one of these and then there we
 

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.470
spin up one of these and then there we
go I'm gonna play on my trackpad this is

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480
go I'm gonna play on my trackpad this is
 

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.299
go I'm gonna play on my trackpad this is
me playing sonarak on a cluster that's

00:24:19.299 --> 00:24:19.309
me playing sonarak on a cluster that's
 

00:24:19.309 --> 00:24:21.970
me playing sonarak on a cluster that's
running us east or us west one or

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:21.980
running us east or us west one or
 

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.890
running us east or us west one or
another there are some players around

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:23.900
another there are some players around
 

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.169
another there are some players around
here somewhere

00:24:25.169 --> 00:24:25.179
here somewhere
 

00:24:25.179 --> 00:24:27.850
here somewhere
without fail there we go

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:27.860
without fail there we go
 

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.620
without fail there we go
as soon as I play in front of a group of

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:29.630
as soon as I play in front of a group of
 

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:34.200
as soon as I play in front of a group of
people there's never anyone around oh

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.210
 
 

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.580
 
the most important part of this whole

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:36.590
the most important part of this whole
 

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.720
the most important part of this whole
talk really all right cool that was fun

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:40.730
talk really all right cool that was fun
 

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.740
talk really all right cool that was fun
but I actually want to show you some

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:41.750
but I actually want to show you some
 

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.159
but I actually want to show you some
other fun stuff off to um so I'm gonna

00:24:45.159 --> 00:24:45.169
other fun stuff off to um so I'm gonna
 

00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:47.500
other fun stuff off to um so I'm gonna
do let's do a couple more allocations

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:47.510
do let's do a couple more allocations
 

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.700
do let's do a couple more allocations
because I want to show up this is this

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:48.710
because I want to show up this is this
 

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:53.380
because I want to show up this is this
cool so we have we can see here that we

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:53.390
cool so we have we can see here that we
 

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.520
cool so we have we can see here that we
have three game servers that are

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:54.530
have three game servers that are
 

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.710
have three game servers that are
allocated right we essentially have

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720
allocated right we essentially have
 

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.880
allocated right we essentially have
three people three game servers that

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:57.890
three people three game servers that
 

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.159
three people three game servers that
have people playing on it so let's scale

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:00.169
have people playing on it so let's scale
 

00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:01.630
have people playing on it so let's scale
this down we're like actually these game

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:01.640
this down we're like actually these game
 

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.640
this down we're like actually these game
servers we don't like it there's

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:03.650
servers we don't like it there's
 

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.750
servers we don't like it there's
something wrong with it something like

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760
something wrong with it something like
 

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.810
something wrong with it something like
that so let's just say replica 0 like

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:07.820
that so let's just say replica 0 like
 

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.070
that so let's just say replica 0 like
flip the table and just be like we hate

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080
flip the table and just be like we hate
 

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.100
flip the table and just be like we hate
this thing now so that's gonna start

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:12.110
this thing now so that's gonna start
 

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.460
this thing now so that's gonna start
scaling that down but we're always gonna

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:15.470
scaling that down but we're always gonna
 

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.620
scaling that down but we're always gonna
see that those three allocated servers

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:17.630
see that those three allocated servers
 

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.409
see that those three allocated servers
always stay there this is what like

00:25:20.409 --> 00:25:20.419
always stay there this is what like
 

00:25:20.419 --> 00:25:21.909
always stay there this is what like
organized does a whole bunch of stuff

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919
organized does a whole bunch of stuff
 

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:23.200
organized does a whole bunch of stuff
but this I think it's like one of the

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:23.210
but this I think it's like one of the
 

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.600
but this I think it's like one of the
core basic things that it understands is

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:25.610
core basic things that it understands is
 

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.169
core basic things that it understands is
that while we might have a variety of

00:25:29.169 --> 00:25:29.179
that while we might have a variety of
 

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:30.820
that while we might have a variety of
these being shut down we don't touch

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:30.830
these being shut down we don't touch
 

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.799
these being shut down we don't touch
allocated game servers super super

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:32.809
allocated game servers super super
 

00:25:32.809 --> 00:25:34.570
allocated game servers super super
important we don't interrupt player

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:34.580
important we don't interrupt player
 

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.390
important we don't interrupt player
playing a game don't ever do it it's bad

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:37.400
playing a game don't ever do it it's bad
 

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.480
playing a game don't ever do it it's bad
bad bad bad bad bad

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:39.490
bad bad bad bad bad
 

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.549
bad bad bad bad bad
so lots and lots of fun so that's yeah

00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559
so lots and lots of fun so that's yeah
 

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:43.840
so lots and lots of fun so that's yeah
so if we actually run that again there

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:43.850
so if we actually run that again there
 

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.520
so if we actually run that again there
we are so we still always will see those

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:45.530
we are so we still always will see those
 

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.470
we are so we still always will see those
allocated game servers until the players

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480
allocated game servers until the players
 

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.150
allocated game servers until the players
finish playing their games and those

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:49.160
finish playing their games and those
 

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.430
finish playing their games and those
game servers self shutdown very

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440
game servers self shutdown very
 

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.100
game servers self shutdown very
important stuff cool we go back to

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:54.110
important stuff cool we go back to
 

00:25:54.110 --> 00:26:00.820
important stuff cool we go back to
slides please excellent wonderful okay

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:00.830
slides please excellent wonderful okay
 

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:06.299
slides please excellent wonderful okay
so things are always better with friends

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:06.309
so things are always better with friends
 

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:09.190
so things are always better with friends
so let's see if we can make this work

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200
so let's see if we can make this work
 

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:16.840
so let's see if we can make this work
together so we do have stuff wherein we

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:16.850
together so we do have stuff wherein we
 

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:21.610
together so we do have stuff wherein we
can make these talk to each other so

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:21.620
can make these talk to each other so
 

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.930
can make these talk to each other so
what we can do is we can install

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:22.940
what we can do is we can install
 

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.690
what we can do is we can install
basically what we commonly refer to as a

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:25.700
basically what we commonly refer to as a
 

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.760
basically what we commonly refer to as a
director or basically blue code between

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:27.770
director or basically blue code between
 

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.010
director or basically blue code between
open match and a game server scalar

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:30.020
open match and a game server scalar
 

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.860
open match and a game server scalar
which can be custom if you so desire so

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:32.870
which can be custom if you so desire so
 

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.350
which can be custom if you so desire so
that a matchmaker can take the things in

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360
that a matchmaker can take the things in
 

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.030
that a matchmaker can take the things in
open match right you run your custom

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:37.040
open match right you run your custom
 

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.280
open match right you run your custom
match logic there it can talk to our

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:39.290
match logic there it can talk to our
 

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.470
match logic there it can talk to our
ganas and be like hey I've got players

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480
ganas and be like hey I've got players
 

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.360
ganas and be like hey I've got players
let's um action I can make a game and

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:43.370
let's um action I can make a game and
 

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.880
let's um action I can make a game and
then that game server can be marked as

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:45.890
then that game server can be marked as
 

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.919
then that game server can be marked as
allocated those players can then play

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:47.929
allocated those players can then play
 

00:26:47.929 --> 00:26:50.020
allocated those players can then play
that game and continue on and have a

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:50.030
that game and continue on and have a
 

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:54.700
that game and continue on and have a
really good time so one slide went back

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:54.710
really good time so one slide went back
 

00:26:54.710 --> 00:27:00.669
really good time so one slide went back
to demo fund so in in cooking show

00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679
to demo fund so in in cooking show
 

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:03.990
to demo fund so in in cooking show
parlance here's one I prepared earlier

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000
parlance here's one I prepared earlier
 

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.090
parlance here's one I prepared earlier
so I already have that's you know what I

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:10.100
so I already have that's you know what I
 

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.430
so I already have that's you know what I
want is all I already have open match

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440
want is all I already have open match
 

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.049
want is all I already have open match
installed I have a gun is installed

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:14.059
installed I have a gun is installed
 

00:27:14.059 --> 00:27:16.450
installed I have a gun is installed
there's a bunch of stuff already in this

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:16.460
there's a bunch of stuff already in this
 

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.520
there's a bunch of stuff already in this
cluster but what we're going to do is

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:18.530
cluster but what we're going to do is
 

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:21.909
cluster but what we're going to do is
we're going to create that fleet like we

00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919
we're going to create that fleet like we
 

00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:27.419
we're going to create that fleet like we
saw previously

00:27:27.419 --> 00:27:27.429
 
 

00:27:27.429 --> 00:27:29.700
 
so that's gonna create a fleet for us of

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:29.710
so that's gonna create a fleet for us of
 

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.279
so that's gonna create a fleet for us of
a really simple game server it literally

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:32.289
a really simple game server it literally
 

00:27:32.289 --> 00:27:34.379
a really simple game server it literally
just takes a UDP packet with some text

00:27:34.379 --> 00:27:34.389
just takes a UDP packet with some text
 

00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:36.810
just takes a UDP packet with some text
in it and it spits out a log that's like

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:36.820
in it and it spits out a log that's like
 

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.519
in it and it spits out a log that's like
I know stenotic is like super exciting

00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:38.529
I know stenotic is like super exciting
 

00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:40.709
I know stenotic is like super exciting
but this is like just very simple for

00:27:40.709 --> 00:27:40.719
but this is like just very simple for
 

00:27:40.719 --> 00:27:42.779
but this is like just very simple for
