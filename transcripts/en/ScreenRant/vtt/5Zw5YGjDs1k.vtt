00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.380
Everyone knows that Hollywood’s built on
powerful personalities, and you can’t be

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.670
a movie star without a bit of an ego, but
you’d be surprised to learn how many famous

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.240
screen teams downright hated eachother.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.320

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.890
video with a friend whose mind would be blown
by 10 Actor Feuds You would Never Imagine

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:30.759
Happening.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.650
Jim Carrey vs Tommy Lee Jones

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.420
Both the Riddler and Two-Face were out of
control as the villains of Batman Forever,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.210
so you would think they’d get along off
set, too.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.550
But Jim Carrey tells the story of running
into Tommy Lee Jones at a restaurant while

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.230
filming, and seeing the elder actor’s face
drain of color.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.390
Carrey was confused, but Jones explained,
saying he hated his co-star, since he could

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.539
not “sanction his buffoonery.”

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.050
At least he said it to his face..?

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.730
Channing Tatum vs Alex Pettyfer

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.520
Audiences knew that Channing Tatum was the
star of Magic Mike, but his on-screen protégé

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.500
Alex Pettyfer had a different idea.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.140
Tatum was against casting the actor due to
his bad boy reputation, since he’d put his

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.690
own money into the film – and turned out
to be right.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.290
Pettyfer has since admitted that he could’ve
been more respectful, but when he screwed

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.500
one of Tatum’s friends out of four months’
rent before the film’s reshoots, this feud

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.290
was set in stone – no surprise, Pettyfer
wasn’t invited back for the sequel.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.770
Bill Murray vs Chevy Chase

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.260
Believe it or not, these two comedy legends
only appeared together in a single film – Caddyshack.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.750
Which is why director Harold Ramis panicked
when he realized the two never had a scene

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.790
together – but it was for a good reason.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.509
Chevy Chase and Bill Murray had a feud going
all the way back to their Saturday Night Live

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.759
days, but both bit the bullet while filming
their scene – written completely on the

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.280
spot, which is why it’s completely separate
from the rest of the movie.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.869
Brad Pitt vs Harrison Ford

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.210
The Devil’s Own may not be remembered as
a Hollywood classic, but the production was

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.549
messy on a truly uncommon level.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.240
Before it was even decided if the movie was
going to focus on Harrison Ford or Brad Pitt,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.710
it entered production, meaning the director,
the stars, and the studio were at odds.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.400
Creative disputes over who would be the bad
guy in the end led to delays, rewrites, and

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.400
budget troubles.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.479
Pitt made his concerns well known at the time,
and Harrison Ford later admitted that even

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.300
in the best case, he and his younger co-star
would have little in common.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.150
C3PO vs. R2D2

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.790
They may be the dynamic duo of the Star Wars
universe, but Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.340
the actors inside the actual droids downright
hated eachother.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.992
The two rarely spoke to one another on set
for obvious reasons, but the feud hit a new

00:02:22.992 --> 00:02:27.210
level when Daniels claimed he was the real
star of the twosome, and that R2-D2 could’ve

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.310
been a bucket, and no one would’ve cared.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.220
Baker was rightly offended, but would later
say that once he realized Daniels treated

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.120
everyone that way, it was an easier pill to
swallow.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.820
Gillian Anderson vs David Duchovny

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.280
The duo of Fox Mulder and Dane Scully made
the X-Files a household name, with their chemistry

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.270
and opposing personalities the main reason
for the success.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.430
So fans would never have guessed that the
two actually couldn’t stand eachother by

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.450
the end of their run.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.360
Both Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny admit
that spending so much time with one person

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.590
can drive any relationship apart, and Anderson’s
struggle for equal pay behind the scenes couldn’t

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.590
have helped.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.560
Thankfully, their rivalry eventually turned
to friendship, with the two as close as siblings

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560
today.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.090
Nathan Fillion vs Stana Katic

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.450
The ABC series relied on the undeniable charm
of Nathan Fillion to succeed, with his leading

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.870
lady Stana Katic unable to resist.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.400
Over Castle’s run, the two heroes would
grow close, and even marry – but behind

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.200
the scenes, things weren’t so sunny.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.480
Rumors of a rift between the two leads started
early, but eventually proved true.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.440
It’s impossible to say that the two actually
disliked working together, but the final season

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.420
split their characters apart – and another
season was planned without Katic, before the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.810
show was completely canceled.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.170
The truth really is stranger than fiction.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.610
Shia LaBeouf vs Tom Hardy

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.320
Controversy tends to follow Shia LaBeouf wherever
he goes, so rumors that he had gotten into

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.230
a fight with his co-star Tom Hardy on the
set of Lawless were easy to believe.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.061
To stay in character as a bootlegger, LaBeouf
got a little familiar with moonshine, which

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.960
may have convinced him that picking a fight
with Hardy was a good idea – and later bragging

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.350
that he put Hardy in his place.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.581
It was Hardy who got the last laugh, though,
claiming LaBeouf was terrifyingly scary, and

00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.130
a “bad, bad boy” – to a room full of
laughing reporters.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.080
Wesley Snipes vs Everybody

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.410
Before Wesley Snipes ran into trouble with
the IRS, he was causing it as the star of

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.410
the Blade trilogy.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.440
Stories from the set describe Snipes as a
diva, angry and suspicious that Ryan Reynolds

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.850
was being given better lines, or that his
director, David S. Goyer, was a racist.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.079
Reynolds and his co-stars wound up filming
most of their roles without Snipes present,

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.480
which turned out to be better for the film’s
comedy.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480
As for Goyer?

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.510
He pretended to hire a local biker gang as
security, which put his star’s antics – and

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.000
calls to the studio to have him replaced – to
an end.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.150
The Rock vs Vin Diesel

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.780
Fans may have thought that Fast &amp; Furious
stars Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson only started

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.940
as enemies in front of the camera, but it
seems truer than most realized.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.600
When his last week of filming the eighth installment
kicked off, The Rock took to social media

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.230
to thank his female co-stars – and call
out the men who’d shown themselves to be

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.680
“unprofessional candy asses.”

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.310
It didn’t take long for people to realize
it was star Vin Diesel he was referring to,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.310
promising that the anger and boiling blood
in their scenes wasn’t entirely an act.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.400
Those are the best-known feuds and on-set
rivalries we can name, but which ones have

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.400
we missed?
