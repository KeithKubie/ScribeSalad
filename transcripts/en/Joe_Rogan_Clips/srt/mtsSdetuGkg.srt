1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,490
When you work out your shit. Now I've seen
you at the comedy store, but only once.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,300
Where, where do you work out your shit?
I like to go to random comedy clubs.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,250
You know, I think I'd go to
New York first. Uh, New York
has always been, uh, a home,

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,670
um, when it comes to building, uh,

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,660
putting some structure within a set
that you're trying to figure out.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,400
Once I got a skeleton of what I want
to do, I've just go to West Palm.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,670
Uh, I love that comedy club, the
Improv down there, and I'll stay,

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,290
I'll stay for two weeks. Oh real. And
just go and run through some jokes.

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:38,190
I'll go to Utah.
I'll go to Denver.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,520
Who Do like wiseguys. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. I'll go to comedy clubs.

11
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,620
Just random comedy clubs that
you would expect to see me yet.

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,540
But I'll do a hell of a run.

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,990
And the goal is to get out of
there with just a foundation.

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,280
It's not to have a complete set.
I just want to get a foundation.

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,930
So when I'm done getting the foundation,
then I'll do a little comedy club run.

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,030
I'll do a full comedy club run where I
just put two or three months in and it's

17
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:06,870
come to club comedy club comedy club
and I'm doing seven shows a weekend and

18
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,460
people were shocked that
I'm there and that I'm doing
it, but you know, that's my,

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,380
that's my gym.
That's how I work.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,440
And I ended up leaving that period of
time with a complete set after the first

21
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,930
three or four months that I
spent now after the comedy club,

22
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,200
three to four months don't that run.
Then I'll take it to like a small theater.

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,260
I'll see what my laugh to feels like in
the small theater and I'll do a little

24
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,430
run in small theaters.

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,790
And then when I finally feel like it's
at a point where I'm getting the laugh

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,060
consistently and the punch lines of
working and I flipped it back front,

27
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:39,690
what's forward?

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,690
Every direction and my story is a real
roller coaster and it has an ending where

29
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:48,450
I feel like we get off the roller coaster
and we're happy and you don't feel

30
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,650
like you were there for an hour.

31
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,700
Then when I go test it out in
that arena and if they arena,

32
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:57,210
if the last or sounds the
way it's supposed to, then
I'll say, okay, I'm ready.

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,073
If it doesn't,

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,770
then I'll go back to small theaters
and then I'll go to an arena again.

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,430
So not to that arena sounds
the way it's supposed to do.

36
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,190
I say I'm going on a tour,
so sometimes it takes me about a year,

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,520
a year and three months, a
year and four months. You know,

38
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:15,330
people don't understand how hard it is
to develop an hour of standup material.

39
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,910
You know? People act like you
just turn on a new hour. It's,

40
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,850
it's an hour to get to an hour.

41
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:25,080
You're going through four to five hours
of bullshit that you thought was funny.

42
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,770
Yeah. To come up to that
hour that you finally say,

43
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,890
this is going to be the
representation of me this year. Yeah.

44
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,280
It's a lot for me to do that, especially
at this level, you know? Well,

45
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:38,400
especially while you're always doing
movies and you're always busy with a bunch

46
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:42,270
of other stuff to stuff that you don't
love me. You don't take any breaks.

47
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,800
Why tour? I actually, you know, when
I'm touring, if there's a movie,

48
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:50,280
I make the movie schedule around
a tourist, so my shooting days,

49
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:53,340
we'll go Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday rep,

50
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,990
Thursday maybe ever show Thursday night,
and then I'm going Thursday,

51
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:01,690
Friday, Saturday, sometimes no
show Sunday, sometimes show Sunday,

52
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:04,960
depending on what the work schedule
and the workload for the following week

53
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:09,280
would look like. So I'm implementing
that in, so when I say I'm out, I'm out,

54
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,070
I'm gone.
Yeah.

55
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,950
So I've knocked that movie out in two
months and then when I'm not that tour

56
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,480
scheduled shifts. So the Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, dedicated to family,

57
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,330
dedicated to the office, everything.
Then those weekends or tour.

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,390
But the tour lasts for a year and a half.

59
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,010
I mean this year we did 157 shows
on my air responsible tour. Wow.

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,520
Hundred and 57 show before you decided
to put it on the Netflix special. Yeah,

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,590
we did the Netflix. The taping. I think
I did it three weeks before we were done,

62
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:42,040
so we probably had 143 shows.
Oh Wow.

63
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,750
Then I taped it and finished the tour.

64
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,630
Did you always have this kind
of structure? Like when did you,

65
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,340
how did you design this thought out
individually? Yeah. You seem like I am a,

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,800
I may well thought out
individually random. No,

67
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,910
everything is planned.
If you look at all my standup specials,

68
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,470
there's a two year gap in between them.

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,910
So the two year gap is because
at the end of that second year,

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,020
my new special should be coming out
when a new special should be coming out.

71
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,410
I'm now focusing on what the
next special is going to be.

72
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,660
So that first year is all development.
Like right now I'm off,

73
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,680
I'm not touring,

74
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:23,010
but now I'm mentally in the gym and
throwing all the old stuff that I talked

75
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,160
about away that's now thrown out.
Can't repeat it, can't say it.

76
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,270
Now it's talking about with the new
version of myself is going to be,

77
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,460
what do I want the conversation to be?
What's my thinking and just taking notes.

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,990
So eventually now I'm going to start just
popping up at random comedy clubs and

79
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,580
trying to figure out
what the next thing is.

80
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,580
So by mid mid 20 I'll probably
be doing comedy clubs.

81
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:53,100
By the end of 20,
I should have a full fledge concept.

82
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,040
Did that new hour.

83
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,970
And by the beginning of 21 I should
be ready to go out with my new hour.

84
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,370
End of 21 film.

85
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:03,730
I knew our mid 20 to
that hour would come out.

86
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,460
That seems like a schedule a
lot of people are doing now.

87
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:09,540
The two years scheduled. It's a
perfect get. Yeah. That's how I do.

88
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,570
I know Louis Ck did a year every
year in George Carlin did every year.

89
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,200
But I think even he said that really
wasn't the right way. That's tough.

90
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,850
A year's tough. Yeah. I mean
that's a, that's a shouts
out to those that can do it.

91
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,040
I think that's amazing.
Um,

92
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,810
I think just for everything that I have
going on and all of the different things

93
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:31,360
that my hands are in within the brand,
the business,

94
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,550
I need to make sure that I'm giving
100% to those things so they have the

95
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:41,110
highest opportunity to be successful.
If I'm trying to cheat it,

96
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,390
then it's going to show you it's not going
to come out to the best of my ability

97
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,960
and will then stand up. You gotta you
gotta fucking magnifying glass on you.

98
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,820
You know, you're always being judged
off of what you did at one point,

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,320
just like a musician,

100
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,350
you're always off of the album that
everybody thought was whatever.

101
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,780
So the biggest thing for an entertainer,
artists, whatever your craft is,

102
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,160
his creation,
how you recreating yourself,

103
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,590
how are you constantly
showing that you're growing.
