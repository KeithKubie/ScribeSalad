00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:03.210
- You gotta see the, like, caramelized

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.379
edges of that squid; it is a
beautiful, beautiful thing.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.931
This looks unbelievably good;

00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:11.870
a big plate of grilled
squid, a giant squid.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.453
That squid is huge.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.132
(upbeat pop music)

00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:23.903
Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens,

00:00:23.903 --> 00:00:25.893
in Phnom Penh, Cambodia,

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:29.729
and today, I'm taking you
on a street food tour,

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.688
Cambodian street food tour, in Phnom Penh.

00:00:31.688 --> 00:00:33.767
And, we're gonna start by
going to central market,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.710
so we are in the back of a tuk tuk,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.136
which is one of the best,
and the easiest ways

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.719
to get around Phnom Penh.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.118
Hanging out with Micah, and Ying,

00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:45.105
and my buddy Joel came along on this trip.

00:00:45.105 --> 00:00:46.606
- What's up, everyone?
- So, we're on our way

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:48.569
to central market first, which is

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.359
one of the central landmarks of the city,

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:51.214
and it's a big market.

00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:53.685
It's actually called the new market.

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:56.602
(upbeat pop music)

00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:06.067
Known for its pastel
yellow-colored dome structure,

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:09.115
Phnom Penh's central market
is a landmark of the city.

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:11.448
Inside, you'll find a
collection of mostly jewelry

00:01:11.448 --> 00:01:14.056
and souvenir shops, but
the beauty of the market

00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:16.727
for you and I, as food
lovers, is the open-air

00:01:16.727 --> 00:01:19.630
outdoor section, where you'll
find a fresh wet market, and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.477
an incredible food court where
you could spend hours eating.

00:01:23.477 --> 00:01:25.425
Oh, look at these crabs.

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:29.702
Wow, the pinchers-to-body
ratio is fantastic.

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:32.897
There is an abundance
of things to walk around

00:01:32.897 --> 00:01:34.814
and see at this market.

00:01:41.232 --> 00:01:42.994
The fresh ingredients, and the wet market,

00:01:42.994 --> 00:01:45.129
is fantastic to walk around and see,

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:48.099
but right next to the wet
market is a little food court,

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:50.738
where you can get pre-made food, and this

00:01:50.738 --> 00:01:52.580
is the section that you're
gonna wanna come to,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.247
to come check out the
food and start eating.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.440
To begin with, we sat down at a stall

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.397
for a quick bowl of Bún Riêu,

00:02:02.397 --> 00:02:04.605
a crab noodle dish with rice vermicelli,

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:07.110
shredded vegetables, and crab meatballs,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.630
all submerged in a fragrant,
orange-colored broth.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.510
It's not assembled until you order it,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.105
and it comes to you piping
hot, and utterly attractive.

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:18.232
And, I had it in Vietnam
a couple of times,

00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:20.791
and it's delicious, so
I had to sit down to,

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.421
and we're gonna try this first.

00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:24.883
And also, just the
beautiful display of food.

00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:27.151
It's like a little pyramid
of different ingredients,

00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:28.521
the different noodles.

00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:30.414
I think they serve a number
of different types of noodles

00:02:30.414 --> 00:02:32.345
at this stall too, because
they have some other

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:35.219
boiled chickens, and those ovary eggs,

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.662
which look amazing too.

00:02:36.662 --> 00:02:38.688
But, we went with the Bún Riêu.

00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:40.350
There has to be like a
dozen different sauces

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.698
sitting before me, right
here on this table.

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:45.868
I'm not exactly sure which sauce to add.

00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:47.155
I'm gonna ask her.

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:49.465
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:50.342
Okay.

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:52.058
Alright, I just asked.

00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:54.015
- More interesting--
- This is the sauce to add.

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:54.848
Okay.

00:02:54.848 --> 00:02:56.840
One of the most notable
features of this bowl of noodles

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.964
is that it's an orange-colored broth.

00:02:59.964 --> 00:03:02.132
Look at the color of that broth.

00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:04.046
And then below here, there's noodles,

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.911
there's some fish cake,

00:03:05.911 --> 00:03:07.766
I think two types of fish cake.

00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:10.306
This is some sweet basil,
there's some okra in here,

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:13.652
and these are the chunks
of crab, I believe.

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:16.839
And then, there's also tomato,
there's tomato in here,

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:20.047
blood lump, and then sweet basil on top.

00:03:20.047 --> 00:03:22.880
Let's just first taste this broth.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.493
Oh, yeah.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.896
Oh, it's crabby.

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:31.024
Oh, that's what I remember.

00:03:31.024 --> 00:03:32.517
It's a very light broth.

00:03:32.517 --> 00:03:34.092
- For having that much stuff in the soup,

00:03:34.092 --> 00:03:35.840
it's surprisingly clean.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.038
The broth is awesome.

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:39.838
- I think this is the shrimp
paste, or the crab paste.

00:03:39.838 --> 00:03:41.964
I'm gonna go in for some of this.

00:03:41.964 --> 00:03:43.152
Alright, that should be good, and then

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:44.804
I gotta go in for some chilis as well.

00:03:44.804 --> 00:03:47.880
- Tamarind, always interesting.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.856
- Sprinkle on a few chilis on here.

00:03:49.856 --> 00:03:51.767
Oh yeah, and tamarind;

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:53.767
I think that is tamarind sauce.

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.246
Yeah, 'cause you can
see those tamarind seeds

00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:56.914
in there, as well.

00:03:56.914 --> 00:03:58.981
There's noodles on the
top, and even under here

00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:00.925
there's all these vegetables,
the morning glory,

00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:02.089
the shredded morning glory,

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.381
and the shredded vegetables down there.

00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:07.345
What a beautiful bowl of noodles this is.

00:04:07.345 --> 00:04:09.820
Alright, going in for some basil.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.570
- [Joel] Some pickled ginger too.

00:04:17.578 --> 00:04:21.450
- I like it with that added
shrimp paste, tamarind, chilis.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.110
The crab flavor is so soothing.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.040
I wanna grab that chunk,
which I think is crab roe,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.280
some type of crab roe mixed with,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.530
maybe mixed with something.

00:04:36.617 --> 00:04:38.810
Oh, that's awesome!

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.003
Oh, that's like a crab meatball.

00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:43.329
- [Joel] It's so rich.

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:45.533
- I forgot to mention,
there's even a pork chunk,

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:48.458
which I think is a pork knuckle.

00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:50.752
It looks a little bit gelatinous.

00:04:50.752 --> 00:04:52.268
But, there's so many things going on,

00:04:52.268 --> 00:04:55.478
but I think the gem of the
bowl is that crab meatball.

00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:57.981
That is just delicious.

00:04:57.981 --> 00:04:58.898
Okay, okra.

00:05:02.973 --> 00:05:05.236
The only thing I might do,
because I'm a little bit

00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:07.268
obsessed with chilis, 'cause I think

00:05:07.268 --> 00:05:11.018
I'll reach in for some
of this crushed chili.

00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:16.937
Alright, and give this a whirl.

00:05:16.937 --> 00:05:18.786
I think I will be ready to just devour

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:22.703
the rest of this bowl of
noodles, on that note.

00:05:28.288 --> 00:05:29.121
Mmm!

00:05:30.393 --> 00:05:32.703
That crab meatball is where it's at.

00:05:32.703 --> 00:05:36.870
That is the ultimate bite
of this bowl of noodles.

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:39.776
Finished with that bowl of noodles,

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:41.536
and the combination of those chilis,

00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:43.198
plus the hot broth,

00:05:43.198 --> 00:05:46.916
in this market food court
that has zero air flow,

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:47.949
I'm just dripping.

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.866
You can see my arm just glistening.

00:05:51.827 --> 00:05:54.130
How's that sweat?
- I feel like I just showered.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.995
- That was a properly
good bowl of noodles.

00:05:55.995 --> 00:05:58.664
All the different flavors,
that was delicious.

00:05:58.664 --> 00:06:02.649
And, we are now walking down the market.

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:04.649
This is a squid section.

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:06.562
Okay.

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:15.203
We saw the gigantic squid,

00:06:15.203 --> 00:06:17.947
and Ying loves squid, I love squid,

00:06:17.947 --> 00:06:19.543
so there was no way we could pass this up

00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:21.519
without trying one of these giant squid.

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:23.538
And, she has them pre-grilled over here,

00:06:23.538 --> 00:06:25.788
but then she's grilling more, and then

00:06:25.788 --> 00:06:27.349
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.185
as you order it, she drops
it back on the hot coals,

00:06:31.185 --> 00:06:33.907
and it's really hot; I can feel the flames

00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:35.330
coming off of those charcoal.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.543
We're about to eat a giant squid.

00:06:37.543 --> 00:06:41.120
You gotta see the, like, caramelized edges

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.671
of that squid, it is a
beautiful, beautiful thing.

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:46.387
And then, as she was
grilling it, she brushed on

00:06:46.387 --> 00:06:48.168
some kind of a fragrant oil as well,

00:06:48.168 --> 00:06:51.893
so that also increased,
probably, the crispiness of it.

00:06:51.893 --> 00:06:54.139
And then, as soon as it was ready,

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.260
then she chopped it
into bite-sized pieces,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.995
and then I didn't know
she was gonna do this,

00:06:57.995 --> 00:07:01.812
but they applied a beautiful oil

00:07:01.812 --> 00:07:03.848
with, I can see fried garlic in there

00:07:03.848 --> 00:07:06.152
as well as green onions,
chopped up in there,

00:07:06.152 --> 00:07:09.144
that they just lathered
on top of the squid.

00:07:09.144 --> 00:07:12.329
What a wonderful addition
to finish it off.

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:14.760
And then it's served
with a plate of veggies;

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.314
there's some green tomatoes on there,

00:07:16.314 --> 00:07:19.240
there's cucumber, and then the herb there,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.593
I think it's mostly culantro,
which is also known as

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:25.297
saw-toothed herb, and then I think

00:07:25.297 --> 00:07:26.905
there's some Vietnamese
coriander in there as well.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.299
And then it's served with a dipping sauce.

00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:29.703
This looks unbelievably good,

00:07:29.703 --> 00:07:33.018
a big plate of grilled
squid, a giant squid.

00:07:33.018 --> 00:07:34.604
That squid is huge!

00:07:34.604 --> 00:07:37.342
Okay, I'm going with
this piece right here,

00:07:37.342 --> 00:07:38.759
on the top there.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.413
Mmm!

00:07:46.712 --> 00:07:50.879
Oh, the tenderness of
that squid is ridiculous.

00:07:51.946 --> 00:07:54.353
Oh, and it's perfectly salty.

00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:58.520
It's so fragrant with, I think
they're shallots actually.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.218
I think that might be shallot
oil, fried shallot oil.

00:08:03.218 --> 00:08:07.040
It's so fragrant; the
texture of that squid

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.857
is so soft, and so tender,

00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:14.395
and it's not rubbery whatsoever.

00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:16.145
It is awesomely good.

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:22.081
The sauce is good too, but actually,

00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:24.634
I barely even noticed the
difference of that sauce

00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.367
to that fragrant oil that's already

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:27.665
applied all over it.

00:08:27.665 --> 00:08:31.035
And, I'm gonna follow this
bite with a green tomato,

00:08:31.035 --> 00:08:33.702
and poke up some of those herbs.

00:08:37.632 --> 00:08:40.439
That just is a complete

00:08:40.439 --> 00:08:43.690
refreshing jolt in your
mouth, with those herbs.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.034
We just finished off
that squid, without even

00:08:46.034 --> 00:08:47.666
talking to each other.

00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:50.126
That was one of the better pieces of squid

00:08:50.126 --> 00:08:52.276
that I've ever had in my
life, and that was giant.

00:08:52.276 --> 00:08:54.466
Incredibly good, and I think
what they did is that they

00:08:54.466 --> 00:08:56.409
just cooked it perfectly.

00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:58.168
They grilled it so it wasn't over-cooked.

00:08:58.168 --> 00:09:00.277
If you get over-cooked
squid it can be all rubbery,

00:09:00.277 --> 00:09:02.467
and not very good, but that was,

00:09:02.467 --> 00:09:05.263
I was even trying to
like imagine in my head

00:09:05.263 --> 00:09:06.819
what kind of texture that is.

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:11.180
It's almost like a chicken
thigh, or the dark chicken meat,

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.724
but more silky.

00:09:12.724 --> 00:09:15.332
That was a treat, a real squid treat,

00:09:15.332 --> 00:09:17.550
and if you come to this
market, if you love squid,

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.250
that's something you should consider

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.340
eating, immediately, as you arrive here.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.015
Next step, we are stopping
for something refreshing

00:09:25.015 --> 00:09:26.912
to cool down, and they have

00:09:26.912 --> 00:09:28.916
lots of fruit shake stands all over.

00:09:28.916 --> 00:09:30.574
We got an avocado shake, with

00:09:30.574 --> 00:09:32.765
a little something special inside.

00:09:32.765 --> 00:09:35.019
This little special
ingredient, that is along

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:38.669
with the avocado in this
shake, you can just smell it

00:09:38.669 --> 00:09:40.525
within the humidity of this market,

00:09:40.525 --> 00:09:42.804
and it's one of my, well, it is definitely

00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:45.105
my favorite fruit, the king of fruits,

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:46.571
I'm talking about durian.

00:09:46.571 --> 00:09:50.738
So, this is a combination
of avocado and durian shake.

00:09:52.005 --> 00:09:53.588
Whoa, that's thick!

00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:03.536
Wow!

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:08.157
The thickness of that; it's so creamy.

00:10:08.157 --> 00:10:10.168
That's like cream on top of cream.

00:10:10.168 --> 00:10:11.849
The avocado and the durian,

00:10:11.849 --> 00:10:15.229
and then it's like, it's very, very smooth

00:10:15.229 --> 00:10:17.595
from the avocado, but
then you've got that,

00:10:17.595 --> 00:10:19.698
yeah, the durian just dominates

00:10:19.698 --> 00:10:22.551
in the flavor department,
it just takes over.

00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:25.523
It's so thick, rather than
being like a drinkable smoothie.

00:10:25.523 --> 00:10:27.302
It's like a pudding that you almost

00:10:27.302 --> 00:10:29.552
need to use a spoon to eat.

00:10:34.114 --> 00:10:36.328
You almost can't do it with a straw.

00:10:36.328 --> 00:10:38.187
There's a popular Cambodian
street food snack,

00:10:38.187 --> 00:10:39.708
and you see it surrounding the market,

00:10:39.708 --> 00:10:41.415
and you see it all over Phnom Penh.

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:43.379
And, they have it right over here.

00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:46.058
I'm gonna go taste it for the first time.

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:47.946
Wow, there's a couple different types.

00:10:47.946 --> 00:10:50.928
Clams, this one, or what is this one?

00:10:50.928 --> 00:10:53.845
What's the difference between them?

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:56.882
This one is spicy.

00:10:56.882 --> 00:10:58.155
- [Man] Yeah.

00:10:58.155 --> 00:10:59.356
- [Mark] This one looks the most spicy,

00:10:59.356 --> 00:11:01.105
because it has the chilis
ground up in there.

00:11:01.105 --> 00:11:02.226
This one--

00:11:02.226 --> 00:11:03.880
- [Man] Oyster Cambodia.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.973
- Cambodian oysters.
(laughing)

00:11:06.973 --> 00:11:09.356
They have a couple of different clams,

00:11:09.356 --> 00:11:12.171
and I think they're sun-cured;
they dry it in the sun.

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:13.889
And then, they're also salt-cured;

00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:15.907
they're just coated in salt.

00:11:15.907 --> 00:11:17.040
This one?
- Yeah.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.873
- Alright.

00:11:17.873 --> 00:11:21.322
Can we please have one can of this one?

00:11:21.322 --> 00:11:23.068
I'm gonna see if he can
show me how to eat it,

00:11:23.068 --> 00:11:24.992
but I saw it, that you kind
of like bite it in your mouth,

00:11:24.992 --> 00:11:28.868
because they're pretty,
they're shut pretty tight,

00:11:28.868 --> 00:11:33.167
and then just coated in
lots and lots of salt.

00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:35.417
(laughing)

00:11:37.774 --> 00:11:39.357
Okay.

00:11:40.675 --> 00:11:43.960
They're shut pretty tight,
so you gotta bite it.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.127
(mumbles)

00:11:49.635 --> 00:11:52.611
Wow, I just got a
mouthful of salt on that.

00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:55.400
If you can, you gotta like, have a really,

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.921
razor-sharp tooth.

00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:59.206
- [Man] Oh, lose that,
another piece of one.

00:11:59.206 --> 00:12:01.373
- And it's juicy in there.

00:12:06.627 --> 00:12:07.460
Mmm!

00:12:08.606 --> 00:12:11.567
Oh, that is attractively good.

00:12:11.567 --> 00:12:14.466
It does have the consistency of an oyster.

00:12:14.466 --> 00:12:16.203
It's kind of slimy like an oyster,

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:18.418
and it has a little bit
more of a bitterness to it.

00:12:18.418 --> 00:12:19.800
I can see why these are so popular,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.912
such a popular snack.

00:12:20.912 --> 00:12:25.512
This time, let me do the
Cambodian style opening method.

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:28.429
(upbeat pop music)

00:12:31.449 --> 00:12:33.441
It's a little tricky to
open them with your teeth.

00:12:33.441 --> 00:12:35.375
I haven't gotten down the method

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:36.499
of opening it with your teeth.

00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:38.064
They're shut really tight.

00:12:38.064 --> 00:12:42.231
I just completely failed
opening these with my teeth.

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:46.472
Okay, there we go; I got it open.

00:12:48.215 --> 00:12:49.048
Okay.

00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:52.462
That's it, right on the side there,

00:12:52.462 --> 00:12:55.879
and then you just kind of wiggle it open.

00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:01.807
Wow, that is, those are tasty.

00:13:01.807 --> 00:13:04.104
This is a really popular
Cambodian street food

00:13:04.104 --> 00:13:06.517
in Phnom Penh, and people just come here,

00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:08.299
and you'll just see people,

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:11.785
probably friends of the owner
of this street food cart,

00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:13.867
but they'll just come and,
they'll just grab a clam

00:13:13.867 --> 00:13:15.153
and walk around.

00:13:15.153 --> 00:13:16.602
Thank you very much.
- Good?

00:13:16.602 --> 00:13:17.550
- It's really good.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.633
Goodbye.

00:13:20.373 --> 00:13:21.811
But yeah, it is hilarious;

00:13:21.811 --> 00:13:24.259
people will just walk up,
and they will just grab

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:27.650
a couple clams, and then keep on walking.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.573
- A girl just came straight across

00:13:29.573 --> 00:13:30.920
the row, and--
- She grabbed a,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.206
she just grabbed a clam--
- Grabbed one.

00:13:32.206 --> 00:13:34.259
- And then jumped in the tuk tuk.

00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:36.787
We are walking outside of
the central market now,

00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:37.736
and onto the streets.

00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:40.402
And then, a little bit away, there is this

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:43.485
grilled meat skewer, I think they're beef,

00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:47.329
grilled beef skewer, in
baguette sandwiches, that

00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:51.507
looks irresistible, so that's
where we're walking to next.

00:13:51.507 --> 00:13:54.424
(upbeat pop music)

00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:05.999
There are few things in the
world that make me more excited

00:14:05.999 --> 00:14:07.945
than grilled meat on a skewer.

00:14:07.945 --> 00:14:10.318
And, in Phnom Penh, one of
the classic afternoon snacks

00:14:10.318 --> 00:14:11.757
is a handful of grilled meat

00:14:11.757 --> 00:14:14.238
tucked into a Cambodian baguette.

00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:16.385
This place is fantastic.

00:14:16.385 --> 00:14:18.167
They have a selection of
different meat skewers.

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:22.059
I'm not even sure, but I think it's liver,

00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:24.613
and then they have regular meat.

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:27.008
But the main skewer that
I'm most interested to try

00:14:27.008 --> 00:14:30.538
is the, like, kebab meat
style, the minced meat.

00:14:30.538 --> 00:14:32.360
When they're grilling it, you can actually

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.763
smell the lemongrass,
coming out of the fumes,

00:14:35.763 --> 00:14:37.818
out of that smoke, from the grill.

00:14:37.818 --> 00:14:39.791
If you eat it here, they
don't assemble anything.

00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:41.454
They just leave it all separate.

00:14:41.454 --> 00:14:43.053
They give you the meat on a plate,

00:14:43.053 --> 00:14:45.061
they give you the papaya salad,

00:14:45.061 --> 00:14:47.080
and they give you all the loaves of bread,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.373
and which, by the way,
they toasted on the fire,

00:14:50.373 --> 00:14:53.925
and you can see it
absorbing the meat fumes.

00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:57.295
So, that bread is gonna
have a meaty aroma to it,

00:14:57.295 --> 00:14:58.599
taste good as well.

00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:00.015
Yeah, this is great, so we can assemble it

00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:00.879
all on our own.

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:01.978
I'm gonna get some help here.

00:15:01.978 --> 00:15:03.405
Okay.

00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:05.083
Hold the meat skewer.

00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:07.500
Oh, let it pull off the meat.

00:15:08.611 --> 00:15:10.878
Okay, and also this one?
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:10.878 --> 00:15:14.212
Okay, double meat.
- Yes, that's awesome.

00:15:14.212 --> 00:15:17.962
- Put all that meat in
there, and then salad.

00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:21.888
I think it's papaya salad.

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:24.888
Oh, yeah, stuff in the papaya salad.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.858
Yeah, this is some kind of a chili sauce.

00:15:27.858 --> 00:15:29.895
It looks like a sweet chili sauce.

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:32.395
Oh, yeah, oh, fantastic.

00:15:35.195 --> 00:15:37.509
Okay, Micah,

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:40.676
Micah is joining us for this sandwich.

00:15:41.582 --> 00:15:44.346
This is just the type of
bread that you can feel

00:15:44.346 --> 00:15:46.343
just collapsing in your fingers;

00:15:46.343 --> 00:15:48.015
it just sort of like,
it just sort of yeah,

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:50.432
it just completely collapses.

00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:54.432
Mmm!

00:15:58.621 --> 00:15:59.495
Oh!

00:15:59.495 --> 00:16:00.855
Yeah, the minced meat is where it's at,

00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:03.143
that's like, those are like little kebabs,

00:16:03.143 --> 00:16:07.604
and they are so fragrant,
with smoke and lemongrass.

00:16:07.604 --> 00:16:09.103
Oh man, that's good.

00:16:09.103 --> 00:16:12.213
And then, what I like is
that the bread is very light.

00:16:12.213 --> 00:16:13.972
It's very, very crusty,
it's the type of bread

00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:16.641
that when you chew down,
you can almost like

00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:20.724
stab your gums, because
it's so sharp and crusty.

00:16:24.094 --> 00:16:26.381
We immediately have to
order more of those,

00:16:26.381 --> 00:16:28.132
those lemongrass kebabs.

00:16:28.132 --> 00:16:30.798
Okay, next up, I think
this is grilled liver.

00:16:30.798 --> 00:16:34.631
I'm not totally sure,
but let's just try this.

00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:38.788
It's a little bit dried out,

00:16:38.788 --> 00:16:41.523
but it is good, it's creamy,

00:16:41.523 --> 00:16:44.296
but a little bit dry, in my opinion.

00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:46.109
But I think those
lemongrass skewers, which

00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:49.165
is their specialty, I think
that is where it's at.

00:16:49.165 --> 00:16:50.558
That's what you have to order.

00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:51.736
Finished off that first sandwich,

00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:53.462
and we finished off the liver.

00:16:53.462 --> 00:16:55.427
Liver was good, okay, but

00:16:55.427 --> 00:16:58.762
we had to eat more of these kebab-like,

00:16:58.762 --> 00:17:01.345
little minced meat packed onto,

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:06.726
they're actually, look like
little chopstick skewers.

00:17:11.469 --> 00:17:12.302
Mmm!

00:17:13.862 --> 00:17:17.007
Oh, it's so fragrant, it's so juicy,

00:17:17.007 --> 00:17:18.842
a little bit oily,

00:17:18.842 --> 00:17:22.232
a little bit sweet and
salty, and so lemongrass.

00:17:22.232 --> 00:17:25.601
You can really taste the
lemongrass and garlic in there.

00:17:25.601 --> 00:17:27.255
- Ooh, hot, man!

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.177
- You know, and you could
just eat these like saute.

00:17:29.177 --> 00:17:30.010
- Yes.

00:17:31.173 --> 00:17:32.816
- Okay, I decided to make one more order

00:17:32.816 --> 00:17:34.898
of the meat skewers.

00:17:34.898 --> 00:17:36.951
A couple more of the minced meat,

00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:39.475
and a couple more of
the whole meat pieces.

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.486
We gotta have something to fill into these

00:17:41.486 --> 00:17:43.669
airy little loaves of crunchy bread.

00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:46.483
Last sandwich, and I think we can utilize

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.483
the rest of this meat.

00:17:48.483 --> 00:17:50.929
Joel, three skewers,

00:17:50.929 --> 00:17:53.302
three skewers of meat.

00:17:53.302 --> 00:17:54.728
Oh, yeah.

00:17:54.728 --> 00:17:56.393
Stick them all into here;

00:17:56.393 --> 00:18:00.579
nestle it into that
cracker, cracker baguette.

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:03.412
And then, or sandwich it into that bread,

00:18:03.412 --> 00:18:07.579
and then stuff it with the
green papaya, on this side.

00:18:11.552 --> 00:18:12.915
Oh, yes.

00:18:12.915 --> 00:18:14.748
Okay, finish this off,

00:18:15.707 --> 00:18:18.790
and then chili sauce, chili sauce it.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.596
Grab that chili sauce.

00:18:22.596 --> 00:18:23.893
Oh, they have a whole chili.

00:18:23.893 --> 00:18:26.129
Yes, yes, please.

00:18:26.129 --> 00:18:27.708
I'm gonna squish this down, and then

00:18:27.708 --> 00:18:30.958
try to pull out the sticks, one by one.

00:18:32.453 --> 00:18:33.286
Oh!

00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:36.480
When I did that, and then
when I squished the meat,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.834
you could just see the oils and the juices

00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:41.169
just squeezing out of that kebab.

00:18:41.169 --> 00:18:43.252
Okay, one more.

00:18:44.689 --> 00:18:45.705
Oh, wow!

00:18:45.705 --> 00:18:48.760
The meat is really clamped on there.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.560
Okay, one more.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.327
Oh, and you can just feel that, oh, wow.

00:18:54.327 --> 00:18:57.054
This is a beauty; it is just stuffed,

00:18:57.054 --> 00:19:00.721
jam packed with meat,
and salad, and chilis.

00:19:04.417 --> 00:19:05.250
Mmm!

00:19:06.987 --> 00:19:10.657
It's such a well-balanced
combination of ingredients.

00:19:10.657 --> 00:19:12.048
At first I thought we were coming here

00:19:12.048 --> 00:19:13.783
just to eat a little sandwich, but that

00:19:13.783 --> 00:19:16.526
ended up turning into a
little bit of a meat fest,

00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:18.124
'cause it was so good.

00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:20.145
We just wanted to eat
more and more skewers.

00:19:20.145 --> 00:19:22.695
From here, we're gonna take
a little rest this afternoon,

00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:24.755
and then eat some more food this evening.

00:19:24.755 --> 00:19:26.794
Yes, there are definitely
vegetables you can eat

00:19:26.794 --> 00:19:28.310
when you're in Phnom Penh,

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.219
but to be honest, when
you're walking around

00:19:30.219 --> 00:19:32.813
and eating spontaneously,
throughout the city,

00:19:32.813 --> 00:19:35.693
meat of some kind or another, seems to be

00:19:35.693 --> 00:19:38.985
what really stands out,
what's easily accessible

00:19:38.985 --> 00:19:42.786
on seemingly every street
corner throughout Phnom Penh.

00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:44.688
When we set off in the
morning, I had no plans

00:19:44.688 --> 00:19:47.386
for it to be one of those all-meat days,

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:50.777
but by a streak of
unplanned dining, somehow,

00:19:50.777 --> 00:19:52.495
that's what it turned into.

00:19:52.495 --> 00:19:55.154
The next Cambodian street
food this afternoon

00:19:55.154 --> 00:19:58.227
is grilled, dried, grilled buffalo meat.

00:19:58.227 --> 00:20:01.760
And, there's just a
sea of meat right here,

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.497
that's drying, on the table.

00:20:03.497 --> 00:20:05.711
After the meat is dried,
and then she grills it on a,

00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:07.708
it's a really, really low
fire, so you can see it

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:09.565
kind of dehydrates the meat,

00:20:09.565 --> 00:20:12.994
and then she actually
has to hit it with a,

00:20:12.994 --> 00:20:17.985
it's like a bat, against a wooden stump.

00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:22.152
So, that might be some pretty
tough meat right there.

00:20:25.109 --> 00:20:28.026
(patrons chatting)

00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:35.902
We didn't exactly know what we were doing,

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.006
and we had a little bit
of a miscommunication, but

00:20:38.006 --> 00:20:39.959
we ended up ordering half a kilo.

00:20:39.959 --> 00:20:42.143
And, half a kilo of this meat is like,

00:20:42.143 --> 00:20:44.637
it's like the family pack, definitely;

00:20:44.637 --> 00:20:46.578
you could feed the whole neighborhood.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.488
He grabbed a giant pair of scissors,

00:20:48.488 --> 00:20:50.399
an ancient, iron pair of scissors,

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:52.857
and chopped up some of the
beef into bite-sized pieces.

00:20:52.857 --> 00:20:55.194
They serve it with some pickles,

00:20:55.194 --> 00:20:59.361
and this is kind of just a
hang out, afternoon meat spot.

00:21:03.518 --> 00:21:04.351
Wow!

00:21:06.287 --> 00:21:07.840
Okay, it's definitely chewy,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.559
but that flavor is awesome.

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:12.772
Oh, it's salty, it's peppery,

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:15.950
it has this amazing meaty flavor to it,

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.754
and yet it's not too gamey tasting.

00:21:18.754 --> 00:21:20.734
To accompany the dried
buffalo, and he said

00:21:20.734 --> 00:21:22.956
it makes it more tasty,
there's a plate of pickles.

00:21:22.956 --> 00:21:24.769
There's some, I think
this is morning glory,

00:21:24.769 --> 00:21:26.972
that looks like finely-shaved lemongrass,

00:21:26.972 --> 00:21:29.972
and then I think radish and carrots.

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:34.292
Oh, yeah!

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.932
Oh, that very finely-shaved lemongrass.

00:21:36.932 --> 00:21:39.232
That was so good, we
finished it off, and we need,

00:21:39.232 --> 00:21:41.032
we need him to chop up some more.

00:21:41.032 --> 00:21:42.933
It's so addictively good, and it has that

00:21:42.933 --> 00:21:44.757
kind of texture to it, yeah,

00:21:44.757 --> 00:21:47.233
where you just don't wanna
stop eating, for sure.

00:21:47.233 --> 00:21:49.380
Some more freshly-chopped
beef, and look at that,

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.399
look at that cross-section; that's just,

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:53.937
that is just pure, condensed meat,

00:21:53.937 --> 00:21:58.882
and I'm gonna eat it this
time, with some chilis on it.

00:21:58.882 --> 00:22:02.465
Just kind of scoop up
some of those chilis.

00:22:03.426 --> 00:22:04.259
Oh!

00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:08.894
That meat is just so condensed,

00:22:11.824 --> 00:22:13.655
It just releases flavor.

00:22:13.655 --> 00:22:15.988
My jaw is a little bit sore,

00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:19.840
and I got a little bit of dried
buffalo stuck in my teeth,

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.285
but that is some seriously tasty meat.

00:22:23.285 --> 00:22:26.406
There's just so much
street food in Phnom Penh.

00:22:26.406 --> 00:22:28.800
It's a street food paradise, for sure,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.187
and you can just walk from stall to stall.

00:22:31.187 --> 00:22:34.265
So many interesting foods, so
many delicious things to try.

00:22:34.265 --> 00:22:36.468
This is a great food city.

00:22:36.468 --> 00:22:39.385
(upbeat pop music)

00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:48.927
This is a serious meat joint, right here.

00:22:48.927 --> 00:22:51.649
In the evening is when the
huge Cambodian barbecue

00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:53.246
meat stalls emerge;

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:57.252
a symphony of rotating meats,
slow hissing from the coals,

00:22:57.252 --> 00:23:00.325
with a cloud of smoke
pouring onto the streets.

00:23:00.325 --> 00:23:02.792
As a meat lover, this
is where you want to be,

00:23:02.792 --> 00:23:04.886
when you're in Phnom Penh.

00:23:04.886 --> 00:23:08.000
I have a soft spot in my
heart for grilled meats,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.373
and rotating meats, and this

00:23:10.373 --> 00:23:13.151
beautiful meat stall,
grilled meat stall, here

00:23:13.151 --> 00:23:15.846
in Phnom Penh, is something
I could not walk past without

00:23:15.846 --> 00:23:19.992
ordering, and so we decided
to order some grilled meat.

00:23:19.992 --> 00:23:22.409
What a stunning shop this is!

00:23:32.489 --> 00:23:34.439
I just got splashed with duck,

00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:36.673
as he chopped that up expertly.

00:23:36.673 --> 00:23:38.736
This guy is a meat master.

00:23:38.736 --> 00:23:41.876
He's doing everything; he has
a friend who's helping him

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:44.150
hack everything, but he's
literally doing everything:

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.595
grilling the meat, maintaining the fire,

00:23:46.595 --> 00:23:48.572
chopping up the meat.

00:23:48.572 --> 00:23:51.369
He is a grill master, to say the least.

00:23:51.369 --> 00:23:53.418
(speaking in foreign language)

00:23:53.418 --> 00:23:56.724
That is a meat cart that even
the most dedicated person

00:23:56.724 --> 00:23:59.372
on a diet, would stop for,

00:23:59.372 --> 00:24:01.488
and would break their diet for.

00:24:01.488 --> 00:24:05.467
That meat is just, just impressive.

00:24:05.467 --> 00:24:08.035
They have no seats at the meat stall;

00:24:08.035 --> 00:24:09.854
most people just get it for take-away,

00:24:09.854 --> 00:24:12.507
but luckily, he has a friend
right across the street,

00:24:12.507 --> 00:24:14.301
right across the intersection here,

00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:17.657
and she has a fruit cart,
a fruit smoothie cart,

00:24:17.657 --> 00:24:19.453
and so he asked if we could sit here,

00:24:19.453 --> 00:24:20.756
which is very, very kind.

00:24:20.756 --> 00:24:22.881
And, she allowed us to
sit here, and we ordered

00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:26.068
some soursop smoothies, to begin with.

00:24:26.068 --> 00:24:27.980
Cheers, man!
- Oh, thanks.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.246
Let's have some soursop smoothie first,

00:24:30.246 --> 00:24:32.579
before we dig into the meat.

00:24:33.652 --> 00:24:35.215
Oh, that's just pure soursop,

00:24:35.215 --> 00:24:36.856
and I think she added coconut milk.

00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:39.512
But, I asked her to put no sugar,

00:24:39.512 --> 00:24:41.759
and no condensed milk.

00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:42.957
Wow, that's good!

00:24:42.957 --> 00:24:45.811
Let's begin with the duck.

00:24:45.811 --> 00:24:48.506
Oh, it's so hot and fresh,
right off the grill,

00:24:48.506 --> 00:24:52.506
and that golden skin is
stunning; it's stunning.

00:24:57.323 --> 00:24:58.156
Mmm!

00:25:00.429 --> 00:25:03.595
That could definitely be a free-flying,

00:25:03.595 --> 00:25:05.267
free range duck, right there.

00:25:05.267 --> 00:25:07.438
It's a little bit on the chewy side,

00:25:07.438 --> 00:25:10.972
but it's so, the taste of
it is really, really good,

00:25:10.972 --> 00:25:12.722
very natural tasting.

00:25:14.009 --> 00:25:18.176
And it sort of has like a,
almost like a honey glaze.

00:25:19.533 --> 00:25:21.200
Oh, yeah.

00:25:22.442 --> 00:25:25.173
That's Vietnamese coriander; it's so,

00:25:25.173 --> 00:25:26.749
so peppery, that goes well with the duck.

00:25:26.749 --> 00:25:28.921
Alright, let's try the quail next.

00:25:28.921 --> 00:25:32.073
I'm gonna, oh, yes, the whole thigh, and,

00:25:32.073 --> 00:25:33.629
thigh and drum.

00:25:33.629 --> 00:25:36.585
I think I'll go for the sauce on this one,

00:25:36.585 --> 00:25:39.918
dip a little bit of sauce onto this guy.

00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:43.424
Oh!

00:25:45.735 --> 00:25:46.652
Mmm!
- Mmm!

00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:49.421
- Quail is superb.

00:25:50.317 --> 00:25:53.030
I think this is quail; quail or pigeon.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.658
I think it's quail.

00:25:54.658 --> 00:25:58.967
It's just like, the
darkest meat of chicken,

00:25:58.967 --> 00:26:00.780
and like, condensed.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.595
Oh, wow, it's good.

00:26:02.595 --> 00:26:04.851
- [Joel] I can crush
right through the bones.

00:26:04.851 --> 00:26:06.688
That's amazing.

00:26:06.688 --> 00:26:09.523
- Some parts of it even
taste a little livery.

00:26:09.523 --> 00:26:13.263
(upbeat pop music)

00:26:13.263 --> 00:26:15.710
You can definitely tell,
this is not your average

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.750
farm-raised duck, right here.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.825
We have come to the end of this day.

00:26:19.825 --> 00:26:23.040
This has been, it's been a
little bit of a meat-heavy

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.537
street food day in Cambodia,
and it has been fantastic.

00:26:26.537 --> 00:26:28.226
The food, the different variety of dishes

00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:30.966
we've eaten today, and the
different meats that we've eaten

00:26:30.966 --> 00:26:32.953
has been incredibly delicious.

00:26:32.953 --> 00:26:35.328
Met a lot of friendly people as well.

00:26:35.328 --> 00:26:37.302
Phnom Penh is just such a fantastic

00:26:37.302 --> 00:26:39.180
street food-lovers' city.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.286
I'm gonna end the video
for today, right now.

00:26:41.286 --> 00:26:43.848
I wanna say a big thank you
for watching today's video.

00:26:43.848 --> 00:26:46.265

and I will see you on the next video.

00:26:58.813 --> 00:27:00.656
Oh, that was a great meat day.
