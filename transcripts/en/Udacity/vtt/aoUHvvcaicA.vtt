00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.130
So now we're going to look at Interdomain

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.450
Routing Business Models. So the one thing to

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.610
remember about interdomain routing is that it's really

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.760
all about routing money. Let's consider this AS

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.060
that wants to send traffic to a particular

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.180
destination. Well, in the internet there are two

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.750
different types of business relationships: a customer-provider business

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.130
relationship where money flows from customer to provider,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.640
regardless of the direction that traffic flows, the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.500
other type of business relationship is a peering relationship

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.820
where an AS can exchange traffic with another AS

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.450
free of charge. This is sometimes also called settlement-free

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.210
peering. So already you can see given three possible

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.080
ways to reach the destination. This AS is first

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.300
going to prefer a route through its customer, because

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.000
regardless of the direction of traffic on this link,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.240
money is always flowing from the customer. The

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.180
peering link is the second most preferable because it's

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.110
free. And the least preferable route is through

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.440
the provider, because the AS has to pay money

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.730
every time it sends traffic on this link.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.635
This leads to the basic rules of preference in

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:11.540
interdomain routing, where customer routes are preferred over peer

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.440
routes, which are in turn preferred over provider routes.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.820
The other consideration that an AS has to make

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.850
is filtering, or export decisions. In other words, given

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.430
that an AS learns a route from its neighbor,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.370
to whom should it re-advertise that route? To understand filtering

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.180
and export decisions, let's add a couple more AS's

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.820
to the graph. Let's add another peer, and let's add

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.050
another provider. Let's call this AS in the middle

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.510
of the picture Cox Communications. This ISP might have smaller

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.050
regional customers and it might also buy transit

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.690
connectivity from other providers. Now let's suppose that this

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.310
AS learns routes to a destination via its customer,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.590
its peer and its provider. Now we already have

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.220
established that it would prefer the customer route, so

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.260
that it can make money by sending traffic to

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.090
that destination. But what about filtering decisions? Well, routes

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.630
that are learned from a customer, Cox of course

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.500
would want to re-advertise to everyone else, because the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.280
more people use that route, the more money Cox

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.940
makes. Therefore a route that's learned from a customer,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.460
gets advertised to everybody else. On the other hand, a

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.110
route that's learned from a provider, if it were

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.520
actually selected, would of course, only be advertised to customers.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.140
It wouldn't make any sense to take a route

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.680
like this and advertise it to another provider. The reason,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.870
of course, is that money is flowing in the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.750
direction of the providers. So any route that's learned from

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.840
a provider would never be advertised to another provider,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.720
because it would result in Cox essentially becoming a transit

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.560
provider between two of its own providers and paying

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.450
them both for the privilege of carrying that traffic. So

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.930
routes learned from a provider would only ever be advertised

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.780
to other customers. And similarly, routes from peers would only

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.710
be advertised to other customers, not to other

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.660
peers or other providers. So to summarize, interdomain routing

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.462
has both ranking rules, where, given multiple choices,

00:03:06.462 --> 00:03:09.950
an AS might prefer a customer route over a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.670
peer route over a provider route. And then,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.330
given that it selected a particular route from either

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.830
a customer, a provider, or a peer, Ii makes

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.880
different decisions about where to re-advertise that route to

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.240
other neighboring ASs. Now as it turns out if

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.000
every AS in the internet followed these rules exactly, then

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.620
routing stability is guaranteed. Now you might wonder, isn't routing

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.270
stability guaranteed already? And it turns out that it isn't.
