&gt;&gt;  THE WINTER OF
2015 HAS WREAKED HAVOC ALL OVER

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:07.573 line:91%
THE NORTHEAST, AND SOME NEW
YORKERS HAVE SEEN THEIR HOMES

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:09.675 align:start position:0% line:91%
DESTROYED BY THE RECENT
BLIZZARD.

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:14.113 line:85%
STATEN ISLANDERS AIMAN YOUSSEF.

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.048 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT BLIZZARD.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.082 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. AN ICE STORM.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.050 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT AN ICE STORM.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.084 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; FROZEN HAIL?

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.585 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT IT, EITHER.

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:21.821 size:88% position:44% line:85%
IT WAS FROM HURRICANE SANDY.

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:24.057 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT, THAT WAS LIKE TWO YEARS
AGO.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.892 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, TWO YEARS AGO, WE'RE
STILL IN A TENT.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:26.492 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.561 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WE HAD A CONCERT TO HELP.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:32.498 line:91%
WE HAD MICK JAGGER THERE AND THE
BOSS WAS THERE AND THEN WE HAD

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:35.034 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANOTHER CONCERT AND THERE WERE
COMMERCIALS AND THIS GUY IS

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.269 align:start position:0% line:85%
STILL IN A TENT?

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.970 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THIS IS WHERE YOUR HOUSE USED
TO BE.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:38.771 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.139 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS USED TO BE YOUR LIVING
ROOM?

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:40.673 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:42.175 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT ALONE.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:46.179 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
STILL WITHOUT HOMES.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.713 line:85%
&gt;&gt; NOBODY'S HOME, ME INCLUDED.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:49.816 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO AND A
HALF YEARS ALREADY.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:50.683 size:88% position:44% line:85%
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REBUILT.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.919 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE'RE FROM NEW
YORK.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.454 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY TAKE
THIS LONG?

00:00:54.487 --> 00:01:00.660 line:91%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WAIT, MORE THAN $648
MILLION WAS SET ASIDE FOR AN

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:03.663 line:91%
ORGANIZATION CALLED BUILD IT
BACK WHICH WAS CREATED SOLELY

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.867 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO-- IT'S IN THE NAME-- BUILD
PEOPLE'S HOUSES BACK.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.002 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE GUYS?

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:11.270 line:85%
&gt;&gt; BUILD IT BACK REALLY SUCKS.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:13.773 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUILT IT BACK, THEY BUILD
NOTHING.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.074 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THEY LOSE PAPERWORK.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.577 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S JUST BEEN-- NO ANSWERS, AND
NO PROGRESS.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.880 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE NO HOMES BUT WE PAY
TAXES ON THOSE HOMES.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:21.681 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.649 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M STILL PAYING
FLOOD INSURANCE.

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.818 line:91%
THEY DIDN'T FINISH PAYING ME,
BUT I AM STILL PAYING THEM.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:29.122 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE NEED TWO FLOORS AND THEY
ONLY WANT TO FINISH ONE.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:31.991 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND ALL WE WANT IS WHAT WE HAD
BEFORE.

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.426 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
SIMPLE KITCHEN, SIMPLE LIVING
ROOM AND A BATHROOM.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.560 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WOAH, WOAH, WOAH. WHAT ELSE?

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:38.197 align:start size:88% position:13% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DOORS WOULD BE NICE. 
&gt;&gt; PLURAL.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.332 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, DOORS ON THE BEDROOMS,
MAYBE A FRONT DOOR.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.568 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE HOW THIS COULD TAKE A
WHILE.

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:45.671 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF I DO THE MATH HERE, THIS IS A
17-YEAR PROJECT.

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:49.442 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
IT'S BECAUSE BUILDING IN NEW
YORK CITY IS COMPLICATED.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:53.045 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
JUST ASK ARCHITECT ENRIQUE
NORTON.

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:55.882 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NEW YORK IS A VERY COMPLEX
CITY. 

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.151 line:91%
BUT OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, A LOT
OF THINGS GET BUILT HERE AND A

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:01.387 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
LOT OF VERY GOOD THINGS GET
BUILT HERE.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.857 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
FOR EXAMPLE, WE RECENTLY
COMPLETED THE MERCEDES HOUSE.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.958 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NOW HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE TO
COMPLETE?

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.159 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS TOOK TO COMPLETE
APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.328 line:91%
&gt;&gt; OR JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
TIME THAN THE SANDY VICTIMS ARE

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.797 line:85%
WAITING FOR THEIR HOMES.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.567 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 1.2
MILLION SQUARE FEET.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.769 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT 1.2 MILLION SQUARE
FEET.

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:18.237 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, THIS IS ONLY A MODEL.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.739 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE
BUILDING.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.207 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THE ACTUAL BUILDING.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.874 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS?

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.009 line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE DID THIS BUILDING.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.679 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU BUILT THIS IN THREE
YEARS, AND NOTHING, NOTHING IS

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:27.513 size:81% position:41% line:85%
GOING ON IN STATEN ISLAND.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.182 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:29.983 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNREAL.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.552 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM
HERE?

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:35.154 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUREAUCRACY IS TO BLAME FOR
NOT REBUILDING HOMES.

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:38.057 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NOTHING GOOD EVER HAPPENED
WITHOUT BUREAUCRACY.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.026 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THAT,
RIGHT?

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.361 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:44.197 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO OUT IN THE BACKYARD,
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.666 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUREAUCRACY, AND WE'LL SEE WHAT
COMES OUT OF IT.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.801 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WAIT, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
IN THE BACKYARD.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:50.069 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO KICK THE
( BLEEP ) OUT OF YOU?

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:52.438 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT, I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST
GOING TO TALK ABOUT BUREAUCRACY

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.840 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND SIGN SOME PAPERS.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:55.974 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY UNDERSTANDABLY, THINGS
WERE GETTING TENSE SO I TURNED

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:58.978 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO LOCAL ADVOCATE ALANA TORNELLO
TO SEE WHAT I COULD DO.

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:01.480 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M GOING TO DROP THE IRONIC,
HANDSOME JORDAN KLEPPER

JORDAN KLEPPER.

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.385 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WANT TO HELP.

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:09.255 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:14.694 line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, DO YOU HAVE ANY SKILLS?

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:15.661 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANY

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:16.862 size:78% position:39% line:85%
SKILLS TO COME VOLUNTEER.

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:21.901 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.704 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AS THE MEDIA, THERE IS A LOT
THAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE IT VERY

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.072 line:91%
CLEAR THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE, FOR
SOME NEW YORKERS, THIS IS STILL

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:28.441 align:start position:0% line:91%
A DISASTER AND THIS IS STILL A
STORY.

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.976 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.178 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M TALKING TO YOU.

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:32.945 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS YOU.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:33.579 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU CAN DO THIS.

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:34.680 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOT AS THE MEDIA.

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:35.381 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:36.515 align:start position:0% line:85%

OH RIGHT!

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:40.519 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH, YEAH, THIS THING.

&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU CAN REMIND PEOPLE
THAT THIS IS STILL A NEWS STORY.

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:47.893 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DONE.

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:49.929 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY?

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:50.396 align:start position:0% line:85%

&gt;&gt; YOU'RE WELCOME.

LOOKS LIKE MY WORK AS A MEDIA

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.607 align:start position:0% line:91%
