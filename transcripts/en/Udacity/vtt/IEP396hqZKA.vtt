Great job. It really, is just that

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.360
easy. Local storage is widely supported across browsers.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.920
But as we pointed out it does have some down sides. It's a great way to

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.560
get simple storage for persistent data like

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.470
user settings, or users profile strings. But, you

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.240
really don't want to try to use it store

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.920
complex data, like binary files or structured data.
