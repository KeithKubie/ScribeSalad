00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.330
In the last lesson, we learned how our genomes are made of a chemical substance

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.110
called DNA, which holds all the information we need to make up who we are.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.860
&gt;&gt; And in this lesson, we're going to talk about

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.070
our cells transform genetic information into our flesh and blood.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.460
&gt;&gt; Quite literally, in fact. We're going to focus on

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.910
a process that's referred to in biology as the central

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.040
dogma. Central, because it's true for virtually all life. The

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.790
processes of transcription and translation. Which will turn our DNA

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.710
genetic code into the protein of who we are. And to

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.720
do this, we're going to focus on the trait of blood type.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.521
&gt;&gt; So you're talking about, like, A, B, A positive,

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:35.145
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:36.833
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You probably heard of these blood

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:38.617
types before. They're referred to as the ABO

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:40.502
blood types. And there are pretty important to

00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:42.090
know, especially if you are in the doctor's office.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.820
&gt;&gt; That's true. In fact, over 15 million people per year

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.060
had donated blood in the US alone, and over 5 million

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.480
people per year received blood transfusions. So knowing your blood type

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.950
can help save your life or the life of someone else.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.515
&gt;&gt; It's actually a lot of people

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:56.820
[UNKNOWN],

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.890
some of you might even know your blood type, and so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.820
we want you to tell us if you know it. Are you

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.250
type A, B, AB, or O? And if you know about

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.040
your positive or negative factor, don't worry about that for right now.
