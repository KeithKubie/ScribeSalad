00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:10.717
It's often said that despite 
humanity's many conflicts,

00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:14.251
we all bleed the same blood.

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.531
It's a nice thought
but not quite accurate.

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:21.542
In fact, our blood comes 
in a few different varieties.

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:25.269
Our red blood cells contain
a protein called hemoglobin

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.114
that binds to oxygen,

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:30.330
allowing the cells to transport it
throughout the body.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.251
But they also have another kind
of complex protein

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:35.947
on the outside of the cell membrane.

00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:41.059
These proteins, known as antigens,
communicate with white blood cells,

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.524
immune cells that protect 
against infection.

00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:47.095
Antigens serve as identifying markers,

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:51.117
allowing the immune system to recognize
your body's own cells

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:54.513
without attacking them as foreign bodies.

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:59.528
The two main kinds of antigens, A and B,
determine your blood type.

00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:04.022
But how do we get four blood types
from only two antigens?

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:08.839
Well, the antigens are coded for
by three different alleles,

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:11.534
varieties of a particular gene.

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:15.452
While the A and B alleles code
for A and B antigens,

00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:18.669
the O allele codes for neither,

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:22.422
and because we inherit 
one copy of each gene from each parent,

00:01:22.422 --> 00:01:27.081
every individual has two alleles
determining blood type.

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:28.847
When these happen to be different,

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:33.607
one overrides the other 
depending on their relative dominance.

00:01:33.607 --> 00:01:39.832
For blood types, the A and B alleles
are both dominant, while O is recessive.

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:45.775
So A and A gives you type A blood,
while B and B gives you type B.

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:47.673
If you inherit one of each,

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:52.524
the resulting codominance
will produce both A and B antigens,

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:54.448
which is type AB.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.831
The O allele is recessive,

00:01:56.831 --> 00:02:00.163
so either of the others will override it
when they're paired,

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:03.315
resulting in either type A or type B.

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:07.508
But if you happen to inherit two Os,
instructions will be expressed

00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:12.849
that make blood cells 
without the A or the B antigen.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.940
Because of these interactions,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.765
knowing both parents' blood types

00:02:16.765 --> 00:02:21.714
lets us predict the relative probability 
of their children's blood types.

00:02:21.714 --> 00:02:23.542
Why do blood types matter?

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:25.083
For blood transfusions,

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:28.940
finding the correct one is a matter
of life and death.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.565
If someone with type A blood
is given type B blood, or vice versa,

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:38.192
their antibodies will reject 
the foreign antigens and attack them,

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:42.175
potentially causing 
the transfused blood to clot.

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:46.736
But because people with type AB blood
produce both A and B antigens,

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:51.868
they don't make antibodies against them,
so they will recognize either as safe,

00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:54.311
making them universal recipients.

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:55.534
On the other hand,

00:02:55.534 --> 00:02:58.999
people with blood type O
do not produce either antigen,

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.507
which makes them universal donors,

00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:04.370
but will cause their immune system
to make antibodies

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.456
that reject any other blood type.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:13.677
Unfortunately, matching donors 
and recipients is a bit more complicated

00:03:13.677 --> 00:03:16.311
due to additional antigen systems,

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:18.308
particular the Rh factor,

00:03:18.308 --> 00:03:22.580
named after the Rhesus monkeys
in which it was first isolated.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.261
Rh+ or Rh- refers to the presence
or absence of the D antigen

00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:31.955
of the Rh blood group system.

00:03:31.955 --> 00:03:34.820
And in addition to impeding 
some blood transfusions,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.355
it can cause severe complications
in pregnancy.

00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:42.853
If an Rh- mother is carrying an Rh+ child,

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:47.216
her body will produce Rh antibodies
that may cross the placenta

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:49.142
and attack the fetus,

00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:53.340
a condition known as 
hemolytic disease of the newborn.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.092
Some cultures believe blood type
to be associated with personality,

00:03:57.092 --> 00:03:58.906
though this is not 
supported by science.

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.401
And though the proportions
of different blood types

00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:03.784
vary between human populations,

00:04:03.784 --> 00:04:06.603
scientists aren't sure why they evolved;

00:04:06.603 --> 00:04:09.143
perhaps as protection 
against blood born diseases,

00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:11.874
or due to random genetic drift.

00:04:11.874 --> 00:04:15.724
Finally, different species 
have different sets of antigens.

00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:19.676
In fact, the four main blood types
shared by us apes

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:25.943
seem paltry in comparison 
to the thirteen types found in dogs.
