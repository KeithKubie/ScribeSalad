00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.379
Remember what it was like to be 8 and agonize
over picking ice cream?

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.830
Do I get the tweety bird with gumball eyes
or the ninja turtle with gumball eyes?!

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.420
It was probably the most important decision
of your day.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.530
But now, we’re adults.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.339
We make small choices like what to eat for
lunch, but we also have to set goals, pick

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.739
a career, and decide how to invest our hard-earned
money.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:27.739
It’s not easy!

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.619
We don’t want to make a decision out of
fear, rather than doing what’s best for

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.619
us.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.300
And we don’t want to regret a big choice
and dwell on the “what ifs” either.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.219
There are lots of pretty common psychological
phenomena that can skew the way we view choices,

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.800
like the sunk cost fallacy, loss aversion,
and anchoring.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.370
So today, we’re going to take a step back,
understand how to really look at the decisions

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.129
we’re making, and learn what not to do when
facing a difficult choice.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.540
I’m Evelyn from the Internets, and this
is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:06.340
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.180
Decision-making is a process when it comes
to big choices.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.240
Most of us wouldn’t just flip a coin to
decide whether to quit a job.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.760
We take the time to weigh our options, think
about the benefits and downsides, and look

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.950
at how what we do now could affect us down
the road.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.860
Every decision has an opportunity cost.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.420
Nothing is really ever free, because choosing
one opportunity means you’re giving up another.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.870
So, if you decide to binge something on Netflix,
you’re giving up time you could spend reading

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.250
a bestselling memoir.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.540
Or doing your homework.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.070
On a bigger scale, if you’re figuring out
where to move to after you graduate, you can’t

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.040
live in both New York and Chicago.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.090
So it’s important to think about how the
time, money, and energy you could invest in

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.420
an opportunity compares with other options.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.420
If you decide to go to college, there are
lots of opportunity costs.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.030
But, to focus in on the financial stuff: you
have to consider more than just different

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.030
tuitions.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.920
You also have to weigh the money you could’ve
made by working instead of going to school,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.390
even though a degree usually means higher
earnings in the future.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.200
And remember how we talked about anchoring
in negotiations?

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.230
Anchoring may mean you’re happy with an
option because it’s better than the first

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.890
option you were given, not because it’s
great or even fair.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.730
Anchoring is why we feel good after buying
something marked at a discount, even though

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.400
the original sticker price could’ve been
random.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.349
But hey, there’s no shame in looking for
deals.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.230
So make sure to take a step back and do research
to make sure you’re fairly judging an opportunity

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.530
and its costs.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.030
Whether we’re choosing a college or picking
a career, thinking about opportunity costs

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.030
can seem daunting.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.400
It can feel like every decision has a drastic
long-term impact that could make us fail or

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400
succeed.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.910
But sometimes, decisions are just decisions.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.860
The butterfly effect is a great movie with
Ashton Kutcher, but it shouldn’t be a metaphor

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.120
that rules your life.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.070
For all my fellow perfectionists out there:
perfect is the enemy of good.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.350
By that I mean, it’s better to make a decision
quickly than avoid it for a month because

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.350
you’re afraid of choosing.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.870
Mulling things over until you’re stuck in
decision gridlock is exhausting.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.670
Plus some choices, like job offers, usually
have deadlines.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.709
So to keep our brains from getting totally
overwhelmed, we shouldn’t think about the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.660
opportunity cost of every single option if
we can help it.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.520
Narrow down the list and try comparing only
the best two or three.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.930
If the company that just hired you has offices
in a bunch of cities, you might narrow your

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.790
choice to Seattle, New York, or LA.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.770
Next, think about the value and opportunity
costs of each option.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.780
To do that, you can make a list of pros and
cons.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.210
Or better yet, create a weighted scorecard,
which is a sheet where you assign bigger point

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.349
values to your bigger priorities.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.470
This way you can tell if one, huge pro outweighs
a group of little cons.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.470
That’s so…

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.470
Virgo.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.880
So, if public transportation matters to you
more than the weather, then New York would

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.360
get more points than LA.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.290
Then, stay calm and give yourself some space.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.240
You don’t want to delay for weeks, but if
you’re about to make a snap decision, you

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.030
may end up picking something you regret.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.510
You’ll want at least one night to ‘sleep
on it.’

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.660
But you might take a couple days for major
choices, like responding to a job offer.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.800
And you don’t have to make decisions alone.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.640
If you’re ruminating, it’s probably good
to get a fresh perspective from someone who’s

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.660
not as worried about all those opportunity
costs.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.140
Consider their opinion even if it’s not
what you wanted to hear.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.449
Asking for advice isn’t the same as asking
for a pump-up speech!

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.300
You need to take different perspectives into
account in order to avoid confirmation bias,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.860
which is our tendency to ignore evidence that
doesn’t support our own opinions.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.349
It’s why fake news can be powerful.

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.039
Or why bad research gets spread.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.680
We like to be comfortable in what we know,
and being challenged can feel scary.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.340
Deep down, most of us are loss averse.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.639
Risk is kind of on a sliding scale.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.330
Many entrepreneurs are willing to take a leap
of faith and make the financial risk to develop

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.039
the next big thing.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.050
Other people prefer to work a lower-risk 9-to-5
job and build up a simple savings account

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.050
and a retirement fund.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.449
But no matter whether you take big risks or
not, failure hurts.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.979
Losses feel bigger than gains, and, psychologically
speaking, we’re more likely to be hurt by

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.819
failures than appreciate successes.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:10.039
We anxiously remember the interviews that
went wrong, but how often do we replay the

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.090
ones that went right?

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.159
So if you’re making a big decision, like
a career change, use an alternative frame

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:16.159
of reference.

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.310
Don’t ruminate on the negatives.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.110
Think about how happy you’ll be as a freelancer.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.360
Then weigh it with the pay cut you’ll take
by quitting your advertising gig.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.490
On a smaller scale, loss aversion can lead
to decisions like useless purchases.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.689
Our brains are weird.

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:37.650
Avoiding an extra $5 charge feels better than
spending 5 fewer dollars, even though it’s

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.650
the same thing.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.120
It’s like why you might add 30 bucks of
clothing to your online cart to avoid a $7

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.460
shipping cost.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.330
But loss aversion can also lead to really
bad business decisions, like when people do

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.240
unethical things in order to succeed.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.770
One of these unethical things is known as
motivated blindness, which is when someone

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.710
avoids asking important questions or ignores
unethical behavior because it benefits them.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.800
It might feel safer to be blissfully ignorant,
but ignoring a problem only helps perpetuate

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
it.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.840
It’s important to consider the larger impacts
of your decisions.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.240
To see what I mean, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.289
The Enron scandal led to huge changes in the
way we make companies report their financial

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.669
gains and losses on their quarterly reports.

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.729
The Enron Corporation was the nation’s seventh
largest company.

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.110
A leader in the energy sector, it was considered
highly respected and profitable.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.699
But in late 2001, they unexpectedly declared
one of the largest bankruptcies of all time.

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:41.120
Estimated losses totaled 74 billion, and shares
plummeted from almost 90 dollars to 26 cents.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.629
By using some pretty creative accounting methods
and outright fraud, executives had been hiding

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:50.599
billions of dollars of debt from shareholders
and investors for years.

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:55.249
Kenneth Lay, the former CEO, said, “I take
responsibility for what happened at Enron,

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:56.419
both good and bad.

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.629
But I cannot take responsibility for criminal
conduct that I was unaware of.”

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.340
He was convicted of fraud, by the way.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.759
So he knew.

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.330
But even if he hadn’t, it would have been
his responsibility.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.379
This criminal conduct never came to light
because Enron was plagued by a culture of

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:11.809
motivated blindness.

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:16.809
Enron’s incentive structure required 20%
of their employees to be ranked “below average”

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:18.619
and encouraged to leave.

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:22.610
So some of them ignored the fraud and failed
to ask questions about projects that were

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.789
their responsibility.

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.229
But many did the ethical thing and tried to
confront the issues.

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:30.949
Some employees quit when they realized their
complaints did nothing.

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:35.759
Others were fired when they posted their suspicions
online to try and generate conversation.

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:40.849
But it was Sherron Watkins, a vice president
of Enron, who sent Lay an anonymous memo warning

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:43.009
of “an elaborate accounting hoax.”

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:45.629
She became known as the “Enron whistle-blower.”

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:47.879
She eventually revealed her identity.

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:52.759
It cost her some influence and a lot of cash,
but it led to testimony that ended Enron’s

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.229
crimes and some hefty jail time for its CEOs.

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:56.470
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.099
If there’s any potential that you could
contribute to something unethical at a job,

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:03.830
consider whether you’ve asked the right
questions to the right people.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.879
And consider what power you have to make different
choices… even if that choice is quitting.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:12.009
Of course, there are lots of things we have
to think about.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:14.300
We need to put food on the table and pay our
bills.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.759
I would love to just travel the world in a
wide-brimmed hat and flowy dress.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:21.449
But I need a savings account more than an
Instagram aesthetic.

00:08:21.449 --> 00:08:25.360
But that doesn’t mean we should necessarily
stay at a job if we’re miserable.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.779
The more time or effort we put into a project,
the less likely we are to scrap it, even when

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:31.830
it isn’t working out.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.270
This quirk is called the sunk cost fallacy.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.430
It’s what keeps you from walking out in
the middle of a really bad movie, even when

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.259
you could spend that time doing something
you actually like.

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:46.620
I sat through all of Sausage Party, even though
I probably could’ve done literally anything

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.970
else - grocery shop.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.870
I could’ve grocery shopped instead.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.110
Now, we’re not just saying to give up if
you feel like you’re bad at something.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.560
Nobody starts as an expert.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.720
And if you’re determined to put in the work
to accomplish a difficult dream, stick with

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.720
it!

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720
Seriously.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.520
My very first ever YouTube video was a process.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.740
But if a choice isn’t working out, you shouldn’t
feel stuck with it.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.720
Instead of escalating your commitment, think
about your opportunity cost and set a cutoff

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.380
point of time or money to make a different
decision.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.089
Be careful though, because we’re all susceptible
to the planning fallacy and underestimate

00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:21.110
how long things are going to take.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.509
Even huge companies do this -- it’s how
the city of Boston managed to spend almost

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:31.649
8 extra years and 14.6 billion dollars on
a transportation project that was supposed

00:09:31.649 --> 00:09:33.829
to cost 2.6 billion.

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:35.190
It was called the Big Dig.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.329
And it was a big mess.

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:40.200
It really stinks to realize that you’ve
put time and effort into something that isn’t

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.399
going to work out, whether it’s a job or
a long-term relationship.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:48.639
But you’re always paying an opportunity
cost, so don’t be afraid to shift directions.

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:52.610
It’s better to appreciate the good times,
look back on what you’ve learned, and put

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.240
your time towards something that’s going
to make you happier.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.259
And when it comes to learning from past decisions
to make better ones in the future, it’s

00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:01.760
best to think about why we failed or succeeded.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.600
Sometimes we can fail, even if we did the
right thing.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.710
And sometimes, bad behavior can produce good
results.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.449
We tend to put a lot of weight on outcomes
that are completely arbitrary or that we don’t

00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:14.769
have context for.

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:20.060
It’s why autobiographies can be inspirational,
but are bad for specific career advice.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.470
Everyone’s path is different!

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.380
Like, you shouldn’t start drinking a Dr.
Pepper a day because a 101-year-old lady says

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.889
it’s the secret to her success.

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:32.470
So try and think about your decisions in terms
of the research you did and steps you took

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.889
to accomplish your goal.

00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:37.319
A lot of times, decision-making comes down
to trial and error.

00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:41.959
So if you take nothing else from today’s
episode, remember:

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:43.500
Decision-making is a process.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.029
Take time to consider your opportunity costs.

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:52.670
Look out for common psychological errors like
anchoring or the sunk cost fallacy.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:58.279
Learn from your past choices by thinking about
what happened and why it happened.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:01.990
Watch out for ethical mishaps by making sure
you’re asking the right questions.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.281
You don’t always make decisions solo.

00:11:03.281 --> 00:11:08.529
So next time, we’ll help you work effectively
with a team to accomplish goals and keep pesky

00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:09.649
meetings at a minimum.

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:11.720
