00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's now talk about pie charts.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You all know what a pie is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's a birthday pie,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and if you look at this pie from above

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
it looks just like this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's a circle.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now here comes Sebastian and cuts out his first piece of the pie.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What results is a pie with a missing piece,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then my wife comes, and she gets just a small piece,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but my brother eats a very big piece,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so only the following pie is left.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We've just made a pie chart,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and in statistics you use pie charts to visualize data,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
specifically relative data, and I'll tell you in a second

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what that means.
