00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In dynamic programming, this happens to be really easy to program--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
even easier than in A-star. Here is how I did it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I defined a field called "policy" of the same size as my grid,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
initialized it with lots of spaces.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now in my dynamic programming procedure

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
check for whether we have reached the goal state, and we have.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Then I set the corresponding element to star,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
using a single new command that just sets policy [x, y] to star.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Finally, in my big update loop where I assign an improved value to a grid cell [x, y]

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
based on its successor, I assign to the policy the character

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that corresponds to the action that led to that update over here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Put differently, as we look for a better value we look into all possible directions

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
by looping over all actions.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If one of those succeeds, I just memorize in my policy function what that action was

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
with a command over here.

00:01:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If I finally know output this, then I get this field over here.
