00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.930
In the last video, we
took the Maclaurin series

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.180
of cosine of x.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.670
We approximated it
using this polynomial.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.560
And we saw this pretty
interesting pattern.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.310
Let's see if we can
find a similar pattern

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.360
if we try to approximate sine
of x using a Maclaurin series.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.000
And once again, a
Maclaurin series

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.240
is really the same thing
as a Taylor series,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.800
where we are centering
our approximation

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.740
around x is equal to 0.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.830
So it's just a special
case of a Taylor series.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.870
So let's take f of
x in this situation

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.410
to be equal to sine of x.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.890
And let's do the same thing
that we did with cosine of x.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.598
Let's just take the
different derivatives

00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:42.450
of sine of x really fast.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.240
So if you have the first
derivative of sine of x,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.490
is just cosine of x.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.160
The second derivative
of the sine of x

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.880
is the derivative of cosine of
x, which is negative sine of x.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.790
The third derivative is going
to be the derivative of this.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.437
So I'll just write
a 3 in parentheses

00:01:00.437 --> 00:01:02.270
there, instead of doing
prime, prime, prime.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.310
So the third derivative
is the derivative

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.790
of this, which is
negative cosine of x.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.570
The fourth derivative
is the derivative

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.020
of this, which is
positive sine of x again.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.950
So you see, just like cosine
of x, it kind of cycles

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.990
after you take the
derivative enough times.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.550
And we care-- in order to do
the Maclaurin, series-- we care

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.840
about evaluating the function,
and each of these derivatives

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.450
at x is equal to 0.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.220
So let's do that.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.510
So for this, let me do this
in a different color, not

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.030
that same blue.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.320
I'll do it in this purple color.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.810
So f-- that's hard
to see, I think

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.930
So let's do this
other blue color.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.620
So f of 0, in this
situation, is 0.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.280
And f, the first derivative
evaluated at 0, is 1.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.880
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.300
Negative sine of 0
is going to be 0.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.210
So f prime prime, the second
derivative evaluated at 0 is 0.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.335
The third derivative
evaluated at 0 is negative 1.

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.411
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:09.660
You have a negative out there.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.850
It is negative 1.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.850
And then the fourth
derivative evaluated at 0

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.594
is going to be 0 again.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.385
And we could keep going,
but once again, it

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:19.593
seems like there's a pattern.

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:21.130
0, 1, 0, negative
1, 0, then you're

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.920
going to go back to positive 1.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.750
So on and so forth.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.230
So let's find its
polynomial representation

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.510
using the Maclaurin series.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.380
And just a reminder,
this one up here,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.210
this was approximately
cosine of x.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.220
And you'll get closer and
closer to cosine of x.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.960
I'm not rigorously
showing you how

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.760
close, in that it's definitely
the exact same thing as cosine

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.710
of x, but you get closer
and closer and closer

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.975
to cosine of x as you
keep adding terms here.

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:46.350
And if you go to
infinity, you're

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.920
going to be pretty
much at cosine of x.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.490
Now let's do the same
thing for sine of x.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.960
So I'll pick a new color.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.980
This green should be nice.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.820
So this is our new p of x.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.590
So this is approximately
going to be

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.600
sine of x, as we add
more and more terms.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.820
And so the first term here, f
of 0, that's just going to be 0.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.050
So we're not even going
to need to include that.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.090
The next term is
going to be f prime

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.800
of 0, which is 1, times x.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.880
So it's going to be x.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.450
Then the next term is f
prime, the second derivative

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.220
at 0, which we see here is 0.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.020
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.340
It is 0.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.610
So we won't have
the second term.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.590
This third term right
here, the third derivative

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.920
of sine of x evaluated
at 0, is negative 1.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.830
So we're now going
to have a negative 1.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.490
Let me scroll down
so you can see this.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.240
Negative 1-- this is
negative 1 in this case--

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.505
times x to the third
over 3 factorial.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.860
And then the next
term is going to be 0,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.850
because that's the
fourth derivative.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.660
The fourth derivative evaluated
at 0 is the next coefficient.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.052
We see that that is going to be
0, so it's going to drop off.

00:04:03.052 --> 00:04:04.510
And what you're
going to see here--

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.825
and actually maybe I haven't
done enough terms for you,

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:08.300
for you to feel good about this.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.330
Let me do one more
term right over here.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.690
Just so it becomes clear.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.450
f of the fifth
derivative of x is

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.440
going to be cosine of x again.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.209
The fifth derivative-- we'll
do it in that same color,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.180
just so it's consistent-- the
fifth derivative evaluated at 0

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.570
is going to be 1.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.470
So the fourth derivative
evaluated at 0 is 0,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.860
then you go to the fifth
derivative evaluated at 0,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.814
it's going to be positive 1.

00:04:38.814 --> 00:04:40.730
And if I kept doing this,
it would be positive

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.440
1-- I have to write the 1
as the coefficient-- times x

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.770
to the fifth over 5 factorial.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.530
So there's something
interesting going on here.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.500
For cosine of x, I had 1,
essentially 1 times x to the 0.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.420
Then I don't have x
to the first power.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.240
I don't have x to the
odd powers, actually.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.830
And then I just essentially have
x to all of the even powers.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.650
And whatever power it is, I'm
dividing it by that factorial.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.400
And then the sines
keep switching.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.300
I shouldn't say this is an even
power, because 0 really isn't.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.440
Well, I guess you can
view it as an even number,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.540
because-- well I won't
go into all of that.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.440
But it's essentially 0, 2,
4, 6, so on and so forth.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.200
So this is
interesting, especially

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.440
when you compare to this.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.760
This is all of the odd powers.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.060
This is x to the first
over 1 factorial.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.300
I didn't write it here.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.580
This is x to the
third over 3 factorial

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.477
plus x to the fifth
over 5 factorial.

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:35.810
Yeah, 0 would be an even number.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.830
Anyway, my brain is in a
different place right now.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.890
And you could keep going.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.190
If we kept this process
up, you would then

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.280
keep switching sines.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.200
X to the seventh over
7 factorial plus x

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.527
to the ninth over 9 factorial.

00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:51.110
So there's something
interesting here.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.280
You once again see this
kind of complimentary nature

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.930
between sine and cosine here.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.630
You see almost
this-- they're kind

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.960
of filling each
other's gaps over here.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.220
Cosine of x is all
of the even powers

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.680
of x divided by that
power's factorial.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.310
Sine of x, when you take its
polynomial representation,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.470
is all of the odd powers of
x divided by its factorial,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.100
and you switch sines.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.640
In the next video,
I'll do e to the x.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.660
And what's really
fascinating is that e

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.310
to the x starts to look like
a little bit of a combination

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.050
here, but not quite.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.790
And you really do
get the combination

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.310
when you involve
imaginary numbers.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.860
And that's when it starts to
get really, really mind blowing.
