taking out Zucco's uh orange I wonder if

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.040
taking out Zucco's uh orange I wonder if
 

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.010
taking out Zucco's uh orange I wonder if
they had a chance to go back cuz I know

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.020
they had a chance to go back cuz I know
 

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.360
they had a chance to go back cuz I know
wasn't always blue the flame wasn't

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:55.370
wasn't always blue the flame wasn't
 

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.340
wasn't always blue the flame wasn't
always blue uh in the other episodes I

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:57.350
always blue uh in the other episodes I
 

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.570
always blue uh in the other episodes I
went ahead she has to go back if they

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:58.580
went ahead she has to go back if they
 

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.360
went ahead she has to go back if they
were redone bad no cuz I think the

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:01.370
were redone bad no cuz I think the
 

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.329
were redone bad no cuz I think the
reason they did it I don't know a real

00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:04.339
reason they did it I don't know a real
 

00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:05.590
reason they did it I don't know a real
reason why I did it but one of my

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600
reason why I did it but one of my
 

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.970
reason why I did it but one of my
theories is that

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:06.980
theories is that
 

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.610
theories is that
and she goes more nuts he wanted to

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:09.620
and she goes more nuts he wanted to
 

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.990
and she goes more nuts he wanted to
separate her from the rest of the pack

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000
separate her from the rest of the pack
 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.760
separate her from the rest of the pack
and I think it does that because she's

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:12.770
and I think it does that because she's
 

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.610
and I think it does that because she's
not I mean she's always crazy but the

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:15.620
not I mean she's always crazy but the
 

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.620
not I mean she's always crazy but the
level of nuts

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:17.630
level of nuts
 

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.890
level of nuts
she's a good rover self yeah and that

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.140
she's a good rover self yeah and that
color scheme happens over the course of

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:23.150
color scheme happens over the course of
 

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.240
color scheme happens over the course of
the episode so that you know when you

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.250
the episode so that you know when you
 

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.800
the episode so that you know when you
you went from one point where she seemed

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:26.810
you went from one point where she seemed
 

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.269
you went from one point where she seemed
really powerful and now when you see her

00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.279
really powerful and now when you see her
 

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:30.460
really powerful and now when you see her
she's just gone completely insane

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:30.470

think it was really intentional no

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240
think it was really intentional no
 

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.280
think it was really intentional no
you're probably right because as she

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.290
you're probably right because as she
 

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.010
you're probably right because as she
gets more mentally ill the fight you're

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.020
gets more mentally ill the fight you're
 

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.420
gets more mentally ill the fight you're
right the fire changes color and becomes

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:43.430
right the fire changes color and becomes
 

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.880
right the fire changes color and becomes
less warm and more cold and thus it

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:45.890
less warm and more cold and thus it
 

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.019
less warm and more cold and thus it
probably not as strong either yeah it

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:49.029
probably not as strong either yeah it
 

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:51.610
probably not as strong either yeah it
