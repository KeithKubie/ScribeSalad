00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.230
When a TV show is being created with children
in mind as the target audience, you would

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.740
think that the message would be kept as light
or clear-cut as possible.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.210
But when the kids who love those shows grow
up, they start to see the straightforward

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.869
stories, characters, and messages in a brand
new light.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.290
Or darker than ever before.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:34.850
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Dark Theories That
Completely Change Popular Kids Shows.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.960
Spongebob Squarepants
This kids show has always teased some adult

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.539
jokes, starring a sponge living in Bikini
Bottom who's friends with Sandy Cheeks.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.870
But the darker theory says that the show's
characters aren't just marine life who can

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.030
walk and talk, but creatures horribly mutated
by nuclear bomb testing.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.180
Since America's nuclear testing was carried
out on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.530
the mutated fish might actually owe their
origins to the American military - if you

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.379
believe the theory.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.830
Fresh Prince of Bel Air
One little fight is all it takes to send the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.440
Fresh Prince to live with his rich aunt and
uncle in a Bel Air mansion, but according

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.810
to some fans, the Fresh Prince didn't make
it out of Philly at all.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.970
That little fight was rougher than expected,
with his "rare" cab giving him a ride to Heaven,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.079
not California.

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.479
All we know is that if the theory is true,
the Angels are a lot less accepting than we've

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.670
been told.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.869
Inspector Gadget
This mechanical cop's origin isn't all that

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.091
different from Robocop's: the show never explains
what happened to Inspector Gadget, and he

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:35.070
can't remember the accident that saw his entire
body replaced by robotic tools.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.740
One theory assumes that the show's bumbling
hero is obviously a flawed imitation of the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.210
pre-accident inspector, rebuilt to keep his
legend alive.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.399
But what of the real Gadget?

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.920
The broken, highly intelligent man who wakes
up to see he's been replaced by an idiot?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.689
The leading theory is that he took a new name
as Dr. Claw, determined to kill his replacement

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.180
by any means necessary.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.380
No wonder we never got to see his face.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.230
The Tick
The cult comic book, cartoon and TV series

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.369
based on The Tick differ from one another,
but fans of the cartoon have come up with

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.119
one truly crazy theory.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.929
The superhero is obviously a nod to Spider-Man
- but a bite from a tick won't give you superpowers...

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.979
it may only give you lyme disease.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.030
The fans claim the entire story takes place
in the mind of a young boy who's fallen ill

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.489
with just that, imagining he'll soon become
a hero himself.

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.700
It explains why the show parodied the best-known
heroes, villains, and stories, and the stranger

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.430
characters based on the everyday things the
boy has to work with.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.739
And with a character this crazy, it might
actually make sense.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.629
The Jetsons Meet The Flintstones
Everyone's favourite stone age family was

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.900
just as well-known as their futuristic counterparts,
The Jetsons - but what if the two families

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.459
weren't separated by thousands of years at
all?

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.550
What if the Jetsons just happen to live among
the future's super-rich, in cities in the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.690
sky driving flying cars, while Fred and Wilma
are forced to live like cavemen down below,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.959
with only engineered dinosaurs to use for
technology.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.799
It explains why dinosaurs can actually talk,
but in such a dark, dystopian theory, it's

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.760
no wonder fans have adopted it so quickly.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.299
Winnie the Pooh
Sure, the characters of this book and animated

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.519
series are born in the mind of Christopher
Robin, but it didn't take long for their personalities

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.280
to grab the attention of mental health experts
and psychiatrists.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.299
They soon argued that the cast offer perfect
examples of a wide range of psychiatric conditions:

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.130
Eeyore suffers from depression, Tigger is
hyperactive, Piglet succumbs to anxiety and

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.610
paranoid delusions, Rabbit shows signs of
OCD, Owl is dyslexic, and even Pooh compulsively

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.849
eats honey, no matter how much pain it may
cause him.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.380
And here we thought it was all the rampant
illusions of a young boy's mind... okay, maybe

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.439
we should have caught this one sooner.

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.250
Pinky &amp; The Brain
They started as a pair of supporting characters

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.660
on WB's Animaniacs, but these two laboratory
mice soon became stars, with one a genius,

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.660
and the other insane.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.500
But what if fans have been getting their intellects
mixed up this whole time?

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.159
Brain might seem like the genius, but his
plans to "take over the world" are usually

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.459
nonsense, and never work.

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.250
Instead, it's Pinky who sees the problems
ahead of time, and is constantly keeping Brain

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.750
from taking over anything.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.579
All this time, we never realized that Pinky
was just a weird genius defending the entire

00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.579
world.

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.450
Seems fans owe him an apology.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.969
Pokemon
Fans of the anime series know that its hero,

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.769
Ash Ketchum, never ages a day, or faces an
obstacle he can't beat.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.890
But what if the ageless Ash can't be hurt,
because he's already dead?

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.750
It's a dark theory, but not a completely unhappy
one.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.750
In the first episode, Ash and Pikachu are
almost killed by a flock of birds, before

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.400
a lightning attack wipes the birds - and Ash
- out.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.050
When the two wake up, they catch a glimpse
of a legendary Pokemon flying overhead - one

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.330
that grants eternal happiness to anyone who
sees it - as fitting a metaphor for the afterlife

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.979
as we've ever heard.

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.900
Babar
A walking, talking elephant may seem innocent,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.180
but it's hard to miss the real message at
work here.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.592
After leaving the jungle behind for Paris,
an Old Lady teaches Babar how to dress, how

00:04:38.592 --> 00:04:40.889
to read, and how to speak.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.419
When he finally returns home with this education,
Babar is chosen as the new Elephant King,

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.260
re-shaping the Jungle and the animals in the
image of western society.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.430
But remember: the story was written in turn-of-the-century
Europe, after the continent had spent centuries

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.630
trying to do the exact same thing to native
people around the world.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.680
There were lessons to learn from Babar, but
we never realized that defending colonialism

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.010
or the "civilizing" of savage people was one
of them.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.070
Saved By the Bell
Life couldn't be any better for Zack Morris:

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.930
he never has a bad day, can talk his way out
of any trouble, and is even able to stop time

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.490
itself to talk to the camera.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.509
It's too good to be true... so what if it
is?

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.330
After all, the actual title and theme song
of "saved by the bell" makes school sound

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.070
like Zack's worst nightmare, just hoping for
the bell to set him free, before his alarm

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.819
clock starts it all over again.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.710
Fans have an explanation: the show is a total
fantasy.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.810
The real Zack isn't popular, good-looking,
or powerful - what audiences see is the life

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.470
he dreams about once his actual school day
has ended.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.560
Talk about depressing... but also comforting.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.800
Nobody could ever be that cool in real life.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.780
Those are the dark and incredible fan theories
that forever changed our idea of hit childrens'

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.410
shows, but which ones did we miss?
