00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:03.935
Let's say that you are
desperate for a dollar.

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:06.763
So you come to me the local loan shark,

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:08.805
and you say hey I need
to borrow a dollar for

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:11.603
a year. I tell you I'm
in a good mood, I willing

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:14.516
to lend you that dollar
that you need for a

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:17.008
year. I will lend it to
you for the low interest

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:25.734
of 100% per year. 100% per year.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.348
How much would you have
to pay me in a year?

00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:30.203
You're going to have to pay the original

00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:33.941
principal what I lent
you plus 100% of that.

00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:37.435
Plus one other dollar.
Which is clearly going

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:44.349
to be equal to $2. You
say oh gee, that's a lot

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:48.468
to have to pay to pay back
twice what I borrowed.

00:00:48.468 --> 00:00:50.942
There's a possibility that
I might have the money

00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:54.537
in 6 months. What kind
of a deal could you get

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:56.470
me for that Mr. Loanshark?

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.742
I say oh gee, if your
willing to pay back in

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:01.074
6 months, then I'll
just charge you half the

00:01:01.074 --> 00:01:03.146
interest for half the time.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:10.284
You borrow one dollar,
so in 6 months, I will

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:18.111
charge you 50% interest.
50% interest over 6 months.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:22.691
This, of course, was 1
year. How much would you

00:01:22.691 --> 00:01:24.868
have to pay? Well, you
would have to pay the

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:26.872
original principal what you borrowed.

00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:29.601
The one dollar plus
50% of that one dollar.

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:35.299
Plus 0.50, and that of
course is equal to 1.5.

00:01:36.037 --> 00:01:39.923
That is equal to $1.50. I'll
just write it like this.

00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:44.087
$1.50. Now you say well
gee that's I guess better.

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:46.524
What happens if I don't
have the money then?

00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:49.060
If I still actually need a year.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.667
We actually have a system for that.

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.858
What I'll do is just
say that okay, you don't

00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:56.004
have the money for me
yet. I'll essentially ...

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:57.756
we could think about it.
I will just lend that

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:00.937
amount that you need for
you for another 6 months.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:02.751
We'll lend that out.

00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:05.798
We'll lend that out for
another 6 months at the

00:02:05.798 --> 00:02:10.837
same interest rate at 50%
for the next 6 months.

00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:17.324
Then you'll owe me the
principal a $1.50 plus

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:24.314
50% of the principal, plus 75
cents. Plus 75 cents, and that

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:30.517
gets us to $2.25. That equals $2.25.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:33.295
Another way of thinking
about it is to go from

00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:35.514
$1 over the first
period, you just multiply

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:38.715
that times 1.5. If your
going to grow something

00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:41.747
by 50%, you just multiply it times 1.5.

00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:43.807
If your going to grow it
by another 50%, you can

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:46.127
multiply by 1.5 again.

00:02:46.127 --> 00:02:48.400
One way of thinking about
it that 50% interest is

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.271
the same thing as multiplying by 1.5.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.397
Multiplying by 1.5.

00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:58.448
If you start with 1 and
multiply by 1.5 twice,

00:02:58.448 --> 00:03:00.804
this is going to be the same thing.

00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:06.399
$2.25 is going to be 1
multiplied by 1.5 twice.

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:12.021
1.5 multiplied twice is the
same thing as 1.5 squared.

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:13.801
You can see the same
thing right over here.

00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:17.281
This is the same thing.
100% is the same thing

00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:22.997
as multiplying by 2. As we
be multiplying 1 plus 1.

00:03:22.997 --> 00:03:26.025
This is multiplying by
2, so you could do this

00:03:26.025 --> 00:03:31.694
right over here. You could
do this as 1 times 1.

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:41.849
1 times 1 to the first ... I'm sorry
1 times 2 to the first power , because

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.180
your only doing it over
one period over that year.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.248
You say once again
where's that 2? Well, if

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:48.785
someone is asking for
100%, that means over the

00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:50.580
period you're going have to pay twice.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.320
You're going have to pay
the principal plus 100%.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.915
You're going have to pay
twice what you originally

00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:57.069
borrowed. If someone is
charging you 50% over

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.520
every period, you're
going have to pay whatever

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.246
you borrowed. That's
kind of the one part plus

00:04:02.246 --> 00:04:05.514
50% of it. So 1.5 times what
you borrowed. You multiply

00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:09.906
times 1.5 every time.
If you wanted to see how

00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:12.311
this actually related to
the interest, you could

00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:14.790
view this as ... this
right over here is equal

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.736
to 1 times, the interest
part is 1 plus 100%

00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:26.571
divided by 1 period to the first power.

00:04:26.571 --> 00:04:28.815
I know this seems like
a crazy way of rewriting

00:04:28.815 --> 00:04:31.391
what we just wrote over
here. Writing 1 plus 1,

00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.855
but you'll see that we
can keep writing this

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:36.185
as we compound over different periods.

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:38.737
This one right over here, we can rewrite.

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:44.993
We can write as 1 times 1 plus 100%.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.736
Here we took our 100% for the year, and we

00:04:47.736 --> 00:04:50.403
divided into 2 periods.
Two 6 month periods.

00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:54.094
Each of them at 50%. 1
plus 100% over 2 is the

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:58.801
same thing as 1.5, and
we compounded it over

00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:01.121
2 periods. Let me do that
2 periods into a different

00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:05.516
color. The periods, let
me do in this orange

00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:08.525
color right over here.
You might start to see a

00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:10.604
pattern forming. Let's
say, well gee, I might

00:05:10.604 --> 00:05:13.017
have the money back in
... and you don't really

00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:15.326
like this. This is
$2.25. That was more than

00:05:15.326 --> 00:05:17.934
the original $2, so you
say, well what if we do

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:20.400
this over every 12
months. I say, "Sure. We

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.126
got a program for that."

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:26.432
After every 12 months
... or after every month

00:05:26.432 --> 00:05:31.355
I should say, I'm just
going to charge you 100%

00:05:31.355 --> 00:05:38.525
divided by 12 interest.
This is equal to 8 1/3%.

00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:44.731
Having to pay back the
principal plus 8 1/3%,

00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:50.463
that's the same thing as
multiplying times 1.083 repeating.

00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:55.658
After 1 month you would
have to pay 1.083 repeating.

00:05:55.658 --> 00:05:59.589
After 2 months ... and
this isn't the scale

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.188
that actually looks
more than 2 months, but

00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:04.462
it's not completely at
scale. After 2 months

00:06:04.462 --> 00:06:06.792
your going have to multiply by this again.

00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:11.689
Times 1.083 repeating,
and so that would get you

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:18.066
1.083 repeating squared.
If you went all the way

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:20.614
down 12 months ... let
me get myself some space

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:24.869
here. If you went all the way
down 12 months ... let me just.

00:06:27.607 --> 00:06:30.043
I should way from the
beginning 12 months, so

00:06:30.043 --> 00:06:32.429
another 10 months.
What's the total interest

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:34.397
you would have to pay
over a year if you weren't

00:06:34.397 --> 00:06:35.866
able to keep coming up with the money?

00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:37.399
If you had to keep re-borrowing it.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.340
I kept compounding that interest.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.436
Well, you're going have
to pay 1.083 to the ...

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:47.932
this is for 1 month. You
could view this as to

00:06:47.932 --> 00:06:50.858
the first power. This is
for 2 months, so you're

00:06:50.858 --> 00:06:53.202
going have to pay this to the 12th power.

00:06:53.202 --> 00:06:56.667
We have compounded over
12 periods, 8 1/3% over

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:58.939
12 periods. If you wanted
to write it in this

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.472
form right over here,
this would be the same

00:07:01.472 --> 00:07:03.470
thing as the original principal.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:12.028
Our original principal
times 1 plus 100% divided

00:07:12.028 --> 00:07:17.136
by 12. Now we've divided
our 100% into 12 periods,

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:20.604
and we're going to compound that 12 times.

00:07:20.604 --> 00:07:26.665
We're going to take
that to the 12th power.

00:07:26.665 --> 00:07:28.739
What is this going to
equal to? This buisness

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:31.823
over here. We can get a
calculator out for that.

00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:36.015
I'll get my TI-85 out.
What is this going to be

00:07:36.015 --> 00:07:38.535
equal to? We could do it a couple of ways.

00:07:38.535 --> 00:07:43.869
This is 1.083 repeating.
Let's get our calculator

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:47.123
out. We could do it a couple of
ways. Let me write it this way.

00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:50.128
Your going to get the same value.
I don't have to rewrite this one.

00:07:50.128 --> 00:07:52.460
I just did that there to
kind of hopefully you'd

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.756
see the kind of structure
in this expression.

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:58.347
1 plus ... 100% is the same thing as 1.

00:07:58.347 --> 00:08:09.600
1 divided by 12 to the 12th
power. 2.613, I'll just round.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:16.527
So approximately 2.613.
You say well this is an

00:08:16.527 --> 00:08:17.929
interesting game you all most forgot about

00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:19.597
your financial troubles,
and you're just intrigued

00:08:19.597 --> 00:08:21.861
by what happens if we keep going this.

00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:25.101
Here we compounded just
... we have 100% over

00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:27.726
here. Here we do 50%
every 6 months. Here we

00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:32.186
do a 12th of 100%, 8 1/3% every 12 months

00:08:32.186 --> 00:08:33.532
until we get to this number.

00:08:33.532 --> 00:08:35.432
What happens if we did every day?

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.196
Every day.

00:08:37.196 --> 00:08:39.266
If I borrowed a one
dollar, and I'd say well

00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:41.263
gee I'm just going to ... each
day I'm going to charge you

00:08:41.263 --> 00:08:45.683
charge you one three hundred
sixty-fifth of a 100%.

00:08:45.683 --> 00:08:50.861
So, 100% divided 365,
and I'm going to compound

00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:56.013
that 365 times. You're
curious mathematically.

00:08:56.013 --> 00:08:57.332
You say well, what do we get then?

00:08:57.332 --> 00:09:01.132
What do we get after a year?

00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:03.595
You have your original
principal. Let me scroll

00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:05.931
over a little bit more to the
right, so we have more space.

00:09:05.931 --> 00:09:08.200
You're going to have
your original principal

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.933
times 1 plus 100% divided
by not 12. Now we've

00:09:14.933 --> 00:09:18.095
divided the 100% into 365 periods.

00:09:18.095 --> 00:09:22.869
365 periods. We're going to compound it.

00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:26.197
Every time we have to
multiply by 1 plus 100%

00:09:26.197 --> 00:09:29.532
over 365 everyday that
the loan is not paid.

00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:33.663
365th power.

00:09:33.663 --> 00:09:35.797
You say oh gee taking
somebody to 365th power

00:09:35.797 --> 00:09:38.599
that's going to give me some huge number.

00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:40.869
Then you say well maybe
not so bad, because

00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:44.012
100% divided by 365 is
going to be a small number.

00:09:44.012 --> 00:09:46.062
This thing is going to
be reasonable close to 1.

00:09:46.062 --> 00:09:48.197
Obviously, we can raise
1 to whatever power we

00:09:48.197 --> 00:09:49.863
want, and we don't get anything crazy.

00:09:49.863 --> 00:09:51.596
Let's see where this one goes.

00:09:51.596 --> 00:09:53.865
Let's see where this one goes.

00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:57.596
This is the same thing
as 1 plus. 100% is the

00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:05.692
same thing as 1 divided
by 365 to the 365th power.

00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:15.710
We get 2.71456. Let me put
it over here. Then we get ...

00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:22.730
This is approximately equal
to ... this approximate

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.901
is a very precise
approximation, but 2.7 ...

00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:30.260
but my calculators
precision only goes so far.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:36.827
2.7145675 and it keeps going on and on.

00:10:36.827 --> 00:10:38.860
This is really really
interesting. It looks

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.570
as if we take larger
and larger numbers here,

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.594
it just doesn't just
balloon into some crazy

00:10:43.594 --> 00:10:46.865
ginormous number. It seems
to be approaching some

00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:50.651
magical and mystical
number. It is, in fact,

00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:53.659
the case. That if you
would just take larger and

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:55.661
larger ... if you were
to take your 100% and

00:10:55.661 --> 00:10:57.324
divide by larger and
larger numbers, but take

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:59.656
it to that power, you're going to approach

00:10:59.656 --> 00:11:02.721
perhaps the most magical
and mystical number

00:11:02.721 --> 00:11:06.829
of all. The number E.
You can see it right over

00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:09.410
here in your calculator.
They have this E to the X.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.526
I can do that, so E to
the ... I'll raise it to

00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:14.194
the first power so you can look at the

00:11:14.194 --> 00:11:16.122
calculators internal representation of it.

00:11:16.122 --> 00:11:19.189
You see all ready raising
some ... doing 1 plus 1

00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:21.922
over 365 to the 365th power, we got

00:11:21.922 --> 00:11:24.826
pretty ... we're starting
to get really really

00:11:24.826 --> 00:11:27.997
close to E. I encourage
you try this with larger

00:11:27.997 --> 00:11:29.660
and larger numbers, and your going to get

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.414
closer and closer to this magical mystery.

00:11:32.414 --> 00:11:33.997
You almost wouldn't mind
paying the loan shark

00:11:33.997 --> 00:11:36.527
E dollars, because it's
such a beautiful number.
