00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.790
The hardest part of a script to nail is the
ending.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.200
Everything has been building up to this one
moment, and if the writer doesn’t deliver,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.750
the movie could be doomed.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.710
Audiences love finality in movies, and prefer
it if they understand what happened in a film.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.110
But sometimes, the conclusion throws them
for a loop, and they’re more concerned about

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.360
figuring out those last moments than anything
else.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.090
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 confusing movie
endings finally explained.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.090
Inception

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.329
One of the most famous movie images this decade
is Cobb’s top spinning on the table before

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090
Inception cuts hard to black.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.970
This launched countless theories debating
whether Cobb was in a dream or reality.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.760
But audiences were missing the point.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.649
An interpretation Christopher Nolan agrees
with suggests the point of the scene isn’t

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.649
to tell where Cobb is.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.649
It represents an arc in his mindset.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.329
After concerning himself with the “dream
or reality” query, Cobb simply didn’t

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450
care after seeing his kids and walked away
from the top.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.249
No matter where the hero is, he got the happy
ending he deserved.

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:58.249
American Psycho

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.199
This is another case where audiences are left
wondering if the events actually happened

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.969
or all took place in the main character’s
head.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.110
When he confesses his grisly crimes, Patrick
Bateman is simply ignored by those he tells,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.860
hinting that it was all a hallucination.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.470
The author of the source novel says if that
were the case, the entire point of the book

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.470
would be moot.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.390
American Psycho is a satire tale poking fun
at the shallow mindset of yuppie culture.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.580
The reaction to Bateman’s confession shows
that even when a serial killer owns up, nobody

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.280
cares since it doesn’t effect them directly.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.300
No Country for Old Men

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.550
After failing to capture notorious killer
Anton Chigurh, retiring sheriff Ed Tom Bell

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.070
recalls a dream he had about seeing his father
riding past, going somewhere to set a fire.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.530
The movie fades to black when he’s done
telling his story, so many were left wondering

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.530
what just happened.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.660
Bell is reflecting upon his life and realizes
that it’s time for him to move on and join

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.130
his father wherever he went to light that
fire.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.700
Viewers were so invested in the Llewelyn vs.
Chigurh pursuit that they missed the main

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.700
theme of the film.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.800
It’s all there in the title.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800
Interstellar

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.840
In this space epic’s third act, Cooper drops
himself into a black hole and lands in a fifth

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.290
dimensional tesseract placed by future humans.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.070
He uses his love for his daughter Murph to
communicate back to Earth and save mankind.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.940
How did the tesseract get there?

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.670
One explanation is that the movie deals with
alternate realities and universes, making

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.500
a non-linear timeline possible.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.099
The “present day” humans were in dire
times during Interstellar, so it’s unlikely

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.360
they became the same “future” humans depicted.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.620
Beings from another dimension were reaching
out to lend a helping hand.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.620
For what?

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.349
We’ll leave that up to you.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.349
The Wrestler

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.020
The final image of Darren Aronofksy’s sports
drama is protagonist Randy jumping off the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.010
ropes and then cutting to the end credits.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.950
His fate is left up to the viewer, but there’s
strong evidence that he dies in the match.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.650
Randy has a serious heart condition and is
told by doctors continuing wrestling could

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.650
kill him.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.079
But Randy has damaged all relationships he
has and goes back to the ring where he can

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.079
feel alive.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.480
Aronofsky even agrees with this interpretation,
saying in an interview “if not now, when?”

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.379
in regards to Randy’s death.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.680
Shutter Island

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.989
Leo DiCaprio sure likes to keep viewers guessing.

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.579
In Shutter Island, his Teddy Daniels is in
for a rude awakening when he learns he’s

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.250
actually a patient at the Ashecliffe Institute,
following the trauma he suffered when his

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.099
wife murdered herself and their children.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.299
At long last, his doctors think his illness
is cured, but Teddy appears to relapse, leading

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.299
to a haunting lobotomy.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.299
But Teddy’s last words are a major clue.

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.939
In his mind, living as the monster who killed
his family would be worse than dying as the

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:23.719
good man who came to terms with it all.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:24.719
Total Recall

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.950
When Quaid’s adventure plays out a little
too close to the description offered by the

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.749
Rekall officials, many are wondering if the
events were all just a dream.

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:35.099
It was intentionally left ambiguous, but director
Paul Verhoeven believes it all took place

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.099
in the hero’s head.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.739
This could happen by Quaid’s mind having
a violent reaction to the implant process

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.129
and incorporating things from real life to
populate the dream.

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.599
The name of the program is even Blue Skies
on Mars, and love interest Melinda is a fantasy

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.749
girl that Quaid chose himself before the implant.

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.439
Things are just a tad coincidental for it
to all be real.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.079
2001: A Space Odyssey

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.620
The floating star child that’s featured
in 2001’s final shot is a part of cinematic

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.260
history, but what does it all mean?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.879
Stanley Kubrick himself tried to provide some
answers.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.010
The entire film serves as a metaphor for mankind’s
evolution, beginning with the apes billions

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.419
of years ago and working up to futuristic
intergalactic travel.

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.541
The main astronaut Bowman is reborn as an
enhanced being and returns to Earth to take

00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:15.969
the next big step for the species.

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:20.380
In a way, that’s inspiring, since it portrays
everything as hopeful and always looking ahead

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.959
to better ourselves.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.959
Birdman

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:26.740
When recovering from his self-inflicted gunshot
wound in the hospital, actor Riggan Thomson

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.490
opens the window of his room and we never
see him again.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.360
The last shot is his daughter Sam looking
out that same window, smiling at something

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360
in the sky.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.550
One possible theory is that Riggan committed
suicide by jumping out the window, at peace

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.199
with himself after he starred in an acclaimed
Broadway play.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.270
What Sam sees is her father’s free spirit
floating up to the heavens for eternity, and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.310
she’s happy for him.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.490
It’s dark, but it gives Birdman a poignant
finale that taps into strong emotions.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.490
Memento

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.050
We’re not done with you, Chris Nolan.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.870
In the director’s breakout hit, he takes
viewers on a non-linear journey that shows

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.740
how Teddy became Leonard’s John G. Teddy
reveals that Leonard killed the “real”

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:10.919
John G. a while back, and has been hunting
others so Teddy can get rid of some bad guys

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:11.990
and keep Leonard happy.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.830
There’s a photograph of Leonard that suggests
Teddy’s telling the truth, and Leonard even

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.440
admits he lies to himself sometimes.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.949
If he’s willing to bend the truth to fit
his needs, it’s not out of the question

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.760
he would change his target to Teddy.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.680
These are our best explanations for the most
confusing endings in popular films.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.680
Are there any we missed?

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.050
