00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.610
- [Instructor] The goal of
this video is to appreciate

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.328
some of the structures that you see

00:00:04.328 --> 00:00:07.161
even in unicellular organisms.

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:09.413
So this right over here
is a picture of the amoeba

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:10.913
Chaos carolinense.

00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:14.754
And what you see here is
a projection coming off

00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:16.867
from the main part of the cell,

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.119
and this is called a pseudopod,

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.975
which is referring to
it being a false foot.

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:24.947
The pod is coming from the
same root word as podiatry,

00:00:24.947 --> 00:00:26.874
which is referring to the foot.

00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:28.198
And what I really want you to appreciate,

00:00:28.198 --> 00:00:31.193
this is used by amoeba
either to move around

00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:33.469
or it could be even
used to attack something

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.257
that it wants to engulf.

00:00:35.257 --> 00:00:38.275
And think about what it might
take to be able to do this,

00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:40.899
to be able to grow this
type of a pseudo foot,

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.664
this type of a false foot.

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:45.961
You need all sorts of
microstructures in here

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.492
that will extend or contract as necessary.

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:50.605
And think about the machinery
that you need to do that.

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:52.277
And so the key realization is,

00:00:52.277 --> 00:00:54.901
sometimes we just imagine cells as these

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:57.525
bags of fluid with a few
things floating around.

00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:59.940
But they're these incredibly
complex structures,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.401
and biologists even today
don't fully understand

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.235
how everything works and they're studying

00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:07.417
how these things actually come to be.

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:09.460
Now another structure
that you'll often see

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.477
in unicellular organisms that
either help them move around

00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:18.307
or even help move other
things around are cilia.

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:22.602
So this right over here is a
picture of Oxytricha trifallax,

00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:24.390
which is a unicellular organism.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.714
It's a eukaryote.

00:01:25.714 --> 00:01:27.200
And you can clearly see these projections

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.640
from its body here,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.079
these hairlike structures.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.703
Remember this is a unicellular organism.

00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:34.561
If we were to, it's actually a fairly,

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.163
it's a decent sized one.

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:39.112
That would be about, something
like that would be about

00:01:39.112 --> 00:01:41.828
30 micrometers right over there

00:01:41.828 --> 00:01:44.754
or 30 millionths of a
meter or 30 thousandths

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:46.124
of a millimeter.

00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:47.959
So small by our scale, but
it's actually pretty big

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.699
on the scale of it being a cell.

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.856
And once again, these cilia
tend to move in unison

00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:56.852
to either allow the
microorganism to move around

00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:59.986
or sometimes they're used
to move other things around.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:02.123
For examples the cells
that line your lungs

00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:05.002
will have cilia that
are used to move things

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.137
up or down, to move some of
the saliva or any particles

00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:10.157
that are in there.

00:02:10.157 --> 00:02:13.477
Now Oxytricha trifallax is
particularly interesting

00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:17.192
as a eukaryote because it
doesn't just have one nucleus.

00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:19.468
It can have two nuclei.

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:21.001
And within the nucleus,

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.648
it's DNA can be extremely fragmented.

00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:25.784
Most organisms have

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:28.361
a reasonable number of chromosomes.

00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:30.381
Human beings have 23 pair.

00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:32.634
That's actually a fairly large number.

00:02:32.634 --> 00:02:37.208
Oxytricha trifallax could
have thousands of chromosomes.

00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:39.994
And what's really interesting
about Oxytricha trifallax

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:41.643
is how it mates.

00:02:41.643 --> 00:02:43.268
When it is under stress,

00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:46.589
it will merge with another
Oxytricha trifallax,

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.911
and instead of producing
another offspring,

00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:51.349
they mingle their DNA together.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.902
So by mating, they change
each other's genetic makeup,

00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:56.643
which is fascinating.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.104
And depending on your
perspective, highly romantic.

00:02:59.104 --> 00:03:01.310
Now another related idea
is instead of having

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.840
many cilia, some unicellular
organisms will just have

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.067
one large thing that looks like a tail

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:11.504
that they can whip around to move.

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:15.405
So this right over here is a
commonly studied green algae.

00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:17.634
It's called Chlamydomonas,

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:20.537
and you can see very
clearly here this flagellum,

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:22.766
this tail-like structure.

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:24.852
And this is extremely thin.

00:03:24.852 --> 00:03:27.732
We're seeing it under a
very powerful microscope

00:03:27.732 --> 00:03:28.893
right over here,

00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:31.540
but just to get a sense of scale.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.394
A micrometer here would be about that.

00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:37.507
So the width of this flagellum,

00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:38.761
flagellum would be the singular.

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:40.061
If we were talking about many of these,

00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.803
we would say flagella.

00:03:41.803 --> 00:03:45.193
This is about 1/4 of a micrometer.

00:03:45.193 --> 00:03:46.238
Another way of thinking about it,

00:03:46.238 --> 00:03:48.978
you could put 4,000 of these side by side,

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.021
and you would have the
width of a millimeter.

00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:52.647
So extremely extremely small,

00:03:52.647 --> 00:03:54.899
but once again, it really is amazing

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.685
that these what seem like
simple organisms to us

00:03:57.685 --> 00:03:59.148
are actually quite complex.

00:03:59.148 --> 00:04:02.910
There's a whole study of how
these flagella move around,

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.811
how the cell can spin it
around so it allows it to move.

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:09.063
If you were to actually
decompose what's going on

00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:10.596
in this part of the cell,

00:04:10.596 --> 00:04:12.128
it's actually quite complex.

00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:14.055
It's biological machinery going on.

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:17.144
So once again, these
cells are not these just

00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:19.350
bags of just a few things floating around.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.068
They're incredibly complex structures

00:04:21.068 --> 00:04:24.318
that we are still trying to understand.
