00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.540
Ah, just a little mindful meditation to relax
the brain.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.680
Man, this feels great!

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.340
Oh.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.080
Eugh.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.000
Mindful meditation is the latest cure-all
for, well, just about anything.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.580
Do you want to eat better?

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.100
Cure your back pain?

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.240
Become rich?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.619
Well, then close those eyes, take a deep breath
and...do nothing, really.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.259
The news is full of headlines about mindful
meditation, and that’s not surprising since

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.220
scientists have been researching the practice
and coming up with some promising observations.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.300
Some of which are really cool, like increasing
the grey matter in your brain cool.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.859
But not everyone is sold.

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.219
A group of 15 psychologists and cognitive
scientists have published an article that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.680
highlights the weaknesses in the current research
on meditation.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.710
So what’s going on?

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.120
Is mindful meditation good for you or not?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.060
Mindful meditation has its roots in Buddhism,
but was made popular in the West in the 1970s

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.300
by Jon Kabat-Zinn, a molecular biologist who
used the technique as a method to reduce stress.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.040
Interest in the practice has particularly surged in the past 20 years in both the scientific community

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.379
and in the media.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.600
And hey, full disclosure, I’ve tried it.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.740
And it wasn’t in a temple or a church.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.920
I went to a group meditation class led by
doctoral students in a medical center.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.680
And it was good.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.660
I felt a lot better.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.960
So I was bummed to see this article about
the problems with mindful meditation studies.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.900
And, man, there were problems.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.600
The article points out that only around 9%
of the research surveyed used a control group

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.770
to account for placebo.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.600
Less than 25% bothered to look for any negative
side effects of mindful meditation.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.300
And a 2014 review of 47 trials showed no benefits
for substance abuse, aiding sleep, or weight

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.380
control, which is not great considering these
headlines about meditation helping with

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.780
substance abuse, sleep, and weight control.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.640
But the real sticking point for the researchers, has to do with defining the term

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.760
“mindful meditation”.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.120
And that’s because, well, there isn’t
one clear definition.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.189
At least not in scientific research.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.350
I mean a general way to describe it is directing your attention to the present moment without

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.820
any judgment or reaction.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.040
Just being.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.560
But that definition isn’t consistent across
all studies.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.910
I mean sometimes there are definitions focusing
on your breathing, or how you’re sitting,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.620
or what your posture is.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.500
This makes comparing data from different studies
incredibly difficult.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.860
On top of all this, researchers were also
concerned with how the media is reporting

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.860
on mindful meditation.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.519
Most of the time, they’re lauding the practice
as a magic cure for all ailments.

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.319
So the researchers worry that overstating
the benefits of meditation could potentially

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.319
lead to harm.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.530
Like, you probably won’t be able to meditate
away your high cholesterol.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.890
That might deserves some traditional medical attention.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.810
Now this doesn’t mean the researchers see
no benefit from mindful meditation.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.470
They point out a couple of studies that have
encouraging data about relieving anxiety,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.790
depression, and pain.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.810
They also had no problem with the methodology
of a study that showed increased thickness

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.599
in the prefrontal cortex, which again, that’s
pretty cool.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.580
So no one here saying don’t meditate.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.520
It might just be helping your mental and physical
health.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.440
Just have some tempered expectations while
doing so.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.200
So, maybe we don’t know if meditation can treat drug addiction, but maybe a vaccine can?
