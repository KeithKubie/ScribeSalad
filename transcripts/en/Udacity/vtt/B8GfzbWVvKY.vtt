Hey, everyone.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.770
My name's Jared.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.960
&gt;&gt; My name's Gabrielle.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.770
&gt;&gt; And my name is Jessica.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.670
In the coming weeks and months, you are
going to be learning the foundational

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.660
skills used every day by iOS developers.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.280
You'll also be learning
the Swift programming language.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.790
Which is Apple's custom language
designed for iOS, Mac OS and

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.170
watchOS development.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.430
&gt;&gt; Before going any further,
you'll need to download and

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.600
install the core tool for
any iOS developer, Xcode.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.230
Xcode is Apple's Integrated
Development Environment,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.540
which in layman's terms is the place
where you build your apps.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.260
Downloading Xcode is simple.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.810
It's available for
free on the App Store app on your Mac.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.950
&gt;&gt; If you need any additional help,
you can find instructions below.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.120
Depending on your Internet speed
however, this download can take a while.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.330
But don't worry, go ahead and
grab something to drink.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.980
We'll have some things to keep
you busy in the meantime.
