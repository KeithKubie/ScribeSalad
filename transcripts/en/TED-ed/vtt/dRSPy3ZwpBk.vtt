00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:07.663
I was walking my mountain the other day,

00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:10.747
and I was feeling really at home with the forest.

00:00:10.747 --> 00:00:12.458
And I was so grateful to it

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:15.212
for showing me that forests are built on relationships

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:17.831
which form networks,

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:19.746
like these beautiful river networks.

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:20.967
And I thought,

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:25.184
"Wow, forests are just like human families."

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:27.224
And I was so taken by the beauty of this idea

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:29.558
that I fell and I crashed down on the ground,

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:31.895
and I hit my head on this new stump.

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:34.100
And I was so angry!

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.030
Then, I was so heartbroken

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.901
because there was a whole family of trees cut down.

00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.960
Thing is, where I'm from in Western Canada,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.659
there's clearcuts like this hidden everywhere,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.410
and it wasn't until Google Earth starting sending images,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.956
like this,

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:51.707
that we realized the whole world

00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:54.631
was wiping its noses on our old-growth forests.

00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:56.264
Did you know

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.376
that deforestation like this around the world

00:00:58.376 --> 00:01:00.599
causes more greenhouse gas emissions

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:04.698
than all the trains, planes and automobiles combined?

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.209
Yeah, I'm really upset about this,

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:08.930
but I'm also really hopeful

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.449
because I've also discovered in my research

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:15.349
that forest networks are organized

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:17.802
in the same way as our own neural networks

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:19.680
and our social networks.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.766
And I believe that if we can learn to integrate these into a whole

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:27.508
that we can change this dangerous pathway of global warming

00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:30.786
because I believe we are wired for healing.

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:32.712
So, here's the science:

00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:35.079
The most ancient of these networks

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.579
is this below-ground fungal network, or mushroom network.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.746
And it evolved over a billion years ago

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:45.679
to allow organisms to migrate from the ocean onto the land.

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.502
And eventually, they got together with plants

00:01:47.502 --> 00:01:49.848
in this symbiosis.

00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:53.619
And this allowed plants to photosynthesize,

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.374
pulling CO2, which is our biggest greenhouse gas,

00:01:56.374 --> 00:01:59.023
out of the atmosphere and giving off oxygen,

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:01.036
which allows us to breathe

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:04.348
and actually allowed humans to eventually evolve.

00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:08.229
Now, we call this symbiosis a mycorrhiza,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.492
myco for fungus, rrhiza for root.

00:02:10.492 --> 00:02:12.328
So, the fungus and root get together,

00:02:12.328 --> 00:02:15.131
and they trade for mutual benefit.

00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:18.834
Now, all trees in all forests all over the world

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:21.822
depend on these mycorrhizas for their very survival.

00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:24.044
They can't live without them.

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:25.509
And the way it works

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.509
is that a seed falls on the forest floor,

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:28.628
it germinates,

00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:30.429
it sends a root down into the soil,

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.794
and it starts sending out chemical signals

00:02:32.794 --> 00:02:36.019
to the fungi to grow towards the root.

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.895
And the fungus communicates back

00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:39.648
with its own signals,

00:02:39.648 --> 00:02:41.064
and it says to the root,

00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:43.545
'You need to grow towards me and branch and soften.'

00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:45.234
And so by this communication,

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:49.377
they grow together into this magical symbiosis.

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.577
And the way that symbiosis works

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:55.044
is the plant takes its hard-earned carbon from photosynthesis

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:57.248
and brings it to the fungus

00:02:57.248 --> 00:02:59.750
because the fungus can't photosynthesize.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.947
And the fungus takes nutrients and water it gathers from the soil,

00:03:02.947 --> 00:03:05.172
where plant roots can't grow,

00:03:05.172 --> 00:03:07.507
and they give it to the plant.

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:11.053
And so they're both benefiting in this cooperation.

00:03:11.053 --> 00:03:13.347
Now, as the fungus grows through the soil,

00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:15.310
it starts linking plant and plant

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.886
and tree and tree together

00:03:16.886 --> 00:03:19.395
until the whole forest is linked together.

00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:21.480
Did you know that a single tree

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.192
can be literally linked up to hundreds of other trees

00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:28.156
as far as the eye can see?

00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:31.155
And as you're walking through the forest,

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:35.827
what you see, the trees, the roots, the mushrooms,

00:03:35.827 --> 00:03:37.358
are just the tip of the iceberg.

00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:39.192
Under a single footstep,

00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:43.543
there are 300 miles of fungal cells

00:03:43.543 --> 00:03:46.131
stacked end on end moving stuff around.

00:03:46.131 --> 00:03:48.039
And if you could look down into the ground,

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.613
it would be like this super highway

00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:51.524
with cars going everywhere.

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:55.306
Now, all networks are made of nodes and links.

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:57.223
In forests, those nodes would be trees

00:03:57.223 --> 00:03:58.776
and the links fungi.

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:00.613
It's kind of like in your Facebook network,

00:04:00.613 --> 00:04:03.063
where nodes would be friends

00:04:03.063 --> 00:04:05.690
and links would be your friendships.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.638
Now, we all know that some of those nodes,

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:08.721
or friends,

00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:09.971
are busier than others,

00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:12.402
like that friend who is always sending out group messages.

00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:14.784
Well, it's the same in forests,

00:04:14.784 --> 00:04:16.243
and these nodes in forests,

00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:17.952
we call them hubs,

00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:19.830
they're the big trees in the forests

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.887
with roots going everywhere.

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.417
Now, we also have learned

00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:27.388
that the systems organized around these hubs,

00:04:27.388 --> 00:04:28.971
these big old trees,

00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:31.383
so in forests, that's where the regeneration occurs.

00:04:31.383 --> 00:04:33.052
In your Facebook network,

00:04:33.052 --> 00:04:34.596
that might be how parties are organized,

00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:37.137
around that hub that's always sending out the group messages.

00:04:37.137 --> 00:04:40.184
We call those hubs in forests mother trees;

00:04:40.184 --> 00:04:43.271
they're the big old trees in the forest.

00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:45.022
And they fix the carbon in their leaves,

00:04:45.022 --> 00:04:47.358
and they send it down through their massive trunks

00:04:47.358 --> 00:04:50.554
and into the networks all around them

00:04:50.554 --> 00:04:52.138
that are linked up to all the other trees

00:04:52.138 --> 00:04:54.555
and seedlings, the young ones,

00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:57.833
and they start sending that carbon everywhere.

00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:59.912
The more those seedlings are stressed out,

00:04:59.912 --> 00:05:01.721
maybe from drought or shade,

00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:03.916
the more the mother tree sends to them.

00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:06.487
It's kind of like in your families,

00:05:06.487 --> 00:05:07.910
where if you're kind of stressed out,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.972
mom and dad kick in and help you out a bit more, right?

00:05:10.972 --> 00:05:12.924
Well, it's the same in forests.

00:05:12.924 --> 00:05:16.178
The other thing that we've recently discovered

00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:19.054
is that mother trees will preferentially send

00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:23.186
more signals to her own kids, her own children.

00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:25.970
And then, this way she helps them do better,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.639
and then they survive more,

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.443
and then they can pass their genes on to future generations.

00:05:30.443 --> 00:05:32.971
So, how natural selection works.

00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:35.239
Now, the way these forests are organized

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:38.783
makes them both resilient and vulnerable.

00:05:38.783 --> 00:05:40.786
They're resilient because there's many mother trees,

00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:44.304
and there's many fungal species linking them together.

00:05:44.304 --> 00:05:47.324
And that network is really hard to break.

00:05:47.324 --> 00:05:49.002
It's pretty darn tough.

00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:50.169
But of course,

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.923
we humans have figured out how to do that.

00:05:51.923 --> 00:05:54.476
And what we do is we take out the mother trees.

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:57.011
And maybe taking one out won't make much difference

00:05:57.011 --> 00:05:58.846
but when you take more and more and more

00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:00.681
and clearcut and more and more and more

00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:04.388
that it can cause the system to collapse and fall down,

00:06:04.388 --> 00:06:06.887
like dominoes.

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:08.857
And we can cross tipping points

00:06:08.857 --> 00:06:11.320
and cause more forest death and more global warming,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.304
and we're doing that.

00:06:13.304 --> 00:06:14.971
So what we do,

00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:16.323
our choices we make,

00:06:16.323 --> 00:06:19.980
can lead us towards global heatlh or global sickness.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.880
We do have choices.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.663
And I'm going to leave you with four ideas

00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:25.387
that I think are worth spreading.

00:06:25.387 --> 00:06:26.665
First one:

00:06:26.665 --> 00:06:27.828
To love the forest

00:06:27.828 --> 00:06:29.403
you have to go spend time in it.

00:06:29.403 --> 00:06:31.253
Go be in the forest, connect with it.

00:06:31.253 --> 00:06:33.637
And then you'll fight hard enough to protect them.

00:06:33.637 --> 00:06:34.642
Second:

00:06:34.642 --> 00:06:35.974
Learn how they work.

00:06:35.974 --> 00:06:37.725
Learn how those networks link things together

00:06:37.725 --> 00:06:39.221
in organized forests.

00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:40.138
And to do that,

00:06:40.138 --> 00:06:41.764
you gotta go out there take risks, make mistakes.

00:06:41.764 --> 00:06:43.208
Third:

00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:44.678
Protect forests.

00:06:44.678 --> 00:06:46.106
They need you to do that

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.304
because they can't do it themselves.

00:06:47.304 --> 00:06:49.054
They're stuck in one spot.

00:06:49.054 --> 00:06:50.722
They can't run away from humans,

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:52.639
and they can't run away from global warming.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.306
They need you.

00:06:54.306 --> 00:06:55.779
And finally,

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:57.321
and most importantly,

00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.649
use your own very clever, brilliant,

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:04.203
neural and social networks to create amazing messages,

00:07:04.203 --> 00:07:07.554
and spread the word that forests are worth saving

00:07:07.554 --> 00:07:09.291
because you're worth saving,

00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:10.638
and I believe that together

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:12.419
we're all wired for healing.
