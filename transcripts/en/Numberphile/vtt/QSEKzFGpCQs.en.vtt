00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.480
DR. TONY PADILLA: The GIMPS
have been at it again.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.230
They've found a new prime
number, the largest prime

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.050
number that's been
found to date.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.830
The GIMPS, of course, are the
Great Internet Mersenne Prime

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.510
Search team, a network of
computers and people that work

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.415
on these computers that look
for large Mersenne primes.

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:21.840
It's a pretty big number, 2 to
the power-- now, I've got to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.440
remember this, now--

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:31.510
57,885,161 minus 1.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.385
So the 57,885,161 is
a prime number.

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:38.920
But this bad boy, the whole
thing, is also a

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.830
prime number, of course.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.835
It's a much bigger one.

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:42.740
And that is the largest
prime number ever

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.620
to have been found.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.970
It's the 48th Mersenne
prime ever to have

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.620
been found as well.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.610
BRADY HARAN: Can you remind us
what a Mersenne prime is?

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.030
DR. TONY PADILLA: Yes.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.050
So essentially, the Mersenne
prime-- you just take 2.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.750
You take it to some power, P--

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.140
and this is a prime
number-- minus 1.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.580
And that's your Mersenne
prime.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.660
It's pretty interesting how
they've gone about finding

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.209
this, as well.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.610
There's various things
about it.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.640
For example, the way
it's done is they

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.900
have this GIMPS network.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.210
They're a network of
shared computers.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.150
And they use their combined
computing power to basically

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.510
work out, try and find
these prime numbers.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.740
So it's quite interesting, this
sort of collaboration

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.110
going on to find these things.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.940
From my point of view, it's
actually reminiscent of

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.020
something that they do at the
LHC to manage the data.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.180
They basically use a network of
computers around the world

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.310
to analyze that data.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.160
So it's not always academics
that are finding these things.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.390
Anybody can get involved
in the project.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.340
And there's money on the table,
as well, when it comes

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.490
to finding these things.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.160
Curtis Cooper will win--

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.660
it looks like $3,000 for
finding this number.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.290
It's a bit of a shame
for him because

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.780
this number, actually--

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.240
well, it has this many digits.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.460
It's this many digits long.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:08.180
It is 17,425,170 digits
long, I think.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.650
The reason this is a little bit
annoying for Curtis Cooper

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.710
is that it's not 100 million
digits long.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.250
Because if it had been 100
million digits long, then he

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.720
would have won $150,000.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.090
Because that's the prize on
offer if he can find one

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.520
that's actually that long.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.730
It's worth thinking about how
big this number actually is.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.515
And we've talked about big
numbers in the past, Brady.

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:30.670
It is bigger than a googol.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.870
It's not as big as
a googolplex.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.640
It's certainly not as big
as Graham's number.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.280
You can easily think of this
number without your head

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.430
collapsing to form
a black hole.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.910
There's no problem there.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.810
In fact, actually, it's quite
easy to think of.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.580
You could even memorize
this number.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.060
Here we have the number.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.210
So this is the number written
out in full--

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.390
quite a big file.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.220
There you go.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.810
It's got 17 and 1/2
million digits.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.120
This file is about 22 meg.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.660
Now, apparently, your brain can
store about 2.5 million

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.880
gig of memory.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.920
So technically, you could
memorize this number without

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.740
having a problem.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.530
And in fact, I'm going to be
cocky here because I actually

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.110
can write this.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.910
I'm going to write
this number.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.560
I've remembered this number.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.210
But I've remembered
it in base 2.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.630
OK.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.630
So let me write down
it out in base 2.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.620
I was quite impressed that
I remembered this.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.090
So the first number is 1.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.170
The second number--
ah, it's also 1.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.520
And the next one's also 1.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.010
And the next one is also 1.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.460
And I would carry on writing 1's
until I got all the way to

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.140
the last number, which
is also 1.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.250
And there would be
a grand total of

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.010
57,885,161 of these 1's.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.330
And that is the number
written in base 2.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.600
So I can prove that for
you if you'd like.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.720
BRADY HARAN: Go on.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.820
DR. TONY PADILLA: OK.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.910
So the reason that that's
what it is in base 2--

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.190
OK.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.150
So let's look at this number.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.550
Let's just call it P for now,
rather than this 57 million.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.680
Because we can prove
this in generality.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.950
I can actually factorize
this expression.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.470
And I can factorize this
expression as follows.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.090
It's 2 minus 1.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.370
That's obviously 1--

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.170
multiplied by 1, plus 2, plus
2 squared, all the way up

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.090
to 2 P minus 1.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.155
OK.

00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:27.940
So this is obviously
1 out front.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.350
So what I'm left with is just
all the, basically, essential

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.310
units of base 2 with
1's in front.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.760
And that's it.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.380
So that's the proof.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.310
So there's obviously P
of these in total.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.690
So in our case, P
is 57,885,161.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.300
And so this is how you would
write it out in base 2.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.570
BRADY HARAN: In base 10, which
is what more people are

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.320
familiar with, what's the
first and last digit?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.300
DR. TONY PADILLA: So I'm going
to have to look this one up.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.380
Well, I think I know the
first, actually.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.490
actually.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.130
It's 5, isn't it?

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.890
It's 5.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.640
And the last one-- can I look?

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.720
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.310
DR. TONY PADILLA: I've got a
feeling the last one's--

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.860
well, we know it's going to be
an odd number, don't we?

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.444
So we've got 1.

00:05:09.444 --> 00:05:10.280
There we go.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.380
Of course, we have a new perfect
number from this.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.020
And it's very easy to write
down what it is.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.810
And the perfect number
that we have--

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:27.710
2 to the 57,885,160, multiplied
by 2 to the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.680
57,885,161 minus 1.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.330
That's our new perfect number.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.370
It's about 34 million
digits long.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.710
Yep.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.430
That's our new perfect number
we've got out of this.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.840
So whew.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.740
It's all good fun, basically.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.980
And I think that there is an
important point to come from--

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.900
these searches.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.950
I mean, they're fun to look at.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.370
It's nice.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.950
It's interesting.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.810
Oh, we found this new,
big prime number.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.990
There's a lot of technology
that goes into sort of

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.360
developing the software to
do these calculations.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.300
Because basically, if you
actually tried to calculate

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.840
all the divisors of this guy,
you've used all the numbers

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.350
that were smaller than it and
tried to see if they were

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.760
factors of that number, if you
did that, just like that, sort

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.970
of blindly, you'd find that you
needed more than the age

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.830
of the universe to actually
do that calculation.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.080
So there's sophisticated
techniques at work here.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.510
And all this game, and all this
developing this computing

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.250
power in particular ways to
multiply large numbers, really

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.480
have had sort of impact
elsewhere, for example.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.050
It's the spinoff technologies
that are coming from this sort

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.640
of really mathematicians
playing games.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.850
But you should never knock
mathematicians playing games.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.940
Because the crumbs that fall
off the table can be of

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.150
benefit to everybody else.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.740
BRADY HARAN: If you'd like to
see even more from this

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.550
interview, including a rather
strange discussion about my

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.670
family tree, I've got an
unlisted video with all the

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.470
off cuts and extra footage.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.770
I basically didn't put it as a
listed video because I didn't

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.670
want to clog up everyone's
subscription boxes.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.780
And if you want to find out
more about some of these

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.070
topics and you haven't watched
our back catalogue of videos,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.800
I've also put links to our films
about Mersenne primes,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.180
perfect numbers, googols and
googolplexes, Graham's number,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.720
all that kind of stuff.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.310

video or here on the screen.
