00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.446
We already know that the derivative with
respect to x of

00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:12.193
tangent of x is equal to the secant of x
squared, which is

00:00:12.193 --> 00:00:17.967
of course the same thing of one over
cosine of x squared.

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:21.615
Now what we wanna do in this video, like
we've done in the last

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:26.103
few videos, is figure out what the
derivative of the inverse function of the

00:00:26.103 --> 00:00:29.958
tangent of x is, or in particular, let's
see if we can figure out

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.390
what the derivative with respect to x of
the inverse tangent of x is.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.411
And I encourage you to pause this video
and

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.489
use a technique similar to the one, or
very

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.336
close to the one that we've used in the

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:42.560
last two videos, to figure out what this
is.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.133
Well let's set y equal to the inverse
tangent

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.920
of x, y is equal to inverse tangent of x.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.290
That is the same thing as saying that the
tangent

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.110
of y, the tangent of y is equal to x.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.884
All I've done, now you can kind of think
of it

00:01:05.884 --> 00:01:09.243
as I've just taken the tangent of both
sides right over

00:01:09.243 --> 00:01:12.529
here, and now we can take the derivative
of both sides

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:17.050
with respect, the derivative of both sides
with respect to x.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.110
And on the left hand side, we can just
apply the chain rule.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.130
Derivative of tangent of y with respect to
y, is going to be secant

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.490
squared of y, which is the same thing as
one over cosine of y squared.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.420
I like to write it this way.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.590
It's it'll, keeps it a little bit simpler
at

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.613
least in, in my brain, but when we're
applying

00:01:39.613 --> 00:01:43.155
the [INAUDIBLE], it's gonna be the
derivative of tangent

00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:45.883
of y with respect to y times the
derivative of

00:01:45.883 --> 00:01:50.821
y with respect to x, times the derivative
of y with respect to x, and on the right

00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.697
hand side, the derivative of x with
respect to

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:56.633
x, well that's just going to be equal to
one.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:00.601
And so we get, if we wanna solve for the
derivative y with

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:05.767
respect to x, we just multiply both sides
times the cosine of y squared.

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:10.286
And we get the derivative of y with
respect

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:14.680
to x is equal to cosine of y squared.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.781
And like we've seen in previous videos,

00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:19.603
this isn't that satisfying because, you
know, I've

00:02:19.603 --> 00:02:23.100
written the derivative of y with respect
to x as a, as a function of y.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.855
But what we're really interested in is
writing it as a function of x,

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:30.768
and to do that, we'd express this somehow
in terms of the tangent of y.

00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:33.884
And the reason why the tangent of y is
interesting is

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:37.460
because we already know that tangent of y
is equal to x.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.500
So we can rewrite this using a little bit
of trigonometric identities.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.587
Then we can, with tangent of y, we can

00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:46.090
substitute all the tangent of y's with an
x.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.270
So let's see if we can do that.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.910
And this seems a little bit tricky.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.072
They introduce a tangent of y, we'd wanna
have a sine, divided by a

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:58.210
cosine, that's what tangent is, and this
is just a straight up cosine squared y.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.957
So this is really gonna take a little bit
more experimentation than at

00:03:01.957 --> 00:03:06.410
least some of the other, the, than the
last two examples we've done.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.220
So one thing we could do is we could say
hey, let's just divide by one.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.360
Dividing by one never hurt anyone.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.960
So we could say this is the same thing,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.900
this is the same thing as cosine squared
y.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.876
And I'm really doing this to, to see if I

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:20.969
can in, start to express it as some type
of a

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.519
rational, a rational expression which
might involve, at some point,

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.650
a sine divided by cosine and it could have
a tangent.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.900
So, let's divide by one.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.436
But we know from the Pythagorean, the
Pythagorean identity that one

00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:39.781
is equal to sine squared of y plus cosine
squared of y, and so let's

00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:45.233
try that or we could write cosine squared
of y plus sine squared of y.

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:47.967
Once again, why was I able to divide by
this expression?

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:50.724
Well, this expression by the Pythagorean
identity, which

00:03:50.724 --> 00:03:52.939
really comes out of the unit circle
definition of

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.830
trig functions, this is equal to one, so

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.020
I have not changed the value of this
expression.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.461
Now what makes this interesting is if I

00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.511
wanted to introduce a sine divided by a
cosine,

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:06.106
I could just divide the numerator and the

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:09.537
denominator by cosine square, so lets do
that, lets

00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:12.284
multiply one over cosine or else divide
the

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:15.183
numerator by cosine square of y and divide
the

00:04:15.183 --> 00:04:18.690
denominator, by cosine square of y, or
multiply each

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.560
of them by one over cosine square of y.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.050
What's that going to give us?

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.372
Well the numerator, these characters are
going to

00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:27.880
cancel you're just going to have a one.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.130
And the denominator this time this this,
that's going to be equal to one.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.716
And then you're gonna have sine squared,
sine squared y over,

00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:43.095
over cosine squared y, and this is, this
is the goal that I was

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:48.760
trying to achieve, I have a sine divided
by cosine squared.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.950
So this right over here, this is the same
thing, actually let me

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.220
just write it this way, let me, let me
write it this way.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:04.470
This is the same thing as sine of y over
cosine of y, cosine of y.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.427
Whole thing squared, which is of course
the same thing

00:05:09.427 --> 00:05:14.970
as one over one plus tangent of y, tangent
of y squared.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.310
This is equal to this.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.460
Now why is that useful?

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.670
Well we know that x is equal to tangent of
y.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.472
So this is going to be equal to, this is
going to be equal

00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:33.150
to one, one over, one plus tangent of y is
equal to x,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.600
x squared, x squared, which is pretty
exciting.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.010
We just figured out the derivative of y
with respect to x.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.366
So the derivative of this thing with
respect

00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:47.680
to x is one over one plus x squared.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.640
So we could write that right up here.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.654
So this is going to be equal to one over

00:05:55.654 --> 00:06:01.671
one plus x squared, and we are done.
