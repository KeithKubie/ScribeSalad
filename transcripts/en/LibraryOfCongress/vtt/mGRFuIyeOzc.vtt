00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.270
&gt;&gt; Taina Caragol: Hello
good evening all.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.880 position:56%
My name is Taina Caragol and I'm the
curator of Latino Art and History

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.820
at the National Portrait
Gallery and the curator

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.070
of One Life Dolores Huerta.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.700
Thank you very much
for being here tonight.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.120
Welcome to poets unite.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.720
A program organized by the National
Portrait Gallery in collaboration

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.390
with the Library of Congress
Hispanic Division and Poetry

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.850 position:56%
and Literature Center and with Letra
Latinas, the literary initiative

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.990
at the University of Notre Dame's
Institute for Latino Studies.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.600
Tonight we have the honor to have
among us Juan Felipe Herrera,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.030
the 2015 Poet Laureate
of the United States.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.330
Which also we presented

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.020
in the Portrait Gallery's
permanent collection by the way,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.610
I don't know if you know that.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.220
Also Arlene Biala,
Poet Laureate of Santa,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.610
the county of Santa
Clara in California.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.650
And award winning poet Diana Garcia
who will read poems in response

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.790
to One Life Dolores Huerta.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.550
One Life is not only exhibition,
series of exhibitions really

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.480
that shed light on individuals

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.590
who through their leadership have
helped shaped American History

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.890
and culture.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.220
This iteration based on [inaudible]
Dolores Huerta, a figure essential

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.000
to the farm workers
movement of Cesar Chavez.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.460
But not yet as familiar
to the American public.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.770
The mutual identification
of Chavez and Huerta

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.440
with migrant farm workers,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.500
their common indignation
other subhuman working

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.770
and living conditions,
led to them found

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.780
in 1962 the National Farm
Workers Association or NFWA.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.450
In September 1965,
their mainly Mexican

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.180
and Mexican-American Union joined
the Filipino Union named the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.940
Agricultural Workers Organizing
Committee led by Larry Itliong

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.170 position:56%
in the momentous Delano Grape Strike

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.110
that launched the Farm
Workers Movement.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.540
Both unions merged a year later
and formed the United Farm Workers.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.440
These exhibition commemorates
50 years

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.400
of the beginning of these movement.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.900
By illuminating Dolores
Huerta's crucial role in the UFW

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.680
as it's Vice President, a
strategist of the Grape's Boycott,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.740
that perhaps some of you remember.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.510
A remarkably skilled
lobbyist for the union

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.020
and it's main contact negotiator
between the 60's and 70's.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.890
It is very meaningful for us at
the Portrait Gallery to collaborate

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.440 position:56%
in this program with Chicano poets
Juan Felipe Herrera and Diana Garcia

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.290
and Filipino American Arlene
Biala, who shares a commitment

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.490
to social justice, cultural
affirmation and given voice

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.200
to communities that have been
historically silenced or oppressed.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.510
Juan Felipe and Diana Garcia
come from farm worker families

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.830
and were born in farm labor camps.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.300 position:56%
Their personal stories are
directly tied to Dolores's struggle.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.720 position:56%
As some of you know this program was
suppose to take place in January,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.760
but it had to be rescheduled
due to the big snow storm.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.890
What a better day to respond to
Dolores Huerta's endless energy

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.510 position:56%
and power as transformational figure
than in International Women's Day.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.300
[ Applause ]

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.890
I should also add that I
think the stars aligned

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.940 position:56%
to have the program tonight as well,
because about 50 years ago right

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:52.910
around this time in 1966, in March
of 1966 the, Cesar Chavez started

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.770 position:56%
in the UFW which wasn't the UFW yet,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.990
but the union of these two
labor unions, the Filipino

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.870
and Mexican-American union
started their march from Delano

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.880
to Sacramento, their 340 mile
march to protest the conditions of,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.730
the working conditions
of farm workers

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.450
and to let the state
government to really engage them

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.120
in the struggle of farm workers.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.990
On behalf of the Portrait Gallery
I'd like to thank the poets

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.750
for the privilege of hearing their
responses to the show tonight.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.070
And I'd also like to give a very
special thanks to Francisco Aragon,

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.370 position:56%
Director of Letra Latinas and also
to Robert Casper and Anya Creightney

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.360
as well as Georgette Dorn from
the Library of Congress Poetry

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.600
and Literature Center and
also the Hispanic Division.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.660
A big thank you as well to our
two sponsors for this program,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.510
the Smithsonian Latino Center

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.280
who also sponsored the
exhibition One Life Dolores Huerta

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.700
and the Smithsonian Asian
Pacific American Center.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.740
And thanks again to, as well
to The Portrait Gallery staff

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.650
that has worked in the
coordination of this event.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.130
To finish I'd like to remind you
all that One Life Dolores Huerta is

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.520
up until May 15, it will
possibly travel starting the fall

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.180
of next year through the country.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.680
So if you know venues that would be
interested in receiving this show

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.110
as panel exhibition
please let us know.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.090
And I would like also to
let you know that several

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.210 position:56%
of the portrait collections have the
authors presenting tonight will be

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.010
available at our shop so please,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.230

exhibition also come

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.870
by our shop and support our poets.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.080 position:56%
And now I give the word to Francisco
Aragon Director of Letra Latinas,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.140
who will tell you more
about this program.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.940
Thank you.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.340
&gt;&gt; Francisco Aragon: My
name is Francisco Aragon

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.100
and I direct Letra Latinas,
which is the literary initiative

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.350
at the University of Notre Dame's
institute for Latino Studies.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.910
When it comes to programming,

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.870
the core of our philosophy
is collaboration.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.350
Since establishing our presence
in Washington D.C. In 2007,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.930
we've been fortunate enough
to partner with a number

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.980
of local institutions and these
have included such institutions

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.910 position:56%
such as The Shakespeare, Folger
Shakespeare Library, Split this Rock

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.780
and of course one of our
partners this evening The Library

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.110
of Congress, specifically the
Poetry and Literature Center.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.340
The programming Letra
Latinas has carried

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.010
out in Washington D.C has been made
possible thanks to the generosity

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.830
of the Weissberg Foundation.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.030
I'd like to take a moment
to thank Wally Babington,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.940
a Weissberg board member
who is with us this evening.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.340
I shall also say that along with
the Library of Congress's Poetry

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.350
and Literature Center we've also
established a great partnership

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.110
with the Hispanic Division.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.720
But tonight we are also partnering
with a branch of the Smithsonian,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.170
the National Portrait
Gallery and this is special

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.460
because this is the 3rd time

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.280
that Letra Latinas has
partnered with the Smithsonian.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.910
The first was in 2009 when
we co-presented the poetics

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.770
of labor series with the National
Museum of American History.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.540
In tandem with its exhibit
Bittersweet Harvest,

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:38.080
The Bracero Program 1942, 1964.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.910
One of the poets who presented
in that series is back

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.520
with us this evening, Diana Garcia.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.840
In 2013 we began the collaboration

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.960
with the Smithsonian American
Art Museum in conjunction

00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.800
with the exhibit, Our America, The
Latino Presence in American Art.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.940
One of the outcomes
of that collaboration,

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.330
which concludes next
year, is the special issue

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.780
of poetry magazine this
month's issue, March,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:18.160
which includes a portfolio
of 20 poems by 12 poets.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.710
One of those poets is another poet
we'll be hearing from this evening,

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.000
US Poet Laureate Juan
Felipe Herrera.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.020
But of course tonight's
collaboration will specifically

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.080
engage with as been said,
One Life Dolores Huerta.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.370
And it will yield our
first collaboration

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.500
with our third poet this
evening Arlene Biala.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.670
The printed program for tonight's
events, which I hope you all have

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.140
in hand, includes biographical
sketches

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.280
of our three distinguished poets.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.540
But what I want to
say right now is this,

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.260
all three like myself are
natives of California.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:04.650 position:56%
From where I recently returned after
taking part in a memorial tribute

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.450
to a recently departed
poet and dear friend.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:16.140 position:56%
I think Juan Felipe, Diana and
Arlene will agree with me when I say

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.820
that the ethos and spirit of our
now departed poet friend is in sync

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.250 position:56%
with the ethos and spirit behind the
exhibit we're celebrating tonight.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.420
So with this in mind, I
want to close these remarks

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.910
with a brief poem titled,
Ode to Dolores Huerta

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.110
by the late Francisco X Alarcon.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:46.760
Because you were the
strongest, caring, mother,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.570
protesting against social
injustice in the new war.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:10:00.020
Your ribs were broken
many times over.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:07.430
Your spleen smashed,
split and you were thrown

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.260
like any rose to the ground.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:17.880
Clubbed down on the
street by the SF PD.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.930
But Dolores, you remain a
May carnation on the lips

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:30.100
of our people in prayer
and in praise.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.510
Francisco X Alarcon.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:38.650
[ Applause ]

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.400
And now without further delay
please welcome our poets

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.080
who will be presenting in
this order Arlene, Biala,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.510
Diana Garcia and Juan
Felipe Herrera.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:59.430
[ Applause ]

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.420
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Good evening
everybody, how is everybody?

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:08.030
Very very good, [foreign word]
thank you, [foreign word] to Taina

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.990
for a beautiful, beautiful exhibit,

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.460
if you have not seen the
Dolores Huerta One Life Exhibit,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.780
please go check it out
before it leaves here in May.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.670
And to Francisco, my heart
to you for sharing that poem

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.840
from our beloved Francisco
X Alarcon.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.690
I'm going to share a
couple of poems tonight

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.990
that were inspired
by the exhibition.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.870
And one of the quotes
from Dolores Huerta is,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.280
when you have nothing left
you still have your body.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.870
And it's around the concept, very
prevalent in Civil Rights activism

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:49.430 position:56%
and social justice that you use your
body for teach ins, for sit ins,

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:55.000
for protests and that is
what we'll carry forward.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:35.660
[ Singing ]

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.900
What is the song of your body?

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.200
Is it [foreign word]
and [foreign word]?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.550
A love song of resistance.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.460
Is it [foreign word]
and [foreign word]?

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.610
The chorus of huelga, huelga.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.530
The same word in Spanish
and in Tagalog.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:04.190
What is the song of your body
standing barely five feet tall?

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.920
Yet shifting mountains,
lifting the voices

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.820
of thousands of women
who say enough.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.890
It is time to rise.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.600
What is the song of your fingers?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.140
That grip the megaphone.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.120
Base notes mean business.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.170
Don't be a marshmallow.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.210
Get off the sidewalk,
get into the streets.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.720
Out, out from the mud.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.290
Out, out from the pesticides,

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.070
out from the weight
of your broken bodies.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.220
What is this song of your hands?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.120
That write the contract
for the first time.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.020 position:56%
That wiped the blood from your face.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.980
What is this song of
your hands on your hips?

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:02.440
Ready to hear the excuses that
crop up as they always do.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.000
But you are here.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:22.950
This poem, actually is a series
of poetry form called Haynaku

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.660
and it's a play off of
the short form Haiku.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.010
Which is, most of you might be
familiar with, raise your hand

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.500
if you know what a Haiku is?

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.400 position:56%
Right, so 575 syllable count tercet.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.990
This is also a tercet
so three lines,

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.750
but the form is basically one word,
two words and then three words

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.740
and it can be reversed as well.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.890
An I Knuckle is a form that
was originated and founded

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.930
by my beautiful friend,
Filipino poet Eileen Tabios

00:14:53.930 --> 00:15:00.240
and Haynaku means the translation
is sort of like, [foreign word]

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.220
or oh my god, you know
you're just sort

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.790
of like, what in the world right?

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.150
So I would like for you,
if you would indulge me,

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.410
to help me with this
poem, with this chant.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:18.400
And when I raise my hand like this,
if you would yell out huelga, okay.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.580
Going to need everybody with me.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.300
Okay. First one, huelga.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.590
Dragon lady they call you.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.960

&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.210

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.480

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.940

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.100
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: The
Filipinas are tired too.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.400
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.570
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Laureate
[foreign word], we are here.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.860
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Exhausted
women lead the march.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.160
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.080
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Hunger
striking, that is love

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.380
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.660
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: See
her, red mother rising.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.960
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.730
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Beyond
this, she is here.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.030
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.190
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Same
age as my mother.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.490
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.120
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: No back
seat, do not buckle.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.530
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.590
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Hospital
bed, Cesar is there.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:36.990
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.050
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Same
word, we are you.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.350
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.560
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: My
sister, take this water.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.860
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.580
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Our
sister, take this breath.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.920
&gt;&gt; Huelga.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.720
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Thank you, huelga.

[ Applause ]

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.230
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: The first poem is
called Delta Angel and it's taken

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.770
from an uncredited photograph
called, Dolores Huerta

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.660
as a majorette, it's part
of the family holdings.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.780
I never knew.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.650
Main street angel, glitter

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.510
in your majorette costume,
each sequin hand sown.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:29.230
Strut for the camera, your
baton waves, arcs, ready to fly.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.720
Passers by stop, admire
your exuberance.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.270
Spine straight taller than
your friend beside you,

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.120
taller than you thought
you would be.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.350
All eyes follow your form,
slim waist, high breasts,

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.180
grace and strength in
each toss of the baton.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:51.070
This is you, tasseled cape hat,
set to lead the band every parade,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.140
every Friday night, every
Friday night halftime,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.110
every band competition.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.100
Who taught you intricacies
of baton work?

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.130
Who taught you confidence?

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:05.110
The feel of hard steel in
both hands, working the baton

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:10.630
from one hand to the other, over,
under, above, through, between?

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.270
Sometimes the clunk on the head?

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.060
How many bruises suffered for
this one moment each week?

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.070
Delta Angel leading the way,

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.610
charging headlong beneath
the late autumn sun.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.360
In the heat, delta water
flushes your heart and lungs.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.410
Delta soil lifts each time
your boots hit their mark.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.200
On Friday nights your baton
arcs beneath the lights,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.300
a 100 yard stage just for you.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.500
Lights bounce of baton, sequins.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:44.090
Lights swirl like stars against
your dark skin and skirt.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:49.150
You hear the delta call of
sand hill cranes settling,

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.010
snowy egrets flying overhead.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.910
You pull for the star,
strain against gravity.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.300
Your baton strings in
the fog, wings shimmer.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:11.370
This next poem Huelga, after Harvey
Richards 1965 photograph Huelga.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:16.660
September 24th, 1965
Delano California.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.410
You remember this day.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.140
How can you forget?

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.840
Iconic this photo, outsize
reproduction guiding us in.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.860
The great strikes in Delano, where
it all began and you were there.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.100
Look at you atop a truck,
sun in your eyes, you squint.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.440
Sensible clothes, sleeves pushed

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.070
up passed your elbows,
your get to work look.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.600
Comfy dark slacks, nothing
you'd wear to church,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.560
nothing you'd wear turning trays.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.250
You turned from side to side,
arms tired from holding the sign.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.880
It looks heavy, the
word huelga feels heavy.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.040 position:56%
Think of what this word means to all
those who follow you out that day.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.840
Think of the lives
changed by this one word,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.170 position:56%
workers daring to claim their lives.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.570
Daring to think their arms, backs,

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.130
legs should earn them
more than substance wages.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:16.230 position:56%
More than a quick meal midday, more
than those furtive trips to the edge

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.450
of the fields, hunkered
down against crying eyes.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.790
More than dry eyes
and dryer throats.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.070
The heat rises, pushes
against your face,

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.990
singles you out atop that truck.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:34.480
You must wonder if even now someone
has you in their cross hairs.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.270
You must wonder what would
happen to your children.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:43.350 position:56%
But you can't think about them,
because this is about your children.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:48.010
If this is about all the children,
about all these young workers,

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.990
ready to walk out,
ready to follow you,

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:55.000
ready not to grow old
beneath another hot sun.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.960
A 300 Mile March.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.740
NFW flags bluster and blow.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.370
The value winds blow
from the east, new day,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.550 position:56%
new beginnings, a few dozen workers.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.970
They hoist the flags,
take their first steps.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.380
A 300 mile march.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.860
Audacious, Filipino and
Mexican field workers daring

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.680
to cast their struggles
across the length and breath

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.820
of California's great
Central Valley.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.510 position:56%
So few, you'd hoped for dozens more.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.520
But the media trucks soon
bloom, photographers,

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.550
newspapers cover the story.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.560
The story grows and
so do the numbers.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.200
What do hundreds of
boots and sandals sound

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.720
like as they pound asphalt up
Highway 99 and all its tributaries?

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.220
The storm of passion,
tectonic surge, the rumble

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.510
and roar beneath the feet, the
earthquake and hurricane in Shirako

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.280
and what else can we call it?

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.120
The mad howl of parents,

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.370
parents telling children
there is not enough food,

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.100
not enough for new clothes,
warm jackets, clothes that fit,

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.520
not enough for the doctor when
one child struggles to breath,

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.300
not enough air, not
enough money, never enough

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.890
and now huelga they scream,
[foreign word] they roar

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:24.510
and if that's not enough [foreign
word] enough, they have had enough.

[ Applause ]

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:38.110
The next Dragon Lady is taken from
a uncredited photograph of Huerta

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:43.520
at the Gala Negotiations in 1973.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.180
Remind you of something?

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.670
Men in charge.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.310
Usually men, usually
white men in white shirts

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.250
and perfectly knotted ties.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.970
Good ole boys taught
to tie a tie in front

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.180
of a bathroom mirror at age 12.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:03.320
But here in this simmering heat,
they've shed the ties, the suits

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.020
and jackets, hunkered down,
ready to take you down.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.170
Even as you prepare to break the
wall they've built word by word,

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.820
line by line, point by point.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.860
In your checked jacket
and white blouse,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.440
they should remember the
images of wives at church.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.400
Small armies of women
wielding power,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.520
ancestral lines of
women behind them.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:36.370
They should recall who wields the
final word in any disagreement.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.710
What do they call women
like you behind their back?

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.010
Don't think about it.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.950
Your hand moves across one

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.790
of several pages, strewn
across the table.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:52.880
The man to your right follows
each movement, each cross out,

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.570
cringes as your pen hovers
over one critical section.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:03.350
See him flinch as you
grasp its importance.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.030
When Cesar handed you this
responsibility you crammed

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.590
for one week, reviewing
all you'd learned

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.840
about contract negotiations
in the past years.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.460
First the dates and [inaudible],
now wine and raising grapes.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.090 position:56%
You must have felt like you were
back in college cramming for finals.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.690
You did now what you did then.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.680
When you got to the hall,
you walked through the doors

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.740
as if you were leading a
field full of strikers.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.640
You claimed the best seat,

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.300
but looked aside not
straight at them, not yet.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:45.460 position:56%
You gave them a chance to grasp, you
were the lead negotiator, not Cesar,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:51.080 position:56%
not a man trained in law school, but
you with your state college degree,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:56.870 position:56%
you mother of half a dozen children,
you mother to this movement.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.640
Dragon Lady, that's what they'll
call you at the end of this day.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.490
Dragon lady howling heat and dust
on this contract, summoning decades

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.470
of sweat and blisters and bent
backs, twirling lassos of words,

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.990
specific words, demanding words,

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:16.510
gorging on the power
of words to dismantle.

And finally, Different Ways to Heal.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.830
And this is from a photograph from
Victor Alaman of Chavez sitting

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.590
with Dolores Huerta in the
hospital after she'd been beaten

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:41.020
and her spleen ruptured and ribs
broken by San Francisco's police.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.030
You watch.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.930
You sit and watch.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.100
Hour after hour.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.200
What else can you do?

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.480
You can't heal her,
no one can do that.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.300
You can't take away the
nightmare, the feel of metal baton

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.670
on shoulder, hip, kidney.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.410
You can't remove the sound,

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.870
the memory of flesh crumbling
beneath the weight and power

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.050
of San Francisco's finest.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:12.390
You wait. Not like waiting those
long months before you sign the

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.600
first contract.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.820
Your eyes stray to her,
stay away from her.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.330
This woman who's stood by
your side, who worked with you

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.700
to found this union, this woman
who agreed the monotonous way

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.900
of non-violence, augured well for
the stance you all would take,

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.420
in the face of hate filled faces,
fists that slowed your chance,

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.860
your songs, your flying
flag into oblivion.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.180 position:56%
You turn away from the photographer,

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.450
your face obscured
by your left hand.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.630
Do you regret not being at her
side when the police attacked?

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.780
Are you racked with guilt?

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.200
Aware of what your [foreign
word] will say, those back home

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.160
who expect a man to take
the blows, not the woman.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.120
You wait because there is
nothing else you can do.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.090 position:56%
You wait, because surgery only
heals the body but what of the soul?

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:13.340
Bound to a hospital bed draped
in white, propped up on pillows,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:17.150
she stares straight
ahead, not at you.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.420
No smile, no attempt
at conversation.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.510 position:56%

That's beautiful.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.360
I'm so honored to be here
with Diana and Arlene.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.350
To listen to their amazing poems.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:47.980
To feel and to see those moments
once again, presented in many ways

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:54.890
at Taina's gallery, room project
Dolores Huerta One Life and to be

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:59.900
in the midst of women
leaders right here.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:05.970
It's a wave of creativity,
it's a wave of being brave,

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.220
of being pioneers and
this is what I mentioned

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.610
to [inaudible] just
a few minutes ago

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:17.260
and for me it's a beautiful honor
and I can feel Dolores Huerta here.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.770
So let's give a [foreign word],

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.510

[foreign word], a big hand.

That is right.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.400
That is right.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:47.090 position:56%
Also to, once again give thanks to
the Library of Congress's Department

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:52.420
of Literature Rob Casper and the
Portrait Center and Letra Latinas,

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.180
Notre Dame Institute with
Francisco Aragon and all those

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.770
that are part of this project.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.910
I feel really good about it because
it's once again as we can see,

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:07.100
as you can see, it's bringing
into our minds, into our presence,

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.140
right here in Washington D.C.,
this amazing gallery, the face

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.880
and the life of Dolores Huerta.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:23.360
A most brave and most keen mind and
leader and activist on the ground,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.900
on the earth for so many.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.860
And it's so easy for our
leaders in particular,

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:37.530
women to be slowly erased
or evaporated by the media

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.600
and of course by the onslaught,

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:46.340
the continuous corporate
onslaught of things to purchase.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.660
And all those other good things.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.190
Let me read you a poem.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:59.220
Jose Montoya, Jose Montoya who
also passed away not to long ago.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:05.740
A great poet, muralist,
painter who early on was part

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.700
of the campesino movement with
Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:15.480
And the farm workers, he was also
a farm worker for [foreign word]

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:21.800
in Northern Mexico, in New Mexico
and he painted these stories.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.180
On amazing murals throughout
California and the Southwest

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:30.880
with his artists, so Sacramento,
many artists from Sacramento,

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.930
the real Chicano Air Force.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:39.700
And gave you know a large
public face and history

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.640
through the visual
images and documents

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.480
from an artists point of view.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.620
So he dedicated his life to this.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:52.470
So, he passed away in 2013

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:57.450
and I thought I'd bring
him into view tonight.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.920
Since he was a great participant

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.110
with Dolores Huerta
and Cesar Chavez.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:07.460
So this is a node to Jose
Montoya and I have it in Spanish

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:12.150
and [foreign word] Spanish, the
kind of Spanish you know you speak,

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:17.620
we speak kind of in
between everything.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:23.040
You know on the border lands,
on the border and as we grow up

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:27.590
and before we take Spanish
one like I did [laughter].

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:31.590
And Spanish two and three and four.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:35.990
And ideally you make it to
Spanish five [laughter].

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:41.220
Ode to Jose Montoya,

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.400

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:47.810
Too change for the good,
for the excerpt, for all.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.960
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: Scorched
fields, no marshmallows here,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.320
marshmallows roast in
summer heat, valley weather,

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.970
tie the vines, turn the trays.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.380
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: We are
all saying the same thing.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.220
The difference is your red knit
vest, small enough to be a child's.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:09.370
With the black eagle soaring
across the room toward us.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:13.490
The first thing I notice
your ribcage swelling.

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:17.930
Heart almost bursting through,
held back only by the weaving

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:22.450
of [foreign word], chanted into
each click of knitting needles,

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.850 position:56%
that were offered up to protect you.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:28.380
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: At
the foot of the fountain,

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.380
some cannot see it,
some cannot read.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:38.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: Walk out of the
fields, walk out, walk into history,

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.820
see your children glide university
halls, this is what we do, we lead,

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.370
we lead, we march into history.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:48.740
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Your fierce small
body relentless beyond miles,

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.490
beyond broken ribs.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.100
You call us to that
eagle that soars,

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:57.790
proclaiming in every language,
here is what America is.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.710
We are what America is.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.940
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Siete, seven.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.280
One, compassion.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.050
Two, struggle, [foreign word].

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.090
Three, debate, analysis.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:15.480
Four, fast, fast for
30 days, just water.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.400
Five, call the people.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.710
Six, knock on every door.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:22.140
Seven, lifetime.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:29.020
One, your, yours, for
all, lifetimes.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:37.620 position:56%
Knit, vest, with each name of the
invisible lives, the threat of path,

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.560

Enter the room, enter the room.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.590
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Eagle

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.270

word], on the wall.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.330
Who played with dirt?

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.840
Parents, picked, [foreign word].

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.100
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: Eagle

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.170
what kind of movement screams,

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:15.520
Moves with us, walks the streets

walks with us, marches a march,
get marching, use your lives,

make the world a better
place, better always better.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.560
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Garcia: The
world becomes as you move it.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.510
How do you move it Dolores?

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:50.510
[ Applause ]

00:42:50.510 --> 00:43:03.800
[ Silence ]

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.480
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: That
was really wonderful,

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.850
wonderful congratulations
all of you.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.150
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Thank you.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.560
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: I'm going
to ask you a few questions.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:16.140 position:56%
Can you talk about your process
both writing, your poems in response

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.330 position:56%
to exhibit, One Life Dolores Huerta?

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.000
In working in collaboration?

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:32.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: I think for me it
was having met her when I was young,

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.610
when I was still 18, 19 years old.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:40.890
And having the, having the great
good fortune to have Louis Valdez

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:43.330
and [foreign word] come
onto campus at Fresno State

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:45.630
and say come with us
into the fields.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:49.780
And I think that that and then
combined with Taina Caragol

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.980
and all the wonderful work
she did on the exhibit

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.220
and then Francisco Aragon texting

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.520
and saying you do you
want to do this?

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.060
And I thought, well hell my
life finally came full circle,

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.360
it's about time.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:06.830 position:56%
It was, it was a perfect opportunity
to study these photographs

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:11.850
and to have a chance to put
passion in motion, history

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:15.070
and memory along side
the photographs

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:18.130
and then write these poems.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:19.750
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Wonderful.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:22.100
You have any comments?

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.490
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: I
do, I think echoing

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:29.740
when Diana was saying the work as
you enter this room is so powerful.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.450
And for me the very first
thing that my eye went

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:36.380
to was Dolores Huerta's
vest that was gifted to her.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.360
I think we all brought
that into the poems

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.540 position:56%
when we were writing about the work.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:48.000
It's just a very small tiny vest
and it's in a shadow box frame

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.490
and I looked at it and I thought,
man that things going to bust out.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:54.970
Right because you immediately
make the connection

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:59.160
with the woman and
the power she held.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:04.710
And when Felipe and Francisco
had called and asked if I would

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.450
like to participate in this first

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:10.470
of all I was completely
floored and humbled and honored.

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.220
It was also around the time that
there was a very important movie

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:18.390
by a Filipino producer, Melissa
Aroy, Marissa Aroy excuse me,

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.110
that was screening in San Jose and
it's called the Delano Manongs.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:29.080
And it talks about the
Filipino's history in the movement

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.510
and sheds light into the fact that
you know the different cultures

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:34.850
of Filipino's and the
Mexican's were very much,

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:37.310
even though there was
some warring and struggle,

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:40.480
were very much together in
wanting the same things.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:46.780
So, that vest and all the other
works that are in that room,

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:51.790
very much called forth a
lot of hope and inspiration.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:53.720
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Do you have
anything to add Juan Felipe?

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:59.020
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Well
you know, yes [laughter].

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.230
But it's really all been
sad to tell you truth.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:09.230
You know humbly, I'm really really
happy again you know that this,

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:14.660
that Taina put this project
together on Dolores Huerta,

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:18.130
here at The National Portrait
Gallery and the Department

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:24.230
of Literature, Rob Casper and
Anya and Matthew are part of this

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.410
and sponsored it as
well as everyone else.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:33.050
You know I've been, it's
been a concern of mine to,

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:39.340
to have such pioneers as
Dolores Huerta as much

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.600
as possible in the public's eye.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.150
You know how much media we
get every three seconds.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:51.420
You know there's pharmaceutical
ads, there's everything

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:55.840
in the whole wide world that's
cost billions, billions literally

00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.330
after a while of dollars,
that we receive in the media.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:05.220
We never really receive ten
seconds of Dolores Huerta

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.940
for example, in the media.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:13.060
I don't think I seen Dolores
Huerta in the media at all.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:17.610
And the entire farm workers
movement and still Cesar Chavez.

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:22.040
And in addition we do not receive
the Filipino, Filipinas story.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.740
So I feel that this
project brings such amazing

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:35.300
and important significant faces for
us to see once again and courage

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.750
for use to feel once again.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:42.430
Incredible courage and a
movement for us to get in touch

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:47.470
with once again that
changed our lives.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:51.330
And still is changing
our lives and it's part

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:55.760
of all the production
that we benefit from.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:05.620
In every hamburger there's lettuce
and tomato and pickle and jalapeno.

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:11.460
And I say like that because I'm
joking with you but it's true.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.760
So that's why I feel
this is so important

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:19.400
and of course it touches back
to my own story and our stories.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.610
My parents and how hard they
worked back in those early years

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:27.660
when there was no union and
at a later age in their life

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:32.130
and my father kept on working
until he was 70 in those fields.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:37.040
So it's like that, it's
such a beautiful to be here.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.340
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: It is yes.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:42.000
And, in general what
fantastic poetry contributed

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.680
to such an exhibit?

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.410
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: Images.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:52.490
Images coming from the San Marquis
Valley and knowing Stockton as well

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:55.750
as I do, because so many
family members live there.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:49:00.420
To know that she came
out of Stockton and ran

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:04.210
through the entire Central
Valley, for me it was the sounds,

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:09.260
the scents, the feel of the fog in
the winter and heat in the summer.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:14.320 position:56%
For me it was, it just drenched with
sensory detail and then the shouts.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.070
The shouts for justice
and the sites.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:21.000
The huge red banners with
that screaming eagle on it.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.300
It was all imagery.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:30.540
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: And how do
you connect to Dolores Huerta?

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:34.280
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Well you
know I met her in, not to long ago.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:40.250
And just recently, in her
early 80's, early 80's

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:42.990
and this was in Bakersfield.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:47.390
And I was invited to say something
as a California Poet Laureate

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:51.360
to a high school fundraiser
audience.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.400
It was maybe around 50
people in Bakersfield

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.310
at Cal State University,
Bakersfield.

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:01.970 position:56%
And this particular group has been
raising funds, having speakers come,

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:07.330
raise funds for the next generation
of students that are continue.

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:11.460
And not much money was raised
but a beautiful effort was made.

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.930
And Dolores Huerta was there.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:18.270
So I got to say hi and thank you.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:27.380
And I noticed how she's a
solar beam, she's a solar beam.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.470
She just emanates all
this beautiful, strong,

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:34.320
bright, brilliant energy.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.710
And we talked a little bit.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:41.100
And she said well you know
what, I wanted to be a poet.

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:45.150
She said I wanted to be
a poet in third grade,

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:49.100
but my teacher said I
didn't have any talent.

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.930
So then she decided on something
else, which you guys know about.

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:59.890
But it was a very tender
moment for her.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:06.650
I noticed this, this feeling she
was feeling about being taken,

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.920
ripped away from this
poetry she wanted to,

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.570 position:56%
this poetry life she wanted to have.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.150
It was she had it, cause she
was called [foreign word],

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:19.830
seven tongues by her grandfather.

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:23.670 position:56%
Which we know how she used that too.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.730
So I said you know what
Dolores we're going to take care

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:29.470
of that right now, we're going
to take care of that right now.

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:31.360
So just hold on right now okay.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:37.850 position:56%
I said okay everybody, as of today,
we're announcing by the power vested

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:45.030
in me, Kings County Poet Laureate,

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:49.760
cause that's the county you know
for, that Bakersfield was in.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:56.930
Kings County Poet Laureate and
everybody goes yeah [laughter].

00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:01.050
So she's beautiful human being and
the most and I was so fortunate

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.190
to have met her at that time.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:05.100
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: I saw her
last year at the Mexican Embassy

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.700
when she got the Aguila Azteca
Prize and she looked marvelous,

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:12.110
she is just amazing,
an amazing person.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:13.410
What about you?

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:15.590
How do you connect
to Dolores Huerta?

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:19.180
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Dolores Huerta, I
didn't get to ever speak with her,

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:23.000
but I did get to see her, she
came to the Mexican Heritage Plaza

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.210
which is now the School of
Arts and Culture in San Jose,

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:29.310
which is the safe way site of the
original Cesar Chavez boycott.

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:33.160
In San Jose she came on a day
when we had I think 3,000 5th

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.990
and 6th graders there from
the neighborhood schools.

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:39.440
Huge, huge you know we have
the Cesar Chavez on March 31st

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:45.700
in San Jose and so she was there,
spreading her power and joy

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:50.560
to these 5th and 6th graders that
covered, you know I don't how many,

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.270
how many square feet but
it was just a packed plaza.

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:57.960
But the thing that I really connect
with her is that she's the same age

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.260
as my mother, my mother's,

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:04.140
she probably has half her
foot of height on my mother.

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:07.210
But man what a powerhouse.

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:10.180
Right, this is you know going
back to thinking about the body

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:14.770
and what it can contain and what
it can barely contain when it comes

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:20.440
to life and that soul, that
fierceness, that was needed

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.140
to do the work that she did.

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.440
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yeah.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.740
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: You know.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.020
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.350
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: It's
amazing, thank you.

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:34.530
And the United Farm
Workers, did she ever talk

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.000
about the United Farm Workers?

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:41.980
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: My own
parents left the fields

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.380
when I was seven years old.

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:48.340
When I was two but finally and
completely by the time I was seven.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:55.250 position:56%
So my early life was living in Camp
CPC, California Packing Corporation.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:54:00.170
What I remember is those very
early mornings in the fields.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:03.110
Sitting on my fathers gunnysack
while he dragged me along.

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:05.260
Because I couldn't do
my share of picking

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.920
or I wouldn't one or the other.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:14.340 position:56%
And when they started this movement,
I remember my mom and I sitting

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.830
around in the living room talking
about a union for farm workers

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:20.600
and by this time I
was 15, 16 years old.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.090
And it seemed like such
an inconceivable project.

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:28.260
It's like, but the
biggie I should say is,

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.110
that even then Dolores
Huerta was well known

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:33.580
in the Central San Marquis Valley

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.850
and for my mother this is
a woman who's only a couple

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.490
of years older than she is.

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:42.130
For my mother, this woman who
was leaving her family behind

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:45.300
and walking out into the fields
and pulling the workers out,

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.410
was so removed from anything
she would ever have imagined

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:50.710
for herself.

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.990
And I think that not
only did Dolores Huerta

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:57.600
and the United Farm Workers inspire
us, those of us who were teenagers

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.250
and young adults, but they
inspired women of my mothers age

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:03.840
who eventually in her
40's went back to college.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:09.110
And so I say that, you say that's
a union and a farm workers union

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:13.020
but we say that it was
a peoples movement.

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.340
And it was more than
just United Farm Workers.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.970
It grew us up.

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.590
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.500
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: You
want to add to that?

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.320
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: No, I think.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.620
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Juan Felipe?

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.130
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right you know.

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:34.000
That's right, you know Diana
says it, you know says it well.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:40.560 position:56%
You know we als,o it's good to
acknowledge the community organizers

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:47.090
that kind of shared their methods
with Dolores and Cesar Chavez,

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:50.510
is it Fred Ross, a Jewish
community organizer.

00:55:50.510 --> 00:56:00.130
That's also part of the movement
and as Arlene and Diana have said,

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:02.710
all this is kind of part
of our lives you know.

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:06.900
This is what we've been writing
about and talking about and reading

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:12.230
about and kind of keeping
the fires going

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:19.140
with this particular movement I
kind of came into my own poetry

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.890
at that particular time,
the late 60's at UCLA.

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:26.590
And I was testing the free speech
mount, I was really testing myself

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:30.570
to see that I could get up
there and read out and speak

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:34.100
out because I was always, it
kind of became my life project,

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.940
I don't know what got into me.

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:40.790
But I noticed that I had a hard
time speaking up in 7th grade

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:45.730
and people would ask me what am
I and I would say I'm Hawaiian.

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:47.680 position:56%
I wish I was you know, I wish I was.

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:52.060
You know cause I had come in
from the Bay Area and I had gone

00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.930
to school in the Mission District.

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:56.730
So my friends were
Filipino's you know

00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:59.370
and Filipinas at school you know.

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:02.340
Honolulu, [inaudible] would
always run ahead of me,

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.540
I was trying to catch up to it.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:08.030
You was so fast and so
tall and Tyronne Akino

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:09.900
and [inaudible] Bautista.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.510
So when I came to San Diego
to go to middle school,

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:18.850
my music teacher said well you know
what are you anyway, I go what?

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:25.490
I don't know I'm, I wish
would Mexican but you know.

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:29.380
I'm Hawaiian, I'm Hawaiian.

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:33.890
And it's ridiculous you know but
I was so afraid to really speak

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.700
up and to tell the truth.

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.670
So I took choir and I
started putting myself

00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:44.010
in impossible situations so I could
you know kick it out of my body,

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:48.680
force out of my body to
speak up and to be true.

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:54.140
So, the farm workers movement
kind of made that happen for me.

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:58.380
And that's why I started
really writing and reciting

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.510
and open fields, open eyes

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:04.680
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.720
What's that?

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.580
That's good, I'd be delighted.

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.070
Truly honored, truly honored.

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:15.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Did the
exhibition deepen your understanding

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:20.020
of Dolores Huerta, this
exhibit here in the gallery?

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.320
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: It did.

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:25.550
I didn't have the personal
history of you know family working

00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:29.360
in the fields and as Diana's family
and Juan Felipe's family did,

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.850
I mean I had uncles and aunts
who were definitely, in our,

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:35.350
in [inaudible] Valley we were
surrounded by the onion fields

00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:38.410
and that's where they
went to do their work.

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:41.670
Cousins in Hawaii actually
who were on the plantations,

00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:43.750
in the cane fields, you know

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:47.860
up until very recently
when they closed down.

00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.160
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: Closed down.

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.560
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: My, so this
exhibition really you know things,

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:54.980
I didn't know she had 11 children.

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:59.180
And was doing all this
work and that alone to me,

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.260
you know I have three
children and I'm like woo.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.560
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Amazing.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.490
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Okay I can't
complain about being tired.

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:11.680
Just again back to that
core strength that she has.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:15.610
You know and I didn't know
that her life as a young child,

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:19.030
you know she was actually middle
class and was not herself working

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:21.810
in the fields but when
she went to teach,

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:25.510
her young students were coming
to school with no shoes,

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:28.600
she knew that hadn't eaten
because they didn't have any food

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:34.730
and that was the point where
she said, how can I sit here

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:37.660
as a teacher and try to
teach you know writing,

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.380
reading, art what have you.

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.760
When these children don't
have their basics met.

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:47.550
And so it's at that core of
her passion and her commitment

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:52.250
to making sure that
there's justice you know.

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:55.310
And that's really the core,

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:57.800
how I feel about your
working and your writing.

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:04.720 position:56%
Which is that, if we don't have that
part within us to generate work,

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.880
whether it's [inaudible] you
know work based on works of art

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.370
or inspired by dance or theater.

01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:16.660
Or a way to express
anger at you know,

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.990
[foreign word] whatever
all this ridiculous things

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.380
that are happening in the media.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.150
That you wish this was a
bad joke but you realize,

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.700
I'm awake, what's going on right?

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:31.600
So, to really remember to
engage and be well with yourself

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.240
so that you can share
that positive energy out.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:41.180
You know and it's women like
Dolores Huerta and people who,

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:45.180
who are consistent in that
bringing forth the core.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:52.210
That I try to engage with all the
time because the rest is just going

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:55.300
to make you fall down
and cry, right.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.120
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: It's wonderful
to have the exhibition here

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.990
for a new generation
to see this marvelous,

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.950
amazing woman, isn't that true?

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:05.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: That's true,
you know there's new generations

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.200
and so that's what's also
beautiful about this project.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.270
As we have, we have ourselves
and then we have our new selves

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:16.580
in our new generations that
are learning about this

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.460
and it's a beautiful thing to have.

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:23.980
Here on site and Dolores Huerta
at the center and Arlene and Diana

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.680
as well and yourself
and everyone here.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.900
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: What does it
mean that the federal institutions

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.870
such as the Smithsonian
and the Library

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:35.110
of Congress are celebrating
Dolores Huerta?

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:40.970
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: The
walls have come down you know,

01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:43.130
the walls have come down.

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:46.360
And there's mighty
bridges being built.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.410
And that's what's amazing.

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:53.200
You know that we're uniting
and doing the good work

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.470
of course there's a lot of good
work already at the Library

01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:58.060
of Congress and at the Gallery.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:04.740
And yet this is a new, a new
leaf in that, a new direction

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.550
or a continued direction
in that field,

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:10.890
so I think it's most inspiring
especially at a time like this.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:12.770
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: That's right
and a time like this is true.

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:14.860
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: And I
never imagined a moment

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:17.620
like this would come.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.230
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: And I have
one more question and what might

01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:21.680
that fact say about the
message of her work?

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.000
Which you are promoting
through poetry.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.840
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: That
poetry is for everybody.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.640
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Yes absolutely.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:40.050
[ Applause ]

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.350
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Poetry you know,

01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:46.800
is what she was doing all along,
she was doing all along poetry

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.480
for the people with her voice.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:55.510
And Arlene and Diana and yourself
and everybody here one more time.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.190
[ Applause ]

01:02:58.190 --> 01:03:03.260
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Thank
you very much, wonderful.

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.740
&gt;&gt; Taina Caragol: Thank you
very much Georgette we would

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.620 position:56%
like to open the floor to questions.

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:16.830
The microphones are on both
sides of the auditorium.

01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:24.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for
this evenings program.

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:29.250
Not only is this exhibit the first
time that a Latino has been honored

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:32.890
by the Smithsonian in this
way, but I believe you know,

01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:36.480
it's the first time that a living
person has been given this honor

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.190
or one of the first ones.

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:45.110
What does it mean to have this
project and her life presented

01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:48.040
in this way, that history presented
while the person is still living?

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.740
And I'm curious as
people who created poetry

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.760
around the project
and around her life?

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.240
Can you say something about what
it means, the responsibility

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.000 position:56%
of the poet to sort of honor someone
who's living at the same time?

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: I teach my students
to write the truth and I feel

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:18.770
like there has been no truth
written about Dolores Huerta

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:22.120
that has had a bigger hearing

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:27.820
than the presentation we're doing
tonight, that the exhibit is one

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:35.340
that blasts apart a silence that
has kept her in second place

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.310
and with no one recognizing
that she was the co-founder

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.390
of the United Farm Workers.

01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:49.590
I'm so, I'm so amazed that a
moment like this can happen

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:52.090
to honor her when she
is still alive.

01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:56.020
That it's so tiring
to hear the accolades

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.000
after amazing people
like this are dead.

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:06.860
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Very good,
very good any other questions?

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:11.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much to all
of you who are putting this on.

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:15.000
Especially the poets here
tonight and the [inaudible]

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.780
for hosting this discussion
all of you are putting on.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.360
I had actually your question
in mind, but then when,

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.010
Juan Felipe when you
mentioned the anecdote

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:24.940 position:56%
about Dolores saying she wished that
her poet when she was just three.

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:30.090
Made me actually think about, for
example your saying new generation

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:33.670
about President Kennedy, who
if most of us who are familiar

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:34.970
with his life story,
have it be almost

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:38.400
to intimately involved cause I
was named John, partly after him.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.650
I just know about his life story,
just remotely I read through it

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:45.770 position:56%
that as a young man him being rather
sickly and having dealing with a lot

01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:48.110
of illnesses, he actually read a
lot, the joke in his family was

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.630
that a mosquito bit him,

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:52.530
the mosquito might die actually
all the illness John had.

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:54.520
And anybody familiar with
the Kennedy story knows

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.460 position:56%
that Josey was the first one
actually in line for the presidency.

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.910
But then fate intervened and
then John was next in line.

01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:03.970
My comment is simply like
rather you having heard

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:05.270
that comment [inaudible]
poets in general.

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:09.620
What do you think it means the
fact that sometimes that her,

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:13.670
that teacher said a comment or
that President Kennedy himself,

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:18.560
as being as a context the
idea of like, he had inspired

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.450
to be a teacher and a writer
himself and maybe even a poet

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:22.760
but it didn't quite
work out that way.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.550
Was Dolores, that teacher
said that comment and

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:27.960
yet as you said her life
expresses itself in different ways

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.290
through poetry of her activity.

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:32.970 position:56%
So that was more as a commentary but
rather maybe can reflect on that,

01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:35.260
what do you think it all means in
a way lead to a next generation

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.240
of those who are told
not to do one thing,

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.130
maybe going through your
own forged path we can.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:43.210
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
You know you can ask the,

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.520
you can ask up the spirit.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:54.260
You know she definitely found a way
and her poetry was a bigger poetry.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:59.850
It wasn't on a page, it didn't
require ink, it was her voice

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:05.170
and her actions and this
great solar power that she has

01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:12.900
of facing impossible odds
and making it through.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:18.260
And bringing about this beautiful
change that we have experienced,

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:21.360
inspiration, changing labor laws,

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.160
inspiring millions
and new generations.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:28.790
So her poem was a mighty big poem.

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:31.540
And she made it through, yes.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.460
&gt;&gt; Taina Caragol: Any
other questions?

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.260
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: Yeah right here.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:43.410
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah first of all I
just really want to thank Taina

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:48.550
for putting this on,
just blows me away.

01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:52.860
Yeah I just, so you
hear a lot of this

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.370
when we're you know
celebrating Dolores Huerta's life

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:57.670
and I know she's still alive.

01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:01.910
But, we hear like get off the
sidewalk, you know and this calls

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:06.140
to action and well first of
all actually Juan Felipe I want

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:11.120
to commend you for taking the
Poet Laureate's position in doing

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.140
like really activists
type stuff with it

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:17.510 position:56%
and like really doing these big
projects that unite people you know,

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.490
I think that's really beautiful.

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:26.840
But my main question is, what what
you say to the next generation

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.140
and you know here we are like
we're growing, you know we're here.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.320
And I just, I want
to hear some words

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.000
from you guys for the
next generation.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.160
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: The next
generation is here for sure.

01:08:50.430 --> 01:09:01.580
I, what I tell my kids who, who I
think have very very great heart,

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:06.980
passionate hearts sharing
empathy but really have their own,

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.090
their own desires of what they
want to do, you know I may say

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:13.530
to my 15 year old, you're
practicing your drums today,

01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:14.830
you're practicing your drums today,

01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:18.130
you're practicing your drums today
he's like no man I'm going to skate

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:21.290 position:56%
and I'm going to go play my ukelele.

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:26.970
We can't hold any of you back and
I think people like Juan Felipe

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:32.140 position:56%
as US Poet Laureate, first US Latino
Poet Laureate, Dolores Huerta here

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:35.360
and the Smithsonian you
know these things are huge

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:38.810
and I think it really
creates as Juan Felipe said,

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:44.070
bringing down walls and just
letting people know to stand up,

01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:48.040
to be heard, create your
art, share your passion

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.840
for the things that matter.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.160 position:56%
You know, hey I'm on social media
all the time, I'm guilty of Facebook

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.410
and Instagram and all that but
move beyond that, you know remember

01:09:58.410 --> 01:10:00.460
to connect with each other.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:03.340
In very meaningful ways.

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:08.090
And not get lost you know the
whole get off the sidewalk,

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:10.930
don't get lost you
know you could maybe,

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:14.200
yes you can forward you
know petition or something.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.040
But what does that really mean?

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.840
How is that helping you grow

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.400
and help you know each
one teach one right?

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:27.820
Educate the next and help them
feel strong to rise with you,

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.120
with your whole generation.

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.350
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:41.520
&gt;&gt; Arlene Biala: Just do it.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:50.460
&gt;&gt; If I could also ask a question,
thank you so much for tonight.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:59.910
I wanted to know if you've noticed
with Huerta and Chavez's life,

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:04.420
if they found encouragement
and influence

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:11.400
from 20th century religious figures
like Oscar Romero, Dorothy Day,

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.020
Gustavo Gutierrez, Martin
Luther King, Mother Theresa.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:19.120
If you noticed them
finding influence

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.000
and encouragement from
figures like those?

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.260
&gt;&gt; Diana Garcia: Well most
definitely you didn't mention him

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:30.630
from Gandhi.

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:35.930
That was the core to their
own non-violent approach

01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:40.150
to union organizing, to
striking, to picketing.

01:11:40.150 --> 01:11:42.450
That this would be a
non-violent movement.

01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:47.630
The power of non-violence to
speak so much strong, stronger,

01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:50.910
so much more loudly
than hitting back.

01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:54.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah thank you.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.680
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: There was
so many, that's why just a question

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.160
of religion is so big isn't it?

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:04.140 position:56%
It's so big, like [foreign word] and
the [foreign word], the big banner

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.780
that kind of led the
pilgrimage of [foreign word]

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.900
and beyond that and within that.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:14.950
You know there were also a
lot of songs, a lot of poetry,

01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:19.450
a lot of theater, a lot of story
telling and the famous newspaper

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:21.710
in [foreign word], the
Misbehave, what's the word

01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:24.160
in English [foreign word].

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.780
The misbehave one, misbehaved one.

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.850
&gt;&gt; The spoiled one.

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:33.510
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: The
spoiled one, the spoiled one.

01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:36.110
[ Foreign Language ]

01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:37.970
Don't be, get over here.

01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:42.880 position:56%
Right and you could see all those
[foreign word] and all those notices

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.280
and writings, even that newspaper
inspired the younger ones

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.360
at that time, like myself so we
all created little newspapers

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.110
in our communities.

01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:56.890
Kind of modeled in some ways after
[foreign word], with a local news

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:59.580
of the day among the
students in communities.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:03.170
So all those things are also
part of this amazing moment

01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:06.920
with Dolores Huerta, Cesar
Chavez, Filipino, Filipina,

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.050
farm workers and leaders.

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:12.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah thank you.

01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:17.760
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Yeah
thank you very much.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.630
&gt;&gt; Taina Caragol: Well thank you
very much for your questions.

01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:23.310
I'd like to thank the poets, I
have to say that as a curator

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:29.660
of the show, you know the main
medium of exhibitions relies

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:34.510
on visual material and on text,
on the text that is on the walls.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:40.880
And I feel that through their
art, Arlene, Juan Felipe

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.180
and Diana have really
expanded massively.

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.530
What is on the walls in the show?

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:53.580
And I could hear it and I could see
it happening and it was right there

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:57.300
as they, as they read, was
