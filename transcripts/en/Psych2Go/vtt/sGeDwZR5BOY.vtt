00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Oh

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.160
One. there are four types of introverts social thinking anxious and restrained

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.209
Social introversion is what's commonly accepted and understood as the stereotypical definition of introversion

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.519
social introverts prefer solitude or small groups of people over large gatherings

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:45.299
They rather stay home with a book or laptop or hang out with close friends, then go to parties with many unfamiliar faces

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.260
Social introversion is different however from shyness because there's no anxiety attached to their need for solitude

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.080
Thinking introversion is a newer concept

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.989
Thinking introverts are introspective thoughtful and self reflective unlike social introverts

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.669
They don't feel a need to avoid large social scenes instead they like to daydream using their rich imaginations and creative capacities

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.700
Anxious introverts on the other hand seek time alone because they feel awkward and self-conscious

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.549
Unlike social introverts they experience painful shyness around new people and the anxiety doesn't

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.530
Necessarily go away when they're alone because they let situations play over and over in their heads

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.079
Contemplating what might have gone wrong?

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.749
Lastly restrain introverts function on a slower pace and prefer to think before they speak or act

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.468
They're also known for being reserved. They like to take their time

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.139
preventing impulse from affecting their decision-making

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.170
Two introverts react quickly to new information, but are slow to monitor change

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.210
Introverts brains become more excited when they analyze what steps they must take in the future

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.449
But hesitate when they need to prepare for action whereas

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.219
Extroverts need to minimize the thoughts in their heads to make a decision but act quickly afterwards

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.868
Three introverts dread small talk

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.149
Introverts might seem disinterested in other people because they dislike small talk however

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.749
They only dislike it because he creates barriers between them and others

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.339
Instead introverts want to feel authentically connected, so they crave deep meaningful conversations that help lower social walls

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.600
For introverts need alone time

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.850
This is because introverts respond differently to rewards such as food money sex and social status than extroverts do

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.949
Although they do care about eating income and relationships, they're less driven about and experience less enthusiasm for the possibilities of them

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.009
Extroverts in contrast are more excited to work for those rewards, which is why they're so prone to instant gratification

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.560
more often than introverts

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.379
Five introverts are more careful and calculated about what risks to take?

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.389
This is due to a difference in dopamine activity between introverts and extroverts brains

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.010
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.299
Associated with sensation-seeking risks and new adventures both introverts and extroverts have the same amount of it

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.108
But introverts brains are less active in the region that generates dopamine

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.119
Six introverts are deep thinkers

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.240
Since it reverts use less activity from dopamine. They rely more on a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.210
Like dopamine it's linked to pleasure

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.699
But the pleasure is produced from turning inwards

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.669
This allows introverts to reflect deeply and stay focused on a single task for an extended period of time

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.029
acetylcholine also influences them to prefer calm quiet settings over loud crowded places

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.629
Seven introverts are more creative

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.489
introverts need solitude to recharge

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.569
But it's also within solitude where they find creativity

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.679
Most artists and writers who identify as introverts produce their best work when they're by themselves as opposed to in group settings

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.059
additionally people in general feel less self-conscious when they're alone

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.699
So being in solitude helps introverts feel safe to take risks that allow their creative juices to flow

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:12.739
Eight

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.269
introverts like the rain

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.508
Rain creates white noise that attracts introverts because it signals opportunities for solitude

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.179
They find the calming effect pleasurable since it allows them to escape within themselves for the time being

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.519
Rain helps lower expectations for the day as well and isn't as overstimulating as the Sun

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.329
Nine pretending to be extroverted can have a negative effect on an introverts performance

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.090
The time introverts spend on pretending to be people they're not disrupts. Their usual level of performance

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.089
It's important to realize and acknowledge this since the world is so used to trying to mould introverts and extroverts

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.220
Ten

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.579
introverts might not prioritize happiness

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.939
Although we live in a culture that emphasizes happiness

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.209
Introverts actually prefer to maintain a neutral emotional state when presented with tasks such as taking a test

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:12.190
Giving a speech or thinking rationally. This is because happiness and arousing emotion may distract them from completing their tasks efficiently

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.839
Extroverts on the other hand prefer happiness because it acts as a motivator

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.730
