00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.320
So here we are in this Web page.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.320
Let's take a look at what it looks like when we can see our click locations.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.950
I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.520
open up the console by pressing Command+Option+J and start clicking around.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.920
We can see x location with a pixel value and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.030
y location with a pixel value of where we were clicking on the page.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.940
For this question, I want you to use this code here to pass x and

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.900
y click values into a function called logClicks.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.040
You'll need to write some code here that will collect the x and y click values.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.590
logClicks is defined in helper js.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.140
It's going to append the x and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.860
y values to a list and Console.log what you saw before.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.030
X location with a pixel value, and y location with a pixel value.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.960
When you do everything right,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.280
you should start seeing your clicks showing up in the Console.
