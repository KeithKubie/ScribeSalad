The stars of "Hostile Planet"
are obviously the animals.

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:06.266
But the unsung heroes
are the crew that work so

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.066
hard to bring you that footage.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.333
[wolves howling]

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.867
PETE MCGOWAN: So my
name's Pete McGowan.

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:16.066
I'm here in the Canadian
Arctic trying to film wolves

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.600
hunting bison.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600
And hopefully in a minute
through the scrub over there,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.633
there might be a
herd of bison being

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:27.934
followed by a pack of 23 wolves,
hopefully not straight at me.

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:31.333
When we went to film
the wolves and the bison,

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.333
our aim was to film a hunt.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.367
My job was to go up every
morning first thing, look

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:38.834
for the wolves,
and every day we'd

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:40.233
find the bison but no wolves.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.934
It was a two-week shoot,
and we spent seven days.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:47.000
And we didn't see a wolf, and no
one knew where the wolves were.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.266
And you know it's make or break.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.000
And we're just sat
there in an airport

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.400
just waiting day after day.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.734
And then you get
that phone call--

00:00:57.734 --> 00:00:58.800
[snaps fingers]

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.567
--and it all changes.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:02.300
And you are in the
helicopter, and you

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.700
are headed straight out to it.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.233
And you know you've got
one chance to nail it.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.400
And if you mess
it up, that's it.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.367
TOM HUGH-JONES: So the idea
was we'd cover the hunt

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:14.533
from the air whilst we
left Pete on the ground

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.500
so that he could capture shots
of the chase panning out.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
It's really hard
trying to predict

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.667
where they're going to go.

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.133
We dropped him off into
the middle of nowhere

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.734
at minus 40 degrees.

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:28.800
And he was having to traipse
around in his snow shoes

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.000
pulling all his camera gear.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.734
I mean, it was hardcore.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.867
For once we managed
to guess right

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:37.500
and predict where the wolves and
the buffalo were going to come.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.066
And we placed Pete
right in their path.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.467
As the wolves are
chasing them past,

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:43.533
Pete's capturing these
shots of these bison.

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:48.633
I was watching it
from above, and he's

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:52.433
got these one-ton beasts
charging towards him.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:54.467
And you're thinking like,
hold it, hold it, hold it.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:56.200
And I could see the moment
where he's obviously

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.433
looking through his long lens.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:58.467
And I think he just
thought, are they

00:01:58.467 --> 00:01:59.800
going to run straight into me?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.033
[laughs] Have they seen me?

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:04.033
Just along here,
the lead big bull,

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:07.033
they started coming
up along my track.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:08.633
They're just like
a freight train

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:13.100
running through everything, and
kept me in this little bush.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.066
They came pretty close,
a little bit too close,

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.767
really, for my liking.

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:20.600
TOM HUGH-JONES: The main
worry is that, you know,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.333
we're only going to see
this a couple of times.

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:25.333
And are the cameramen going
to be able to nail it?

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:27.500
MARK MACEWAN: And I've
got the camera controller.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.133
And I'm trying to keep
that on one of 23 wolves

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:32.533
I think might be about
to take down a buffalo,

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.667
or stay a bit wider
and cover the event.

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:36.600
TOM HUGH-JONES: The skill of
these cameramen to be able

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.667
to keep the camera in focus
as the helicopter's moving,

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:42.133
the scene is changing,
and predicting

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.133
where they're going--

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.200
I've no idea how they do it.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.500
It was a lovely low sun.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500
And the bison were
kicking up the snow,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.100
so it was all, kind of, backlit.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.500
And we just think, wow,
this is a spectacle.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.867
That's the high-five moment.

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:53.900
That's going to make the promo.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.734
[laughs]

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:55.734
[music playing]

00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:56.767
[wolves howling]

00:02:58.033 --> 00:02:59.033
