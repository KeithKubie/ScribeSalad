00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
In today's video,
we are going to find out just

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.900
how much paint is actually
in a spray paint can,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.000
mix some colors together,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.400
and then try boiling it.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.940
[Music]

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.820
We have a little bit
of leftover spray paint

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.121
from a couple of projects.

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:17.700
Just a few.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.940
Just just a little.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.660
We might have an addiction
to spray for you.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.820
I've always been curious to see
a few things about spray paint.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.780
For one,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.700
how much paint do you actually
get out of one of these cans?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.200
I also want to see

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:31.900
what spray paint looks like
when it's just sitting in a pot,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.720
like a gallon of it.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.700
Most people know

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.928
that you could spray
spray paint into a fire,

00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:37.600
and it'll burn, it'll catch.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.500
However, a lot of that
is the propellant itself,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.900
and not necessarily the paint.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.468
Finally, we want
to see what happens

00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:44.834
if we add a little bit of heat.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:45.490
Does it boil?

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.640
Does it just burn?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.860
We don't know, and we want to.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.060
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.700
We have got a lot
of spray paint.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.870
We're going to try spraying
it all into one pot,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.320
and then turn on the heat.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.360
Let's see how much
spray paint is in a pot.

00:00:57.378 --> 00:00:58.678
Although, one other thing,

00:00:58.678 --> 00:01:00.528
we are in a dome,
and it's pretty big,

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:01.850
but we have a lot
of spray paint.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.500
I think we sprayed
it all in here,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.200
we would end up high as a kite.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.580
So we're going to take the pot
and the spray paint outside,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.880
and do the spraying there.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.480
Supposedly, there's
15 ounces in this can.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.400
Time to find out.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.900
[Music]

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.360
It's pretty color.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.400
This may take longer
than I thought.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.780
[Music]

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.500
Thanks.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.499
So much better.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.700
This is wonderful.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.780
You're so helpful.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.600
I mean, the fumes
aren't going on you.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.060
That's-- That's fair.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.400
But you're kind of cold.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.440
But this is not 15 ounces
worth of paint.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.252
Yeah, I think you're right.

00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:41.249
I think we just lost
a ton of it to the air.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.800
Yeah.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.300
I feel like when
I'm painting things,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.711
I run out of spray paint
faster than this.

00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:47.430
I know.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.654
When you're, when you're trying
to paint with it,

00:01:49.654 --> 00:01:50.783
you get like three passes,

00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:52.410
and then you're like,
the can ran out.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.640
This can never come ahead.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.500
Now, to be clear,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.030
this was a brand
new can of paint.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.549
Most of these will be half used,

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.400
but we wanted to see exactly
how much was in a brand-new can,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.700
and shockingly, it's a lot.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.560
Speaking of which--

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.440
Is that it?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.460
It's pretty much there.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.900
That's a whole can
of spray paint.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.340
That's sad.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.600
That looks really cool though.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.400
It's beautiful, but there's
not much in here.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.300
That's very cold.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.900
So we were looking at the can,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.267
or not the can, we're looking
at the bottom of the pot,

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:28.100
and it's actually--

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.480
It's frozen over.

00:02:29.508 --> 00:02:29.892
Yeah.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.200
This much paint depressurizing
actually comes out very cold,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.160
and it's cold out here anyway,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.580
so it just sort of stays cold
once it gets cold.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.360
Look at that.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.180
The bottom of the pot
has frosted over,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.500
and Calli stuck her finger

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.360
into the paint, and said
that it's also very cold.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.820
Let's do more.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.800
More colors.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:03:13.120
[Music]

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.000
That's about a gallon
of spray paint right there.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.750
That's amazing.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.460
So much.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.088
With hydro-dipping,
you have paint on top of water.

00:03:19.088 --> 00:03:22.200
Here, we've just got
paint on top of more paint.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.000
So it's not going
to work nearly the same,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.219
or probably nearly
as successful but--

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:27.700
I suspect this whole thing--

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.500
We're going to--

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.300
We've got this clear Christmas
ornament, and I suspect

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.399
that the whole thing will just
end up sort of a muddy brown.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.040
Gray. Yeah.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.400
Maybe we'll get a little bit of that
turquoise surface stuff on it.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.520
Let's find out.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.840
[Music]

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.580
Wait, I actually love it.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.240
It's so shiny.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.840
[Music]

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.800
Guys, it's the beach.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.180
We made the beach.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.240
In the middle of the winter.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.978
So the inside of these ornaments
are really pretty.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.600
The outsides are just...

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.640
Mud.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.500
Purplish sparkly mud, but mud.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.500
That was really cool
with all the paint

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.653
like rushing into the globe.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.600
Not, not much.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.040
We got a few gold swirls,
but the color is just..

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.660
It's just...

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.620
Kind of all mixes.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.170
We'll be selling these?

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.060
$400 as is appropriate and fair.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.120
All right.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.300
So this is kind of gorgeous.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.270
Now that we know that--

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.140
Those are some
really cool swirls.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.200
That is beautiful.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.920
But it's freezing.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.010
I want to heat it up.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.000
I wanna boil it.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.900
All right, that's lit,
but it's on fairly low heat.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.902
I'm hoping we can
actually get to a point

00:04:42.902 --> 00:04:44.520
where we can see this bubbling.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.020
I think it's very likely
that it will light on fire.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.900
But I do want to see
if we can get like a bubbling,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.860
rolling boil before that.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.700
Because I think it
will look interesting.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.229
There's water running
down the outside of the pot,

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.448
because it got so cold.

00:04:57.448 --> 00:04:58.683
It's actually frozen.

00:04:58.683 --> 00:05:01.066
That it was frozen all
the way around, and now,

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.595
we're starting to thaw it,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.940
and we've got just a few drips
down here at the bottom.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.400
We sprayed in maybe 3/4
of an inch of paint

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.900
before we had to stop
for the day,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.780
and we came back,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.800
and I think that paint
got a lot colder.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.848
It was still liquid,
but I'm guessing,

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.398
it didn't really mix very well.

00:05:17.398 --> 00:05:18.798
And now, as it's heating up,

00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:20.790
we've got some of that
raising up to the top.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.000
When we stopped that yesterday,
it was a very green mix.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.700
So it's bubbling,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.600
but there's no heat
radiating off of it.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.140
The side of it's cool.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.000
That is slightly cool,
is I would say.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.231
How-- the bubbles are weirding me out.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.840
Now, my entire hand
is submerged in spray paint,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.840
which is odd.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.980
But awesome.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.760
Very thin, and
it's like slippery,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.800
so it kind of feels
like my hand is in oil.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.680
So it's thinner than regular,
like house paint.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.500
Definitely thinner
than house paint.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.840
And yet, it's almost soapy.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.900
It's interesting.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.176
You can see as he's...

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:01.000
The the teal is coming through.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.580
That was the teal that,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.900
that we've sprayed
in the very beginning yesterday.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.700
I am rubbing some of the paint
off of the bottom of the pot,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.180
and it's definitely warmer.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.700
As long as I keep
my fingers moving,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.900
it's not like burning
them at all or anything.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.240
[Music]

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.520
I think the solvents

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.880
in the paint are slightly
dissolving my glove.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.538
They are.

00:06:24.538 --> 00:06:26.500
That gloves
normally form-fitting.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.500
[Music]

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.900
Well, that's a very very
thin bottom steel pot.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.940
And so,

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.300
individual tiny little bits
of paint probably are boiling.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:47.540
[Music]

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.120
Now, it's on high heat.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.680
So now we're backing up.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.900
Oh, and that is bubbling
much more vigorously.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:04.280
[Music]

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.800
That could have been
potentially disastrous.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.040
That is a lot
of flammable liquid.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.415
We decided we had too

00:07:10.415 --> 00:07:13.100
much flammable liquid
to just let that go,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.636
and possibly light on fire.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.800
Almost certainly light on fire.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.100
And so, what we're going to do

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.061
instead is we're just going
to take it off of the burner,

00:07:21.061 --> 00:07:23.080
move the propane tank far away,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.600
and then see if we can light
the surface of the paint.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.600
Because I really do think
it will light on fire,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.820
but then, we have to deal
with it being on fire,

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.800
and we have a fire extinguisher,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.535
which would probably put it out.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.833
But it also sprays out
with a lot of force,

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:38.600
and maybe that would like
send burning paint flying.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.600
The fumes from--

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.700
There's just so many things

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.600
that we think we might not want
to deal with right now,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.580
especially if it's all that fire
surrounding a propane tank.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.920
We're still gonna light it up.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.800
We're going to see if I
can like the surface on fire.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.040
But without the
propane tank there,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.700
and then, just try putting
a board over to put it out,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.100
and if that doesn't work,
then the fire extinguisher.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:09.560
[Music]

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.680
Poke it with a stick.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.100
I'm going to poke
it with a stick.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.900
A flaming stick.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:16.860
Yeah.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.760
There we go.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:35.200
[Music]

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.900
I don't think it like that.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:37.840
No.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:55.880
[Music]

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.500
That's got to be
the most extreme way

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.760
to graffiti anything ever.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.980
[Music]

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.540
Dries really fast.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:28.660
[Music]

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.300
That's a lot of boiled paint.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.500
[Music]

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.020
Well, I think we
should take this paint,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.100
just set it somewhere.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.520
Just leave it?

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.100
For like six months,
and see if it dries out.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.980
Let's do it.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.534
Stay tuned for six months,

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.300
and maybe we'll show
you the dried out paint.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.000
That's not going
to be in this video,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.117
because we're not
waiting six months.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.820
Guys, that's it for today.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.400
Come back in maybe six months,
and we'll show you

00:09:55.402 --> 00:09:56.971
what's happened to this pot
of spray paint.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:57.725
As for now, you know,

00:09:57.725 --> 00:09:59.005
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:09:59.005 --> 00:10:01.129
That box of the top is going
to take you to our last video.

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:02.159
You should go check that out.

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.377
The other box
is going to show you

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.520
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.699
And if you aren't subscribed
to our Channel,

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:07.837
hit this bomb to join the club.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.780
That way, you'll never miss
out on a cool video.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.760
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.636
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.640
Talk to you then.
