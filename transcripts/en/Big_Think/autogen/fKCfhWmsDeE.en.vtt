scientific data out there now that shows

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859
scientific data out there now that shows
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.679
scientific data out there now that shows
us that our brains will work up to 31

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
us that our brains will work up to 31

good mood so if I smile at you and you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
good mood so if I smile at you and you
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179
good mood so if I smile at you and you
see it or you can hear a smile on

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189

and if I intentionally put you in a good

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
and if I intentionally put you in a good
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.060
and if I intentionally put you in a good
mood your brain will be working more

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
mood your brain will be working more
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.010
mood your brain will be working more
effectively and that already begins to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
effectively and that already begins to
 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.150
effectively and that already begins to
increase the chances that you're gonna

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
increase the chances that you're gonna
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.670
increase the chances that you're gonna
collaborate me with me you'll be smarter

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
collaborate me with me you'll be smarter
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.639
collaborate me with me you'll be smarter
and you like me more at the same time

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649
and you like me more at the same time
 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.460
and you like me more at the same time
now I'll put in downward inflection

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470
now I'll put in downward inflection
 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.050
now I'll put in downward inflection
downward inflection is often used to say

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
downward inflection is often used to say
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.730
downward inflection is often used to say
you know this is the way it is there's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
you know this is the way it is there's
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.469
you know this is the way it is there's
no other way and I will say it exactly

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
no other way and I will say it exactly
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.359
no other way and I will say it exactly
like that if there's a term in a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
like that if there's a term in a
 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399
like that if there's a term in a
contract that there's no movement on and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
contract that there's no movement on and
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620
contract that there's no movement on and
I want you to know it and feel it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
I want you to know it and feel it
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.660
I want you to know it and feel it
without me having to say there's no

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
without me having to say there's no
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.719
without me having to say there's no
movement on this which you know maybe

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
movement on this which you know maybe
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.100
movement on this which you know maybe
you want to yell at somebody and that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
you want to yell at somebody and that
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.960
you want to yell at somebody and that
that's ineffective because that triggers

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
that's ineffective because that triggers
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.190
that's ineffective because that triggers
a different part of the brain and makes

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
a different part of the brain and makes
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.980
a different part of the brain and makes
people angry and they want to fight and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
people angry and they want to fight and
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.560
people angry and they want to fight and
I've done this in contract negotiations

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570
I've done this in contract negotiations
 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.700
I've done this in contract negotiations
I've said things like we don't do work

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710
I've said things like we don't do work
 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.280
I've said things like we don't do work
for hire just like that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
for hire just like that
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.929
for hire just like that
well that's the other side no there's no

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
well that's the other side no there's no
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.139
well that's the other side no there's no
movement whatsoever I also may need to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
movement whatsoever I also may need to
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700
movement whatsoever I also may need to
put you in a more collaborative frame of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
put you in a more collaborative frame of
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.270
put you in a more collaborative frame of
mind and if I want to if I want to ask

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
mind and if I want to if I want to ask
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520
mind and if I want to if I want to ask
you a question I'll say something like

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
you a question I'll say something like
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.499
you a question I'll say something like
it seems like this is important to you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
it seems like this is important to you
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.480
it seems like this is important to you
and I looked up it's more driven by

and I looked up it's more driven by
 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.520
and I looked up it's more driven by
context and I can use upward inflection

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
context and I can use upward inflection
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.100
context and I can use upward inflection
to encourage you and smile while I'm

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
to encourage you and smile while I'm
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.859
to encourage you and smile while I'm
questioning you and that'll make you

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
questioning you and that'll make you
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.100
questioning you and that'll make you
feel less attacked by being questioned

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
feel less attacked by being questioned
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.559
