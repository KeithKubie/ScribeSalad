00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.390
If a doctor is concerned that
a patient either has diabetes

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.430
or is at risk from
diabetes, they

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.785
might suggest an A1C
test to be performed.

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:11.410
And what I want to
do in this video is,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.550
one, just explore
what A1C even means,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.770
and also how that
actually relates

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.170
to diabetes, or the main side
effect of diabetes, which

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.260
is having high blood
sugar or hyperglycemia.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.869
So to do that, let's think
about red blood cells,

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.410
and I know what
you're thinking, what

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.868
does this have to
do with diabetes?

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:33.430
And we'll get there
in a little bit.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.980
So red blood cells are the main
oxygen carriers in our blood,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.660
they kind of look
like these lozenges,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.700
and inside of red
blood cells you

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.450
have hundreds of
millions of hemoglobin

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.695
molecules, hemoglobin proteins.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:49.810
So let me draw some
hemoglobin proteins.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.470
You actually have, the number
I found is 200 to 300 million

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.870
per red blood cell,
and then we have

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.730
tens of trillions
of red blood cells.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.460
So we have a lot of
hemoglobin in us,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.590
and hemoglobin is what
makes red blood cells red.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.710
When hemoglobin is bound to
oxygen it has a red color.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.600
So this right here, each of
those are a hemoglobin protein.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.250
Now, it turns out
that hemoglobin--

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.610
let me draw a bigger
version of it--

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.080
if it has some glucose
around-- so let

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.280
me draw some glucose floating
around near the hemoglobin--

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.134
if it has some glucose
around, there is some chance,

00:01:28.134 --> 00:01:29.800
it's not a high
probability, but there's

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.470
some chance if the
hemoglobin and the glucose

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.340
bump into each other
in just the right way,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.580
that they'll bind to each other.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.330
And so you'll have
this situation

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.900
where you have glucose
bound to the hemoglobin.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.140
Now, this hemoglobin with
a glucose bound to it

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.095
is called glycated hemoglobin.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.730
I wrote "glycated"
in green because I'm

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.520
using green for the glucose.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.500
And another name for
glycated hemoglobin,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.960
or hemoglobin that has
some glucose bound to it,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.586
is hemoglobin A1C.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.990
And now I can imagine
things are starting

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.210
to click in your brain.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.180
When you are measuring
your A1C levels,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.650
that's a test of the percentage
of your hemoglobin, that

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.400
is hemoglobin A1C.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.870
So you take a
blood test, they're

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.690
measuring relative to the total
amount of hemoglobin there,

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.950
what percentage of
that is hemoglobin A1C?

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.050
And a normal range of
that, so if you just

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.080
have normal blood sugar over
a reasonable amount of time,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.450
you are going to
have a hemoglobin A1C

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.100
level in kind of
the 4 to 6% range.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.940
And people are still kind
of trying to tighten up

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.240
these ranges, and it
doesn't completely

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.900
correlate tightly with the
blood sugar, it does correlate,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.850
but people with the
same blood sugar

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.110
can still have fairly different
A1C levels, but 4 to 6%

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.085
is considered normal.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.060
And if you have higher than 7
or 8%, so greater than 7 to 8%,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.220
so if you had like an A1C
level of 9 or 10%, that's high.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.850
And so you can
imagine, this is kind

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.500
of a proxy for how much glucose
you have in your bloodstream.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.510
Because the more glucose you
have in your bloodstream,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.820
the higher the probability
that that glucose

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.600
is going to react with
the actual hemoglobin.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.424
So you're going to have a higher
percentage of hemoglobin A1C.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:46.090
And the other reason
why this is useful,

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.270
and it's kind of, I guess you
can see on the first pass, it's

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.770
useful because it's not one
of these snapshot tests.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.940
Everything we've talked about
so far with respect to diabetes

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.960
is taking your blood sugar
at any one point in time,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.194
and we know that your
blood sugar changes

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:01.860
throughout the day,
it changes depending

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.750
on how active you are,
it changes depending

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.806
on what you might
have just eaten.

00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:08.180
So when you do blood sugar,
you're just getting a sample,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.596
you don't know what the blood
sugar is throughout the day,

00:04:10.596 --> 00:04:13.550
unless you just kept sampling
it, which could get pretty

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.180
annoying, keep
pricking your needle.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.269
With A1C, this starts to become
a measure of how much glucose

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.464
you have in your blood over
a longer period of time.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.880
And, in general,
it's kind of used

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.990
as a measure for the last few
months, because the red blood

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.730
cells and the
hemoglobin in them,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.090
they have a lifespan
of about 120 days.

00:04:37.551 --> 00:04:40.050
Now, that obviously doesn't
mean that all of your hemoglobin

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.950
gets produced on one day and
then all dies 120 days later.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.206
You have some red blood
cells and hemoglobin

00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:48.080
that might be a few
seconds old, and then you

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.630
have some that might be
approaching 120 days old.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.945
So on average they're going
to be about 60 days old

00:04:52.945 --> 00:04:54.632
or about 2 months old.

00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:56.340
So when you're measuring
this percentage,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.290
you're definitely not getting
the percentage of anything

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.690
older than 120 days,
and on average you

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.580
are seeing things that are
from about two months old.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.470
So the higher this percentage,
this is saying, wow,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.420
my average hemoglobin
molecule in my body

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.630
is only maybe 60 days old at
this point, and already 7 to 8%

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.600
of them have already
been glycated,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.540
which is an indicator that
I probably have more blood

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.720
sugar than a normal person.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.670
In a normal situation, only
4 to 6% of my hemoglobin

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.390
would get glycated.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.940
So hopefully that
explains what A1C is.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.560
But I do want to say, I said
at the beginning of the video,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.050
I'm not a doctor, and even
amongst doctors, the A1C test

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.700
or the A1C measurement,
it's a little bit,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.040
there's some debate
about how useful it is,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.460
what it's measuring, or kind
of how far back it actually

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.990
is a good view at kind
of your glucose levels.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.890
And also, as I
mentioned, two people

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.220
with the exact same blood sugars
could have different A1C levels

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.046
depending on other things.

00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:05.420
How old they are,
or whether they

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.740
have some other type
of medical condition.
