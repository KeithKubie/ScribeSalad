00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:15.517
I was around 10 when one day,

00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:18.284
I discovered a box
of my father's old things.

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.815
In it, under a bunch
of his college textbooks,

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.311
was a pair of black corduroy
bell-bottom pants.

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:29.155
These pants were awful --

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.176
musty and moth-eaten.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.256
And of course, I fell in love with them.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.395
I'd never seen anything like them.

00:00:36.154 --> 00:00:37.623
Until that day,

00:00:37.647 --> 00:00:42.137
all I'd ever known and worn
was my school uniform,

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:45.378
which, in fact, I was pretty grateful for,

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:47.524
because from quite a young age,

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.442
I'd realized I was somewhat different.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:53.245
I'd never been one of the boys my age;

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:54.771
terrible at sports,

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:57.456
possibly the unmanliest little boy ever.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.568
(Laughter)

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.258
I was bullied quite a bit.

00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:06.140
And so, I figured that to survive
I would be invisible,

00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:07.749
and the uniform helped me

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:11.149
to seem no different from any other child.

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:12.350
(Laughter)

00:01:12.374 --> 00:01:14.436
Well, almost.

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:18.240
This became my daily prayer:

00:01:18.264 --> 00:01:21.738
"God, please make me
just like everybody else."

00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:25.927
I think this went straight
to God's voicemail, though.

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.003
(Laughter)

00:01:27.027 --> 00:01:29.529
And eventually, it became pretty clear

00:01:29.553 --> 00:01:33.373
that I was not growing up to be
the son that my father always wanted.

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:34.983
Sorry, Dad.

00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:40.358
No, I was not going to magically change.

00:01:40.382 --> 00:01:45.687
And over time, I grew less and less sure
that I actually wanted to.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.344
Therefore, the day those black corduroy
bell-bottom pants came into my life,

00:01:51.368 --> 00:01:52.688
something happened.

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:54.624
I didn't see pants;

00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:56.564
I saw opportunity.

00:01:57.087 --> 00:01:59.788
The very next day,
I had to wear them to school,

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:00.962
come what may.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.256
And once I pulled on those god-awful pants
and belted them tight,

00:02:05.844 --> 00:02:10.240
almost instantly, I developed
what can only be called a swagger.

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:11.896
(Laughter)

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.586
All the way to school,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.526
and then all the way back
because I was sent home at once --

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.858
(Laughter)

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:21.989
I transformed into
a little brown rock star.

00:02:22.013 --> 00:02:23.552
(Laughter)

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:26.551
I finally didn't care anymore
that I could not conform.

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:29.680
That day, I was suddenly celebrating it.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.500
That day, instead of being invisible,

00:02:33.524 --> 00:02:35.318
I chose to be looked at,

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:38.279
just by wearing something different.

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:43.418
That day, I discovered
the power of what we wear.

00:02:43.723 --> 00:02:46.396
That day, I discovered
the power of fashion,

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:49.251
and I've been in love with it ever since.

00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:53.964
Fashion can communicate our differences
to the world for us.

00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:56.754
And with this simple act of truth,

00:02:56.778 --> 00:02:59.606
I realized that these differences --

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.576
they stopped being our shame.

00:03:02.413 --> 00:03:05.044
They became our expressions,

00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:08.472
expressions of our very unique identities.

00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:12.315
And we should express ourselves,

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:13.671
wear what we want.

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:16.160
What's the worst that could happen?

00:03:16.184 --> 00:03:21.014
The fashion police are going to get you
for being so last season?

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:22.999
(Laughter)

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:25.826
Yeah.

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.172
Well, unless the fashion police
meant something entirely different.

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:38.228
Nobel Prize laureate Malala
survived Taliban extremists

00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:39.841
in October 2012.

00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:45.324
However, in October 2017,
she faced a different enemy,

00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:49.726
when online trolls viciously
attacked the photograph

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.873
that showed the 20-year-old
wearing jeans that day.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.440
The comments,

00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:56.977
the hatred she received,

00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:59.983
ranged from "How long
before the scarf comes off?"

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:02.167
to, and I quote,

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:06.105
"That's the reason the bullet
directly targeted her head

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.419
a long time ago."

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.088
Now, when most of us decide
to wear a pair of jeans

00:04:11.112 --> 00:04:14.880
someplace like New York,
London, Milan, Paris,

00:04:16.007 --> 00:04:19.831
we possibly don't stop
to think that it's a privilege;

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.096
something that somewhere else
can have consequences,

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:28.847
something that can one day
be taken away from us.

00:04:30.447 --> 00:04:33.541
My grandmother was a woman
who took extraordinary pleasure

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:34.862
in dressing up.

00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:36.976
Her fashion was colorful.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.689
And the color she loved to wear so much
was possibly the only thing

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.617
that was truly about her,

00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:44.590
the one thing she had agency over,

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.948
because like most other women
of her generation in India,

00:04:47.972 --> 00:04:50.646
she'd never been allowed to exist

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.556
beyond what was dictated
by custom and tradition.

00:04:54.535 --> 00:04:56.314
She'd been married at 17,

00:04:57.094 --> 00:05:01.785
and after 65 years of marriage,
when my grandfather died suddenly one day,

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:04.838
her loss was unbearable.

00:05:07.122 --> 00:05:10.893
But that day, she was going to lose
something else as well,

00:05:11.514 --> 00:05:12.786
the one joy she had:

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:14.583
to wear color.

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.983
In India, according to custom,

00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:20.283
when a Hindu woman becomes a widow,

00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:23.002
all she's allowed to wear is white

00:05:23.026 --> 00:05:25.104
from the day of the death of her husband.

00:05:25.634 --> 00:05:27.771
No one made my grandmother wear white.

00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:32.259
However, every woman she'd known
who had outlived her husband,

00:05:32.283 --> 00:05:33.866
including her mother,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.040
had done it.

00:05:35.463 --> 00:05:39.847
This oppression was so internalized,

00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:41.468
so deep-rooted,

00:05:41.492 --> 00:05:44.135
that she herself refused a choice.

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.541
She passed away this year,

00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:50.167
and until the day she died,

00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:52.342
she continued to wear only white.

00:05:56.275 --> 00:05:59.741
I have a photograph with her
from earlier, happier times.

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:03.391
In it, you can't really see
what she's wearing --

00:06:03.415 --> 00:06:05.205
the photo is in black and white.

00:06:05.783 --> 00:06:08.615
However, from the way she's smiling in it,

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.525
you just know she's wearing color.

00:06:12.382 --> 00:06:15.235
This is also what fashion can do.

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.374
It has the power to fill us with joy,

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:23.116
the joy of freedom to choose for ourselves
how we want to look,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.668
how we want to live --

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:27.955
a freedom worth fighting for.

00:06:28.608 --> 00:06:32.593
And fighting for freedom, protest,
comes in many forms.

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:36.975
Widows in India like my grandmother,
thousands of them,

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:38.853
live in a city called Vrindavan.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.675
And so, it's been a sea
of white for centuries.

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:47.702
However, only as recently as 2013,

00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:51.456
the widows of Vrindavan
have started to celebrate Holi,

00:06:51.947 --> 00:06:53.957
the Indian festival of color,

00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:56.934
which they are prohibited
from participating in.

00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:00.235
On this one day in March,

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.962
these women take the traditional
colored powder of the festival

00:07:04.705 --> 00:07:06.178
and color each other.

00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:11.383
With every handful of the powder
they throw into the air,

00:07:11.407 --> 00:07:15.241
their white saris slowly start
to suffuse with color.

00:07:16.423 --> 00:07:19.867
And they don't stop until
they're completely covered

00:07:19.891 --> 00:07:23.524
in every hue of the rainbow
that's forbidden to them.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:26.772
The color washes off the next day,

00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:30.458
however, for that moment in time,

00:07:30.482 --> 00:07:32.756
it's their beautiful disruption.

00:07:34.742 --> 00:07:36.132
This disruption,

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.561
any kind of dissonance,

00:07:39.116 --> 00:07:43.113
can be the first gauntlet we throw down
in a battle against oppression.

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:45.465
And fashion --

00:07:45.926 --> 00:07:48.336
it can create visual disruption for us --

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:50.316
on us, literally.

00:07:51.942 --> 00:07:54.521
Lessons of defiance
have always been taught

00:07:54.545 --> 00:07:56.518
by fashion's great revolutionaries:

00:07:57.045 --> 00:07:58.226
its designers.

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:03.985
Jean Paul Gaultier taught us
that women can be kings.

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:06.065
Thom Browne --

00:08:06.089 --> 00:08:08.906
he taught us that men can wear heels.

00:08:10.392 --> 00:08:14.847
And Alexander McQueen,
in his spring 1999 show,

00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:17.912
had two giant robotic arms
in the middle of his runway.

00:08:19.222 --> 00:08:24.115
And as the model, Shalom Harlow
began to spin in between them,

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:26.268
these two giant arms --

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:28.772
furtively at first and then furiously,

00:08:28.796 --> 00:08:30.897
began to spray color onto her.

00:08:31.328 --> 00:08:33.070
McQueen, thus,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.414
before he took his own life,

00:08:35.438 --> 00:08:39.429
taught us that this body
of ours is a canvas,

00:08:40.088 --> 00:08:44.079
a canvas we get to paint however we want.

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:47.697
Somebody who loved this world of fashion

00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:49.187
was Karar Nushi.

00:08:49.548 --> 00:08:51.640
He was a student and actor from Iraq.

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:54.693
He loved his vibrant, eclectic clothes.

00:08:55.164 --> 00:08:59.983
However, he soon started receiving
death threats for how he looked.

00:09:00.764 --> 00:09:02.195
He remained unfazed.

00:09:02.754 --> 00:09:04.602
He remained fabulous,

00:09:04.626 --> 00:09:06.594
until July 2017,

00:09:06.618 --> 00:09:10.660
when Karar was discovered dead
on a busy street in Baghdad.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.433
He'd been kidnapped.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.741
He'd been tortured.

00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:22.909
And eyewitnesses say that his body
showed multiple wounds.

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:25.197
Stab wounds.

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:30.117
Two thousand miles away in Peshawar,

00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:36.553
Pakistani transgender activist Alisha
was shot multiple times in May 2016.

00:09:37.339 --> 00:09:39.375
She was taken to the hospital,

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:41.574
but because she dressed
in women's clothing,

00:09:41.598 --> 00:09:45.950
she was refused access
to either the men's or the women's wards.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.474
What we choose to wear can sometimes
be literally life and death.

00:09:53.569 --> 00:09:56.660
And even in death,
we sometimes don't get to choose.

00:09:57.387 --> 00:09:58.991
Alisha died that day

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.038
and then was buried as a man.

00:10:02.753 --> 00:10:04.378
What kind of world is this?

00:10:05.142 --> 00:10:08.714
Well, it's one in which
it's natural to be afraid,

00:10:09.856 --> 00:10:12.388
to be frightened of this surveillance,

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:15.731
this violence against our bodies
and what we wear on them.

00:10:16.928 --> 00:10:21.624
However, the greater fear
is that once we surrender,

00:10:21.648 --> 00:10:22.821
blend in

00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:25.021
and begin to disappear
one after the other,

00:10:25.907 --> 00:10:28.644
the more normal this false
conformity will look,

00:10:29.693 --> 00:10:31.998
the less shocking
this oppression will feel.

00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:35.920
For the children we are raising,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.957
the injustice of today could become
the ordinary of tomorrow.

00:10:42.849 --> 00:10:44.296
They'll get used to this,

00:10:45.104 --> 00:10:48.858
and they, too, might begin to see
anything different as dirty,

00:10:50.413 --> 00:10:51.791
something to be hated,

00:10:52.763 --> 00:10:54.476
something to be extinguished,

00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:57.123
like lights to be put out,

00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:58.314
one by one,

00:10:58.338 --> 00:11:00.345
until darkness becomes a way of life.

00:11:02.738 --> 00:11:04.924
However, if I today,

00:11:04.948 --> 00:11:06.405
then you tomorrow,

00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:08.274
maybe even more of us someday,

00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:11.161
if we embrace our right
to look like ourselves,

00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:14.075
then in the world that's been
violently whitewashed,

00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:16.772
we will become the pinpricks
of color pushing through,

00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:19.184
much like those widows of Vrindavan.

00:11:21.093 --> 00:11:24.537
How then, with so many of us,

00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:26.641
will the crosshairs of a gun

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:28.567
be able to pick out Karar,

00:11:29.412 --> 00:11:30.567
Malala,

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:32.203
Alisha?

00:11:34.223 --> 00:11:35.521
Can they kill us all?

00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:40.306
The time is now to stand up,

00:11:41.171 --> 00:11:42.539
to stand out.

00:11:43.407 --> 00:11:45.782
Where sameness is safeness,

00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:48.331
with something as simple as what we wear,

00:11:48.355 --> 00:11:50.567
we can draw every eye to ourselves

00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:55.427
to say that there are differences
in this world, and there always will be.

00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:57.417
Get used to it.

00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:01.430
And this we can say without a single word.

00:12:01.844 --> 00:12:04.798
Fashion can give us
a language for dissent.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.208
It can give us courage.

00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:12.258
Fashion can let us literally wear
our courage on our sleeves.

00:12:13.644 --> 00:12:14.797
So wear it.

00:12:16.327 --> 00:12:17.808
Wear it like armor.

00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:20.468
Wear it because it matters.

00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:23.070
And wear it because you matter.

00:12:23.817 --> 00:12:24.967
Thank you.

00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:28.161
(Applause)
