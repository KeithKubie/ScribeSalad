00:00:00.356 --> 00:00:02.245
- [Voiceover] We're asked to
simplify the expression by

00:00:02.245 --> 00:00:04.239
removing all factors
that are perfect squares

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:07.826
from inside the radicals
and combining the terms.

00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:09.998
So, let's see if we can
do it and pause the video

00:00:09.998 --> 00:00:12.955
and give a-go at it
before we do it together.

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:17.307
Alright, so let's see how we
can re-write these radicals.

00:00:17.307 --> 00:00:19.573
So, four times the square root of 20.

00:00:19.573 --> 00:00:22.399
Well, thats the same thing
as four times the square root

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.623
of four, times the square root of five,

00:00:25.623 --> 00:00:28.764
because 20 is the same
thing as four times five.

00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:34.110
And 45, that's the same
thing as nine times five.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.826
And the reason why I'm
thinking about the four

00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:36.902
and I'm thinking about the nine

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.711
is because those are perfect squares,

00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:40.241
so I could write this as,

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:41.757
four times the square root of four times

00:00:41.757 --> 00:00:42.793
the square root of five.

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:46.636
And then I could say, this
part right over here is

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:50.385
minus three, times the
square root of nine,

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.216
times the square root of five.

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:56.064
The square root of 45
is the same thing as the

00:00:56.064 --> 00:00:57.616
square root of nine times five,
which is the same thing as

00:00:57.616 --> 00:01:00.519
square root of nine times
the square root of five,

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.029
and then all of that is going to be over,

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:06.043
all of that is over the square root of 35.

00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:11.043
Now, are there any perfect squares in 35?

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:13.300
35 is seven times five.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.306
No, neither of those are perfect squares.

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:20.306
So, I could just leave
that as square root of 35.

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:22.134
And, let's see, the square root of four?

00:01:22.134 --> 00:01:23.660
Well, thats going to be two.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.328
This is the principal root,
so we're thinking about

00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:26.291
the positive square root.

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:28.206
The square root of nine is three.

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:31.770
And so, this part right over

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.902
is going to be four times two,

00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:35.263
times the square root of
five, so it's going to be

00:01:35.263 --> 00:01:37.738
eight square roots of five.

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:42.629
And then, this part
over here is going to be

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:45.059
minus three, times three,
times the square root of five.

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:49.889
So, minus nine square roots of five.

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.812
And all of that is going to
be over the square root of 35.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.466
Square root of 35.

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:56.970
And, so let's see, if I
have eight of something,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.779
and I subtract nine of that something,

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:01.036
I'm gonna have negative
one of that something.

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:03.883
So, I could say negative one
times the square root of five,

00:02:03.883 --> 00:02:06.839
or I could just say negative
square root of five.

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:11.711
Negative square root of five
over the square root of 35.

00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:13.642
I actually think I could
simplify this even more,

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:15.445
because this is the same thing.

00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:18.408
This is equal to the
negative of the square root

00:02:18.408 --> 00:02:22.733
of five over 35.

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:24.273
Both the numerator and the denominator are

00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:25.828
divisible by five.

00:02:25.828 --> 00:02:27.550
So, we could divide them both by five,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.663
and we would get the square root of

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.974
divide the numerator by five, you get one.

00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:34.465
Divide the denominator
by five, you get seven.

00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:37.350
So, we can view this as
the square root of 1/7th.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.948
Square root of 1/7th.

00:02:40.948 --> 00:02:42.674
And we are all done.

00:02:42.674 --> 00:02:43.999
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.958
These are strangely, strangely fun.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.089
And once again, pause it,

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.590
and see if you can work
it out on your own.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.815
Perform the indicated operations.

00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:56.735
Alright, so let's first multiply.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:58.234
So, this essentially is doing

00:02:58.234 --> 00:03:00.302
the distributive property twice.

00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:01.526
And, actually let me just do it that way,

00:03:01.526 --> 00:03:03.274
so let's distribute the
square root of five,

00:03:03.274 --> 00:03:04.499
plus the square root of six.

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.339
Let's first multiply it times
the square root of five.

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.234
So, the square root of five
times the square root of five

00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.564
is going to be five.

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:15.639
Square root of five times
the square root of six is

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.277
the square root of 30.

00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:21.741
So, five plus the square root of 30.

00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:26.486
And then, when I take this expression,

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:30.113
and I multiply it times the second term,

00:03:30.113 --> 00:03:32.222
times the negative square root of six.

00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:33.728
Well, negative square root of six times

00:03:33.728 --> 00:03:34.947
the square root of five is going to be

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:38.118
the negative of the square root of 30.

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:40.821
And then the negative of
the square root of six

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:42.814
times the square root
of six is going to be,

00:03:42.814 --> 00:03:44.778
we're gonna subtract six.

00:03:44.778 --> 00:03:46.389
The square root of six times
the square root of six is six,

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:47.997
then we have the negative out there.

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:51.084
And so, just like that, we are
left with, well, let's see.

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:53.485
Square root of 30 minus
the square root of 30,

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:55.387
well those cancel out, thats zero.

00:03:55.387 --> 00:03:57.637
And we're left with five minus six,

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:02.421
which is going to be
equal to negative one.

00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:05.252
And we are, we're, we're all done.

00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:07.311
Now, another way that
you could've viewed this,

00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:08.929
is you could've seen a pattern here.

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:09.590
You could've said,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.186
Well, this is the same thing
as A plus B, times A minus B,

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:17.388
or A is square root of five
and B is square root of six,

00:04:17.388 --> 00:04:18.595
and we know that this will result in

00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:19.748
the difference of squares.

00:04:19.748 --> 00:04:22.445
This is will be A squared minus B squared.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:24.591
And, so this for this
particular case it would be

00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:28.180
square root of five squared,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.871
minus square root of six squared.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.005
Which is of course
equal to five minus six,

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:36.605
which is equal to negative one.

00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:41.048
Either way, hopefully you found
that vaguely entertaining.
