00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.490
You'll often hear the words
depreciation and amortization

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.200
used together.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.658
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:09.150
is to understand a little bit
better why they are similar

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.590
and the slight difference
between the two.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.440
So in our previous examples,
we've done depreciation.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.150
And so you could
imagine in period zero

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.080
we buy a truck for $60,000.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.480
And instead of just
expensing it in period zero,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.590
instead of putting $60,000
expense right over here,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.740
we capitalize it.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.420
We say that we have
a $60,000 asset.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.580
And so this is right at
the end of period zero

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.840
or at the beginning
of period one.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.500
And what we do is we
spread out this expense

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.540
over the period of time
that we're actually

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.110
going to use the truck.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.620
So in period one, we depreciate
the truck by $20,000.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.912
We're assuming we have a
three year life of this truck.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.286
And we're just
going to do what's

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:48.870
called straight
line depreciation.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.330
We're just going to take
the cost of the truck

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.550
and divide it by its life.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.050
There's other ways
to depreciate it.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.870
Maybe you could imagine
that it depreciates faster

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.000
in the first year, but
this is the simplest type.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.810
And it's actually used by
a lot of companies, just

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.900
straight line depreciation.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.790
So after we use $20,000,
we depreciate the truck

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.626
by $20,000.

00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:08.270
We expense it in that year.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.750
So this is literally an expense.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.130
Then at the end
of period one, it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.120
is now on our books for $40,000.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.860
Then in period two,
we depreciate it

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.640
by another $20,000.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.940
It is going to be an expense, a
$20,000 expense in period two.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.290
Now on our books at the end of
period two, it'll be worth 20.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.542
Then in period three, we
expense another $20,000

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:30.240
on our income statement.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.530
And then on, at least for
just this truck, assuming we

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.710
haven't bought a
new one yet, we've

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.280
completely written it off.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.530
It is now worth
zero on our books

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.690
because based on
what we assumed,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.960
it's not useful anymore.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.010
We kind of have to
scrap this truck.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.780
That's depreciation.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.710
Now imagine if to run our
trucking business we also

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.800
have to pay some
type of license fee.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.980
So let me call
this a license fee.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.730
And let's say that the
license fee was $4,000.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.320
And we get to use
it over four years.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.670
So once again, you could
have just put a $4,000

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.520
expense right over here, but
that's not really accurate.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.690
You're not just using
the fee in that period.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.620
That fee is going to be useful
over the next four years.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.960
So once again, you would
put down the asset, the paid

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.090
license fee or maybe
the prepaid license fee

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.960
depending on how you view it.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.890
And then you would
amortize that cost,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.320
which is essentially the
same thing mathematically.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.900
You'd say, look, I'm going to
use this over the next four

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.380
years, essentially
$1,000 a year.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.900
So my license fee amortization
in year one I'd say is $1,000.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.780
And then on my books I
would carry the license fee

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.480
for $3,000.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.340
Then I'd amortize
another $1,000.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.560
Then it would go down to $2,000.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.049
Amortize another $1,000.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.590
Then at the end of
period three, it's

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.160
now worth $1,000 on my books.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.900
Period four, amortize
another $1,000.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.920
Now I've completely
written it off

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.990
and I probably have to get
another license at this point.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.760
So mathematically,
they're the same thing.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.860
Even philosophically,
they're the same thing.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.900
The idea that instead of
expensing these expenses

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.620
all at once you're saying, look,
they have some useful life.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.300
Let me spread out the expense
over their useful life.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.140
The difference between
the two-- and you

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.930
might have already
kind of realized

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.880
this-- is depreciation is
when you have hard assets.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.640
If you have a
building or a truck

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.940
or some type of equipment, you
would depreciate that asset.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.860
If you have a non-hard
asset or a financial asset

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.760
or something that's
less tangible,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.910
then you would just amortize it.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.520
This is just kind
of a different word

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.810
depending on how
tangible the asset is.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.230
So if it's a license fee
or some other type of fee

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.400
or some type of it maybe
intellectual property,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.170
you would amortize the cost.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.980
If you have a truck or
a building or whatever,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.470
you would depreciate it.
