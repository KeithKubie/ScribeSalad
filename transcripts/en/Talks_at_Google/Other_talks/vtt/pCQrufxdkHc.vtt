&gt;&gt; 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.560
At this time, it's my pleasure to welcome
Chitra back to Google again in 2010.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.230
I first met her -- let's see, I think I walked
into a class in Foothill

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.000
College where she was teaching poetry.
And I studied with her for at least two quarters,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.220
I think.
The fact that she was an excellent poet, and

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.560
probably still is, has
been eclipsed a little bit because she's now

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.110
much more famous as a
novelist and has at least 16 books to her

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.110
credit.
Not only has she completed the books, but

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.330
her books have won several
awards including the American Book Award,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.550
several PEN awards,
the O. Henry and Pushcart Prizes, and two

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.550
of her novels have been
filmed.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.550
She's also a professor of creative writing
at the University of Houston.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.110
Last year when she was here, she read from
her book, The Palace of

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.110
Illusions.
Today, she's back with a brand new novel,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.440
One Amazing Thing.
One Amazing Thing is set in an unnamed American

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.110
city, but I noted that
it was a city that has cable cars and earthquakes.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.110
So, maybe unnamed is not exactly a complete
surprise.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.550
So this novel winds together the personal
stories of individuals who have been

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.990
thrown together in unexpected circumstances.
And we're going to welcome Chitra here to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.990
describe it and read from it.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.990
[applause]

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.540
Chitra Divakaruni: Thank you, Ross.
It's a real pleasure to be back here at Google.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.860
I enjoyed my last visit very much and I'm
already enjoying this visit a

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.220
great deal.
And I'm hoping that after I talk, we'll have

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.750
a conversation as well.
So I'm going to be talking to you about this

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.710
new novel which has just
come out, just a few days back, so you are

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.570
one of the first people that
I'll be talking to about this novel.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.420
And as you heard from Ross, it's a novel about
people who are in a

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.220
life-threatening situation.
A group of people, all of them strangers to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.590
each other, go to an Indian
consulate to get visas to go to India.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.130
They all want to go to India for different
reasons.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.450
And in the beginning of the novel, we don't
know why they want to go to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.239
India, but as the novel goes on that will
be revealed.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.170
But while they are there waiting for their
visas, seven of them, and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.470
two visa office workers, a major earthquake
strikes.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.120
And now they're trapped in the basement of
this building, which has

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:51.700
partially collapsed on them, around them.
And they try very hard to get out but they

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.110
can't.
And this book -- which is very different from

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.820
all of my other books,
which often deal with the immigrant situation

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.420
and people from India
living here or stories that are set in India

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.060
or the movement back and
forth between East and West -- this one is

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.030
very different.
It's a tale of surviving under really difficult

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.970
circumstances.
And the way I came to write this book is quite

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.880
interesting.
But before that, I wanted to say that my entire

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.790
tour for One Amazing
Thing, including this event, is dedicated

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.340
to the memory of my mother
who passed away recently.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.830
My mother's name is Mrs. [INAUDIBLE] Banerjee
and she always wanted to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.919
be a writer herself but because of the time
and place where she grew

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.989
up, she wasn't able to do that.
In her 60s, she did write a few memoir pieces

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.070
that were published in
magazines.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.380
But she always read everything I wrote, and
she was very supportive.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.170
Now, like people, many people of her generation,
my mother was not very

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.329
effusive about expressing how she felt about
things.

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.310
So I would ask her, "Well, Mom, you read this
book.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.651
What did you think?"
And she would generally say, "Hmmm," which

00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:14.639
meant it was okay.
But when she read "One Amazing Thing", which

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.239
she read sometime -- I was
able to get her an advanced copy before she

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.070
passed away, she said, in
my language Bengali, she said, "PAULOWE"(sic),

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.340
which means "not bad."
So I felt that was like high praise coming

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.740
from my mother.
So I'm very excited about this book.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.400
I feel it must be my best book if my mother
said that.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.460
Anyway, but how did I come to write this book?
Sometimes books begin writing themselves before

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.960
you're ready for them,
and that is what happened with One Amazing

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.180
Thing.
Now, although I used to live in the Bay Area

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.270
for many years and
certainly experienced my share of earthquakes

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.060
while I was here, this
book actually comes out of a very different

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.780
experience.
I live now in Houston, and some years back,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.210
you know when Katrina hit
New Orleans, well, a lot of Katrina refugees

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.930
came to Houston.
And I was volunteering in one of the centers

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.340
where we helped the
refugees.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.210
And I began to notice something interesting,
which is I would be

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.390
dealing with many people who had all undergone
the same experience

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.479
pretty much, and pretty much they'd lost everything.
They'd lost their homes.

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.120
They'd lost, sometimes, their pets.
You know, everything was gone.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.039
But their responses were very different.
Some people were very angry, some people were

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.289
very bitter, and some
people were, kind of accepting of it.

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.289
And they would even you know, they were appreciative
that they were

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.639
being helped.
They would even joke about things.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.870
And I began to think, well, what is it that
allows people to -- when

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.740
they're all in that same life-threatening
situation, when they've all

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.960
faced catastrophes, how is it that some of
them can be so much more

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.979
graceful about accepting what has happened,
and why can't everyone do

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.539
that?
Why is that that there's this difference?

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.069
Well, just a few weeks later, another hurricane
approached.

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.689
And this time it was Hurricane Rita.
It was coming right at Houston.

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.830
So everyone was very nervous and the authorities
evacuated us.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.949
But as you can imagine when, you know, all
that many people are all

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.740
evacuated at the same time, we all got on
the freeways, but then we

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.099
weren't going anywhere.
The freeways were completely jammed.

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:39.139
And so I was sitting on Interstate 10, with
like hundreds of cars

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.480
around me, all of us not going anywhere and
Rita was coming.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.210
And fortunately, at the last minute Rita decided
to take a little

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.759
detour otherwise I wouldn't be here and this
book wouldn't be here

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.169
either today.
But as I was experiencing all of that panic

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.780
and fear, I began to notice
the same kind of responses around me.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.819
Some people were really upset.
They were angry.

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:09.699
They were getting into fights with each other.
It was -- you know, they were like, I'm going

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:11.370
to survive no matter
what.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.300
And what I have to do to do it.
And other people were very compassionate.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.979
They were sharing whatever food and water
they had with other people.

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.030
They were helping people who were feeling
sick.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.860
And I noticed that whole spectrum one more
time.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.910
And I started thinking, you know, I really
want to explore this.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.090
I want to write about this.
Because in everyone's life, we're going to

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.249
face situations of
catastrophe.

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:42.430
They might not be natural disasters, but we're
all going to be in places

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.460
where we have no control over what happens,
and we're frightened, and

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.550
you know, we're worried and we're anxious
and we're scared.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.139
And we need to know how to deal with these
situations.

00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:00.280
So here we have these nine people and they're
in that situation, and at

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.810
first they begin to panic.
But then they're going to find a way to deal

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.779
with where they're at
because they can't get out of there.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:13.039
And that becomes the story of One Amazing
Thing.

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:16.610
So I thought I would read to you a little
bit from maybe two different

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:26.469
sections, and then throw it open for questions.
So this novel is different from my other novels,

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:32.300
also, in that in most
of my other novels, all of the main characters

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:38.570
are Indian.
But here, I wanted a community of many different

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.240
people of many
different backgrounds.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.640
And that's what we have here.
So there are people -- so in that visa office,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.110
all getting ready to go
to India for different reasons.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:56.460
There's an African-American ex-solider; there's
an older white couple;

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:03.230
there's an old Chinese woman with her young
 -- with her granddaughter

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.120
who was a teenager and who is kind of punk,
Goth.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.740
And there's a Muslim-American man.
There are just all kinds of people and one

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.140
of -- and what's different is
they're all the main characters.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.960
Unlike my other novels, there isn't like one
protagonist or two.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.370
Everyone is important.
And what they begin doing as the novel goes

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.420
on is going to be equally
important.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.750
So I'm going to read to you a little bit from
the beginning.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:42.790
And in the beginning of -- here's we're in
the point of view of Uma,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:49.230
who is a graduate student, and she studies
literature at the university,

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:54.190
and she's brought her book which she's been
studying The Canterbury

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:59.050
Tales, which as you probably know, is a story
set in a very different

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:05.180
time, but tales within tales.
And she's reading that.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.839
Okay.
"And as -- and she's waiting to be called.

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:13.570
She came here thinking that she would be given
a 9 o'clock appointment,

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.959
but 9 o'clock came, and 10 o'clock came, and
11 o'clock came -- and if

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:22.959
you've had any experience with bureaucratic
offices, this often happens

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:26.710
and now it's afternoon.
And there are all these other -- six other

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.880
people waiting with her.
And she wants to call her boyfriend, Ramon,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:39.740
to tell him where she's at
because she has not -- she has not told him

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.629
where she's coming, for
reasons that will be clarified later on.

00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:49.560
So she's walking around the room trying to
get reception, but she's not

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.870
getting cell phone reception.
Phone to her ear, Uma took a few steps forward.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:02.460
It felt good to stretch her legs.
The phone gave a small burp against her ear,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.260
but before she could check
if it was working, the rumble rose through

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.480
the floor.
This time there was no mistaking it's intention.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.610
It was as though a giant had placed his mouth
against the building's

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:22.370
foundation and roared.
The floor buckled, throwing Uma to the ground.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:27.009
The giant took the building in both his hands
and shook it.

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:32.170
A chair flew across the room toward Uma.
She raised her left hand to shield herself.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.730
The chair crashed into her wrist and a pain
worse than anything she had

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.300
known surged through her arm.
People were screaming.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:47.860
Feet ran by her, then ran back again.
She tried to wedge herself beneath one of

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.620
the chairs, as she had been
taught long ago in grade school, but only

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.360
her head and shoulders would
fit.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.170
The cell phone was still in her other hand,
pressed against her ear.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.769
Was that Ramon's voice asking her to leave
a message or was it just her

00:12:04.769 --> 00:12:11.190
need to hear him?
Above her, the ceiling collapsed in an explosion

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.970
of plaster.
Beams broke apart with the sound of gigantic

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.509
bones snapping.
A light fixture shattered.

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:25.980
For a moment, before the electricity failed,
she saw the glowing

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.370
filaments of the naked bulb.
Rubble fell through the blackness, burying

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.140
her legs.
Her arm was on fire.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.699
She cradled it against her chest, a useless
gesture, when she would

00:12:39.699 --> 00:12:45.459
probably die in the next minute.
Was that the sound of running water?

00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:50.589
Was the basement they were in flooding?
She thought she heard a beep.

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:57.420
The machine ready to record her voice.
'Ramon', she cried, her mouth full of dust.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.620
She thought of his long meticulous fingers,
how they could fix anything

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.190
she broke.
She thought of the small red moles on his

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.509
chest just above the left
nipple.

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:12.610
She wanted to say something important and
consoling, something for him

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:18.329
to remember her by.
But she could think of nothing and then her

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:23.160
phone went dead."
So the earthquake has struck and now this

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.880
whole group will be shut up
in this place, things are going to get really

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.449
bad.
Bits of the ceiling keep falling on them and

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:36.069
they think there's going
to be an aftershock that will cause more of

00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:40.390
the building to collapse.
And then water starts rising in the basement,

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.701
and they're panicking
and they're behaving badly towards each other

00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:49.180
and they're fighting.
And after a really bad fight, Uma says to

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.680
the others, well, we can kind
of destroy ourselves this way or we can do

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.230
something more positive with
our time.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.769
And she says, why don't we tell each other
 -- while we're hopefully

00:13:59.769 --> 00:14:04.850
waiting for rescue -- why don't we tell each
other a story out of our

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:09.670
lives, something we've never told anyone.
Something really important.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:14.529
And everyone is kind of against this idea.
You know, there're not in any mood to tell

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:17.759
stories.
But Uma says, it's, it's really important.

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:23.170
It will take our minds off of what's happening
and it will help us get

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.170
to know each other.
Well, one of them says well, I don't have

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:31.160
a story to tell and then Uma
says in everyone's life there's at least One

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.569
Amazing Thing.
Think about what is yours.

00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:41.610
And then slowly, people begin to tell stories.
And one of the ideas that I had when I was

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:47.050
writing this novel is that I
really believe that in all of our lives, there's

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.930
something special,
something unusual, something that is amazing.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:56.279
But because we're so busy with our everyday
life, doing our daily

00:14:56.279 --> 00:15:02.160
things, taking care of everyday responsibilities,
we forget that we

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.670
have these things that have happened to us,
that have really made us

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.361
who we are today.
So it's my hope that as people read this book,

00:15:10.361 --> 00:15:15.100
they will start thinking
about what is One Amazing Thing that they

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.370
had in their lives.
If they had only one story they could tell,

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.750
what would they talk about?
And now I'll read to you about -- from one

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:30.889
of these stories, where
there's a woman who works in the visa office

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:35.240
who is trapped here, and
she's telling a story about when she was in

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.050
India.
And the story will kind of tell us how she

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.279
ended up in the visa office,
but I'll just read to you a little bit.

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:46.129
One of my challenges in writing this book
was to get -- there are nine

00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:49.399
characters, there are going to be nine different
stories, and I wanted

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:54.160
to make sure that each story had its own voice,
that you really got a

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.889
sense of the character through the story.
And this character, her name is Malathi, and

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:07.560
her name is Malathi, and
she's going to tell her story.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.129
"When I failed tenth grade for the second
time, my parents figured it

00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:19.340
was no use wasting more money on my school
fees and decided to marry me

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.889
off.
I had no objections.

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:24.470
It was not as though I had anything else to
do.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.930
Having navigated their way through the weddings
of two daughters

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:34.490
already, my parents knew that the local matchmaker
would ask for a

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.310
photograph.
If they could provide her with one in which

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:43.720
I looked better than
normal, my chances of finding a husband, and

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.399
theirs of negotiating a
smaller dowry, would be highly improved.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:53.770
Though in general, thrifty and suspicious,
they knew the importance of

00:16:53.770 --> 00:17:00.070
a well-chosen investment.
That is how I ended up in Miss Lola's Lovely

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.940
Ladies salon, the premier
beauty shop in Coimbatore.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:12.510
My mother had been to Lovely Ladies only twice,
but Miss Lola knew her

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.750
right away.
'The bridal photo special, again?' She asked.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:20.370
When my mother nodded, Ms. Lola looked me
looked me up and down and

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:24.920
pronounced that I would require more work
than my sisters.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.120
My mother gave a sigh but did not disagree,
and the two of them fell to

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:36.300
bargaining about the price of my beautification.
When they had reached an agreement, Miss Lola

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:41.260
gave a volley of staccato
instructions to the pink-uniformed girls who

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.940
worked for her, ending
with, bridal special, silver level, with hair

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:52.410
oil.
Two girls whisked me to an inner sanctum filled

00:17:52.410 --> 00:18:00.680
with elegant women undergoing the complex
and painful process of improving upon nature.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.700
I was settled into a reclining chair and shrouded
in cotton sheets.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.660
And it was here in this moist, air conditioned
room, fragrant with

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:15.890
astonishing and exotic substances which my
naive nose was incapable of

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:21.910
identifying that I saw, as though illuminated
by lightening, the path

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:28.520
of my future.
Until this day, I had thought of marriage

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.450
as an inevitable destination,
the only choice a girl from a middle class

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:39.280
Brahmin family, handicapped
by respectability, had in our sleepy town

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.310
was to teach at the
Street Botnaverti Girls Higher Secondary School.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:50.530
But teachers were meagerly paid and resembled
chewed up sticks of sugar

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:58.910
cane, and I had no desire to become one.
I confess, sometimes from our veranda, I spied

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:04.060
on other kinds of women,
receptionists and typists who worked for Indian

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.950
Oil or Guardbridge and
waited across from our house for the company

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:14.260
vans to pick them up.
Torn between disapproval and envy, I noted

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:19.090
the dresses that exposed
their knees, the shoes with platform heels,

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.790
their permed hair.
They wore lipstick, even in daytime, erupted

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:30.170
in laughter at frequent
intervals, whispered prodigiously when men

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.900
in expensive cars drove by
and ignored the remarks aimed their way by

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:40.460
lesser males.
But they were Kerala Christians, members of

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.490
a forbidden, scandalous
species that I could never join.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:50.910
Lola's girls, though, with their perfectly
arched eyebrows, glowing

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:56.060
skin, and pretty faces hanging over me like
radiant moons, were

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.330
different.
As they plucked and exfoliated and massaged

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:06.050
oil and pinched blackheads
and slathered my cheeks with Fair and Lovely

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.350
cream, clucking soothingly
when I yelped, and assuring me that the end

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.250
result would be worth it, I
felt a strange kinship with them.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:20.650
They camouflaged me with sufficient foundation,
face powder, kohl,

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:26.350
lipstick, blush, and Vatika pure coconut hair
oil to pass as one of

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:31.630
Lola's Lovely Ladies.
They attached a glistening bindi to my forehead

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.930
and clipped fake
diamond earrings to my ears.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:40.000
They pinned a sequinned sari, kept in the
salon for this very purpose,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.250
to my upper body, since that was all the photo
would show to

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:49.380
manufacture curves where none had existed
before.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.320
One of them ran to fetch Lola's nephew, who
ran the photography

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.430
business next door, while the others demonstrated
facial expressions

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:03.040
guaranteed to delight mothers-in-law, causing
me to burst into

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.070
laughter, something I never did in the presence
of strangers.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:13.450
But they were no longer strangers.
They had charmed me with their daring jokes,

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:17.600
their code words for
particular beauty procedures, their gallant

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.120
laughter in the face of the
drudgery that I guessed awaited them once

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.510
they stepped out of the
magical perimeter of Lola's salon.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:33.760
The next morning, when my mother armed me
with a parasol to protect my

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.540
newly lightened skin and dispatched me to
the bazaar to buy bitter

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:46.170
gourd, I used the money to rent an auto rickshaw.
Half an hour later, I was at Lola's, begging

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.280
her to let me work for
her.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.400
Lola must have seen something, perhaps a glint
of determination in my

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:01.400
eyes reminded her of her own younger self.
Although she had a room full of clients, she

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.500
took the time to listen to
my pleas.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:10.230
When I finished, she asked, what's the matter?
You don't want to be a bride?

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:19.690
To which I answered, I'd rather be a bride-maker.
Lola, who had been divorced twice and thus

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.880
knew what was what, said,
'smart thinking'.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.450
And just like that, although she hadn't really
needed another employee,

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:33.970
I became one of Lola's girls."
So Malathi's life takes a complete turn.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:38.600
Her family is very against her working in
a beauty salon which they

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:44.560
don't think is respectable, but she persists
and she starts working for

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.900
Lola, and she learns all of these beauty secrets
and she also meets some

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.510
very interesting people.
And I'll read just a little more about one

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:58.740
of these characters.
"Among the creme of creamatorium ladies who

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.530
frequented Lola's, the
richest and most powerful was Mrs. Bonnie

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:09.180
Ballen, wife of an
industrialist who had made his money in cement,

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.790
she visited Lola every
two weeks and underwent our most expensive

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.910
regimes.
In spite of the substantial tips she left,

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:24.700
the girls avoided her.
They didn't like the way she flicked the Rupee

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.790
notes at them.
Besides, she was finicky and hot-tempered,

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.800
and had been known to throw
things if her treatment did not turn out the

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.720
way she had envisioned it.
Only Lola was capable of handling her at such

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.990
times, and even she would
pour herself a full glass of rum and Coke

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.710
after Mrs. Ballen exited the
premises.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:52.920
Now, contrary to all expectation, Mrs. Ballen
takes a great liking to

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.770
Malathi.
And she begins to ask for her.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.670
She wants all her beauty treatments to be
done by Malathi.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:04.350
Mrs. Ballen talked incessantly on her cell
phone.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:10.300
She had perfected the art of speaking without
moving her facial muscles."-- sorry, I can't

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:17.990
demonstrate that "-- and could thus continue
to destroy reputations from under a substantive

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:23.280
swath of seaweed or a
coating of alphahydroxy peel, thick enough

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.610
to render most women
immobile.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:32.910
Thanks to her, I became privy to all manner
of skeletons lurking in the

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:38.210
closets of our fanciest mansions.
Were I so inclined, I could have blackmailed

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.480
large numbers of addicted
husbands, unfaithful wives, and grown offspring

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.020
with questionable
sexual preferences.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:54.730
But we at Lola's had our code of honor."
Like at this point, Mrs. Ballen has a son

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.520
that she's very fond of, her only son, and
he's been studying abroad.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.380
But at this point, he's going to come back
to Coimbatore and things will

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:08.110
get very complicated.
And Malathi's life and his life and Mrs. Ballen's

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.380
life will all get
tangled .

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:16.290
But I'm going to stop right here and ask you
if you have questions.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.660
[PAUSE]

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:30.410
Questions?
The last time I was here, I was here for "Palace

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.670
of Illusions", my
previous novel, which is based on the Mahabharata.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.350
And that book had just come out, it hadn't
yet come out in the India at

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.830
that time, and I remember people were asking
me what they thought the

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:47.320
Indian response to the "Palace of Illusions"
would be because it takes a

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.210
sacred text, the Mahabharata.
And it tells the story from a completely different

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:56.200
point of view, the
point of view of Draupadi so it was something

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.140
different I was trying.
And I was actually quite nervous at that point.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.410
I didn't know how people in India would respond
to it even though I had

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:09.290
stayed pretty, you know, pretty faithful to
the original Mahabharata,

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.110
still, when you change the point of view,
you really change the whole

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.670
meaning of the story.
It's how the narrator sees the story.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:21.620
So I'm very happy to report back to you that
the book went on to do

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:26.250
very well. It was very well-received in India,
and right now it's the

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:30.040
number one bestseller in India.
And who would have thought?

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.900
I would never have guessed that.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.410
Chitra Divakaruni: Thank you.
Thank you.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.420
So Ross, maybe you should start off with a
question.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:53.890
Ross: Since we're discussing this topic of
how books[inaudible], move over from blended

00:26:53.890 --> 00:27:15.670
cultures, you ever feel kind of pressured
as been a representative of Indian culture

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:16.670
and [inaudible]?

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.340
Chitra Divakaruni: The question is do I ever
feel pressured as a

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.700
representative of Indian culture and how do
I feel about that.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.740
I think often writers are taken to be representatives
of the cultures

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.660
that they write from, especially if they're
living in a place where

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:37.131
theirs is not the mainstream culture.
But I always, always tell people that that

00:27:37.131 --> 00:27:41.560
is an inaccurate perception.
I'm just one person giving my understanding

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.330
of India, of the Indian
culture.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:48.360
And, you know, I have a particular set of
experiences that I draw on

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.540
and maybe a particular set of things that
I've read and heard about

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:56.700
that I draw on.
But something like the culture of India is

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.940
so vast, and it's so broad
and so complex, I'm sure everyone in this

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:05.220
audience that's of Indian
origin would have their own take on India.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:11.130
So mine is just one take and therefore it's
 -- I think it's accurate as

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.900
far as accurate and truthful as I can make
it, but it's certainly not

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.020
comprehensive.
And I always tell people that they should

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:24.400
read as many Indian voices as
they can to get very different viewpoints.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.850
So right after you read all of my books, I
would recommend that you

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:37.940
read people like Amitav Ghosh, and Arundhati
Roy, and Aravind Adiga, that you mentioned.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:45.120
And Rohinton Mistry, Jhumpa Lahiri.
There are just so many great voices writing

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.640
out of India right now,
Suketu Mehta, wonderful fiction and non-fiction

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.800
writers, Vikram Seth,
and Vikram Chandra , and they will all, I

00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:01.140
think, provide a slightly
different vision of India.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.140
Yes?

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.860
&gt;&gt; Who's an author you admire?

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.890
Chitra Divakaruni: Who is a writer, author,that
I admire a great

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:12.640
deal?
Well, actually one of the big influences on

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.750
my life is Maxine Hong
Kingston, who is writing out of a slightly

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.760
different tradition, the
Asian-American tradition.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:28.640
But her book that really influenced me, "The
Woman Warrior", is about her growing up as

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.200
an immigrant in this country as a child of
immigrants in this country.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.420
And I think that really influenced me when
I was writing my own

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.390
immigrant stories, such as "An Arranged Marriage",
and then "Unknown

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.790
Errors of Our Lives", because she was interested
in the same kind of

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:51.300
issues, and that gave me a lot of insight
as well as a kind of

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.490
permission to write about my own community.
So she's been a great influence.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:02.330
But really, there are such wonderful, multicultural
voices in American

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:06.230
literature now, people like Toni Morrison
writing out of the African

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:11.300
American culture, Cristina Garcia out of the
Cuban American culture,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.710
Louise Erdrich out of the Native American
culture.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.580
And I've learned a great deal from all of
them.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.750
I read and reread their books a lot.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.750
Yes?

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.840
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:40.420
Chitra Divakaruni: The question is do I see
the new technology

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:45.550
impacting writers and in what way.
Well, first, I have to thank Google, because

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:50.860
really Google has made my
life as a writer so much easier, so much better.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:55.800
Research that used to take me days, where
I would have to go to the

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.430
library, look for books, talk to the librarian,
maybe order things

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.400
that would then come in.
Now I can just do Google search and I have

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.750
it, so thank you to all of
you at Google, please.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.940
You have just made life a lot easier for writers
and I really, really

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.090
mean it.
I'm so appreciative, I'm so appreciative.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:19.830
You've really changed the entire world of
research, at least for me.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:24.260
And I think the other things like the e-books,
Kindle and Google books,

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:33.130
all of them, I mean I use all of those things.
I think a part of me still loves the book

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:38.050
in book form that I can curl
up with in bed on a rainy day.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:42.870
There's just a kind of pleasure.
And especially children's books that we read

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.600
to children, because I
remember reading to children, and they'd lie

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.911
down, and they'd put their
heads on my shoulder and we'd hold the book

00:31:48.911 --> 00:31:52.840
together and we'd read it.
So that has a special kind of -- that's a

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:58.290
special kind of experience.
But in terms of quickness, convenience, making

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.350
things available to
people, I think the new technologies are wonderful.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:08.560
And I have used and profited from all of them.
And I know, like, many of my friends, they

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.960
love their Kindles.
They take them everywhere, and whereas, I'm

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.220
still, I often carry books
and in fact, right now because I'm on book

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.390
tour, my suitcase is full of
books.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:22.650
Because every evening before I sleep I have
to read something.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:26.780
But they just carry their little Kindle and
I have to lug all these

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:31.060
books around so it is a changing world and
I'm always interested to

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.770
see.
I'm very positive to the changes, overall.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.220
Yes?

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.670
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:56.250
Chitra Divakaruni: Oh, wow, that's a complex
question.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.710
I'll take it part by part and if I forget
you'll have to remind me.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.030
All right so "Mistress of Spices" was made
into a film, and actually,

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:07.280
"Sister of My Heart" was also made into a
film in Tamil, in India.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:15.260
So, those two -- and it was a fun experience.
I was only tangentially connected to them.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.390
I was just a consultant, so they'd call me
when they wanted extra

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:23.230
input.
But it was great, you know, seeing the movies

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:27.590
and seeing what the --
what the directors did, which was often -- I

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:31.100
think in the case of
"Mistress of Spices", the movie ended up being

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.960
very different from the book.
Sister of My Heart was much closer it became

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.040
a TV serial, so they could
keep all of the detail.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.300
Right now, three of my works have been optioned,
so you all have to,

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.510
like, send positive energy to these three
works.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:51.790
One is the "Vine of Desire", which is, you
know, the sequel to "Sister of My Heart",

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:57.410
has the same characters, so I'm due now in
this country and it's about their immigrant

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:03.600
life and their complications in their
relationships.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:10.829
That one has been optioned, and Tabu has been
chosen, the actress Tabu has been chosen to

00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:15.500
play the main character Sudha.
And so we'll have to see and a wonderful director,

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.429
who's also a great
actress, Nandita Das, who many of you know,

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:22.950
she's been asked to be
director, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:26.839
I think they're moving very quickly towards
production, and it will be

00:34:26.839 --> 00:34:30.980
fun to see what happens.
Then the other book that has been optioned

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:37.889
is my children's fantasy,
magical adventure the "Conch Bearer", and

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:43.050
that's been optioned by an
independent filmmaker here in the West, so

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.750
we'll have to see what
happens.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:50.230
And then the "Maid's Servant Story" which
is a story out of my collection "Arranged

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:56.589
Marriage" about a very traditional, old family
and what happens in there.

00:34:56.589 --> 00:35:00.260
That's been optioned by Jag Mundra, so if
you have seen Jag Mundra'S

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:04.400
films.
But I'm not sure who's going to act in it.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.570
I don't think they've decided on the actresses.
So I'm excited, let's see what happens.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:14.270
Sometimes people ask me, well, you know, the
movie does end up very

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.269
different from the book, how do I feel about
it?

00:35:16.269 --> 00:35:20.829
But I feel just fine about it.
I have a very clear understanding that the

00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:23.650
book is my work and the
movie is the director's.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.750
You know, the movie is based on the book but
it's not mine.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:38.450
So you know, I don't -- I don't interfere
too much in what they do.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:42.440
Yes?

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.430
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:46.430 --> 00:36:02.390
Chitra Divakaruni: Right. Right.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:06.380
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:16.140
Chitra Divakaruni: Yes.
That's a very good question.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:21.680
That -- is there a cultural component to how
we behave when there are

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.670
disasters?
So is there, for example, in the Eastern or

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:31.029
Indian philosophy, a belief
that so much of our life is based on destiny,

00:36:31.029 --> 00:36:32.710
and therefore we should
be more accepting?

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:38.339
Well, I think we do see that and I do touch
on that a little bit.

00:36:38.339 --> 00:36:43.319
Although, the Indian characters -- well, the
younger ones, have grown

00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:47.780
up in this country, so you know, they're much
more Western in their

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.630
thinking.
But there is a certain, the older characters

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.430
have a certain feeling
that yes, this is destiny and it will work

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.009
out the way it's meant to
work out.

00:36:57.009 --> 00:37:00.269
And they're much more -- you know, they're
much calmer.

00:37:00.269 --> 00:37:04.309
And I've left it to the reader to think is
that better or is that

00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:07.070
worse.
I mean, should we try really hard to change

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:11.250
what's around us?
Or when we think it can't be changed, should

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.980
we be peaceful and
accepting?

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.359
But that comes up as a theme, so it's very
interesting that you should

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:18.920
mention it.
Actually, when I was writing this book, I

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:24.369
did a lot of research on
disasters and how people respond to disasters.

00:37:24.369 --> 00:37:29.369
And I noticed that, for example, when the
tsunami hit India, the

00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:36.740
responses were much more accepting and fate-oriented
than in Western

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.460
catastrophes.
So there is that component.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:44.160
Ultimately, my belief, though, is that it's
personality-based.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.920
Some people believe in that more, and some
people might come from that

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:56.869
culture, but they're much more individualistic.

00:37:56.869 --> 00:37:57.869
Yes?

00:37:57.869 --> 00:38:03.259
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:03.259 --> 00:38:30.310
Chitra Divakaruni: Yeah.
The question, that again is an interesting

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.549
question, looking at
cultural difference.

00:38:32.549 --> 00:38:37.140
When in Mumbai, you're talking about the rain
and the floods and people

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.690
were very worried they were extremely helpful
towards each other.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:48.529
In fact, more so than in usual times.
And when I was researching, I read in a number

00:38:48.529 --> 00:38:54.809
of places that often
disasters will bring out the best in a community,

00:38:54.809 --> 00:38:59.380
and I think this
happens, especially in communities that are

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:04.859
more community-oriented or
family-oriented, so I think that was the case

00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:11.079
in Mumbai, where people
saw the people who were suffering as part

00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:14.140
of this larger family that
they had to take care of.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.490
And in fact, there are many really heartwarming
stories of that point.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:21.700
And there was very little in terms of violence
or looting or anything

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.099
of that kind.
In Houston, I saw both kinds.

00:39:25.099 --> 00:39:28.970
You know, I saw people who were very kind
to each other.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.170
I remember we were all stuck on the freeway,
and then we were moved off

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.630
the freeway onto the side roads in little
towns, and we'd go through

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.019
towns and they'd have a sign up on their porch
saying, do you need

00:39:39.019 --> 00:39:41.069
water?
Do you need to use the restroom?

00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:45.470
Come into our house.
And this is to strangers.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:48.580
And on the other hand, there were people like
don't come near me.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:53.430
Don't even, you know, look at me.
So there was this whole spectrum.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:40:00.630
And I really think perhaps it came out of
what people thought of

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:04.000
community.
People who were very individualistic, perhaps

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.720
they were like, I'm going
to survive no matter what happens to you.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.859
And then others were like, yes, I want to
survive but at what cost?

00:40:11.859 --> 00:40:15.569
I don't want to lose my humanity in order
to survive.

00:40:15.569 --> 00:40:20.710
And that's kind of, one of the themes in "One
Amazing Thing".

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:25.589
In the beginning, everyone here, too, is very
concerned about their

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:28.519
personal survival, but at a certain point
they begin to think, no,

00:40:28.519 --> 00:40:34.319
we're a community.
We rise or we fall together.

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:38.380
And they become more much concerned with everyone's
welfare, which, of

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:45.420
course is, I think, is what we kind of need
to learn as human beings, that yes, we want

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:53.480
to survive but not at the cost of losing our
humanity.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.480
[PAUSE]

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.519
Final questions?

00:40:57.519 --> 00:40:58.519
Yes?

00:40:58.519 --> 00:41:08.390
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:33.450
Chitra Divakaruni: The question is that if
you're a writer, but you're

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:38.320
just starting out, you haven't been published
yet, how do you get to

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.529
that point?
And there is a question that comes a little

00:41:42.529 --> 00:41:46.869
ahead, and that may be your
question, too, or maybe you've passed that

00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:51.440
stage, which is that when you
have a full time demanding job but you really

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.829
want to write and you
feel this desire and need to create something,

00:41:55.829 --> 00:42:00.970
how do you do that?
I mean, how do you make time to do that?

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:04.660
Because, you know, you have to give writing
or any art if you're

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:08.920
serious about it, you have to give it time,
you have to give it energy,

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:15.420
and that's -- that's a real trick.
I mean, it's difficult to find time, to carve

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:21.420
out that time to give to
your writing, so that you can research, you

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.509
can write, you can revise.
You can really make the piece the best it

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:29.920
can be.
And I think, what I tell my students often

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.680
is that we have to start
prioritizing.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:38.339
We have to cut some things out of our lives.
And we have to save that time and put it into

00:42:38.339 --> 00:42:42.119
our writing.
And we have to create a schedule and then

00:42:42.119 --> 00:42:46.619
stick to it, the way we stick
to our work schedules we have to stick to

00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:48.640
our writing schedules as
well.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:53.400
And everyone will have to decide for themselves
how many hours a week,

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.700
for example, can I give to my writing?
But you have to -- once you make that decision

00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.910
 -- you have to stick to
it.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:03.609
And one of the things that I discovered because
it was the same with me

00:43:03.609 --> 00:43:07.589
I was teaching full-time.
I had two children, I was doing community

00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:11.460
work.
There was just a lot on my plate as well.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:16.200
But I decided that well, I can cut out this
and this and this and then

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.780
I have these many hours, and I'm not going
to do anything else with

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.029
them.
I'm going to write.

00:43:21.029 --> 00:43:24.400
So each one, I think, we have to decide what
we can give up.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.680
All right, so now we've done that, we've given
up the time and we have

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.829
a manuscript.
We've shared it with some people who know

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:35.539
about writing, so they've given us good feedback,
we've revised.

00:43:35.539 --> 00:43:40.170
Now what do we do?
Well the way it is in America, is if you are

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:44.069
a fiction writer
particularly, have you to find an agent.

00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:48.279
So that would be my advice to you would be
to research agents.

00:43:48.279 --> 00:43:52.690
And one good way to research is to look at
the people who's writing you

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:57.299
like, and who you think are writing things
similar to what you're

00:43:57.299 --> 00:44:02.349
writing, and see who their agents are.
And their agents will often be mentioned.

00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:06.680
You can probably Google it and find out who
their agents are or in

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.869
their books they sometimes acknowledge their
agents, like I always

00:44:09.869 --> 00:44:14.789
thank my agents in my books.
And then you would go and the agents would

00:44:14.789 --> 00:44:20.690
have websites, they'll have,
you know, they'll give you pointers as to

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.839
how to submit to them and you
should send stuff.

00:44:23.839 --> 00:44:27.710
But without agents, it's very hard now in
America to get your work to

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:32.299
be looked at seriously by good publishers.
So that's what I would say.

00:44:32.299 --> 00:44:34.779
[PAUSE]

00:44:34.779 --> 00:44:39.309
Yes?
Is that a question coming up?

00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:40.309
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:43.190
Chitra Divakaruni: What do my kids think about
my writing?

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:49.490
Well, you know, that is an opinion in progress.
Let me give you a little background on this.

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:52.910
All right.
So I told you that I write books for children.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:56.809
I have four books for children.
I have one called "Victory Song", which is

00:44:56.809 --> 00:45:00.809
a historical novel set during
the Indian Independence Movement.

00:45:00.809 --> 00:45:06.089
Then I have the "Conch Bearer Trilogy", which
has the Conch Bearer,

00:45:06.089 --> 00:45:10.069
that's book one, "The Mirror of Fire and Dreaming";
and then recently,

00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:15.400
"Shadowland, their magical adventures".
Well, when I started writing the "Conch Bearer",

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.720
it was partly in
response to my boys saying, "Mom, you've got

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.580
to write a book that we can
read and enjoy."

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.730
So they were very excited when I was writing
"Conch Bearer".

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:31.289
Oh, I could not write it fast enough for them.
They read it right off of my computer, and

00:45:31.289 --> 00:45:36.069
they were tough critics,
that would be like, "Mom, this is not exciting.

00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:41.190
Change this."
Or "Mom, kids don't think like this.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:45.440
You're making this kid think like you.
You got to change this."

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:50.089
So they were very helpful as critics at that
point.

00:45:50.089 --> 00:45:54.210
And also I gave the two main characters in
the "Conch Bearer" their

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:58.210
names, Anand and Abhay and they thought that
was so cool.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:01.500
They were like in middle school and elementary
school at that time and

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.859
they were like this is so cool.
And I immediately became the favorite parent

00:46:05.859 --> 00:46:12.029
in the household.
But yes, the sequel is when they got to high

00:46:12.029 --> 00:46:16.099
school, it was not as cool
and they were like "Mom, can you not tell

00:46:16.099 --> 00:46:19.079
people that those characters
are named after us?"

00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:23.930
But now that one of them has gone to college,
well, it's kind of

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:26.539
getting back to being cool again to be in
a book.

00:46:26.539 --> 00:46:30.759
So who knows?
This is a story in progress.

00:46:30.759 --> 00:46:35.990
But I think overall, they're kind of excited
by the fact that I do

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:39.630
write.
Now the one who's in college is kind of excited

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:43.019
because some of my
books are taught in college and his literature

00:46:43.019 --> 00:46:47.780
professor knows who I
am, so he's like "yeah, that's not too bad.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.809
That's not too shabby."

00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:53.910
[PAUSE]

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:59.010
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:04.109
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:17.359
Chitra Divakaruni: Thank you so much.
It's been a pleasure talking to you and having

00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:18.299
a conversation.
