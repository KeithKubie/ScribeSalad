should not underestimate its gonna be
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480
should not underestimate its gonna be
the program I mean the activities in the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
the program I mean the activities in the
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.039

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.999
prizes that's what that's what a gun
that's going to give the identity to the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
that's going to give the identity to the
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.289
that's going to give the identity to the
building the building is not going to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299

are going to create the building right
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080
are going to create the building right
so we also have to put in architecture

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
so we also have to put in architecture
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.390
so we also have to put in architecture
at its right point and you know the city

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
at its right point and you know the city
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.600
at its right point and you know the city
is hosting the building and I think they

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
is hosting the building and I think they
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190
is hosting the building and I think they
would have been very sensitive to the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
would have been very sensitive to the
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.710
would have been very sensitive to the
fact that the city's you know a space of

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720

hospitality in which this building
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.819
hospitality in which this building
sitting so the building also gains its

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
sitting so the building also gains its
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.620
sitting so the building also gains its
identity and its shape and its language

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
identity and its shape and its language
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.710
identity and its shape and its language
from the city so we very often talk

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
from the city so we very often talk
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.810
from the city so we very often talk
about the building as if it's somehow

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
about the building as if it's somehow
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.280
about the building as if it's somehow
standing alone on the moon or something

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
standing alone on the moon or something
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.780
standing alone on the moon or something
but that's not the case the building is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
but that's not the case the building is
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.060
but that's not the case the building is
full of all these driving forces the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
full of all these driving forces the
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.920
full of all these driving forces the
activities the great noble sort of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
activities the great noble sort of
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.230
activities the great noble sort of
narrative

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240
narrative
 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.569
narrative
and this is I think how we see it and

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579
and this is I think how we see it and
 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.790
and this is I think how we see it and
what gives me confidence in the project

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
what gives me confidence in the project
 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.440
what gives me confidence in the project
is that this is how David Chipperfield

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450
is that this is how David Chipperfield
 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.600
is that this is how David Chipperfield
see city itself he's not he's very

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610
see city itself he's not he's very
 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.080
see city itself he's not he's very
unselfish in that way
