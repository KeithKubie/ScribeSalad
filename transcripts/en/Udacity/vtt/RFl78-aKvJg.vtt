00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.886
You've just seen a universal algorithm for computing the average of an array of

00:00:03.886 --> 00:00:09.460
objects of any type that is willing to implement the measurable interface.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.362
Let's implement another algorithm along the same lines. This time, we want to

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:19.112
compute the largest element in an array. Again, we have an array of objects,

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:24.092
and you may recall from lesson seven how to do this. You figure out what is the

00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:29.040
largest element that you've seen so far, at the beginning that's the first one.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.752
Then you go through the remainder of the array, if you find a larger one update

00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:38.810
largest so far. And at the end that's what you return. So go ahead and complete

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.843
this method, it'll be the last time ever that you have to write it.
