could could come up with but the
 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.360
could could come up with but the
simplest answer is that to date we have

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370
simplest answer is that to date we have
 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.439
simplest answer is that to date we have

these are huge distances and if in fact

we were able to do that and let me

we were able to do that and let me
 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.350
we were able to do that and let me
emphasize I'm not advocating that we do

that that high-speed rail would take

congested airports and one of the
 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.680

reasons they congested is there's a lot

reasons they congested is there's a lot
 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.870

tremendous benefits from the point of

tremendous benefits from the point of

so that's one obvious example there are
