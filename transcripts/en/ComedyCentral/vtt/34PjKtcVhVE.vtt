on Women's History Month

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:04.737
is<i> Nightly Show</i> contributor
Robin Thede.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.306
-(applause and cheering)
-Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:10.109
-Welcome to the show, Robin.
-Thanks, Larry.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:12.345 line:0%
Now for Women's History Month,
I just wanted to shed light

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.947 line:0%
on a phenomenon that can help
people understand women better.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.450
Oh, that's great.
Uh, what is it?

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:19.685
Black lady sign language.

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:21.487 line:0%
-(whooshing)
-(laughter)

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.890 line:0%
-There it is.
-Wow.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.324 line:0%
Okay, this is kind of cool.

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.193 line:0%
So what is black lady
sign language then?

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.195 line:0%
Well, you might have noticed

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.431 line:0%
-that black ladies use a lot
of hand gestures. -Right.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.066 line:0%
-You know, non-verbal
communication. -Right.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.401 line:0%
Chances are there's a black lady
in your office,

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:38.538 line:0%
-and she's probably named
Rhonda. -Mm-hmm. -(laughter)

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.274 line:0%
And you might misunderstand
her sometimes, right?

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.776 line:0%
Like, you might think Rhonda's
being hostile when she's not,

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.546 line:0%
or you might think she's not
being hostile when she is.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.981 line:0%
-(laughter) -Oh, wow. I can see
how that would be problematic.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:50.983 line:0%
-Right.
-Yes.

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.819 line:0%
So, think of this as my public
service announcement

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.421 line:0%
so you can understand Rhonda
a little bit better.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.757 line:0%
-That's great. Okay, so how does
it work? - Yeah. Okay.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.392 line:0%
-All right, let me give you
a few examples. -All right.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:00.993 line:0%
Number one--
the single hand clap.

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.628 line:0%
-(whooshing)
-All right.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:05.164 line:0%
-Now this can be used to express
happiness or anger. -Mm-hmm.

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.732 line:0%
And learning
to tell the difference

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.234 line:0%
can actually save your life.
All right, watch.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.902 line:0%
-Oh, okay, great, great. Okay.
-All right.

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.472 line:0%
-Oh, it's my song!
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.707 line:0%
-Oh.
-Right? Right?

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.409 line:0%
Wow. Okay.

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:20.079 line:0%
It's very different from,
"Bitch, what'd you say to me?"

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.348 line:0%
(laughter,
applause and cheering)

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.083 line:0%
WILMORE:
Okay.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.919 line:0%
Uh, uh, uh, I know. At first
glance, they can look the same.

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:29.989 line:0%
-But weren't those the same?
-No, no, no.

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:31.357 line:0%
-No, no, not at all, Larry.
-Oh. Okay.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.925 line:0%
Now, here, just watch it
in slow motion.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.193 line:0%
-All right.
-All right.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:36.229 line:0%
(slowly):
My... song.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.531 line:0%
-WILMORE: Okay.
-Versus...

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.867 line:0%
(slowly):
"Bitch...<i> what?!</i>

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.502 line:0%
(laughter)

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.971 line:0%
See, the finger roll is
the subtle difference. Yup.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.973 line:0%
-Oh, my God!
-Yup.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.708 line:0%
I would never know
to look for that thing.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.243 line:0%
-Yes, yes, yes.
-It's the finger thing.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.444 line:0%
That's right.
Now you will.

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:52.712 line:0%
-Now you will.
-Wow. That's fascinating.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.313 line:0%
-Black lady sign language.
-Thank you. All right.

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:56.215 line:0%
All right, well, let's move on
to our next gesture, okay?

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:57.750 line:0%
-Sure. Okay.
-This is the double hand clap

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.986 line:0%
-versus the double hand clap
on syllables. -Mm-hmm.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.954 line:0%
-(whooshing)
-All right. -Okay.

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.323 line:0%
Now, this one's easier to spot,
but it can be deceptive.

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:06.192 line:0%
-Right. Okay. All right.
-So check this out. All right.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:09.162 line:0%
Yay! Great job
on your performance.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.796 line:0%
-Oh. Yeah, that's good. Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.399 line:0%
See, that-that just looks
like regular applause, right?

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:14.800 line:0%
-Well, that's correct,
because it is. -Oh, okay.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:17.136 line:0%
But compare that to the double
hand clap on syllables.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.538 line:0%
WILMORE:
Syllables, okay.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.573 line:0%
-What did you say to me, Larry?
-(laughter)

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:22.742 line:0%
(applause and cheering)

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.744 line:0%
Um...

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.680 line:0%
I didn't... I didn't
say anything. I was just...

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:30.116 line:0%
Don't interrupt me, Larry.

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.018 line:0%
-(applause and cheering)
-All right.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.686 line:0%
-I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding. -Oh. Oh.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.521 line:0%
-I'm just kidding.
-Okay.

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:36.789 line:0%
But now you can see how
effective it is, right?

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.157 line:0%
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Oh, wow. Yeah.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.425 line:0%
-Man, I was... I was scared.
Yeah. -The double... Yeah.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:40.726 line:0%
The double hand clap
on syllables is used

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:41.894 line:0%
to emphasizes a point. Yes.

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.829 line:0%
-Wow. That was so effective,
Robin. -Yeah.

00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:46.032 line:0%
That's, um... It really
emphasizes an angry point.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.767 line:0%
-Right? Uh-huh. -Oh, yeah, well,
not necessarily.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.101 line:0%
-Oh, okay.
-It's tricky because

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:51.070 line:0%
it can be used
for anger or excitement.

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:54.540 line:0%
Such as, "Oh, my God,
these shoes are on sale!"

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:56.042 line:0%
-(laughter, cheering)
-You got it. You got it, yeah.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.910 line:0%
Nice! That's crazy, man.
That's great.

00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:59.812 line:0%
Okay, now, we're only...
we're allowed to do that.

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:02.415 line:0%
-(laughter)
-Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.517 line:0%
It's cool, but, uh,
don't let it happen again.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.485 line:0%
-(laughter)
-All right. -Okay.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:09.889 line:0%
-(applause and cheering)
-Yeah. -Got it. Got it.

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:11.123 line:0%
-Okay.
-Got it.

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.358 line:0%
All right, so,
time for our final

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:13.559 line:0%
-black lady sign language
gesture. -Okay.

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:14.994 line:0%
-Now, this-this is a big one.
-Mm-hmm.

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:17.597 line:0%
The double hand wave versus
the double hand wave pullback.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.265 line:0%
-Mm-hmm. Ooh.
-(whooshing)

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:20.633 line:0%
Wow. That sounds complicated.

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:22.101 line:0%
-It is complicated.
-Okay.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:23.836 line:0%
-But you've been doing well
so far. -Okay.

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.171 line:0%
So, all right, let's start
with the double hand wave.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.372 line:0%
-Okay, double hand wave.
-All right, all right.

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:27.873 line:0%
-So, see, I'm just waving
both hands. -Oh.

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:29.242 line:0%
Just double hand wave. Hi!
It's cute, right?

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.277 line:0%
-Oh. Oh, yeah, I like that.
That's good. -Say hi!

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.712 line:0%
-Yeah. Hey! Hey!
-Right? Right? Right? Right?

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.647 line:0%
-Great.
-Yeah, that's nice.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.315 line:0%
-But if I do the double
hand wave pullback... -Okay.

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:37.850 line:0%
Who said<i> what</i> to me?

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.785 line:0%
(applause and cheering)

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:41.754 line:0%
(Wilmore clears his throat)

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:47.660 line:0%
See-see this is a woman
who's at her wit's end.

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:49.595 line:0%
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-She's not in a space to reason.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:51.797 line:0%
-You should probably leave
the room. -Wow. -(laughter)

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.033 line:0%
I think I saw that on WorldStar
once, that double thing.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.468 line:0%
-Yes. -Yeah.
-(laughter)

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.336 line:0%
-Absolutely. Very good. -It was
very... It was a scary moment.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.505 line:0%
-Yeah. Okay. -It... Yes, no,
it can be quite a thing.

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:01.507 line:0%
All right, well, so, let's
wrap this up by showing you

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.908 line:0%
-all three in action, all right?
-Oh, great.

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:04.343 line:0%
This is what I like to call

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:06.279 line:0%
-the black lady sign language
combo platter. -(whooshing)

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:10.416 line:0%
All right, to better understand
the wonderful black ladies

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.885 line:0%
in your life,
you have to pay attention

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:15.254 line:0%
and say good-bye to all
your preconceived notions.

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:17.823 line:0%
And if you ever get confused,
just rewatch this segment.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:20.092 line:0%
-(applause and cheering)
-Do you hear me, Larry?

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.460 line:0%
-Yes, yes.
-Okay.

00:04:21.493 --> 00:04:24.959 line:0%
I hear you. Robin Thede,
everybody. We'll right back.
