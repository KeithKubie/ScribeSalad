00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
You are having a coffee with a close friend and bring up how you need a new bathing suit

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.559
Then BAM all of a sudden there are ads on your phone for bathing suits.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.120
Our smartphones are with us at all times, but are companies and governments using them to spy on us?

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.520
You may be suspicious for a good reason.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.880
A New York Times piece uncovered that thousands of apps, including gaming apps for kids are equipped with the software Alfonso.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.440
Alfonso uses your smartphone microphone to listen to the ads that you are watching on TV.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.860
It uses audio signals to collect TV viewing data in order for advertisers to personally promote things to you online.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.440
Alfonso "claims" to not record human speech.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.520
Facebook has created a device called Pixel, which is designed as a way to continue tracking you online even after you've left a website.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.620
By dropping a small piece of data called a cookie, your device will now remember information,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.840
like how long you linger on a certain item,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.720
and whether you added anything to your shopping cart, but didn't purchase it.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.480
Millions of websites use Facebook Pixel, which is why the hat you didn't end up buying follows you around Facebook forever

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.240
But sites like Facebook even follow you offline and have been known to purchase information and create a database of over

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.940
52,000 different attributes about you, for example, Facebook buys data from supermarket loyalty programs.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.880
So if you have a points card with a grocery store Facebook may be paying to understand your purchasing patterns

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.960
Potentially learning about what you eat or even what type of toothpaste you use.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.920
So, your phone can listen to you, but it can also follow you as well.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.520
Every time you receive a text or use data to load an app,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.920
companies can log and retain your location based on the cell tower and cellular antenna you connect it to.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.960
The precision of location has increased over time and get paint a detailed picture of where you go.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.580
So, your phone may start sending you ads for swimsuits because you were just physically in or near a surf shop.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:04.200
These companies will claim they aren't doing anything you haven't agreed to as you have accepted the privacy policy that allows the collection of your information.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.120
And did you read the fine print?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.480
Probably not.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.600
A study presented 543 participants with a fake app called Name Drop to see how many would read the privacy policy and terms of service.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.240
74% skipped reading the agreement all together, and those who did read it didn't do a great job.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:32.640
98% percent of participants missed the gotcha clauses, which included sharing all your data with the NSA, your employer, and agreeing to provide your firstborn child as payment

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.740
And what about the rise of smart speakers like Google Home and Amazon Alexa?

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.460
Which are designed to listen to you at all times.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.960
Though, they are supposed to only record your voice when giving prompts like "Ok, Google"

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.480
Recently a couple found that Amazon's Alexa recorded a private conversation and then randomly sent it to a friend

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.680
These are deemed unfortunate glitches.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.840
But what if someone gained access to them as Wi-Fi networks and mobile internet devices are easier to hack than you might think?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.200
Your typical wireless internet information is kept confidential

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.200
by being converted from a readable state to nonsense at the access point and then converted back to a readable state when you use the

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.488
correct Wi-Fi password from your computer.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.690
When Internet moved from physically wired networks to wireless technology it became easier to hack and less secure because the encryption

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.620
schemes are relatively simple

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.340
For example,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:33.000
Your webcam can be hacked by creating a remote access tool which is the digital equivalent of someone adding an unlocked window to your home without you even noticing.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.780
Also, the FBI Agent meme isn't far from the truth, as the FBI is known to use phishing, which is slipping a link into a message

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.160
that is labeled in a misleading way... when you hit the link your device connects to the FBI's computer

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.640
downloading malware, which is then able to covertly spy on you.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.960
Long story short, your phone is capable of listening to you, following you, and even watching you.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.360
If online security and privacy is important to you, make sure you check out today's sponsor of our video Nord VPN, who is offering you

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.359

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.220
NordVPN even passes the Great Firewall of China and works in the Middle East where not all VPNs work

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.860
With 4300 servers and counting, in 62 countries,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.020
They're constantly growing and expanding, which separates them from other providers on top of all this you can use it on six devices simultaneously

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.980

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.620
like your phone, your computer, your tablet, so that you're protecting your information at all times, including if you're on public Wi-Fi.

Peace.
