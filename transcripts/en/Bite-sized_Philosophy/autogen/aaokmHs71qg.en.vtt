the people who created it had the idea
 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.720
the people who created it had the idea
about what it should be before they made

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
about what it should be before they made
 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.450
about what it should be before they made

story you can never fully say what it's
about you can just talk about it forever

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
about you can just talk about it forever
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.429
about you can just talk about it forever
and ever and ever and ever so it's it's

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.830
and ever and ever and ever so it's it's
a wellspring of meaning so oh sure they

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
a wellspring of meaning so oh sure they
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.970
a wellspring of meaning so oh sure they
are of course that's what they're doing

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
are of course that's what they're doing
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.780
are of course that's what they're doing
oh yeah it's calculated marketing yeah

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790
oh yeah it's calculated marketing yeah
 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.200
oh yeah it's calculated marketing yeah
yeah sure

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
yeah sure
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.470
yeah sure
it was hyper politically correct yeah

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
it was hyper politically correct yeah
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.209
it was hyper politically correct yeah
yeah yeah and they didn't need men and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
yeah yeah and they didn't need men and
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.380
yeah yeah and they didn't need men and
you know God give me a break you know

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390
you know God give me a break you know
 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.520
you know God give me a break you know
just because you need men doesn't mean

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
just because you need men doesn't mean
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.110
just because you need men doesn't mean
you have to like them yeah so so I mean

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
you have to like them yeah so so I mean
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.340
you have to like them yeah so so I mean
I've thought a lot about the difference

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
I've thought a lot about the difference
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.850
I've thought a lot about the difference
between propaganda and art so art is

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
between propaganda and art so art is
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.680
between propaganda and art so art is
actually a process rather than an end

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
actually a process rather than an end
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.860
actually a process rather than an end
product and with any luck if you have a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
product and with any luck if you have a
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260
product and with any luck if you have a
piece of art the process is embedded in

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
piece of art the process is embedded in
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509
piece of art the process is embedded in
the byproduct and so it reflects the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
the byproduct and so it reflects the
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.770
the byproduct and so it reflects the
process when you bring it into your

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
process when you bring it into your
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.250
process when you bring it into your
house and so it's an active it's a it's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
house and so it's an active it's a it's
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.560
house and so it's an active it's a it's
a crystallized act of exploration and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
a crystallized act of exploration and
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.870
a crystallized act of exploration and
the real artist doesn't know what

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
the real artist doesn't know what
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910
the real artist doesn't know what
they're doing they don't know what

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
they're doing they don't know what
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100
they're doing they don't know what
they're doing they're exploring I can I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
they're doing they're exploring I can I
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.780
they're doing they're exploring I can I
can recommend a film there's a film made

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
can recommend a film there's a film made
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.960
can recommend a film there's a film made
of Picasso it in about 1957 and it was a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
of Picasso it in about 1957 and it was a
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.190
of Picasso it in about 1957 and it was a
black-and-white film and it was actually

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
black-and-white film and it was actually
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.770
black-and-white film and it was actually
a film of him making a painting and he

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
a film of him making a painting and he
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.330
a film of him making a painting and he
painted it on glass so you could see

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
painted it on glass so you could see
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.530
painted it on glass so you could see
what he was doing it's really quite

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
what he was doing it's really quite
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.719
what he was doing it's really quite
fascinating because you can see that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
fascinating because you can see that
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850
fascinating because you can see that
he's playing he sketches it in and then

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
he's playing he sketches it in and then
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.649
he's playing he sketches it in and then
he rubs it out so he sketches it in

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
he rubs it out so he sketches it in
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.060
he rubs it out so he sketches it in
again and he rubs it out and he sketches

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
again and he rubs it out and he sketches
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.859
again and he rubs it out and he sketches
over here and it's like there's a real

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
over here and it's like there's a real
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.990
over here and it's like there's a real
dynamism about it he doesn't plan it out

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
dynamism about it he doesn't plan it out
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.429
dynamism about it he doesn't plan it out
to begin with not that there's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
to begin with not that there's
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.109
to begin with not that there's
necessarily anything wrong with that as

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
necessarily anything wrong with that as
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510
necessarily anything wrong with that as
an artistic endeavor - but Picasso was

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
an artistic endeavor - but Picasso was
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.539
an artistic endeavor - but Picasso was
trying to explore and understand and you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
trying to explore and understand and you
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.830
trying to explore and understand and you
know I don't know what you know about

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
know I don't know what you know about
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.920
know I don't know what you know about
cubism but cubism it's a strange thing

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
cubism but cubism it's a strange thing
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.440
cubism but cubism it's a strange thing
but what he was doing with his cubism

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450
but what he was doing with his cubism
 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.139
but what he was doing with his cubism
was to try to show you that you only see

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
was to try to show you that you only see
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.600
was to try to show you that you only see
things from one perspective but the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
things from one perspective but the
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.209
things from one perspective but the
things exist in multiple perspectives so

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
things exist in multiple perspectives so
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.850
things exist in multiple perspectives so
you know a cubist painting is your face

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
you know a cubist painting is your face
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.680
you know a cubist painting is your face
this way and your face this way at the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
this way and your face this way at the
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.199
this way and your face this way at the
same time and so you could say well is

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
same time and so you could say well is
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.460
same time and so you could say well is
that a more accurate way

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
that a more accurate way
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.440
that a more accurate way
of representing a person that just the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
of representing a person that just the
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.660
of representing a person that just the
standard portrait and Picasso would say

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670
standard portrait and Picasso would say
 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.000
standard portrait and Picasso would say
well in some ways definitely because it

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010
well in some ways definitely because it
 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.980
well in some ways definitely because it
captures the transformative element

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990
captures the transformative element
 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.920
captures the transformative element
rather than the static element and so

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
rather than the static element and so
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.140
rather than the static element and so
someone who's a true artist doesn't have

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150
someone who's a true artist doesn't have
 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.570
someone who's a true artist doesn't have
a political message it's funny because

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580
a political message it's funny because
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.130
a political message it's funny because
my house is full of ideological

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
my house is full of ideological
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.410
my house is full of ideological
propaganda from the Soviet Union it's

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
propaganda from the Soviet Union it's
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.660
propaganda from the Soviet Union it's
just packed full of it and it's so

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670
just packed full of it and it's so
 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.820
just packed full of it and it's so
interesting to watch these artifacts

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830
interesting to watch these artifacts
 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.500
interesting to watch these artifacts
because a lot of them were their

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
because a lot of them were their
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.150
because a lot of them were their
Socialist Realist although mostly they

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
Socialist Realist although mostly they
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.920
Socialist Realist although mostly they
were Impressionists really it's so

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
were Impressionists really it's so
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.600
were Impressionists really it's so
interesting to watch them because in

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610
interesting to watch them because in
 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.060
interesting to watch them because in
that painting themselves there's a war

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070
that painting themselves there's a war
 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.150
that painting themselves there's a war
that you can perceive and the war is a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160
that you can perceive and the war is a
 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.620
that you can perceive and the war is a
lot of the people who made these

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630
lot of the people who made these
 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.380
lot of the people who made these
paintings were incredibly talented

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390
paintings were incredibly talented
 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.460
paintings were incredibly talented
really really skilled because the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470
really really skilled because the
 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.170
really really skilled because the
Russians kept their their formal

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180
Russians kept their their formal
 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.600
Russians kept their their formal
academies open so the Russians can

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610
academies open so the Russians can
 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.070
academies open so the Russians can
really paint Impressionism it's

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
really paint Impressionism it's
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.500
really paint Impressionism it's
remarkable but their talents were

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510
remarkable but their talents were
 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.990
remarkable but their talents were
encapsulated within this but mostly

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000
encapsulated within this but mostly
 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.120
encapsulated within this but mostly
Stellan this ideology and so in each

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130
Stellan this ideology and so in each
 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.100
Stellan this ideology and so in each
canvas there's this war between the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110
canvas there's this war between the
 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.230
canvas there's this war between the
ideological message and the artistic

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240
ideological message and the artistic
 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.120
ideological message and the artistic
message and what's so cool is the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130
message and what's so cool is the
 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.800
message and what's so cool is the
farther we get away from the Soviet

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810
farther we get away from the Soviet
 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.680
farther we get away from the Soviet
Union the more the art wins because in

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
Union the more the art wins because in
 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.690
Union the more the art wins because in
300 years there isn't gonna be a shred

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
300 years there isn't gonna be a shred
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.120
300 years there isn't gonna be a shred
left of that ideology and all that will

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130
left of that ideology and all that will
 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.610
left of that ideology and all that will
be left to the pendings is the art so

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620
be left to the pendings is the art so
 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.750
be left to the pendings is the art so
part of the reason that people are so

arts winning as far as I can tell so
 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.409
arts winning as far as I can tell so
that's very interesting because they

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419
that's very interesting because they
 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.969
that's very interesting because they
were pure propaganda many of them when I

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979

bought them but it's getting farther and
 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.379
bought them but it's getting farther and
farther away from the Soviet Union so

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389
farther away from the Soviet Union so
 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.140
farther away from the Soviet Union so
