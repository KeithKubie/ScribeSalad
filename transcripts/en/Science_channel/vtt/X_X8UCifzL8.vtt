00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.809
Narrator: THE CREW ON BOARD
THE VIRGINIA CLASS

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.846
WILL EXPERIENCE SEEMINGLY
NORMAL LIVING CONDITIONS,

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.615
BUT THEY'LL BE UP TO 800 FEET
BELOW THE OCEAN,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.551
SO SAFETY IS A TOP PRIORITY.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:22.322
EVERY POSSIBILITY
MUST BE PREPARED FOR.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.857
Nabors: IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT
OF A SUBMARINE SINKING,

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:28.528 line:0%
WE DEFINITELY HAVE
THE CAPABILITY TO ESCAPE.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:32.765
Narrator:
IN CASE A SUB'S INTERNAL
ATMOSPHERE IS EVER COMPROMISED,

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.634
CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER
ERIC NABORS

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:37.904
TRAINS THE CREW TO PERFORM
A PRESSURIZED ESCAPE,

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.739
USING AN INGENIOUS PIECE
OF EQUIPMENT

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.242
CALLED A SEIE SUIT.

00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:47.013
Nabors: IT'S DESIGNED TO PROVIDE
THE OCCUPANT FRESH BREATHING AIR

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:49.782
THROUGH THE COMPRESSION
AND ASCENT PHASES.

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:53.853
IT PROVIDES 75 POUNDS OF
POSITIVE BUOYANCY IN THE WATER.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.588
IT TRAVELS
AT 625 FEET PER MINUTE

00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:59.726
THROUGH THE WATER COLUMN.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.061 align:start position:0%
TOPSIDE, REQUEST PERMISSION
TO FILL AND EQUALIZE.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.897
Man: YOU HAVE PERMISSION
TO FILL AND EQUALIZE.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.966
Narrator: AS THE REGULATED
LIFTING FORCE OF THE SUIT

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.002
PROPELS THE STUDENTS
SAFELY THROUGH

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.870
THE 37-FOOT ESCAPE TRAINER,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.473
THEY MUST FOLLOW
ONE GOLDEN RULE.

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:17.009
THE NUMBER-ONE RULE
OF SUBMARINE ESCAPE IS NEVER,

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.578
EVER HOLD YOUR BREATH.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.852
BECAUSE THE ESCAPEE IS BREATHING
COMPRESSED GAS AT DEPTH,

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:28.187
WHEN THEY TRAVEL THROUGH
THE WATER COLUMN,

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.822
THE PRESSURE
AROUND THEM DECREASES.

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:34.794
WE ARE CONCERNED WITH PULMONARY
OVER-INFLATION SYNDROME.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.630
Narrator: THIS POTENTIALLY FATAL
CONDITION CAN CAUSE THE RUPTURE

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.100
OF AIR SACS
IN A CREW MEMBER'S LUNGS.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.437
Nabors: IF A STUDENT
WERE TO HOLD THEIR BREATH,

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:47.140
THAT WOULD OCCUR, SO WE TEACH
THEM TO BREATHE NORMALLY

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.776
OR EXHALE THE ENTIRE WAY
TO THE SURFACE.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:06.993 align:start size:50% position:50%
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.995
I'M OKAY.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.766
Narrator: IN OPEN WATER,
THE SEIE SUIT CAN WITHSTAND

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:17.270
UP TO 250 POUNDS OF PRESSURE
PER SQUARE INCH.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:24.944
THESE SUITS HAVE BEEN TESTED

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.513
TO DEPTHS UP TO 600 FEET
OF SEAWATER.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:31.050
THE SEIE SUIT ITSELF IS AN
INCREDIBLE PIECE OF ENGINEERING.
