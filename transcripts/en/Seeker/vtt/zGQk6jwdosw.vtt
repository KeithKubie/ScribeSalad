00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.410
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Canon PIXMA Pro professional inkjet printers:

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.000
Exactly as you envisioned.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.120
Don't you hate it when you see something beautiful,
and you pull out your camera, and you just

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.980
CAN'T MAKE IT LOOK THE SAME.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.980
What is wrong here?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:24.450
Is it me or the camera?!

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.449
When you think of a robotic version of a human
eye, or even a prosthetic eyeball, you probably

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.150
picture some kind of camera.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.150
It makes sense, they both capture images and
video, but aside from general comparisons,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.060
they're really not the same at all!

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.890
When you're looking out through your eyeball,
it's doing the same things as a camera, adjusting

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.690
the lens, focusing and trying to make the
image look as good as possible…

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.980
In fact, generally speaking, both the eye
and a camera have a lot in common!

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.580
Both have adjustable apertures to let in the
right amount of light, both have a lens, and

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.850
both have a way to absorb the light.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.870
But from there, comparisons get a little fuzzy.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.870
// Eye pun!

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.780
The reason your photos don't look the same
way your eye sees them is because of the way

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.030
the two different mechanisms function.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.790
The eye is 28 grams of vitreous fluid, muscles,
cells and nerves.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.380
Cameras can be formatted and customized to
do thousands of different types of shoots.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.030
When focusing, the lens of the eye uses the
ciliary muscle to change its shape, a lens

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.350
needs to be physically moved…

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.690
When it's bright or dim, the pupil uses the
sphincter pupillae to adjust the amount of

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.730
light being let into the eyeball -- a camera
uses an aperture to adjust the amount of light…

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.730
it's… sphincter-like…

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.380
According to research conducted in Canada
in the late 50s, the f-stop of the human eye

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.390
might be around f/3.2 to f/3.5…

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.860
It was cited a lot, but I couldn't find the
study to double check.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.080
Regardless, cameras have a far wider range
of f-stops and ISO sensitivity to pick up

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.200
dim light.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.780
When a full-frame camera absorbs light, it
does so with a 35 millimeter sensor, compared

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.260
to the eyeball -- which has a retina at the
back.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.700
That wall of cells is CURVED, but is almost
the same exact size as the camera -- about

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.140
32 mm!

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.580
The difference is, the retina isn't very clear.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.340
We can only see 20/20 at the macula, or fovea.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.670
A spot on the retina that is ALL cone cells.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.570
Outside of the fovea are a mix of rods and
cones, followed by just cones at the edge.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.910
This is why you can't read something you're
not looking directly at, and why peripheral

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.230
vision is mainly just for movement.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.800
Additionally, your eye only sees color where
there are lots of cones, so closer to the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.920
fovea the more color.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.550
A camera, by contrast, can pick up detail
across the whole of the sensor, all in color!

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.280
However, even though the camera can see a
wider field, the amount of information is

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.900
relatively low.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.319
Most high-end cameras process around 24 megapixels,
but the human eye can get 52 megapixels on

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.319
average and HUNDREDS of megapixels if you
take into account the whole field of vision!

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.890
It get's pretty ridiculous.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.050
What YOU SEE isn't just one image, it's dozens
or more!

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.739
You don't worry about overexposing, shutter
speed, or aperture because your brain does

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.910
that for you and filters out any errors in
color or depth.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.110
In the end, the reason your photos don't look
like what you see, is because what you see

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.790
isn't really… real.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.760
It's what your brain created while sucking
in all that visual information and compiling

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.640
it into a three dimensional, multi-million-pixel
world.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.180
Cameras do just one thing.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.860
They can't adjust nearly as fast as your eye,
or compile that information into a fluid image

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.860
as easily.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.910
But a good photographer, on a mountain at
sunset sure can try!

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.391
Of course, no one knows all this stuff better
than Canon - and with their PIXMA Pro Professional

00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:45.810

All backed by Canon's commitment to provide
professionals with fast, high quality service

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:01.569
