MARGARITA ROSARIO:
Everyone needs

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.380
a space where they can
feel loved, and protected,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.200
and where they can
actually purify themselves

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.980
of ideas about
their work and ideas

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.840
about the stressors that may
be overwhelming their life.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.910
When I come into
this space, it is

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.170
because I want to feel
safe, and loved, and secure.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.330
Prayer is supposed to be a
time where you completely

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.810
stop your day, and you are
willing to purify yourself,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.550
and meditate, and
cleanse yourself

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.640
of any thoughts that may
be hindering your ability

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.810
to be kind, to be patient,
which, when I'm busy,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.870
I may not want to do
right away because I feel

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.370
inclined to finish my work.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.390
Once I come in, I feel
completely at peace

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.830
and completely rested.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.290
And it's completely worthwhile.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.350
This room is positioned
on the third floor.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.590
And so you can really
see a lot of campus

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.140
just by looking out the window.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.140
But what I especially love
about looking out the window

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.740
is the architecture of
the building itself.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.630
And so sometimes, I
sit at the window,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.840
and just think about those small
little things that we usually

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.760
take for granted about
the world that we

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.250
live in, such as the
fact that we live

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.480
in a three-dimensional world,
where there is space, distance,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.680
where there are gaps,
where there are curves.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.330
And we can see all
of those things.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.570
And being able to
look at architecture

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.710
and see that, and experience
that, and be thankful for that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.870
is part of the reason why I
come here to meditate and pray.
