00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
Deep underneath Transylvania is a huge subterranean cavern

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.699
where something very strange is happening.

00:00:06.699 --> 00:00:10.200
Strange and totally amazing!

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:18.566
It’s hard to understate the historical value of salt.

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.633
Wars were fought over it, people founded entire cities around it.

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.666
At one point it was worth its weight in gold!

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:27.833
But today it’s common place and this leaves salt mines in a weird place.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:32.466
You’re left with this huge cavernous space that you’re not sure what to do with.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.833
Well, in Transylvania, Romania,

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:38.200
they decided to do something incredible with their salt mine.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.366
It looks like this.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.933
Welcome to Salina Turda.

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.466
Tourists enter the mine

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.833
through a centuries old vertical shaft.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:55.800
And as they descend,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.200
it’s like they’re going into some sort of

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.166
futuristic, subterranean world that had to be built after a great apocalypse,

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.133
restarting humanity underground.

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:10.300
It has this kind of Blade Runner, Mole People thing going on.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.666
And what do you find in this futuristic landscape?

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:18.699
Well at about 140 feet below the surface you'll find mini-golf,

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:19.666
ping pong

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.300
basketball hoops, bowling,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.566
there’s a hundred person amphitheater in there.

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:27.066
You enter this vast enormous space and at the bottom of it

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.833
there’s a salt lake with an island of salt piled up in the middle

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:34.500
where you can go and rent a rowboat and row out to that little island.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.966
And then next to that there’s a giant Ferris wheel that’s lit up and spinning.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:43.466
And it’s all happening deep underground in Transylvania!

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.866
What they’ve done is taken this mine

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.466
and turned it into a museum of the history of mining.

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:51.533
But really it’s a sort of general purpose theme park with

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.166
all kinds of amusements in it.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:53.866
We should go.

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.266
Why are we not going?
