00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.830
In our previous lesson,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.250
we got an overview of the iterative QMV process of analysis.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.380
And how it can be described as a way to go about solving data modeling problems.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.940
In this lesson, we dive deep into a specific problem.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.630
We devote the entire lesson to understanding an individual's Twitter usage

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.750
pattern and how it is influenced by the relationships as well as other factors.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.260
This lesson is all about the impact of data and how the quality and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.730
quantity of data can impact the models we build.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.380
We try to gain a sense of how much data is enough to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.890
say something with any accuracy.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.640
Once we've got data we can use, we think about how to determine what to

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.910
pay attention to within data, otherwise known as the feature selection problem.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.620
Lastly, once we know what to pay attention to,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.100
we learn how to detect certain kinds of structure that may exist in our data,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.870
and what types of models are motivated by them.
