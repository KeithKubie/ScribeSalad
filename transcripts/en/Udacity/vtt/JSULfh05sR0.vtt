00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's see t' is always going to be the time of the observer who were considering

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to be stationary for the time but will the either observe can call themselves stationary.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But will it can--this observer's point of view.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So t'=gamma&lt;i&gt;t. Well, again, y is just 1/√1-β which is 0.6²--this is 1-0.36.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If you carry this out, you get a gamma of 1.25 while t' is just gamma&lt;i&gt;t, t is 8 seconds--&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
then 1.25&lt;i&gt;8 is equal to 10 seconds.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you got that, very good work.
