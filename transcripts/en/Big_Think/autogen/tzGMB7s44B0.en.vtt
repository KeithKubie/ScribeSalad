36% of the population women make up

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
36% of the population women make up
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.370
36% of the population women make up
nearly half of the workforce and I think

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
nearly half of the workforce and I think
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.680
nearly half of the workforce and I think
make up something like 70% of buying

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

increasingly a bigger part of the
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.560
increasingly a bigger part of the
workforce as well and so there are so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
workforce as well and so there are so
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.970
workforce as well and so there are so
many demographic changes that are

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
many demographic changes that are
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.860
many demographic changes that are
impacting our workforce I don't know if

managers are always certain about how to
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850
managers are always certain about how to
work with this new workforce how to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
work with this new workforce how to
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.950
work with this new workforce how to
better engage and motivate these new

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

workers that are entering to the
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.830
workers that are entering to the
workforce in addition to that there's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
workforce in addition to that there's
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.520
workforce in addition to that there's
there's a cost of not flexing so for

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
there's a cost of not flexing so for
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.189
there's a cost of not flexing so for
example I think the Gallup study last

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
example I think the Gallup study last
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.869
example I think the Gallup study last
year said something about four hundred

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
year said something about four hundred
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:03.979
year said something about four hundred
fifty to fifty five hundred fifty

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
fifty to fifty five hundred fifty
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.780

billion dollars of loss due to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
billion dollars of loss due to
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.730
billion dollars of loss due to
disengaged employees so you might have

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
disengaged employees so you might have
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.870
disengaged employees so you might have
employees that you've hired into the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
employees that you've hired into the
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.030
employees that you've hired into the
organization that maybe have one foot

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
organization that maybe have one foot
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.800
organization that maybe have one foot
out the door that really don't feel

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
out the door that really don't feel
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.600
out the door that really don't feel
motivated and engaged and don't feel

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
motivated and engaged and don't feel
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.010
motivated and engaged and don't feel
like the organization is really speaking

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
like the organization is really speaking
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990
like the organization is really speaking
to them so for this and many reasons I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
to them so for this and many reasons I
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580
to them so for this and many reasons I
think there's such a business case and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
think there's such a business case and
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.840
think there's such a business case and
an opportunity for an organization to to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
an opportunity for an organization to to
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.219
an opportunity for an organization to to
create a value proposition for their

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
create a value proposition for their
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.649
create a value proposition for their
employees if they can get this right the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
employees if they can get this right the
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.420
employees if they can get this right the
power gap is a pretty critical element

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
power gap is a pretty critical element
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580
power gap is a pretty critical element
in the I art of flexing the power gap is

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
in the I art of flexing the power gap is
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.170
in the I art of flexing the power gap is
the amount of social distance that

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
the amount of social distance that
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.670
the amount of social distance that
exists between yourself and people who

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
exists between yourself and people who
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.440
exists between yourself and people who
are in positions of authority and if

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
are in positions of authority and if
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.179
are in positions of authority and if
you're the manager people things that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
you're the manager people things that
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.590
you're the manager people things that
exist between yourself and your team

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
exist between yourself and your team
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.179
exist between yourself and your team
members and so you can have a small

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
members and so you can have a small
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.609
members and so you can have a small
power gap or a large power gap if you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
power gap or a large power gap if you
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.950
power gap or a large power gap if you
have a small power gap it's more of an

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
have a small power gap it's more of an
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.469
have a small power gap it's more of an
egalitarian relationship where even as a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
egalitarian relationship where even as a
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.090
egalitarian relationship where even as a
manager you you see yourself as more of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
manager you you see yourself as more of
 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.539
manager you you see yourself as more of
a coach or a guide and you have a very

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
a coach or a guide and you have a very
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.069
a coach or a guide and you have a very
informal relationship with your

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
informal relationship with your
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.690
informal relationship with your
colleagues if you have a high power gap

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
colleagues if you have a high power gap
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.149
colleagues if you have a high power gap
and you're the employee you see your

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
and you're the employee you see your
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.530
and you're the employee you see your
leader as maybe more of an authority

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
leader as maybe more of an authority
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.510
leader as maybe more of an authority
figure and there's a huge gap between

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
figure and there's a huge gap between
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520
figure and there's a huge gap between
yourself and that corner office and so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
yourself and that corner office and so
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.100
yourself and that corner office and so
the way that we see the power gap play

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
the way that we see the power gap play
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.660
the way that we see the power gap play
out in the workplace is pretty important

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
out in the workplace is pretty important
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.400
out in the workplace is pretty important
and we think as we think about the art

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410
and we think as we think about the art
 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.550
and we think as we think about the art
of flexing understanding the dynamics

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560
of flexing understanding the dynamics
 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.020
of flexing understanding the dynamics
the power gap particularly as it relates

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030
the power gap particularly as it relates
 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.809
the power gap particularly as it relates
to generational and cultural differences

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819
to generational and cultural differences
 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.589
to generational and cultural differences
can play a big part in your

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599
can play a big part in your
 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.809
can play a big part in your
effectiveness so as you work across

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819
effectiveness so as you work across
 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.670
effectiveness so as you work across
these differences your goal then is to

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
these differences your goal then is to
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.650
these differences your goal then is to
be a fluent leader and a fluent leader

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
be a fluent leader and a fluent leader
 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.720
be a fluent leader and a fluent leader
is someone who can effectively manage

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730
is someone who can effectively manage
 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.300
is someone who can effectively manage
those differences in the workplace to

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
those differences in the workplace to
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.979
those differences in the workplace to
get the best business results one of the

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989
get the best business results one of the
 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.140
get the best business results one of the
traits of the fluent leader we found and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150
traits of the fluent leader we found and
 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.339
traits of the fluent leader we found and
there's many traits but one of the

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349
there's many traits but one of the
 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.740
there's many traits but one of the
things that we want to focus on today is

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750
things that we want to focus on today is
 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.449
things that we want to focus on today is
innovation and ability to really see

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459
innovation and ability to really see
 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.940
innovation and ability to really see
outside the box and bring out the voices

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950
outside the box and bring out the voices
 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.830
outside the box and bring out the voices
of people who are on your teams who have

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840
of people who are on your teams who have
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.750
of people who are on your teams who have
different perspectives and so I think of

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
different perspectives and so I think of
 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.970
different perspectives and so I think of
one example in Douglas Conant who was a

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980
one example in Douglas Conant who was a
 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.670
one example in Douglas Conant who was a
former CEO of Campbell's Soup Company he

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680
former CEO of Campbell's Soup Company he
 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.100
former CEO of Campbell's Soup Company he
spent some time as a CEO really looking

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
spent some time as a CEO really looking
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.170
spent some time as a CEO really looking
at how do we increase customer

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180
at how do we increase customer
 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.960
at how do we increase customer
engagement he was hired at a time where

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970
engagement he was hired at a time where
 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.940
engagement he was hired at a time where
some of those numbers were slipping and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950
some of those numbers were slipping and
 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.770
some of those numbers were slipping and
he really want to look at what were some

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780
he really want to look at what were some
 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.150
he really want to look at what were some
of the voices that we really can connect

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160
of the voices that we really can connect
 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.100
of the voices that we really can connect
to that haven't been heard to before and

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110
to that haven't been heard to before and
 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.809
to that haven't been heard to before and
so he they spent a few years really

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819
so he they spent a few years really
 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.009
so he they spent a few years really
looking at the voice of the women

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019
looking at the voice of the women
 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.949
