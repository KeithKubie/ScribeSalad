00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.548
 We will look into this video 

00:00:01.548 --> 00:00:06.298
 endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells. 

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:10.688
 The endometrial system. 

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:13.938
 At a very general level, the endometrial system includes 

00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:17.770
 all the membranes that interact 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.976
 in the cage. 

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.950
 Which membranes are involved? 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.505
 I can start with myself 

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:25.223
 cell membrane. 

00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:26.593
 All these membranes 

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.148
 have a double layer of phospholipids. 

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:30.494
 Sometimes the brain gives me a shortcut 

00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:32.073
 and I call them bipillar strata, 

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.952
 but it is a double lipid layer. 

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.645
 If we focus here 

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:40.385
 and we increase that part, 

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:45.122
 we will see that this line is actually a double lipid layer. 

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:46.980
 It will look like this. 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.849
 We have 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.039
 hydrophilic heads pointing outwards 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.080
 and hydrophobic tails that point inward. 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.030
 The hydrophilic heads point outward, 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.282
 hydrophobic tails point inward 

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:02.351
 and so the layer continues. 

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.600
 If we think about it from left to right 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.595
 we have a double layer 

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.775
 of phospholipids. 

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:12.706
 This will be true for the cell membrane, 

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:13.857
 will be true 

00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:16.947
 for the outer nuclear membrane here. 

00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:20.972
 We've painted this membrane in the video about the endoplasmic network. 

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:23.271
 Here you see these two membranes. 

00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.732
 You can say, "Okay, is this double layer?" 

00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:27.869
 No, these are actually two double layers. 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.398
 This membrane here has a dual phospholipid layer 

00:01:31.398 --> 00:01:35.792
 and this membrane here 

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.732
 also has a dual phospholipid layer. 

00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:41.260
 I will use another color. 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.375
 What I begin to outline in the manager is 

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.835
 outer membrane from the nuclear shell. 

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:52.040
 It is connected to the membrane 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.733
 of the endoplasmic network. 

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:57.241
 I begin to outline it too. 

00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:59.107
 What I outline 

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:01.487
 in purple 

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:05.577
 is the inner membrane of the nuclear shell. 

00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:09.083
 All of this is part of the endometrial system. 

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:10.638
 I have already started to talk about 

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:12.170
 the endoplasmic network. 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.330
 We have explained some details about it in the video 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.903
 for the endoplasmic grid and for the Golgi apparatus, 

00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:21.505
 but it is also part of the endometrial system. 

00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:24.965
 One-plane network can represent 

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.440
 50% or more of 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.231
 phospholipid membranes in the cell. 

00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:35.181
 We have already talked about what 

00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:37.689
 occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.916
 This zone here - 

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:43.678
 We talked about what's going on there. 

00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:45.792
 Synthesize proteins. 

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:48.137
 In fact, they can be synthesized there 

00:02:48.137 --> 00:02:49.732
 and other molecules such as lipids. 

00:02:51.032 --> 00:02:53.733
 They can then be transported to the smooth endoplasmic mesh, 

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:56.125
 but the place where they can leave the smooth endoplasmic grid, 

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.841
 we saw how they were tearing apart 

00:02:58.841 --> 00:03:00.466
 in the video about the endoplasmic network. 

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:04.065
 We often call this area a transient endoplasmic grid. 

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:06.689
 This zone here 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.985
 we can call the transient endoplasmic network. 

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:11.290
 Transient endoplasm 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.088
 network is that part, 

00:03:19.088 --> 00:03:21.758
 in which the proteins 

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:23.407
 are detached, wrapped in vesicles (secretory vesicles). 

00:03:23.407 --> 00:03:25.915
 This is the transient endoplasmic network. 

00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:28.585
 The secretory bubbles are these small compartments, 

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.280
 which are surrounded by a membrane 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.623
 and can transport things like proteins. 

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:35.597
 I do not want to waste energy on the wind, 

00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:37.292
 but all these lines that I paint, 

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:38.917
 although they are drawn as a single line, 

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.611
 are double layers of phospholipids. 

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:42.981
 The membrane may be different, 

00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:45.001
 the dual phospholipid layer may be different 

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.996
 between the different parts of the membrane, 

00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:50.457
 but all have the same common device, 

00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:53.661
 have a dual phospholipid layer. 

00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:55.287
 As a revision: these proteins 

00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:58.932
 may exit the endoplasmic network through the transient endoplasmic network 

00:03:58.932 --> 00:04:01.463
 and head to the Golgi apparatus. 

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:02.879
 We have already talked about how 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.896
 proteins "ripen" in the Golgi apparatus. 

00:04:06.896 --> 00:04:08.173
 When I say "ripen" 

00:04:08.173 --> 00:04:10.379
 wants to say there are enzymes, 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.329
 the enzymes of Goldie, 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.489
 which can alter proteins in a variety of ways, 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.727
 can label them, add 

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:19.747
 saccharides to them, 

00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:21.849
 to become glycoproteins. 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.683
 They can designate them as proteins that should be used 

00:04:23.683 --> 00:04:25.169
 in the cell membrane 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.027
 or outside the cell membrane, 

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:29.233
 or in other parts of the cell. 

00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:32.483
 For example, this protein is broken off here 

00:04:32.483 --> 00:04:37.150
 in a secretory bubble and headed to the Golgi apparatus, 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.660
 the two membranes can be merged 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.259
 and the protein gets into the Golgye apparatus. 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.232
 There the protein can be modified there. 

00:04:44.232 --> 00:04:46.252
 It can become a glycoprotein, for example, 

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.669
 who knows? 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.364
 Then it may again tear off 

00:04:49.364 --> 00:04:51.523
 and now this protein that is cut off in a secretory bubble 

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:56.028
 can be placed in the cell membrane. 

00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:59.000
 The protein may be separated from the cell 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.600
 or go to other parts of the cage. 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.273
 All these membranes I talked about, 

00:05:03.273 --> 00:05:05.640
 are not the only parts of the one-membrane system. 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.869
 There are also things like vacuoles, 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:11.445
 which are membrane organelles in the cell. 

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:15.671
 In plant cells the vacuole is used to store substances 

00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:17.807
 or to maintain the cellular form and structure. 

00:05:17.807 --> 00:05:19.293
 Vacuums can be quite large 

00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:20.454
 and give 

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:22.962
 structure of the entire plant. 

00:05:22.962 --> 00:05:27.304
 Lysosomes are present in animal cells. 

00:05:27.304 --> 00:05:29.370
 Lysosomes are membrane structures, 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.110
 in which are sent things that are for 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.639
 recycling or demolition. 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.943
 For example, something can be packed elsewhere. 

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:42.272
 I will use another color. 

00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:45.925
 I drew this bubble too big. 

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:47.736
 But let's say that this has to be destroyed. 

00:05:47.736 --> 00:05:51.730
 Therefore, this membrane merges with this membrane 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.143
 and the contents of the bubble end up in the lysosome. 

00:05:55.143 --> 00:05:58.649
 Lysozyme has a low pH, 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.272
 thanks to that, the things that fall into the lysosomes are digested 

00:06:01.272 --> 00:06:04.755
 and recycle 

00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:06.451
 to their constituent parts. 

00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:11.187
 All of this is part of the one-membrane system. 

00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:12.790
 Once again, I repeat that people rarely realize 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.997
 how complex the cells are 

00:06:13.997 --> 00:06:17.433
 and how beautiful they can be.
