00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.837
My first step was to attend a
lecture

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.406
by a controversial author.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.009
I was clearly entering a world
of fear, obsession,

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.411
and probably madness.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.713
(man)
Airplane mode is a joke.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:15.515
It is a dangerous time

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:20.286
because the Illuminati is
coming up with various methods

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:24.290
to bring about
the Fourth Reich.

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.558
Controlling the weather,

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:30.396
detonating underwater nukes
to cause tsunamis.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.299
(Forrest voice-over)
Listening to this man
ascribe all the word's tragedies

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:35.568
to a shadowy
underground network,

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:39.605
I began to grasp the appeal
of believing in conspiracies.

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:42.308
Perhaps it would be nice
to think that life's misfortunes

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:43.042
aren't simply random,

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.777
but are instead the work

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.647
of a villain who can be
smoked out and defeated.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.287
Which brings us
to the Interdimensional Bigfoot.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.421
(Forrest)
I understand better than anyone

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:58.958
that the randomness
of life can be scary.

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.560
Thanks to this television show,

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.796
my entire existence
is given over to random chance.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.232
Gina, from Toluca Lake
has a question.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.333
What would it be
like to kill a person?

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.535
What's it
like to be a cult leader?

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.804
What's it like
to be kicked in the balls?

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:13.439
And when you really
think about it,

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.007
things
haven't always gone so well.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.175
[gunfire]
Ah!

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.311
I am infested with sea lice!

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:22.181
[screaming]

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:23.382
[gagging]

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:24.784
I'm having a heart attack,
you guys.

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.420
Ow!
[screaming]

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:28.821
Maybe it would feel
better to believe

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.691
that the difficult experiences
I've had on this show

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:35.561
were not the product
of pure blind, random chance.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:36.896
Is there any reason
to think that something else

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.065
might be going on?

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:44.270
Well, let's find out.

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:45.303
Mm-hmm.
