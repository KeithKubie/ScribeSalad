00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.820
So as you may remember,
I came out as bisexual last year.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.240
And since then, I have been dating women.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.520
And what I found very fascinating
is that the more I date women,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.139
the more I find myself understanding heterosexual men.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.180
Let me explain.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.460
Exhibit A:

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.320
I was on a first date with a girl,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.720
who asked me out by the way, this is relevant

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.720
because when the check came,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.600
she never once made a move to pay.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.700
Not even like the fake "let me reach for my purse" move.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820
And though I don't mind paying on a date,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.080
part of me felt like, you know, the offer would have been nice.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.720
I was also a little taken aback that she didn't even say thank you.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.060
AND I never heard from her again.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.000
It really made me feel like she just asked me out so she could have a free dinner.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.580
And the moment I thought that, I was like,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.200
"Oh my god. I sound like all of my guy friends right now."

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.020
And my argument against why guys should pay for dates has always been like

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.260
Look, girls take hours to get ready.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.880
Our investment is looking really nice for you.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.260
Make up, clothes â€” that costs money too.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.660
But we were both girls in this situation. 
We both took hours to get ready.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.620
So I definitely felt slighted.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.440
Exhibit B.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.040
On another day, I went back to a girl's house

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.000
and I ended up making friends with her cat.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.040
That's not a pun. I'm talking about her literal actual animal.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.060
And she said,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.200
- Wow!

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.720
My cat never likes anyone.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.160
I better go out and buy a wedding dress.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.080
[record scratch] [laughing]

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.520
[laughing distorts]

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.760
[awkward laugh]

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.140
[laughing continues to distort]

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.460
And again, I felt like I got some serious perspective.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.920
I have been guilty of making these kinds of jokes on dates with men.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.720
I never really thought anything of it.
I was just being silly!

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.620
But then when I was on the receiving end of it,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.640
I suddenly understood the panic.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.440
And finally, Exhibit C.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.589
One girl invited me back into her house and her specific words were:

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.009
- Do you...

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.640
Wanna come in and make out?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.219
Obviously, I'm like, yeah, you're really pretty. I want to press my face to yours.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.480
But then when we got there,
we both just sat on the couch

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.760
and she talked 'til like... 3 a.m.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.680
And I was like yo girl, I gotta wake up at like 6 a.m.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
I was told there would be kisses here,
there are no kisses,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.860
And like look, I don't want to sound like an asshole.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.520
Like I don't mind talking, I love talking.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.800
But she could have said:

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.200
- Do you wanna come in and just talk?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.000
And I would have had totally different expectations for the evening, you know?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.360
Finally I started falling asleep and I was like,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.620
Hey, I gotta go and I gave her one kiss and... and left.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.440
and I felt sad that the amount of kisses promised

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.660
did not equal the amount of kisses delivered.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.900
And once again, I felt like a dude who was upset that I

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.820
did not receive the expected physical kisses I was promised.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.260
And I wanted to talk about this because I felt like this has really been

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.820
expanding my perspective when it comes to dating.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.660
I finally understand a lot of the complaints my male friends have about dating that,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.920
I admit, I would usually dismiss.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.320
But now I really get it when they say:

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.920
- Dating is just so expensive, man.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.520
- Sometimes I feel like that girl doesn't even like me for me.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.960
She just wants like, a boyfriend.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.970
- I wish it were more socially expected to go dutch on the first few dates

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.760
But you're like a jerk if you even suggest it.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.000
And any experience that expands your compassion and understanding

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.920
is one that I think is worthy of sharing.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.900
So what about you? Have you had any experiences that have

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.560
shifted your viewpoint dramatically? Let me know.
