00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:02.800
How would you like to know if

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.150
you're a carrier for an inherited genetic disorder?

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.530
&gt;&gt; Or would you like to know if certain prescription

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.290
medications may have negative side effects that are specific to you.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.290
&gt;&gt; Or maybe you just like to know

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.380
more information about your family relations and ancestry.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.880
&gt;&gt; Or would you like to know if you're at

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.770
an increased chance of having negative health consequences later in life?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.060
&gt;&gt; There are so many reasons why you might want to unlock the secrets of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.890
your genome. And you don't even have to be rich or famous to find out.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.430
&gt;&gt; And now we're not talking about sequencing a genome.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.330
&gt;&gt; Right, sequencing would require a lot more effort. What

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.960
we're going to talk about in this lesson is looking at about

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.660
a million different positions in the genome that vary between individual

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.760
people. The SNVs which we learned about in the last lesson.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.620
&gt;&gt; Right, the single nucleotide variant. Or the single letter changes.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.560
&gt;&gt; That's right. In this lesson, we're going to learn how to unlock

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.890
the secrets of your genome. But first, what we want to know from you

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.680
is, do you even want to have your genome's information in the first place?
