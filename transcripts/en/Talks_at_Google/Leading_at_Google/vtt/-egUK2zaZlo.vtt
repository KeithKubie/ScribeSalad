ALANA WEISS: Good morning.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.880
My name is Alana Weiss, and
today it is my pleasure to

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.210
welcome Adam Grant to the
Leading at Google series.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.040
Adam Grant is the youngest
tenured professor and single

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.720
highest rated teacher at
the Wharton School.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.360
He is a former record setting
advertising director, junior

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.850
Olympic springboard diver, and
professional magician.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.970
He has been honored as one of
"Business Week's" favorite

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.950
professors and one of the
world's top 40 business

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.500
professors under 40.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.230
Adam is a regular contributor
to Google's People &amp;

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.860
Innovation lab, and he also
has consulted with clients

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.570
ranging from the NFL
to Goldman Sachs

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.540
to the United Nations.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.690
He holds a Ph.D in
organizational psychology from

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.120
the University of Michigan and
a BA from Harvard University.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.510
Today, Adam will share from his
new book "Give and Take."

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.146
Please join me in welcoming
Adam Grant.

00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:02.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.170
ADAM GRANT: Good morning.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.400
Thank you guys so much
for having me.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.830
I'm truly delighted
to be here.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.540
It's always an honor and a treat
to speak to Googlers,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.780
and also to see lots
of friendly

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.870
faces in the audience.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.080
And I'm going to try to turn all
of those friendly faces in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.650
a more negative direction
in the next few minutes.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.950
The place I want to start is I
want to talk for maybe 35 or

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.970
40 minutes or so.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.800
We'll have lots of interactive
discussion throughout, and

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.870
then hopefully open it up then
for some questions and more

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.370
discussion.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.880
But the place to begin, really,
is to say that I'm

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.520
interested in success and what
makes some people and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.020
organizations incredibly
productive and effective and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.410
why other people, perhaps,
are less so.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.430
And at the end of the day, what
I want to know is how can

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.772
every person in this room own
a face that looks like this?

00:01:40.772 --> 00:01:42.250
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.030
ADAM GRANT: And I know some of
you are thinking right now,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.160
well, I already own that face.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.490
And the question is, well, how
could you own it more often?

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.430
Or how could you spread it to
the other people around you?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.150
And as an organizational
psychologist, when I started

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.520
doing research in this area
about 10 years ago, I found

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.370
that there were three ways
to get to this face--

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.480
hard work, talent, and luck.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.180
If you want to be effective in
any domain or any profession

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.790
or any field, you have to
develop a strong work ethic,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.650
you have to really be mastery or
expertise oriented so that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.680
you develop true skills, and, as
Malcolm Gladwell told us in

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.270
"Outliers," you have to find
yourself in the right place at

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.340
the right time.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.560
And I think that's all true.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.570
But for me, it was missing a
really important part of

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.350
success in this connected world
that we all live in--

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.240
our interactions with others.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.490
Most of you work in teams.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.970
Many of you have clients.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.520
Some of you have more managers
than you would like, perhaps.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.410
And the question is, how does
the way that you interact with

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.310
those people every day, shape
the results that you achieve,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.010
the promotions that you gain?

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.750
And ultimately, perhaps also the
meaning in the happiness

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.330
that you obtain.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.370
So when I was trying to get to
the bottom of this, I came

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.840
across a really inspiring
quote.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.070
It was from Robert Benchley.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.000
And Benchley said there are only
two kinds of people in

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.170
the world--

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.450
those who divide the world into
two kinds of people, and

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.520
those who don't.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.860
And I thought that was a
really profound way of

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.700
criticizing those of us in the
psychology world who like to

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.390
oversimplify all of the richness
and complexity of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.480
human beings.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.770
And I told myself that if I
ever wrote a book I would

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.810
never dumb down all of the
complexity of people into just

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.200
two categories.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.850
Which is why today I am proud to
announce to you that if you

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.990
want to capture everything
important about interpersonal

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.260
interaction in organizations
you need not two, but three

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.240
categories.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.290
No, actually, in all
seriousness, there's a good

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.080
amount of evidence across
industries and across cultures

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.580
that there are three fundamental
motives that

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.230
people bring to their
interactions.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.890
I call them reciprocity styles,
basically trying to

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.490
capture the way that you
approach your interactions

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.860
with other people into
exchanging value.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.100
On one end of the reciprocity
spectrum we have the takers.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.350
The people that we all love to
hate who try to get as much as

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.510
possible from others and try to
shirk having to contribute

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.010
back and often specialize in
things like relentless self

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.630
promotion, hogging credit, and
maybe stepping on a few people

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.650
on their way to the top.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.890
Now, on the other end of the
spectrum we have these very,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.260
very strange characters
that I call givers.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.070
And for some odd reason, they
actually enjoy helping others.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.360
Not necessarily philanthropists
or volunteers,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.300
but rather the kinds of people
who do a lot of knowledge

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.910
sharing, who are always
introducing people and making

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.290
connections, who may step
up to provide mentoring.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.260
Now, very few of us
fall purely in the

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.920
taker or giver category.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.010
Most people, it turns out, if
you look at the data, are what

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.280
I call matchers.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.010
And a matcher is somebody who
has tried to keep an even

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.640
balance of give and take.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.850
Quid pro quo.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.830
Tit for tat.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.720
If I do you a favor, I expect
you to do me one in return.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.720
And that seems like a safe and
reasonable way to live your

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.000
professional life.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.300
But my question is, is it the
best way to live your

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.540
professional life?

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.590
Is being a matcher, which most
people choose to do, actually

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.480
the best path to success?

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.380
I'm going to try to shed some
light on that today.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.940
But before we do that, let's
dive into the takers a little

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.300
bit and say, how would you
recognize a taker even if you

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.750
didn't know that person?

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.680
So I prepared a little test,
first of all, for you to

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.290
figure out if you yourself
are a taker.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.400
If you could take a moment and
take the test, I'll tell you

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.114
whether you passed.

00:05:05.114 --> 00:05:13.790
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.410
ADAM GRANT: Now, I hope this is
the only thing I will say

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.010
today that is not based
on data or evidence.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.080
But I sincerely believe that
the longer it takes you to

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.680
laugh, the worse your score
is on the taker spectrum.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.320
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.840
ADAM GRANT: Obviously, there are
a couple different paths

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.850
to becoming a taker.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.220
One is to be a narcissistic,
to be insecure, to believe

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.450
that you have to be superior to
others to be successful and

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.610
carry around this assumption
that the world is zero sum.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.650
A second path to becoming a
taker, which I want to talk a

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.200
little bit about today, is
having been taken advantage of

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.340
one too many times as a matcher
or a giver, and

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.370
believing if I don't put
myself first in this

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.660
dog-eat-dog competitive
world, nobody will.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.620
There's a third path to becoming
a taker which I'm not

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.000
going to talk about today,
it's called being a

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.700
psychopath.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.460
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.840
ADAM GRANT: So all right.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.900
How do you spot a taker?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.980
How do you recognize one?

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.310
There's an actual study by
Chatterjee and Hambrick

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.420
showing that you can tell
whether a CEO is a taker just

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.980
by looking at that person's
photograph in a company's

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.030
annual report.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.010
Here are photos of two CEOs.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.950
I would argue that one is
a taker, one's a giver.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.070
These guys both built very
successful companies.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.450
Both, interestingly, in the
1970s worked in the Nixon

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.000
administration, which I believe
is where one learned

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.940
some of his taking habits.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.510
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.820
ADAM GRANT: And the
question is--

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.260
these photos were taken right
from their annual reports--

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.750
can you tell which of the two
of them is the taker just by

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.950
looking at their faces
or their clothing?

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.180
Take a second to study them, and
then I'm going to ask you

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.140
to weigh in with your votes,
and then justify your bets.

[WHISTLING "JEOPARDY!" THEME]

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.810

to be a great tragedy.

Like, is that "The Twilight
Zone?" No.

00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:04.600
All right, how many people
think the guy on your

right is the taker?

know which one is

No, OK.

to know who you are.

Why?

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.430

he's the taker?

kindness to you?

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.440
AUDIENCE: I don't--

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.270
I'm also completely basing
this off like my exp--

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.950
ADAM GRANT: Rightfully so.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.880
What else could you use?

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.900
I've given you no information.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.695
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:58.332
AUDIENCE: So I feel like the
one on the left, they're a

00:07:58.332 --> 00:08:01.970
little more closed.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.390
Not squinting, but
just more narrow.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.680
ADAM GRANT: All right.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.810
So you feel like the guy on the
right, the taker, is sort

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.624
of looking you right
in the eye?

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:12.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's like he's
posing for a commercial.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.000
ADAM GRANT: He's posing
for a commercial.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.230
Or a press photo shoot.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.220
Yeah.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.040
So there's an actual study
by Keith Campbell and his

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.790
colleagues looking at spotting
takers on Facebook.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.130
They look at the narcissistic
variety of takers, and they

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.310
show that takers actually post
vainer profile pictures of

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.440
themselves.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.380
They're not necessarily more
attractive human beings in

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.950
general, but you will find a
greater distance between how

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.280
they look every day and how hot
they are in their profile

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.690
photo, because they have
to put that best

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.402
foot forward, right?

00:08:41.402 --> 00:08:41.820
All right.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.750
So that's one interesting cue.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.540
What else do you see about the
man on the right that signals

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.540
that man is a taker?

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.200
He's selfish.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.040
He's egotistical.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.090
Now no one wants to answer.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.297
But yes, right here.

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:53.240
AUDIENCE: I think his smile
looks a little forced.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.340
ADAM GRANT: The smile
looks forced.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.240
How so?

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.960
AUDIENCE: It's like tense.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.700
ADAM GRANT: It's tense.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.755
So you think that he's hiding
something behind it.

00:09:01.755 --> 00:09:02.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.750
ADAM GRANT: Maybe All right,
that's reasonable.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.890
Some people also look to this
smile and say he's baring his

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.040
teeth, and in the
animal kingdom

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.170
that's a sign of dominance.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:08.940
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.190
ADAM GRANT: And clearly
CEOs live in the

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.900
animal kingdom, so.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.180
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.160
ADAM GRANT: Any other cues?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.114
John Carmel, what
about the eyes?

00:09:16.114 --> 00:09:17.030
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.600
ADAM GRANT: I know you've
been well trained

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.850
to look at the eyes.

00:09:24.914 --> 00:09:25.902
AUDIENCE: I don't remember.

00:09:25.902 --> 00:09:27.890
ADAM GRANT: Ugh.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.070
Anybody use the eyes other than
just general kindness?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.080
A more specific cue?

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.795
Yes.

00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:34.150
AUDIENCE: The guy on the left
looks like he's making direct

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.132
eye contact, the one on the
right looks like he's looking

00:09:37.132 --> 00:09:38.630
a little bit above you.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.310
ADAM GRANT: Yeah.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.960
All right.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.730
That's a possibility.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:41.780
ADAM GRANT: A-ha!

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.886
Bring it on.

00:09:43.886 --> 00:09:46.992
AUDIENCE: It's when you're doing
a fake smile your eyes

00:09:46.992 --> 00:09:49.820
lie because I think they
crinkle right here.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.630
ADAM GRANT: They
don't crinkle.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.930
AUDIENCE: Or don't crinkle.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.560
ADAM GRANT: Yes.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.210
So some of you know the French
neurologist Duchenne in the

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.110
1800s discovered the Duchenne
smile, the authentic smile.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.190
You can't control these muscles
right next to your

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.430
eyes, and so when you're
experiencing genuine positive

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.810
emotions you will see those
crinkle or wrinkle next to

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.560
your smile.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.830
But if it's a fake smile,
you won't see those.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.770
The problem is both takers and
givers and matchers, too, are

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.080
capable of fake smiles.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.780
In fact, there are a lot of
takers, also, who engage in

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.400
very genuine smiles.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.270
There's a term in psychology
called duping delight, which

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.140
captures the sheer joy you
experience if you're a taker

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.010
after lying to somebody and
getting away with it.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.670
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.720
ADAM GRANT: So you can see this
very genuine smile from a

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.660
taker who's like, I just took
you to the cleaners.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.085
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:10:34.085 --> 00:10:34.560
ADAM GRANT: All right.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.050
So those are a couple cues.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.730
I am sorry to report that the
man on the right I would say

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.650
is the giver.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.350
So some of you will be
feeling bad about

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.310
yourselves right now.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.070
Please don't.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.520
I will make the rest of
you feel bad about

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.130
yourselves in a moment.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.150
The guy on the right, some of
you may have heard of him, his

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.640
name is Jon Huntsman, Sr. He
built the building that I

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.160
teach in at Wharton.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.330
He's one of 19 people on Earth
who have given away over $1

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.650
billion dollars.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.470
Seemingly pretty generous.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.700
He also had a son recently
who may have been a

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.570
presidential candidate.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.470
If you've read his book "Winners
Never Cheat," he has

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.420
some incredible stories of going
out of his way to give

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.550
to others, including after the
financial markets crashed, he

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.850
couldn't fulfill all of his
charitable commitments so he

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.540
took out a personal loan to
deliver on his promises to

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.040
help various causes.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.580
There's also a couple stories,
actually, of him being in big

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.850
merger and acquisition
negotiations and ending up

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.490
feeling like the CEO at the
other side of the table is in

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.430
a really bad situation,
had just lost

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.720
his wife due to cancer--

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.640
cancer, unfortunately,
has affected a lot of

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.600
the Huntsman family--

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.670
and Huntsman basically signed a
deal instead of claiming an

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.680
extra $200 million because he
empathized with the other guy.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.210
So I think he's a pretty
powerful example of a giver.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.970
The man on the left I would
say was the taker.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.500
Did anybody recognize him?

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.460
AUDIENCE: Ken Lay.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.210
ADAM GRANT: OK, those
of you who

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.280
recognized him, that's cheating.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.320
You can't use actual information
about him.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.080
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.005
ADAM GRANT: You're supposed to
use the photo and the clothes.

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:56.340
But yeah, Ken Lay.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.604
What do you know
about Ken Lay?

00:11:58.604 --> 00:11:59.918
AUDIENCE: Enron.

00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:00.360
ADAM GRANT: Enron.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.530
Yeah, one of the primary
villains in that scandal.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.820
If you've seen or read "The
Smartest Guys in the Room,"

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.660
you've been exposed to many,
many examples of him having

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.430
been a taker.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.790
Now, the question is, how did
you know, if you didn't

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.060
recognize him, that
he was a taker?

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.530
And I'm sad to report that there
is nothing in either of

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.880
these two photos that
says anything

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.765
about givers and takers.

00:12:18.765 --> 00:12:19.720
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.510
ADAM GRANT: I just like to see
what people are willing to

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.645
read into meaningless
photographs.

00:12:22.645 --> 00:12:24.191
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:26.310
ADAM GRANT: No, in all
seriousness, I show you these

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.640
photos for two reasons.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.930
One, to remind you that when we
judge is somebody a giver

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.340
or a taker, are they generous
and helpful, or are they

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.300
selfish, we tend to rely a
lot on intuition, on snap

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.940
judgments, on the thin slices
that Malcolm Gladwell wrote

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.750
about in "Blink." The problem
is these are often wildly

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.720
inaccurate, because somebody's
outer veneer--

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.560
are they friendly?

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.360
Are they warm?

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:47.835
Are they welcoming?

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:48.960
Are they polite?--

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.170
is totally different from
their inner motives.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.900
And Ken Lay is a great example
of this, right?

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.285
He wasn't just a taker, he was a
faker, ie, a taker disguised

00:12:56.285 --> 00:12:57.550
as a giver.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.660
He donated 1% of Enron's annual
profits to charity.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.820
He went out of his way to do
what translates from Dutch to

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.300
kissing up, kicking down.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.460
Takers are really good fakers
when dealing with superiors.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.240
They want to put their best
feet forward, they want to

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.110
make a good impression
on powerful people.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.810
But it's hard to maintain
that masquerade at every

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.720
interaction.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.320
And so even if his bosses were
fooled, oftentimes his peers

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.410
and his subordinates saw
right through him.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.860
But I believe we didn't have
to go to his peers and

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.970
subordinates to find out
that he was a taker.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.550
I think we could have looked
at the 1997 Enron annual

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.670
report, four years before the
company collapsed, and spot a

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.550
cue that Ken Lay was a taker.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.820
Let me show you these
photos in context.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.910
Here's Huntsman's
photo from his

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.070
company's 2006 annual report.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:44.130
What do you think Ken Lay's
photo looked like?

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.630
Some people are saying
it's a little bigger.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.640
That would be a dramatic
understatement.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.145
Because if you look at the Enron
1997 annual report, you

00:13:51.145 --> 00:13:53.470
will notice that his head
is an entire page.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.680
AUDIENCE:
[LAUGHTER AND GROANING]

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:03.150
ADAM GRANT: Now, lest you think
this is just sort of a

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.135
fun, unusual example, an
outlier, when Chatterjee and

00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:09.510
Hambrick did their research,
they got data on over 100

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.980
computer companies.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.550
They got Wall Street analysts
who knew the CEOs of each of

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.690
those companies to rate how
much of a taker is each of

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.760
those CEOs.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.660
How egotistical?

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.580
How selfish?

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.070
How narcissistic?

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.170
And then they looked for cues
that correlated with the Wall

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.400
Street analyst's ratings.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.620
And they found three cues that
actually correlated at 0.86, a

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.110
whopping correlation in the
social sciences, with the

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.790
ratings given by the analysts.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.150
And one of them was the
prominence of the CEO's photo

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.600
in the annual report.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.110
The taker CEOs actually
had larger photos.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.510
They were more likely to be
pictured alone, as well.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.080
Which sent a clear
message, right?

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.980
I am the most important person
in this company.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.450
It is all about me.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.360
Second cue--

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.310
compensation.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.480
The average computer industry
CEO made about two to two and

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.080
a half times the annual salary
of the next highest paid

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.760
executive in that company.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.620
The average taker CEO had a
multiple of what greater than

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.190
the next highest paid executive
in the company?

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.010
AUDIENCE: 40.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:04.860
ADAM GRANT: 40.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.745
I mean, I'm not even sure if
that's financially possible.

00:15:06.745 --> 00:15:08.600
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.210
ADAM GRANT: It was a
multiple of seven.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.060
So taker CEOs got paid about
seven times more than anybody

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.530
else in their company.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.180
Third cue was in their speech.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.970
Not just larger photos, not
just bigger relative pay.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.190
What two words do taker CEOs
use more than the others?

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.310
AUDIENCE: "I" and "me?"

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.240
ADAM GRANT: "I" and
"me," bingo.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.010
When talking about the company,
as opposed to "us"

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.140
and we." So those are a
couple ways that you

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.600
could recognize a taker.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.900
What I want to do, though, is
I want to ask, OK, what

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.420
happens to takers?

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.100
Do they rise?

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.030
Do they fall?

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.040
How does their success compare
to givers and matchers?

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.180
And when I started trying to ask
this question, I began at

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.110
the bottom of success, asking
which group is worst off.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.190
Who gets the worst results?

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.170
Is it the takers, the givers,
or the matchers?

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.940
And it looked at research
in three domains.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.800
First, engineers.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.660
Got to have engineers.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.680
Stanford's Frank Flynn did this
great study where he got

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.120
engineers to rate each other
on how many favors they did

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.460
versus how many they got,
and then tracked their

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.030
productivity and the number
of errors they made.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.520
And then medical students.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.970
Filip Lievens and his colleagues
got every medical

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.290
student in Belgium over a seven
year period to fill out

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.640
surveys about how much they
liked helping others and then

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.700
tracked their grades.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.700
And then Dane Barnes and I
actually studied salespeople.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.710
And we were interested
in revenue.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.640
So who were the highest
producing salespeople who

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.800
bring in the most revenue
every year?

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.520
Across these three groups, the
same results came out.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.840
The engineers, the medical
students, and the salespeople.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.760
There was one group, either the
takers, the givers, or the

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.220
matchers, who was consistently
worse off when it came to

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.810
productivity, errors,
grades, and revenue.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.230
Get a show of hands to see
where your intuitions and

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.680
assumptions lie.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.230
How many people think
it was the takers at

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.635
the bottom most often?

00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:54.330
All right, we have some
optimists in the room.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.580
How many people think
it was the matchers?

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.870
OK, a lot of you.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.320
Now, this is an odd thing
to vote for, because

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.480
statistically if most people
are matchers, it would

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.359
actually be quite hard for
most people to be at the

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.310
bottom of any metric.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.020
What about the givers?

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.620
How many people think the givers
are at the bottom?

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.940
All right, those of you
with your hands up,

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.050
you would be correct.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.569
If you looked at the engineers,
the engineers with

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.960
the worst productivity and the
most mistakes were those who

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.960
did a lot more favors
than they got back.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.490
They were so busy helping
their colleagues, they

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.550
couldn't get their work done
efficiently or effectively.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.540
Medical students.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.589
The students with the worst
grades in year one of medical

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.200
school were the ones who agreed
most strongly with

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.280
statements like, I love
helping others.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.140
Now, if you carry that to
its logical extreme--

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.900
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.420
ADAM GRANT: The doctor that
you trust is somebody who

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.020
never wanted to help anyone.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.700
Salespeople.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.830
Dane and I found that the
salespeople with the lowest

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.110
revenue were the ones also who
were passionately motivated to

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.980
help their colleagues and
help their customers.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.350
And I had one salespeople put
it to me pretty bluntly.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.380
He said, look, I really want
to help my customers, which

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.745
means I will never sell
them a product.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.350
So I found this to
be interesting.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.920
I also found it, for those of
you who are givers, to be a

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.510
little bit sad.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.440
How many of you would
self-identify more as a giver

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.600
than a matcher or a taker?

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.765
OK, how many of you
self-identify as a giver but

00:18:13.765 --> 00:18:15.390
didn't want to raise your hand
because you feel like that

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.180
violates humility?

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.620
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.600
ADAM GRANT: All right,
those are the real

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.920
givers in the room.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.710
So I did think this was sad,
though, for those people who

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:24.440
are givers.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.550
And so then I wanted to
know who's at the top.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.230
If the givers are at the bottom,
then who's the most

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.330
likely to have the highest
productivity, the fewest

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.560
mistakes, the best grades,
and, ultimately, the most

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.780
revenue and sales?

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.140
Get a show of hands on
this one as well.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.580
How many people think
the takers were most

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.090
likely at the top?

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.530
How many people think the
matchers are most likely at

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.110
the top, ignoring my warning
that the most common can't be

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.580
overrepresented in one
part of the spectrum?

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.290
How many people didn't raise
their hand for either the

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.540
takers or the matchers
just now?

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.630
OK, good, now we have
everyone involved.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.260
Maybe you didn't raise your
hand because you already

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.860
anticipated the thing that took
me 10 years to figure

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.590
out, which is it's
the givers again.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.620
The givers are not only
overrepresented at the bottom,

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.210
they're also more common
at the top.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.450
The engineers not only with the
worst results but also the

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.390
best results are the ones
who do a lot more favors

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.920
than they get back.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.550
The takers and the matchers are
more likely to be in the

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.650
middle when it comes to
their productivity

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.120
and their error rates.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.160
Medical students with the best
grades, not just in year one

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.780
but over a seven year period are
also the ones who say, I

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.620
love helping others.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.890
And by the way, the medical
students seem to get better

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.800
over time when they're givers,
because you move from

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.520
basically having to study
information independently to

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.040
collaborating with fellow
physicians and also having to

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.110
work closely with patients.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.870
And givers tend to really shine
in interdependent work,

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.245
whereas they may struggle
a little bit more

00:19:42.245 --> 00:19:43.700
in independent work.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.420
In sales, Dane and I found that
giver salespeople who

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.680
really loved helping colleagues
and customers

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.510
actually brought in about 50%
more annual revenue than the

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.150
takers and the matchers.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.930
So for me, that posed
two questions.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.220
One was, what do successful
givers do that the rest of us

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.150
takers and matchers might
want to learn?

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.830
And I think this is an exciting
question because

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.340
these reciprocity styles
are not hard wired.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.440
They're not fixed.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.180
In fact, they're choices
we make in every single

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.240
interaction.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.190
As a thought experiment,
think about the next

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.520
person that you meet.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.610
And you could say, I'm going
to ask myself, do I want to

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.040
just try to help this person
with no strings attached?

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.210
Do I want to try to get
something from this person?

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.990
Or do I want to make
an even trade?

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.120
And the more that you make
those choices, the more

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.810
obviously you define yourself
by one style or another.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.920
But because it's a choice, it's

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.190
something we can all change.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.810
And maybe there are ways that
successful givers operate that

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.550
would be interesting
and productive

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.140
for takers and matchers.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.380
Second question that I was
curious about is, what happens

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.850
to those givers at the bottom?

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.220
And if you would like to be a
helpful person or a generous

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.090
person, what are the traps that
you might fall into and

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.860
how do you avoid them?

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.640
Took me a couple hundred
pages to try to

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.490
answer those questions.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.950
I'm not going to put you all
through that this morning.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.160
But what I want to do is just
give you a couple highlights

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.630
of some of the things that I
learned that are described in

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.190
more detail in the book.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.780
Overall, the thing that I was
really interested in is how do

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.150
givers who succeed relate
to the people in their

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.110
organizations or outside
of them?

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.960
And so I end up looking at how
do givers build networks?

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.540
How do they collaborate?

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.850
How do they develop talent
in other people?

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.070
How do they communicate and
influence and negotiate?

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.150
And I'll just give you a couple
of stories and data

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.860
points from a few of those
perspectives, and then we can

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.960
open it up for questions.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.360
So collaboration.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.180
How do givers succeed
in collaboration?

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.750
Anybody recognize this man?

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.110
He's known as the genius behind
the most successful

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.840
television show in history.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.220
AUDIENCE: "Muppets."

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.490
ADAM GRANT: No, but
it's a good guess.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.380
Probably you've never
heard of him.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.340
I hadn't heard of him either
when I came across his story.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.410
Although I later found out that
he invented a word that

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.280
was uttered by my college
roommate every day for four

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.260
years, which made me a
little bit unhappy.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.350
But this man is known as the
genius behind a really amazing

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.960
television show.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.080
And he had a pretty
checkered past.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.020
He was an undergraduate, and he
ended up deciding that he

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.180
was going to sell
a refrigerator.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.526
And he sold it to a freshman,
and he took the money, and he

00:22:04.526 --> 00:22:06.180
never delivered the
refrigerator.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.810
And he almost got kicked out of
college for that, and then

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.320
he almost got kicked out again
when he smashed his dorm room

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.450
window with an electric
guitar.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.320
And his one sort of
crowning moment in

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.950
life was when he was--

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.500
to that point, at least--
elected the president of "The

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.800
Harvard Lampoon." But
then he was--

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.930
actually there was an attempted
overthrow, a coup,

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.450
by his peers because he was
quote "not responsible

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.720
enough."

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.600
And he ended up finishing
college.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.790
He decided that he was going to
make a living by betting on

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.510
dog racing, greyhound tracks.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.610
And he spent two weeks holed in
a library trying to develop

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.190
a mathematic, scientific way
of beating the system.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.340
Unfortunately, he ran out of
money a few days later and had

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.530
to move in with his parents.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.980
So bad start to his career.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.200
But somehow he managed to get
a job writing for a little

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.370
show called "Saturday Night
Live" in the 1980s.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.320
And one point in his "Saturday
Night Live" career-- his name

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.000
is George Meyer, by the way.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.900
George had a decision to make.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.060
He had two different
guests that were

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.540
coming onto the show.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.660
One of them, the Material Girl
in the height of her

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.020
fame, in her prime.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.760
The other we will say perhaps a
less desirable candidate to

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.570
write a sketch for,
Jimmy Breslin.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.780
And George was trying to
figure out, OK, we need

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.140
sketches for both
of these people.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.780
They're going to be coming
on the show.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.920
And everybody's flocking
to write for Madonna.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.410
Nobody wants to write
for Jimmy Breslin.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.260
They don't think he's very
fun or entertaining.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.950
And George says,
you know what?

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.080
One of the best ways to be
successful if you're working

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.100
in a team or a group is to
try to make other people

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.190
successful.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.010
If "Saturday Night Live" is
better, then I'm going to be

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.140
better off too because
I'm a part of that.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.040
And so he engages in what gets
called at the National Outdoor

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.210
Leadership School expedition
behavior.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:49.720
Basically saying, if you're
going to go and climb a

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.320
mountain, try and put the
mission ahead of your own

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.870
personal interests
and desires.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:55.560
And he says, you know what?

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.100
I'm going to submit a few
sketches for Madonna, but I'm

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.730
going to do my best work
for Jimmy Breslin.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.180
And that's really where my work
is needed, because so few

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.880
people are wanting to contribute
good ideas there.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.340
And George ends up writing
this amazing skit.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.530
It's called "Bond Villains on
a Talk Show." And you get to

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.950
see basically Breslin playing
a Bond Villain, and they're

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.530
comparing strategies
for attacking Bond.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.400
And that ends up basically
inspiring Mike Myers to do the

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.030
"Austin Powers" movies, which
was kind of a cool thing to

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.350
see happen.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.370
Well, if you look at what
happened to George next, he

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.070
ended up moving out
to Colorado.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.570
He was working on a
Letterman script.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.980
It didn't pan out, and he
decided he wanted to do his

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.490
own comedy.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.070
And he knew he couldn't do it
alone, so he reaches out to a

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.430
bunch of his "Saturday
Night Live" buddies.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.850
And he was really torn about how
to do this, because for a

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.830
lot of people George is a really
funny guy and he would

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.710
be a threat.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.870
Right?

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.090
You're working in this zero sum
sort of competitive world

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.180
of comedy, there are
only so many jobs.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.920
And George is afraid that if
he reaches out to people

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.090
they're not going to help him
because if he succeeds, that

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.140
means they're going to fail.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.080
But one of the things that
happened when George engaged

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.550
in this kind of expedition
behavior is he showed that he

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.410
was the kind of person who
cared about the group.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.110
He cared about other
people's interests.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.100
And as a result, instead of
gunning for him, people wanted

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.260
to support him.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.030
He kind of established himself
as a giver, and as a result,

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.410
people were kind of rooting
for him when he was doing

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.660
work, and they wanted to feel
like this is the kind of guy

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.480
who deserved to succeed.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.880
Part of the reason for that is
most people are matchers.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.290
And if you're a matcher, you
believe in a just world.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.820
You think what goes around
ought to come around.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.160
And that means when you see a
taker acting selfishly, you

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.960
want to punish that person.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.540
Usually that means, Robb Willer
shows at Stanford,

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.150
gossiping--

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.600
sharing negative reputational
information so that takers

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.950
cannot get away with exploiting
other people.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.600
Just as you can't stand to see
a taker be selfish and get

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.560
away with it, you also, if
you're a matcher, don't like

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.560
to see generous people fail.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.940
And so when somebody's a giver
and really helpful, you will

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.000
often go on a mission to plot
that person's well being.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.230
And I think that's exactly what
happened to George Meyer.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.160
All these colleagues came out of
the woodwork and they said,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.340
yeah, we'll contribute.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.320
George wanted to write this
little magazine called "Army

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.250
Man." It was going to be a
parody of the US military.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.750
And he reached out to all of
these colleagues, and they

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.740
just gave away some of their
best comedy to him for free.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.740
One of them was a guy
named Jack Handey.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.750
And he wrote one of his earliest
"Deep Thoughts"

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.070
pieces two years before it ever
appeared on the show for

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.640
George and his little
"Army Man" magazine.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.540
George puts out the magazine.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.230
It has all this great
comedy in it.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.150
It catches the attention of a
guy by the name of Sam Simon,

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.940
and Sam is just about to start
a little TV show called "The

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.500
Simpsons."

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.090
George ends up getting invited
because of this comedy he was

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.780
able to do to "The Simpsons,"
where he becomes an executive

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.830
producer, wins a bunch of Emmys,
ends up contributing to

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.470
a movie that grossed half a
billion dollars, and has a

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.540
pretty good, successful
career.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.670
What's interesting, though, is
that he contributed to over

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.800
300 "Simpsons" episodes, and
he only took credit as a

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.250
writer on 12 of them.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.300
And I think this was part
of his giver style.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.280
But I think one of the things
that Robb Willer points out in

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.350
his research is that groups
reward individual sacrifice.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.970
And this is one of the ways
that givers succeed in

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:55.970
collaboration--

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.250
looking for the unpopular tasks
and volunteering for

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.290
them, and showing that they
actually care about the best

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.220
interests of the group.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.610
And then when it comes time to
determine who should lead, who

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:06.980
deserves opportunities, those
are the people who get

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.290
rewarded and trusted
and respected.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.370
So that's one example of the
kind of thing that we see

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.890
givers do successfully
in collaboration.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.160
Now, some people will look at
this and say, this is crazy.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.680
This is not something that I
would recommend to somebody

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.570
that I cared about.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.700
And if this video clip works,
I want to show you my first

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.175
introduction to how most
people view givers.

00:27:31.175 --> 00:27:32.145
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:32.145 --> 00:27:32.630
-Huh.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.960
Still a 31 waist?

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.410
-Yep.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.410
Since college.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.010
Hey, Lena's Small's
on this list.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.772
-Lena Small?

00:27:40.772 --> 00:27:41.616
-Yeah.

00:27:41.616 --> 00:27:43.430
She's that girl I was going
to call for a date.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.550
She was unlisted, and now
here's her number.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.940
-Oh, you are not gonna cop a
girl's phone number off an

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.800
AIDS charity list.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.280
-Elaine, you should admire me.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.930
I'm aspiring to date
a giving person.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:56.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.030
-But you're a taking person.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.720
-That's why I should date
a giving person.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.100
If I date a taking person,
everyone's

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.760
taking, taking, taking.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.460
No one's giving.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.710
It's bedlam.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.012
So George.

00:28:13.012 --> 00:28:15.120
-Yeah.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.720
-Guess what?

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.940
Lena found out how
I got her number.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:20.250
-Really?

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:21.612
How'd she do that?

00:28:21.612 --> 00:28:24.600
-Eh, friend of a friend
of Susan's.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.240
-My Susan?

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.492
-(SHOUTING) Why'd you tell her?

00:28:26.492 --> 00:28:27.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:28.630
-I had to, Jerry.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.680
It's a couple rule.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.760
We have to tell each
other everything.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.600
-Well, you know what this
means, don't you?

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:32.940
-What?

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.752
-You're cut off.

00:28:33.752 --> 00:28:35.110
You're out of the loop.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:36.922
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:36.922 --> 00:28:38.281
-You're cut-- you're
cuting me off?

00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:39.640
No, no, no, Jerry,
don't cut me off.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.640
-You leave me no choice.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.470
You're the media now as
far as I'm concerned.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.880
-No, Jerry, come on.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.480
Please.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.690
It won't happen again.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.710
-If you were in the mafia, would
you tell her every time

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.125
you killed someone?

00:28:49.125 --> 00:28:51.256
-Hey, a hit is a totally
different story.

00:28:51.256 --> 00:28:52.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.450
-I don't know, George.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.595
-So Lena was upset, huh?

00:28:56.595 --> 00:28:57.420
-You know what?

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.510
That was the amazing thing.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.420
-What, it didn't bother her?

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.410
-No, she said it was fine.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:04.530
Something very strange
about this girl.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.660
-What?

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.820
-She's too good.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:08.217
-Too good?

00:29:08.217 --> 00:29:11.750
-I mean, she's giving and caring
and genuinely concerned

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.900
about the welfare of others.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.700
I can't be with someone
like that.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.605
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:15.605 --> 00:29:16.930
-I see what you mean.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:17.310
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.510
ADAM GRANT: I think that's
how a lot of people

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:19.650
view givers, right?

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.990
It's a sign of weakness.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.110
But I actually think it can
be a source of strength.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.380
And one of the more interesting
ways that plays

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.740
out is to look at how givers
actually communicate.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.930
I had a chance to get a personal
taste of this.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.820
A few years ago, shortly after I
finished my doctorate, I was

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.220
asked to teach a group of
Air Force colonels.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.520
And I was supposed to teach them
how to lead and motivate.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.050
I was in my mid-20s, and most of
them were in their mid-50s.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.260
They were just like the guys out
of "Top Gun." Most of them

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.820
had flown thousands of hours
and had these really pretty

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.900
badass nicknames like Stealth
and Gunner and Iceman.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.140
And I walked in, and I knew that
I needed to establish my

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:57.850
credentials, right?

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.730
Here was this kid,
half their age.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:03.330
And so I started talking a
little bit about my expertise,

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.820
my experience, why I could maybe
share some knowledge

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.460
that would be helpful to them.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.270
And it was a four-hour
experience, and I got the

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.530
feedback from the
teaching forums.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.520
And it was pretty
darn painful.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.000
Some of the comments
have really burned

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.330
themselves into my brain.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:21.710
But the one that really stuck
out the most was quote, "More

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:25.960
knowledge in the audience than
on the podium." It's like,

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.020
that is very sad.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.380
Thank you.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.640
The others were nicer, but
they said similar things.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.650
One person said, gosh,
the professors get

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:33.920
younger every year.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.090
How can they possibly know
anything about leadership when

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.980
they've never led, let
alone had a real job.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.030
And I was like, OK.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.980
So part of what I realized
there was that I was

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.560
communicating a little bit
more like a taker does.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.090
Takers try to get respect
by gaining dominance.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:51.980
They try to be as confident
as possible.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.380
They try to make sure
there are not any

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.860
chinks in their armor.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.260
And they want to make sure, as a
result, that people see them

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.830
very positively.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.950
And that style didn't feel
very comfortable for me.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.410
As a professor, at least, I felt
like my job was always to

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.470
listen to students, to learn
from them, and then try to

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.550
figure out what I knew that
might be helpful.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.890
And so I had another session
with a different group of Air

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.390
Force colonels scheduled before
they decided to fire me

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.440
altogether.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.990
And this time I decided that
instead of going with the

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.880
really powerful, confident
approach, I would do something

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.700
a little bit more powerless.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.870
And I opened up by saying, OK,
guys, I know what some of you

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:26.830
are thinking right now.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.860
What can I possibly learn
from a professor

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.750
who's 12 years old?

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.210
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.640
ADAM GRANT: And there was
this dead silence.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.740
And one of the guys I was pretty
sure started to reach

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.420
for his gun.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.120
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.120
ADAM GRANT: And then they all
started laughing, and one of

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.530
them said, oh, there's
no way you're 12.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.840
I'm sure you're at least 13.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.370
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.400
ADAM GRANT: And that sort of
became a running joke for the

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.260
next four hours.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.190
And I noticed that I had really

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.480
bonded with the audience.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.600
I think part of it was because
I had called out the elephant

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.540
in the room.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.010
But afterward when I read
the feedback, it

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:56.950
was night and day.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.510
A lot of them said, gosh, it was
a breath of fresh air to

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.410
have a young professor who
could talk about the

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.090
millennial generation.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.860
And I think that a lot of it--

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.480
I delivered the exact
same material.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.990
A lot of it was the
vulnerability and humility to

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.560
say, look, I don't have
all the answers.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.010
And I may not be able to teach
you guys anything.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.010
And if you look at the data on
this, givers are a lot more

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.590
comfortable doing that
than takers.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.160
Takers do not want to expose
their weaknesses, whereas

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.900
givers are willing to
communicate in a much more

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.470
authentic and honest, maybe even
self-deprecating way in

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.430
order to form a genuine
connection with the people

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.800
that they're trying
to connect with.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.860
And I think there's a great
example of this that dates

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.360
back to the mid-1800s.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.820
Somebody that you may
have heard of, Abe

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.920
Lincoln, was in a debate.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.340
And his opponent called him
"two-faced." And I think a lot

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.240
of takers would have been
offended by that.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.960
I think that Lincoln was a
really extraordinary example

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.160
of a giver who was always
looking for other people's

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.060
best interests and how to
pursue and support them.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.240
And he didn't even really
skip a beat.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.590
And he said, "You call
me two-faced.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.750
If I had another face, do you
really think I would wear this

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.020
one?"

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.140
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.380
ADAM GRANT: And it's a great
example of that kind of

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.120
vulnerability and humility that
establishes a connection.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.100
I think that Lincoln was really
clever about it, too.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.470
He knew that his appearance was
something easy to laugh

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.980
at, but also that it was not
going to call into question

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:16.940
his competence.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.950
And so it was something that
he could easily be a little

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.570
bit vulnerable about.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.125
There's a classic study that
shows why this works.

00:33:23.125 --> 00:33:26.110
Elliot Aronson in the 1960s
asked people to listen to

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.830
tapes of "Quiz Bowl" experts.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.080
Some of them were extremely
knowledgeable, others didn't

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.450
really have the answers to the
trivia questions that were

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:34.830
being posed to them.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.690
And you're listening to this
tape, you hear this candidate

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.680
answering all these
questions right.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.640
And then some of the candidates
the tape just ends,

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.150
and then others spill some
coffee on themselves and you

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:45.280
hear the cup crash and the
person's like, oh my

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.320
gosh, I'm so clumsy.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.380
And you actually, it turns
out, like and respect the

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.330
"Quiz Bowl" expert more when he
spills coffee on himself.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.320
So Aronson and his colleagues
call this the pratfall effect.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.950
And they say, look, we actually
identify with people

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.900
more when they're human.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.920
But interestingly, it doesn't
work if the person is not

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.970
"Quiz Bowl" competent.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.650
So if you got most of the
questions wrong and you

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:13.135
spilled coffee on yourself, you
just look like an idiot.

00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:15.580
But I think that this is a lot
of what happens when givers

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.080
communicate.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.889
There's some really good
research by Alison Fragale at

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.520
the University of North Carolina
who shows that we

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.030
tend to think that powerful
speech, the confident, the

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.460
assertive, the dominant, is
going to earn us status and

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.989
trust and respect.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:28.850
But that that's only true
if you're really working

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.600
independently, separately.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.810
If you have to collaborate, you
have to work in a team, or

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.630
you have to have clients, you
will actually get more trust

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:39.980
if you use a lot of ums and uhs
and ifs and hesitations

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.239
and tag lines and qualifiers,
because what happens is when

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:47.210
you speak in a more tentative,
soft-spoken way, people tend

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.750
to assume that you have their
best interests at heart.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:50.250
And guess what?

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.290
In a collaboration, we care at
least as much about whether

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.830
you care about my best interests
as whether you're

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.570
competent and capable
and assertive.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.420
And again, I think this is
something that often works

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.360
really well for givers
as they communicate.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.920
This willingness to defer to
other people, to show an

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.800
interest in other people's
opinions

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.940
while they're talking.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.640
Those are a couple of things
on communication I thought

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.120
were interesting.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.430
One other thing I wanted
to highlight--

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.250
burnout.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:18.260
Teacher burnout.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.800
Common problem.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.360
This is Conrey Callahan.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.010
She was a Teach for America
teacher who probably

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.940
experienced the worst burnout
I've ever seen in a classroom.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.820
She has at Overbook High School
in Philadelphia where

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.770
the graduation rate is abysmally
low, the crime rate

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.240
is extremely high.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.900
There are students who actually
only come to school

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.520
two or three days a year.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.390
And she was just exhausted
by these students

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:39.840
who wouldn't listen.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.350
And somehow she managed to turn
that around and actually

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.250
end up getting a National
Teaching Award and stay longer

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.670
with Teach for America
than any of the

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.260
people in her cohort.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.020
And when I started to interview
her about why, she

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.780
said some things that I thought
tracked really well

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.180
with some recent data.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.820
The first thing she said was at
the height of her burnout

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.720
she was getting up at 6:00 AM,
she was working 'til 1:00 AM

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.370
usually, she was having to do
grading on the weekends.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:06.190
Instead of giving less,
she gave more.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.190
She started a nonprofit
organization called Minds

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.300
Matter Philadelphia,
where she was

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.690
tutoring kids on the weekends.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.770
And I was like, how could you
possibly burnout less by

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:15.340
giving more?

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.350
That, I think, defies every
principle of physics and

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.210
chemistry I've ever learned.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:23.110
And she said, well, part of
what happened was in my

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.560
everyday job I don't feel like
I necessarily make a dent.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.160
I don't think I have
an impact.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.680
Whereas when I'm working with
these kids on the weekends,

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.770
these are high-achieving
low income kids.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.145
And I feel like I spend four or
five hours with them, and

00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:35.920
I'm actually helping them
get into college.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.170
And it renews my hope that
my regular teaching

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.090
job can have an impact.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:41.890
And I think it reveals one
of the really interesting

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.570
principles of giver burnout.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.810
Givers don't burnout just
because they're working too

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.170
hard or giving too much.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.920
They burnout when they don't
get to feel that they're

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.140
making the difference that
they had set out to make.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.810
And I think that Conrey's idea
of starting this nonprofit was

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:56.520
a really interesting way of not
only seeing more of her

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.360
impact by trying to help
people who were really

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.670
dedicated to school, but also
just created sort of a fresh

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.340
experience of being in a
different setting and being

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.510
able to renew a little
bit of energy.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.860
The other thing she did that I
think was really clever was

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.540
she chunked her giving into
blocks, as opposed to

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.520
sprinkling it out
across the day.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.980
There's an experiment by Sonja
Lyubomirsky that looks at

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.490
random acts of kindness.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.790
And you are either randomly
assigned to do one random act

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.850
of kindness every day for a week
or five random acts of

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.480
kindness in one day each week.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.280
And most people assume that you
should do them every day,

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.190
and that way you feel like
you're helpful every day and

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.640
that will boost your
happiness.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.270
But Sonja finds the opposite,
that doing five random acts of

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.710
kindness in one day actually
leads to greater happiness

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.740
than doing one each
day for five days.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.120
We can speculate about
why that is.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.410
I think this research
is relatively new.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.550
But one of Sonja's dominant
explanations is that you feel

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.960
like you are actually
having an impact.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.470
When you do five acts of
meaningful helping a day, they

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.330
add up, whereas when you
sprinkle them around it's sort

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.550
of a drop in the bucket, and it
doesn't make you feel like

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.630
you're truly making
a difference.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.720
I think that that's a really
interesting practice.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.300
So there's one Fortune 500
company that actually goes out

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.300
of its way to set quiet time
windows-- this is Leslie

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.400
Perlow's research at Harvard
Business School--

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.475
to say if you are an engineer,
you're constantly interrupting

00:38:12.475 --> 00:38:14.250
and getting interrupted by
your colleagues, and it's

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.900
really hard to get your
own work done.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.460
So what if Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Friday mornings

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.990
from 9:00 to 12:00 there were no
interruptions and you could

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:22.130
get your own work done.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.150
And then you have these windows
set aside where you

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.090
can be helpful and
support others.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:29.210
When Leslie did that, this
particular company had 66% of

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.390
engineers show above average
productivity.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:33.900
And at the end of the day they
launched their product, which

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.550
was a laser printer, on time
for only the second time in

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.910
division history.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.770
And I think this, again,
illustrates some things that

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.600
givers can do to
avoid burnout.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.350
Don't help all the people
all the time

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:44.520
with all the requests.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.820
Don't drop everything to support
the people around you,

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.680
but rather say I'm going to
reserve windows where I'm

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.640
going to be helpful to the
people around me, and then

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.310
also I'm going to have times
that I block out for my own

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:54.800
individual work.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.760
Those are some of the things
that I wanted to talk about.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.880
Just a few other things you
might find in the book if you

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.550
are curious.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.530
How do givers build networks,
and how do those look

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.770
different from takers
and matchers?

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.100
How does "Fortune's"
best networker--

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.350
the guy, not the cat--

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.370
claim that he built an
extraordinary network?

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.450
Some of you may know this man.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.760
Just through random
acts of kindness.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.400
And does it actually work?

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.480
Leadership.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.850
How does this guy, CJ Skender,
an accounting professor,

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.240
because he's a giver, know
that this woman, Beth

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.720
Traynham, whose own mother told
her she couldn't add or

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.640
tell time, would one day
become a national gold

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.120
medalist in accounting?

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.540
And how did he know that this
guy, Reggie Love, who was

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.480
written off by many as an
athlete, would one day become

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.100
President Obama's body man?

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:46.040
What do givers know about
spotting talent in others that

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.280
takers and matchers
miss out on?

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.935
Decision making.

00:39:49.935 --> 00:39:52.510
Why does a basketball executive
named Stu Inman pass

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.120
up the chance to choose Michael
Jordan and end up

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.030
getting a draft bust, Sam Bowie,
and then hang on to Sam

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.640
Bowie for four years instead
of cutting his losses?

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.550
What does it take to get other
people to avoid the trap that

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.850
psychologists call escalation
of commitment to a losing

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.110
course of action and instead
say, you know what, it's over

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.050
man, just let her go?

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:16.510
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER[

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.090
ADAM GRANT: I know sometimes
that one hits a little too

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:18.700
close to home.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.520
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.500
ADAM GRANT: And then how do you
avoid being treated as a

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.950
doormat if you're a giver?

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:27.930
What prevents you from
becoming a pushover?

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.580
How do you deal with a taker and
still maintain your sense

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.580
of concern for others
and generosity?

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.025
But my favorite question, is
it possible to turn a taker

00:40:36.025 --> 00:40:37.680
into a giver?

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.430
Maybe not in all of their
interactions, right?

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.630
But can we nudge people more in
the giving direction in our

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.010
relationships with them?

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:44.860
Maybe.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.920
One of my favorite ways to do
that, some of you have been

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.480
part of already, it's called the
reciprocity ring, invented

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.640
by Wayne Baker at the University
of Michigan and

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.220
Cheryl Baker at Humax
Networks.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.710
The idea is you gather a group
of 10 or 20 or 30 people, and

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.570
you ask them all to
make a request.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.300
Something meaningful, personal,
or professional that

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.190
they want but can't
get on their own.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.960
And then you ask everybody else
in the group just to try

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.530
to use their knowledge and their
networks to make the

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.690
request happen.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.180
And some pretty amazing things
happen when everybody adopts

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.410
the norm of giving and says,
we're just going to all try to

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.300
support each other.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.840
Couple examples.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.810
Earlier this year a woman came
in said, my hero is a man

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.430
who's a blogger, but he's
also a minimalist.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:24.640
And he's impossible to
contact because he

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.990
likes a simple life.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:29.140
I've wanted for six years to
meet him and one, thank him,

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.050
and two, ask him how
I can help him.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.210
But I don't know how to
get in touch with him.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.490
Could anybody help me?

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.670
And one person in this room
says, yeah, you know what?

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.560
I know a blogger
who knows him.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.570
And they've been introduced,
and they're meeting up for

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:40.780
dinner next week.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.060
I'm very excited to
see how it goes.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.690
I think it probably wouldn't
have happened unless she had

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.780
access to this network of people
who in that moment were

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.160
willing to act like givers.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:48.740
And guess what?

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.860
Because the requests are
visible, it's really hard to

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:51.650
be a taker.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.930
Because when you make that ask,
if you don't help other

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.590
people, nobody wants
to support you.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.250
There are a few people in this
room who were present for this

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.380
particular request in my
classroom when a student named

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.680
Michelle said she had a friend
who had her growth stunted as

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.500
a child and she could never find
the right clothing, could

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.550
anybody help her?

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.540
And another student, Jessica,
raised her hand, and she said,

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.700
yeah, I have an uncle in
the garment business.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.490
And I'm happy to reach
out to him.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.100
And three months later,
custom clothing

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.780
arrived on her doorstep.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.400
And for the first time in the
life of Hope, Michelle's

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.480
friend, she actually had
clothing that fit her right.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.620
My favorite request, though,
of all time was a student

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.780
named Alex who came in one day
we were running one of these

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.720
reciprocity ring exercises.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.230
And he said, I think the closest
thing to nirvana in

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.520
life is riding a
roller coaster.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.340
And I came to Wharton because I
one day would love to run a

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.960
place like Six Flags.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.160
But strangely, Six Flags does
not recruit at the Wharton

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.030
School of Business.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.000
So could anybody help me figure
out how to break into

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.500
the industry?

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.140
Another student, Andrew, raises
his hand and says,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.840
yeah, I think my dad knows the
ex-CEO, I'm happy to get you

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:53.940
guys in touch.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.710
Two weeks later, they have a
cell conversation, and Alex

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:57.870
comes into class the next day.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.790
I'm so excited to find
out about it.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:00.810
So Alex, how'd it go?

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:02.910
And Alex was like, I learned
something really important

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.030
from that conversation--

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.070
I will never want to work
in that industry ever.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:08.070
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.920
ADAM GRANT: And I was like, OK,
at least you were able to

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.980
rule that out.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.070
And because of that, I am proud
to say that today, at

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.830
this very moment, Alex is
living his dream happily

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:18.085
employed as a management
consultant.

00:43:18.085 --> 00:43:21.650
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:23.520
ADAM GRANT: Anyway, I'm
happy to talk further.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.340
If you check out the "Give and
Take" site, you can rate

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.810
yourself on a survey and figure
out do you tend to

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.370
think most like a giver,
a taker, or a matcher?

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.070
Although you all know too much
now, so your ratings will be

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.260
fatally flawed.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.030
There's also a 360 assessment.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:39.440
You can anonymously ask anybody
who knows who to rate

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.400
you, and then basically find out
do I see myself the same

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.850
way other people see me?

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.190
And then there's also a Nominate
a Giver feature, sort

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.440
of like a bigger version of
the way that peer and spot

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.200
bonuses often work, where you
can write a little paragraph

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.450
to recognize somebody
that you think

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:53.610
has been really generous.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:55.990
And we're going to basically
recognize one a week based on

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:58.890
voting for the best example
of a successful giver.

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:00.780
All right, happy to open
it up for questions.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.930
Who's the first victim?

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:05.430
Tina, "Is there a difference
between men and women?" In

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.160
general, or in "Give
and Take?"

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.360
AUDIENCE: "Give and Take."

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.110
ADAM GRANT: Yeah.

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:13.780
I really try to avoid this
question, because I wanted to

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.970
write about people,
not sort of divide

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:17.010
the world by genders.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.720
But the data on this I think
are pretty interesting.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.280
So Alice Eagly and her
colleagues have meta-analyzed

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.030
about three decades of studies
looking at are men or women

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:26.820
more likely to help others?

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.660
And they find that the answer
is no, they're actually

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.280
equally likely to be helpful,
but that they specialize in

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.950
helping in different domains.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:34.820
So women tend to do more helping
behaviors in close

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.890
relationships.

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:37.930
They spend more time helping
their friends, their family

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.720
members, and their
close colleagues.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.720
Whereas men are more likely,
it seems from the data, to

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.030
help strangers, especially in
emergency situations, which I

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.010
think has an interesting
macho implication.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.380
Oh, I must be tough and
rescue someone now.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.050
Arrr.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.140
But I think a lot of people
stereotype women as being more

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.460
likely to be givers because a
lot of the most important

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.490
giving that happens in the
world is the close

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.890
relationship based giving, and
I would love to see more men

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:03.590
acting like women.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.180
AUDIENCE: So you said that for
givers, they're at the bottom

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.800
and then at the top.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.530
Has that been filtered out
by intelligence level?

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.300
So I'm wondering if you get to
a point where things become

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.050
too easy so you start helping
people if you're at the top

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.780
versus for some people it might
be you just help because

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.180
you know that's something
you can do.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:20.740
ADAM GRANT: Yeah.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:22.550
So intelligence is a really
interesting question.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:25.430
In my data, intelligence are
close to orthogonal--

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:28.450
intelligence measures are to
"Give and Take." So you can

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:31.990
find very, very bright givers,
very bright takers.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.760
There is some evidence.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.200
Russell James, an economist, has
actually shown the smarter

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.490
you are, the more you give
to charity, even after

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:40.050
controlling for your education
levels, your

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.050
socioeconomic status.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:46.070
And the idea is basically that
if you're incredibly high in

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:48.930
intellectual horsepower, it's
easier for you to appreciate

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:51.010
all the different ways that you
could be benefiting others

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:52.550
in the long run.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:54.340
I think there's a lot
a debate about it.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.470
But there's another study
by [? Millet and ?]

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:57.490
DeWitt that actually shows that
when you give people an

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.800
intelligence test and then you
ask them to play a prisoner's

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.680
dilemma game where they have to
keep money for themselves

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.680
or give it to others, the
smarter you are, the more you

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.340
give to others.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.530
That being said, the
correlations are so small that

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.010
I don't think they're
practically that meaningful.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.110
In the studies that Dane and I
did of salespeople we actually

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:14.390
controlled for intelligence
and found that even after

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.910
taking that out of the equation
the giver factor was

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:18.820
basically a very strong
predictor of both hitting the

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.120
bottom and the top
of sales revenue.

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.300
The other intelligence data
point that I've seen is

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.620
there's a great study by Kim and
Glomb called "Get Smarty

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.660
Pants" which shows the smarter
you are, the more likely you

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.660
are to be bullied by your
colleagues who are jealous,

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.880
unless you're a giver.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.050
And that goes back to the point
we want to take down

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.510
really bright, successful
takers, but we want to support

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:39.680
and lift up the bright,
successful givers.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.380
Next question.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:41.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:41.890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:42.930
things I loved for
the session.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.390
It was really interesting.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:46.820
Going back to the point of
showing vulnerability

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.680
publicly, I was wondering
if that changes

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.140
from culture to culture.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.030
Because in certain cultures I
have the feeling that the more

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:57.070
senior or the more professional
you are,

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:59.360
[? public ?] vulnerability might
be seen as something

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.720
quite [? narrative ?]
intellectually.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.490
ADAM GRANT: Yeah, I think
there's a huge cross-cultural

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.070
difference there.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.970
One of the best ways, I think,
to think about that is to go

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:09.030
back to Hofstede's classic
research on power distance and

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:12.180
say that in cultures where
people accept basically steep

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.610
hierarchies as appropriate and
correct, it's a little bit

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:17.720
riskier to open up and
be vulnerable.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.800
I also think, though, that that
was maybe the situations

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.090
where it's most powerful and
disarming for somebody that

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:25.720
you expect to have this
incredibly polished

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.990
presentation style to actually
open up and say, look, I'm

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.700
just human, too.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.300
Aronson's research actually
showed that it will depend on

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.380
the audience, though, how
people react to it.

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.550
So the people who like those
who sort of spill coffee on

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.010
themselves or stumble the most
are those with average

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:42.280
self-esteem.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.890
Those are the people who see
themselves as human, and they

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:45.300
like other people to be human.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.240
Whereas if you have really high
self-esteem, you tend to

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.010
want other people to appear
really confident.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:52.160
If you have low self-esteem,
you just

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.472
don't like other people.

00:47:53.472 --> 00:47:55.280
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.260
ADAM GRANT: That may be a slight
caricature of the data.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:58.780
AUDIENCE: Hey, Adam.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.090
Katie Everett, fellow
Harvard diver.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:01.970
Hi.

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:03.430
I am wondering--

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:05.840
I have my daughter here today,
Grace, who's five.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.360
It's take your child
to work day.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.050
And I love your work and have
been thinking about how do you

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:14.640
foster this kind of mindset
in your children?

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.510
I'm just wondering if you have
any insights into how to do

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:18.630
something like that.

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.970
ADAM GRANT: Yeah.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:20.990
First of all, I think it should
be called give your

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:22.600
child to work day, not take.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.048
No.

00:48:23.048 --> 00:48:25.740
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.840
ADAM GRANT: I was working
on that all night.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.205
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:48:29.205 --> 00:48:29.680
ADAM GRANT: No.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.260
I think that it's a really
interesting question.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.010
As an organizational
psychologist rather than a

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:36.700
developmental psychologist, it
really stretches far beyond my

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.310
areas of expertise.

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.530
So I'm more of a consumer
in this area

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:40.780
than I think a producer.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.030
But I've had a lot of fun
reading some of the research

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:45.860
on what causes some people
to grow into givers.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.570
And I'll just highlight
a couple of patterns.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.570
I'm happy to share more details
if anybody wants to

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.890
read the studies.

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.490
One is parenting styles
are obviously huge.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.030
If you are a role model as a
parent as a giver, obviously

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:57.890
your children are more likely
to follow suit.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:01.430
Also, there's some really cool
data showing that parents who

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:04.360
end up basically giving their
children a lot of freedom are

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.070
more likely to encourage their
children to become givers.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.050
Whereas those who restrict
freedom then essentially raise

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:12.320
kids who want to restrict the
freedom of the other people

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.680
around them, which is sort of,
I think, a little bit more of

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.140
a taker move.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.470
The other really interesting
data

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.820
point on this is siblings.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.430
So this is Paul van
Lange's research.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.470
What Paul shows is that a lot
of people think first borns

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:26.840
are more likely to be givers
because you get a lot of

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.050
responsibility training if you
have younger siblings.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:32.010
You have to share and care
and feed and babysit.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:35.140
And it's actually the opposite
in a weird sense, which is

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.720
just don't be the last born.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.700
As long as you have at least one
younger sibling, and then

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.030
the more of them you have, the
more of this responsibility

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:44.120
training you get and the more
you tend to gravitate in the

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.280
giver direction.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.320
One other sibling pattern that
I think is really interesting

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.050
is van Lange shows that people
who do a lot of generous

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.340
giving are twice as likely to
have sisters as brothers.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.930
And you could ask, well, back
to Tina's question, why do

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:58.490
sisters turn us into givers?

00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:59.740
And there's a debate
about that.

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.300
I don't want to speculate
too far.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:04.160
But two of the popular
explanations are one, women

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.070
basically earlier on start
giving, and so that rubs off

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.140
on their siblings.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.760
And then two, there's
some data--

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.010
Jonathan Haidt argues that
girl babies are literally

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.140
cuter than boy babies, and so
they attract more empathy and

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.360
then people want to help them
more, and then they

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.300
get into the habit.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.720
Again, this is going very
far beyond data.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.390
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:23.930
ADAM GRANT: We have one more
question, and then I have two

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:25.200
things I want to
say to wrap up.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was wondering
if you had looked at

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.700
how the proportion of givers
and takers can affect the

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.720
effectiveness of an entire
organization.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.990
Because one of the things that
I've found since I joined

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:39.300
Google is part of the strengths
is that everyone on

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.070
average is much more
helpful than they

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:42.030
are in other companies.

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.410
ADAM GRANT: Yes.

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:45.930
AUDIENCE: And I think that
really makes the organization

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:47.930
much better, and even
the products that we

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:49.070
produce much better.

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.860
ADAM GRANT: Yeah,
I totally agree.

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.320
I'm probably preaching
to the choir on this.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.860
So I wrote a little article
that's in "McKinsey Quarterly"

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.570
this month that summarizes
some of the evidence.

00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:59.360
Probably the most powerful
data point is Nathan

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.990
Podsakoff's meta analysis of
organizational citizenship

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:05.145
behaviors looking at when more
employees do a lot of helping

00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:07.800
and giving behaviors, what
happens to entire business

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.140
units or organizations?

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.340
And showing that you can just
take the frequency of helping

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.530
between employees on sort of a
daily basis and use that to

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:18.950
predict with surprising power
organizational profits,

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:20.470
efficiency metrics, customer

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:22.490
satisfaction, employee retention.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.390
And I think that this is
actually a big part of

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:25.410
Google's success.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:28.820
As an outsider, I've just been
amazed by the number of people

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.110
who are already givers who come
here, and also the giving

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:32.740
norms that people get
socialized to

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:33.950
right off the bat.

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:36.320
And I think that may be very
well one of the secrets to

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.720
this company's success.

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.710
So on that note, I want
to say two things.

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:41.030
First of all, thank you
so much for having me.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.530
It's always a real delight and
honor to have the chance to

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.800
speak to Googlers.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.030
Because some of you already know
this, but if I knew that

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.610
a company like this existed I
probably never would have gone

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:50.340
into academia.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.530
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.120
ADAM GRANT: And it's just
really, really exciting to

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.320
work with a company that not
only has a lot of employees

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.890
that are givers, but also has
a mission that's so much

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:02.430
about-- well, at least
not taking, right?

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:06.110
If you talk about sort of
the no evil policy.

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.740
But also the genuine idea of
actually democratizing

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.050
information and making it
available to other people.

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:12.930
It's something that I feel
really passionately about, and

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.890
I feel lucky to have the chance
to work with you all.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:17.280
Second thing I wanted to do is
I think that a lot of people

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.450
have a hard time recognizing
successful givers.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:22.160
Because even in an organization
with a lot of

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.720
givers, the takers are
the ones who are

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.910
sort of in the spotlight.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:26.740
And the givers are usually
comfortable sort of hanging

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:27.950
out in the shadows.

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:30.470
And I wanted to try to solve
that problem in two ways.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:33.220
One is we have some postcards
that you can hand out to

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.470
anybody that you think has been
a giver, to recognize

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:36.360
them for that.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.470
Originally they said, "Thank
you for being a giver," and

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:40.280
some people said, oh, that's
kind of cheesy.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.990
Especially men said that.

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:43.110
And so we changed it.

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:45.270
They say, "Congratulations,
you're not a taker."

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:47.360
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.820
ADAM GRANT: So you can
pass those around.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.660
There are more to download on
the "Give and Take" website if

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:52.740
you want them.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.780
The last thing I wanted to do
is just thank some of the

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:58.740
amazing givers who have helped
me a ton with this research

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.300
since a lot of you
are in the room.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.070
If I can ask you to stand up
so that we can applaud you.

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:05.200
First of all, the Google People
Analytics folks who are

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.570
here, please stand.

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:15.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:18.010
ADAM GRANT: So much of the
research in the book and the

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:20.140
ideas in it were shaped by the
work that we've done together,

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.140
and in particular Prasad
and Catherine have been

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:24.220
extraordinarily helpful.

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.652
Secondly, former students.

00:53:26.652 --> 00:53:32.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.240
ADAM GRANT: In particular, I
want to thank Jackie and Jeff

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.780
from the Impact Lab
who actually did

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.780
a lot of this research.

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:41.120
And Jackie for telling me that I
should write a book, which I

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.530
wouldn't have done had she not
encouraged me to do it.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.504
And then finally,
Amy Reznesky.

00:53:46.504 --> 00:53:52.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.550
ADAM GRANT: I know a lot of you
know Amy already, but she

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:56.220
is the ultimate role
model when it

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.240
comes to being a giver.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.300
As a professor, I have learned a
ton from her, and every idea

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.910
in the book was already modeled
by her long before I

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.160
had a chance to study it.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.110
And I feel incredibly
fortunate to

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:07.120
have her as a colleague.

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.905
And she's going to turn really
red, but if you will all thank

00:54:10.905 --> 00:54:12.470
her again for me.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:16.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:17.390
ADAM GRANT: Thank you.

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:18.640
You're free to go.
