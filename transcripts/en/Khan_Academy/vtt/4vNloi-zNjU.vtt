00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.550
We are asked to plot 8 comma 10.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.910
So the first number in
this ordered pair, this

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.960
is our x-coordinate.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.700
This tells us how far do
we move in the x direction.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.180
It's a positive 8, so we
move 8 in the x direction.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.760
And then the second number
in our ordered pair is 10.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.060
That is our y-coordinate.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.390
That tells us how far we
move in the y direction.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.830
Since it's positive,
we move up 10.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.112
So we move up 10, all
the way over here.

00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:32.070
And you could have thought
about it either way.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.403
You could have said, hey,
look this is our y-coordinate.

00:00:34.403 --> 00:00:35.510
This is 10.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.940
So I could move up 10.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.920
And then my x-coordinate
is positive 8.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.760
So I'll move 8 along
the positive x-axis,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.820
or I'll move 8 to the right.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.970
You see right over
here I have moved 8

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.210
to the right-- 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.620
And I have moved 10 up-- 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.300
You might be tempted to
move 8 up and then 10

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.110
to the right, which
would put you there.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.430
But then you would have had
the two numbers mixed up.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.410
You would have had the x and
the y-coordinates mixed up.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.070
The 8 tells you how far to move
in the horizontal direction.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.350
The 10 tells you how far to
move in the vertical direction.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.810
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.240
Plot 6 comma 10.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.230
Well once again, the first
number in the ordered pair

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.800
is the x-coordinate, how far
we move in the x direction.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.270
So we move 6 to the right.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.750
And then the second
number, the 10,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.550
tells us our vertical
coordinate, our y-coordinate.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.970
So it's positive 10.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.880
So we move 10 up.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.070
Let's do one more-- 5 comma 7.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.020
So my horizontal coordinate is
5, so I move 5 to the right.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.930
And then my vertical one is
7, or my y-coordinate is 7.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.045
So I move 7 up-- 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:00.170
And as long as you remember
which one is horizontal

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.586
and which one is vertical or
which one is the x-coordinate

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:04.650
and which one is the
y, you should be fine.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.310
You could say, hey look,
this is my y-coordinate, 7.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.139
So I'm going to move 7 up.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.270
And my x-coordinate is 5, so I'm
going to move 5 to the right.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.320
And it will get you to
that exact same point.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.940
This specifies exactly one
point in the coordinate plane.
