00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.690
As we discussed in the last lesson, one

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.850
of the first challenges of developing for mobile

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.109
devices is the screen. As mobile developers, we

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.740
need to design pages that can adapt across various

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.570
screen sizes and scenarios. This lesson will prepare

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.630
you for building fluid layouts, designs that can adapt

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.590
across different screen sizes. And hopefully we'll break

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.860
the bad habits of designing to the fixed page.
