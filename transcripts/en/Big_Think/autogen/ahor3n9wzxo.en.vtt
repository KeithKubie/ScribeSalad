you

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960
 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.040
this was in the year nineteen

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.050
this was in the year nineteen
 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.090
this was in the year nineteen
fifty-seven when the Russians sent up

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100
fifty-seven when the Russians sent up
 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.750
fifty-seven when the Russians sent up
the first satellite which they called

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760
the first satellite which they called
 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.749
the first satellite which they called
Sputnik which means companion it was a

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759
Sputnik which means companion it was a
 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.499
Sputnik which means companion it was a
companion for the earth so this but Nick

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509
companion for the earth so this but Nick
 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.100
companion for the earth so this but Nick
was up there in space and it was making

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110
was up there in space and it was making
 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.290
was up there in space and it was making
everybody nervous because if the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300
everybody nervous because if the
 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.910
everybody nervous because if the
Russians could send satellites into

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920
Russians could send satellites into
 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.940
Russians could send satellites into
space they could also throw missiles at

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950
space they could also throw missiles at
 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.910
space they could also throw missiles at
us and we at that time didn't have any

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920
us and we at that time didn't have any
 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.580
us and we at that time didn't have any
missiles which we can throw at them so

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590
missiles which we can throw at them so
 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.270
missiles which we can throw at them so
it was a scary moment and so it was a

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280
it was a scary moment and so it was a
 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.189
it was a scary moment and so it was a
moment when you could get money very

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199
moment when you could get money very
 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.630
moment when you could get money very
easily for crazy projects and so my

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640
easily for crazy projects and so my
 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.410
easily for crazy projects and so my
friend Ted Taylor who was a young

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420
friend Ted Taylor who was a young
 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.549
friend Ted Taylor who was a young
physicist to actually younger than me he

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559
physicist to actually younger than me he
 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.120
physicist to actually younger than me he
had this idea of building a spaceship

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130
had this idea of building a spaceship
 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.540
had this idea of building a spaceship
with nuclear bombs which sounds crazy

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550
with nuclear bombs which sounds crazy
 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.260
with nuclear bombs which sounds crazy
and in a certain way it is crazy but it

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270
and in a certain way it is crazy but it
 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.999
and in a certain way it is crazy but it
could have actually it could have worked

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009
could have actually it could have worked
 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.899
could have actually it could have worked
and so I thought that would be exciting

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909
and so I thought that would be exciting
 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.050
and so I thought that would be exciting
to do I have no done anything like that

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060
to do I have no done anything like that
 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.789
to do I have no done anything like that
I'd been always just a mathematician and

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799
I'd been always just a mathematician and
 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.580
I'd been always just a mathematician and
working on paper but so that gave me a

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590
working on paper but so that gave me a
 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.270
working on paper but so that gave me a
chance to do something real so I moved

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280
chance to do something real so I moved
 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.510
chance to do something real so I moved
to San Diego in California and joined

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520
to San Diego in California and joined
 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.870
to San Diego in California and joined
the company called general atomic which

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880
the company called general atomic which
 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.249
the company called general atomic which
is still there and went to work on the

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259
is still there and went to work on the
 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.060
is still there and went to work on the
spaceship and it looked so we might even

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070
spaceship and it looked so we might even
 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.190
spaceship and it looked so we might even
get the green light actually to go ahead

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200
get the green light actually to go ahead
 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.249
get the green light actually to go ahead
and build it but in the end of course we

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259
and build it but in the end of course we
 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.010
and build it but in the end of course we
didn't the fatal flaw of that whole

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020
didn't the fatal flaw of that whole
 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.580
didn't the fatal flaw of that whole
scheme is that it spreads radioactivity

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590
scheme is that it spreads radioactivity
 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.090
scheme is that it spreads radioactivity
all around you're exploding bombs in big

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100
all around you're exploding bombs in big
 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.240
all around you're exploding bombs in big
numbers so you really do make a

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250
numbers so you really do make a
 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.800
numbers so you really do make a
tremendous mess and so in the end common

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810
tremendous mess and so in the end common
 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.160
tremendous mess and so in the end common
sense prevailed and they decided to go

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170
sense prevailed and they decided to go
 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.260
sense prevailed and they decided to go
ahead with ordinary rockets not with

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270
ahead with ordinary rockets not with
 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.690
ahead with ordinary rockets not with
nuclear bombs but

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
nuclear bombs but
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.880
nuclear bombs but
we had a great time we studied the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890
we had a great time we studied the
 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.380
we had a great time we studied the
theory of this and the engineering we

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
theory of this and the engineering we
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.570
theory of this and the engineering we
had a lot of good engineers and we

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580
had a lot of good engineers and we
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.500
had a lot of good engineers and we
actually did little tests of chemical

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
actually did little tests of chemical
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.390
actually did little tests of chemical
explosives building little model plane

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400
explosives building little model plane
 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.540
explosives building little model plane
little model spacecraft which would go

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550
little model spacecraft which would go
 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.150
little model spacecraft which would go
pop pop pop pop just up in the sky and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160
pop pop pop pop just up in the sky and
 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.440
pop pop pop pop just up in the sky and
come down again and just to show that we

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450
come down again and just to show that we
 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.530
come down again and just to show that we
knew how to do it so we had every

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
knew how to do it so we had every
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.259
knew how to do it so we had every
Saturday morning way we didn't get paid

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269
Saturday morning way we didn't get paid
 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.530
Saturday morning way we didn't get paid
for that but every Saturday morning we'd

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540
for that but every Saturday morning we'd
 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.979
for that but every Saturday morning we'd
go and fly our little models the rest of

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989
go and fly our little models the rest of
 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.660
go and fly our little models the rest of
the week we'd do the serious stuff so I

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
the week we'd do the serious stuff so I
 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.509
the week we'd do the serious stuff so I
spent a year and a half there and the

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519
spent a year and a half there and the
 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.750
spent a year and a half there and the
project actually lasted for seven years

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760
project actually lasted for seven years
 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.960
project actually lasted for seven years
but by the end of the first year it was

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970
but by the end of the first year it was
 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.770
but by the end of the first year it was
pretty clear that it wasn't going to fly

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780
 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.430
if it had been given the green light we

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440
if it had been given the green light we
 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.250
if it had been given the green light we
could have gone to Mars in about five

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260
could have gone to Mars in about five
 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.320
could have gone to Mars in about five
years I mean the thing started in 58 and

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330
years I mean the thing started in 58 and
 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.110
years I mean the thing started in 58 and
we planned to have a Mars mission

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120
we planned to have a Mars mission
 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.620
we planned to have a Mars mission
already after within five years and we

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630
already after within five years and we
 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.510
already after within five years and we
be scooting all around the solar system

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520
be scooting all around the solar system
 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.800
be scooting all around the solar system
it was a very very high performance ship

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810
it was a very very high performance ship
 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.360
it was a very very high performance ship
far better than anything we have today

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370
far better than anything we have today
 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.680
far better than anything we have today
and it would have easily gone to Mars

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690
and it would have easily gone to Mars
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.290
and it would have easily gone to Mars
and back and to Jupiter and the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300
and back and to Jupiter and the
 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.479
and back and to Jupiter and the
satellites of Saturn and all the

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489
satellites of Saturn and all the
 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.509
satellites of Saturn and all the
interesting places in the solar system

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519
interesting places in the solar system
 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.070
interesting places in the solar system
we could have gone scooting around and

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080
we could have gone scooting around and
 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.800
we could have gone scooting around and
of course we intended to go ourselves

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810
of course we intended to go ourselves
 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.229
of course we intended to go ourselves
this was a big ship and it was with a

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239
this was a big ship and it was with a
 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.290
this was a big ship and it was with a
crew we imagined we would have a crew of

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300
crew we imagined we would have a crew of
 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.990
crew we imagined we would have a crew of
about 40 people so it was on the grand

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000
about 40 people so it was on the grand
 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.050
about 40 people so it was on the grand
scale and it would have been

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060
scale and it would have been
 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.390
scale and it would have been
comparatively cheap because it it was

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400
comparatively cheap because it it was
 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.219
comparatively cheap because it it was
built like a submarine not like an

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229
built like a submarine not like an
 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.570
built like a submarine not like an
airplane was a heavy engineering and and

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580
airplane was a heavy engineering and and
 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.690
airplane was a heavy engineering and and
so a lot cheaper than aerospace

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700
 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.670
well the joke is of course that we do

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680
well the joke is of course that we do
 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.970
well the joke is of course that we do
such marvelous missions now with small

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980
such marvelous missions now with small
 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.320
such marvelous missions now with small
payloads when we worked on Orion we were

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330
payloads when we worked on Orion we were
 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.660
payloads when we worked on Orion we were
talking about a thousand tons of payload

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670
talking about a thousand tons of payload
 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.720
talking about a thousand tons of payload
just for one ship and so we thought of

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730
just for one ship and so we thought of
 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.880
just for one ship and so we thought of
ourselves sort of like like the Darwin

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890
ourselves sort of like like the Darwin
 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.910
ourselves sort of like like the Darwin
on the Beagle going out for five years

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920
on the Beagle going out for five years
 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.670
on the Beagle going out for five years
and with all our provisions and having

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680
and with all our provisions and having
 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.980
and with all our provisions and having
taken longer squash courts earth so that

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990
taken longer squash courts earth so that
 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.430
taken longer squash courts earth so that
you could stay fit and we could take a

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440
you could stay fit and we could take a
 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.790
you could stay fit and we could take a
law all most anything you wanted and of

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800
law all most anything you wanted and of
 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.870
law all most anything you wanted and of
course nowadays the whole way of

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880
course nowadays the whole way of
 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.550
course nowadays the whole way of
operating in space is so totally

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560
operating in space is so totally
 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.340
operating in space is so totally
different now you measure the payloads

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350
different now you measure the payloads
 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.410
different now you measure the payloads
in pounds not in tons and so we have a

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420
in pounds not in tons and so we have a
 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.220
in pounds not in tons and so we have a
ship which is now orbiting around Saturn

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230
ship which is now orbiting around Saturn
 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.740
ship which is now orbiting around Saturn
called cassini which of course doesn't

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750
called cassini which of course doesn't
 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.600
called cassini which of course doesn't
have people on board it has wonderful

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610
have people on board it has wonderful
 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.450
have people on board it has wonderful
instruments on board and that the the

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460
instruments on board and that the the
 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.060
instruments on board and that the the
total payload of that thing is a few

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070
total payload of that thing is a few
 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.850
total payload of that thing is a few
thousand pounds and it's doing far more

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860
thousand pounds and it's doing far more
 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.480
thousand pounds and it's doing far more
exploring them we could have done so if

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490
exploring them we could have done so if
 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.000
exploring them we could have done so if
we had a thousand tons of payload today

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010
we had a thousand tons of payload today
 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.959
we had a thousand tons of payload today
we wouldn't know what to do with it

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:45.969
 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.979
oh yes I think so but of course my guess

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:49.989
oh yes I think so but of course my guess
 

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:53.299
oh yes I think so but of course my guess
is no better than anybody else's but

00:05:53.299 --> 00:05:53.309
is no better than anybody else's but
 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:56.459
is no better than anybody else's but
technically it could be done of course

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469
technically it could be done of course
 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.709
technically it could be done of course
it's much too expensive just for the

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719
it's much too expensive just for the
 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.449
it's much too expensive just for the
next hundred years or maybe the next

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:00.459
next hundred years or maybe the next
 

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:03.209
next hundred years or maybe the next
thousand years but we have lots and lots

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219
thousand years but we have lots and lots
 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.629
thousand years but we have lots and lots
of time so I would imagine that we will

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639
of time so I would imagine that we will
 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.819
of time so I would imagine that we will
be scooting around on a much grander

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:08.829
be scooting around on a much grander
 

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:12.419
be scooting around on a much grander
scale but but it could on the other hand

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:12.429
scale but but it could on the other hand
 

00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:15.269
scale but but it could on the other hand
we could decide we're not interested so

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:15.279
we could decide we're not interested so
 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.269
we could decide we're not interested so
let's let's not do it and that remains

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279
let's let's not do it and that remains
 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.909
let's let's not do it and that remains
to be seen
