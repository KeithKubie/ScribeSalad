if you remember here is what it looks

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
if you remember here is what it looks
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.319
if you remember here is what it looks
like in 2015 and is 2018 now so things

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
like in 2015 and is 2018 now so things
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.690
like in 2015 and is 2018 now so things
have progressed quite fast and we got a

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700
have progressed quite fast and we got a
 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.040
have progressed quite fast and we got a
newer emulator with a newer look so if

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
newer emulator with a newer look so if
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.860
newer emulator with a newer look so if
you look at the details there are few

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870
you look at the details there are few
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.520

differences you might have noticed

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530
differences you might have noticed
 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.470
differences you might have noticed
firstly there is a frameless skin

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480
firstly there is a frameless skin
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.770
firstly there is a frameless skin
suppose in the 2018 emulator which

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
suppose in the 2018 emulator which
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720
suppose in the 2018 emulator which
doesn't have the window frame for you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
doesn't have the window frame for you
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.539
doesn't have the window frame for you
and gives you a better newer experience

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
and gives you a better newer experience
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.640
and gives you a better newer experience
and secondly you might have noticed that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
and secondly you might have noticed that
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.969
and secondly you might have noticed that

Part IV to the CPU acceleration if you
don't have a hypervisor

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
don't have a hypervisor
 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.520
don't have a hypervisor
you can still run the emulator but

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
you can still run the emulator but
 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.399
you can still run the emulator but
everything will go pretty slow and the

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409
everything will go pretty slow and the
 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:03.559
everything will go pretty slow and the
emulator becomes super sluggish so in

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569
emulator becomes super sluggish so in
 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.580
emulator becomes super sluggish so in
2015

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.559
2015
here is the list of the high process

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
here is the list of the high process
 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.479
here is the list of the high process
resupport on English we have a VM and on

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489
resupport on English we have a VM and on
 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.540
resupport on English we have a VM and on
Windows and Mac we support hexam with

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550
Windows and Mac we support hexam with
 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.160
Windows and Mac we support hexam with
Intel CPU so unfortunately back in the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
Intel CPU so unfortunately back in the
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.850
Intel CPU so unfortunately back in the
days if you are using an AMD CPU on

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860
days if you are using an AMD CPU on
 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.850
days if you are using an AMD CPU on
Windows machine we have no support for

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860
Windows machine we have no support for
 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.430
Windows machine we have no support for
this combination so we got a lot of

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440
this combination so we got a lot of
 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.130
this combination so we got a lot of
requests from AMD users to a support

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
requests from AMD users to a support
 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.229
requests from AMD users to a support
program

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239
program
 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.100
program
so these 2018 now things progress pretty

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110
so these 2018 now things progress pretty
 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.309
so these 2018 now things progress pretty
fast and obviously we have new

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319
fast and obviously we have new
 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.649
fast and obviously we have new
hypothesis of course so firstly we

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659
hypothesis of course so firstly we
 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.869
hypothesis of course so firstly we
suppose a newer version of Hexham have

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879
suppose a newer version of Hexham have
 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.899
suppose a newer version of Hexham have
some servant of virtue which is stable

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909
some servant of virtue which is stable
 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.030
some servant of virtue which is stable
than the previous version and he also

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040
than the previous version and he also
 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.390
than the previous version and he also
gives you better performance then the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400
gives you better performance then the
 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.420
gives you better performance then the
added hybrid hybrid framework support

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430
added hybrid hybrid framework support
 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.789
added hybrid hybrid framework support
for Mac users which in most situation is

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799
for Mac users which in most situation is
 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.820
for Mac users which in most situation is
faster than the hexan on Mac and at last

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830
faster than the hexan on Mac and at last
 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.130
faster than the hexan on Mac and at last
we support hypervisor framework also

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140
we support hypervisor framework also
 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.520
we support hypervisor framework also
known as hyperbole on Windows which can

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530
known as hyperbole on Windows which can
 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.550
known as hyperbole on Windows which can
emulate an AMD so so finally the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560
emulate an AMD so so finally the
 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.920
emulate an AMD so so finally the
combination of AMD and Windows is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930
combination of AMD and Windows is
 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.770
combination of AMD and Windows is
supported and yeah this also gives

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780
supported and yeah this also gives
 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.670
supported and yeah this also gives
docker support alright so if you

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680
docker support alright so if you
 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.760
docker support alright so if you
use the high-pressure performance the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770
use the high-pressure performance the
 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.090
use the high-pressure performance the
next thing we want to go into will be

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100
next thing we want to go into will be
 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.650
next thing we want to go into will be
the ATP performance so a little bit

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660
the ATP performance so a little bit
 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.260
the ATP performance so a little bit

physical devices and you can see what
the first thing was that if you are

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139
the first thing was that if you are
 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.770
the first thing was that if you are
using a USB cable and you're pushing the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780
using a USB cable and you're pushing the
 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.110
using a USB cable and you're pushing the
Google Photos app it takes you

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120
Google Photos app it takes you
 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.279
Google Photos app it takes you
approximately eight seconds if you're

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289
approximately eight seconds if you're
 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.089
approximately eight seconds if you're
using a USB cable yes these three table

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099
using a USB cable yes these three table
 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.150
using a USB cable yes these three table
things goes a lot faster and we take you

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160
things goes a lot faster and we take you
 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.180
things goes a lot faster and we take you
approximately four seconds so you can

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190
approximately four seconds so you can
 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.550
approximately four seconds so you can
observe similar phenomena when pushing

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560
observe similar phenomena when pushing
 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.140
observe similar phenomena when pushing
different apps like the Google Santa

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150
different apps like the Google Santa
 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.460

physical device so her about the

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409
physical device so her about the
 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.420
physical device so her about the
performance on the emulator so here is a

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430
performance on the emulator so here is a
 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.499
performance on the emulator so here is a
chart if you do a push on emulator the

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509
chart if you do a push on emulator the
 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.980

Google Photos app takes approximately

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990
Google Photos app takes approximately
 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.499
Google Photos app takes approximately
0.5 seconds which is a lot faster than

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509
0.5 seconds which is a lot faster than
 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:08.240
0.5 seconds which is a lot faster than
USB 2 or USB 3 and this other chance on

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250
USB 2 or USB 3 and this other chance on
 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.140
USB 2 or USB 3 and this other chance on
an android audio device and it turns out

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150
an android audio device and it turns out
 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.589
an android audio device and it turns out
that the OS version matters a lot as

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599
that the OS version matters a lot as
 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:18.649
that the OS version matters a lot as
well when you are doing the approach so

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659

used to this workflow where they're
inside studio and they want to deploy

inside studio and they want to deploy
 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.399
inside studio and they want to deploy
their app and they need to wait for the

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:34.409
their app and they need to wait for the
 

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:37.760
their app and they need to wait for the
emulator to boot up again so we try to

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770
emulator to boot up again so we try to
 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.980
emulator to boot up again so we try to
address this in 2017 and in 2018 the

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:42.990
address this in 2017 and in 2018 the
 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.719
address this in 2017 and in 2018 the
first way we try to address this is

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:44.729
first way we try to address this is
 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:47.990
first way we try to address this is
through snapshots we call this quick

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000
through snapshots we call this quick
 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.339
through snapshots we call this quick
boot with quick boot the device state is

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:52.349
boot with quick boot the device state is
 

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:54.709
boot with quick boot the device state is
completely saved when you take a

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:54.719
completely saved when you take a
 

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:56.959
completely saved when you take a
snapshot and when you take a snapshot

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:56.969
snapshot and when you take a snapshot
 

00:07:56.969 --> 00:07:59.059
snapshot and when you take a snapshot
when you exit the emulator and you

00:07:59.059 --> 00:07:59.069
when you exit the emulator and you
 

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:02.059
when you exit the emulator and you
resume from that snapshot when you start

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:02.069
resume from that snapshot when you start
 

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:04.969
resume from that snapshot when you start
the emulator again so in a sense it's

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979
the emulator again so in a sense it's
 

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:07.850
the emulator again so in a sense it's
kind of like sleeping and resuming a

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860
kind of like sleeping and resuming a
 

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.459
kind of like sleeping and resuming a
real device and we've also made

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:10.469
real device and we've also made
 

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:12.709
real device and we've also made
improvements in recent emulator Canary

00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:12.719
improvements in recent emulator Canary

we're going to be using quick boot with

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:26.849
we're going to be using quick boot with
 

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.140
we're going to be using quick boot with
that and the second one is called API 28

it starts out with a black screen it

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.310
it starts out with a black screen it
 

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.410
it starts out with a black screen it
takes a while to show the Google logo

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:47.420
takes a while to show the Google logo

you'll notice that law cat has already
started up and we can interact with it

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.490
started up and we can interact with it
 

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.319
started up and we can interact with it
immediately just as the cold boot

00:09:01.319 --> 00:09:01.329
immediately just as the cold boot

emulator has just started up alright so

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480
emulator has just started up alright so
 

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.480
emulator has just started up alright so
just gonna get rid of the cold boot

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:06.490
just gonna get rid of the cold boot
 

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.419
just gonna get rid of the cold boot
annually for now and move on to the next

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:09.429
annually for now and move on to the next

part a demo so in addition a quick boot

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040
part a demo so in addition a quick boot
 

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.650
part a demo so in addition a quick boot
in July of 2018 we've extended a

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:16.660
in July of 2018 we've extended a
 

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.989
in July of 2018 we've extended a
snapshots feature to be more general

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:18.999
snapshots feature to be more general
 

00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:21.449
snapshots feature to be more general
so with quick boot you can only have one

00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:21.459
so with quick boot you can only have one
 

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:23.939
so with quick boot you can only have one
snapshot being saved and loaded at any

00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:23.949
snapshot being saved and loaded at any
 

00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:26.129
snapshot being saved and loaded at any
one time and that can be useful but

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:26.139
one time and that can be useful but
 

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:28.350
one time and that can be useful but
maybe sometimes you want to test

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360
maybe sometimes you want to test
 

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.269
maybe sometimes you want to test
different device configurations

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279
different device configurations

before now you didn't really have a good
 

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:41.220
before now you didn't really have a good
way to do that but in the latest

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:41.230
way to do that but in the latest
 

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.960
way to do that but in the latest

and then run your test in a reset the
 

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:56.330
and then run your test in a reset the
device state again to that end we've

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:56.340
device state again to that end we've
 

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.660

the current device state all the time so

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:12.150
the current device state all the time so
 

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.000
the current device state all the time so
right now we're on the second we're at

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.010
right now we're on the second we're at
 

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.760
right now we're on the second we're at
40 seconds and so the first time you run

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:16.770
40 seconds and so the first time you run
 

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.820
40 seconds and so the first time you run
this it'll save it around then but the

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:19.830
this it'll save it around then but the
 

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.280
this it'll save it around then but the
next time you run it it will very

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:22.290
next time you run it it will very
 

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.460
next time you run it it will very
quickly rewind there so this happens

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:25.470
quickly rewind there so this happens
 

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.060
quickly rewind there so this happens
quite quickly because all the rest of

quite quickly because all the rest of
 

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.470
quite quickly because all the rest of
the end of your UI and all that has

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480
the end of your UI and all that has
 

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.250
the end of your UI and all that has
already been set up

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260

rewinding very quickly and you can be in
 

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.470
rewinding very quickly and you can be in
any state of the device and just keep

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480
any state of the device and just keep
 

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.120
any state of the device and just keep
going back to that one state very

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.130
going back to that one state very
 

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:49.250

it in this you entered no snapshot save
 

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.490
it in this you entered no snapshot save
on the command line and all of the

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500
on the command line and all of the
 

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.230
on the command line and all of the
changes to the snapshot will be

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240
changes to the snapshot will be
 

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.590

thing you can add no snapshot to the
 

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.049
thing you can add no snapshot to the
command line and that will bring the

00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059
command line and that will bring the
 

00:22:15.059 --> 00:22:18.610
command line and that will bring the
emulator back to the way it was before

screens it isn't the extended controls

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:27.370
screens it isn't the extended controls
 

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.600
screens it isn't the extended controls
under the screen record tab so in a

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:30.610
under the screen record tab so in a
 

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.190
under the screen record tab so in a
screen record it starts out with a

once you're done recording you don't

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:46.300
once you're done recording you don't
 

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.790
once you're done recording you don't
have to save it to a file you can

what we just did go to reasons like the

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.070
what we just did go to reasons like the
 

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.030
what we just did go to reasons like the
way the apps go back to the home screen

00:26:59.030 --> 00:26:59.040
way the apps go back to the home screen
 

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.310
way the apps go back to the home screen
but you can still save it in wherever

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320
but you can still save it in wherever
 

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.740
but you can still save it in wherever
you want so let's just save this as demo

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:04.750
you want so let's just save this as demo
 

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:11.520
you want so let's just save this as demo
to you and that similarly works in the

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:11.530
to you and that similarly works in the
 

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:17.610
to you and that similarly works in the
browser okay so that's one of the

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:17.620
browser okay so that's one of the
 

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.640
browser okay so that's one of the
features that we've added in 2017 and

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:20.650
features that we've added in 2017 and
 

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:24.330

we've been doing a lot of work on and
 

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.160
we've been doing a lot of work on and
it's pretty exciting is a our core

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:35.170
it's pretty exciting is a our core
 

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.000
it's pretty exciting is a our core
support now a our core support consists

of a few main components the first one
 

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.100
of a few main components the first one
that you may have seen already is the

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.110
that you may have seen already is the
 

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.950

apps so I'll demonstrate a few of them

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:00.580
apps so I'll demonstrate a few of them
 

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.340
apps so I'll demonstrate a few of them
here in the background in Android studio

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:05.350
here in the background in Android studio

I've opened the augmented image they are

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:09.100
I've opened the augmented image they are
 

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.300
I've opened the augmented image they are
core sample this is available in scene

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:12.310
core sample this is available in scene
 

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:19.260

form Android SDK from github and what AR

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:19.270
form Android SDK from github and what AR
 

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.930

core provides in it it's not just for

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:21.940
core provides in it it's not just for
 

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.160
core provides in it it's not just for
the emulator but there's also

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.170
the emulator but there's also
 

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:26.490
the emulator but there's also
integrations in studio as well so for

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:26.500
integrations in studio as well so for
 

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.740
integrations in studio as well so for
example there's this scene form plug-in

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:31.750
example there's this scene form plug-in
 

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.320
example there's this scene form plug-in
for Android studio where we can view

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:34.330
for Android studio where we can view
 

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:36.990
for Android studio where we can view
models that are met for use in aerocorp

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000
models that are met for use in aerocorp
 

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.980
models that are met for use in aerocorp
apps in addition we can change all the

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:40.990
apps in addition we can change all the
 

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.170
apps in addition we can change all the
material properties we want directly in

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:43.180
material properties we want directly in
 

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.380
material properties we want directly in
studio so this is the lower-left frame

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:46.390
studio so this is the lower-left frame
 

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:51.990
studio so this is the lower-left frame
and I might just say lower the red tint

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000
and I might just say lower the red tint
 

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.950
and I might just say lower the red tint
of a bit okay I guess that didn't really

00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960
of a bit okay I guess that didn't really
 

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.270
of a bit okay I guess that didn't really
changed a color very much

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:00.280
changed a color very much
 

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.710
changed a color very much
so I'm gonna change blue to zero as well

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720
so I'm gonna change blue to zero as well
 

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:09.360
so I'm gonna change blue to zero as well
so once you save these files the model

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:09.370
so once you save these files the model
 

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.820
so once you save these files the model
should get reloaded and you'll see that

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:11.830
should get reloaded and you'll see that
 

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:17.240
should get reloaded and you'll see that
it's mostly pure green now and we can

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:17.250
it's mostly pure green now and we can
 

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:20.370
it's mostly pure green now and we can
the workflow we can just edit this model

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:20.380
the workflow we can just edit this model
 

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:25.110
the workflow we can just edit this model
and deploy it to the device while we

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120
and deploy it to the device while we
 

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:34.800
and deploy it to the device while we
wait I guess right and so in this app we

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:34.810
wait I guess right and so in this app we
 

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.570
wait I guess right and so in this app we
are looking for images to recognize

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:38.580
are looking for images to recognize
 

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.070
are looking for images to recognize
another feature that we've added to the

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.080
another feature that we've added to the
 

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.230
another feature that we've added to the
emulator for AR core support is the

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.240
emulator for AR core support is the
 

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.840
emulator for AR core support is the
ability to load augmented images this is

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:45.850
ability to load augmented images this is
 

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.150
ability to load augmented images this is
in the extended controls panel under the

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:48.160
in the extended controls panel under the
 

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.510
in the extended controls panel under the
camera tab now we can choose different

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520
camera tab now we can choose different
 

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.540
camera tab now we can choose different
posters to appear inside the virtual

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:54.550
posters to appear inside the virtual
 

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:58.080
posters to appear inside the virtual
scene and I've set this JPEG of the

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.090
scene and I've set this JPEG of the
 

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.210
scene and I've set this JPEG of the
earth to appear both on a table and the

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:00.220
earth to appear both on a table and the
 

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.840
