00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Before getting onto the proof that the one-time pad is secure,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I want to do a brief of probability.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If you feel very confident that you understand probability well,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it's fine to skip this section,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but I think for many students it will be helpful to review probability.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For some this will be new.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's not necessary to have a lot of background in probability entering this class,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but we will certainly be using it in crytography.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
To talk about probability we need to think of sets of outcomes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll use omega to represent the set of all possible outcomes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is sometimes known as a probability space.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
For a simple example, if we think about flipping a coin,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
omega is the set of the outcomes we could get.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We could get to land heads, and we'll call that H,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or we could get it to land tails, and we'll call that T.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If our probability space has a uniform distribution,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that means each outcome has equal probability.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We can write that as a probability using P as our probability function.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
P is a function that takes as its input some outcome,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and it maps that to a real number between 0 and 1.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Zero would mean that event never happens.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
One would mean that even always happens.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If we assume a fair coin with a uniform distribution,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
then the probability that we get heads is equal to 1/2,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and the probability that we get tails is also equal to 1/2.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That's how we think of mathematical coins.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We hope to have mathematical coins to use in our cryptosystems.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Real coins aren't so perfect.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Let's assume instead that there are three possible outcomes.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Now our probability space will be heads, tails, and edge.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The edge outcome does not happen frequently.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We'll make the probability distribution.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The probability of heads is 0.4999.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The probability of tails--we'll assume our coin is still fair,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that the probability of tails is equal to the probability of heads,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
which is 0.4999.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Is that enough to determine what is the probability of edge, of outcome E?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I've given you two of the probabilities.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Can you determine what is the probability of the third possible outcome,

00:02:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which is landing on the edge denoted by E.
