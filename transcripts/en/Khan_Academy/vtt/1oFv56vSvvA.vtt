00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.080
So I have two conversion
scenarios right over here.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.040
I want to convert 3
kilograms into milligrams.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.280
And I want to convert
4 tons into ounces.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.570
So this is clearly
in the metric system.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.062
And this right over here is
in the US customary system.

00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:14.520
So I encourage you
pause this video

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.977
and try to do these
conversions on your own.

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:18.560
Well, to think about
this one, we just

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.320
have to think about what
these prefixes mean.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.040
So I could rewrite
this is 3 kilograms,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.716
and we're going to convert it
into some amount of milligrams.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.110
And we've already seen that the
prefix "kilo," this literally

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.470
means 1,000.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.530
And the prefix "milli," means 1
over 1,000 or 1,000 of a gram.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.450
So let's just convert
to grams first.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.670
Let's go from
kilograms to grams.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.710
And then we can go from
grams to milligrams.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.560
So we could say
that 3 kilograms is

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:15.250
going to be equal to
3 times 1,000 grams.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.600
So this is equal to 3,000.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.720
This is literally 3,000 grams.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.230
That's one way to
interpret "kilo,"

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.650
so this gets us to 3,000 grams.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.180
Now, how to go from the
grams to the milligrams?

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.790
Well, we already
said right over here

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.560
that 1 milligram--
Let me write it here,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.660
1 milligram is equal to 1
over 1,000 or 1,000 of a gram.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.330
But another way of thinking
about this statement

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.280
is that 1 gram is equal
to 1,000 milligrams.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.530
So if we keep this in
mind, we have 3,000 grams.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.690
Each of those are going to
be equal to 1,000 milligrams.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.850
So this is equal to 3,000 grams.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.760
Each of those are equivalent
to 1,000 milligrams,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.250
so times 1,000.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.180
And this is going to give
us the number of milligrams.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.430
And what is this going to be?

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.500
1,000 thousands is a million,
so 3,000 thousands is 3 million.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.320
This is going to get us
3 million milligrams.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.070
Another way to think
about this multiplication,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.170
I've got 3 zeroes,
here 3 zeroes here,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.950
so my final product
should-- so 3 times 1 is 3,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.210
and then I should follow
that with the 6 zeroes

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.967
so I get 3 million milligrams.

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:47.550
Now let's do the
same thing over here.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.970
Let's convert this US customary
ton right over here to ounces.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.630
What we'll do first is we'll go
to pounds, and then from pounds

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.110
we can go to ounces.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:07.620
And we know that 1 ton
is equal to 2,000 pounds.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.602
So 4 tons are going to be
equal to, well each of those

00:03:12.602 --> 00:03:13.810
are going to be 2,000 pounds.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.150
So it's going to be
4 times 2,000 pounds.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.235
Which is equal to 8,000 pounds.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.610
Make sure I have
some space here.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.630
Now how many ounces are
in each of those pounds?

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.220
Well, we know that
1 pound, we know

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.660
that 1 pound is
equal to 16 ounces.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.370
So 8,000 pounds,
so this over here--

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.900
so let me write
this, 8,000 pounds.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.010
If each of those 8,000 have
16 ounces, or equivalent to 16

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.570
ounces, this is going to
be 8,000 times 16 ounces.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.530
So what is 8,000 times 16?

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:12.380
So this is going to be 8
times 16 is 80 plus 48 is 128.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:20.100
But we want to do 8,000 times,
so it's going to be 128,000.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.850
So 4 tons are a lot of ounces.
