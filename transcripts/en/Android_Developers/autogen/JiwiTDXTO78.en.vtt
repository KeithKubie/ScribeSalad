great and your audio experience directly
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.100
great and your audio experience directly
on the phone screen so you don't need

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110
on the phone screen so you don't need
 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.309

we want to preview is really a concept

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480
we want to preview is really a concept
 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.009
we want to preview is really a concept
of Android as an embedded platform built

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019
of Android as an embedded platform built
 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.400
of Android as an embedded platform built
directly into the car this is you can

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
directly into the car this is you can
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.259
directly into the car this is you can
see this outside and in the red

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269
see this outside and in the red
 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.539
see this outside and in the red
maserati's there's a preview of that

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549
maserati's there's a preview of that
 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.789
maserati's there's a preview of that
concept there and it's that common

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799
concept there and it's that common
 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.160
concept there and it's that common
effectors can actually build their

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
effectors can actually build their
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.460
effectors can actually build their
native system on top of Android and so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470
native system on top of Android and so
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.259
native system on top of Android and so
you're going to get a great experience

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269
you're going to get a great experience
 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.520
you're going to get a great experience
directly built into the car and what we

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
directly built into the car and what we
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.220
directly built into the car and what we
are super stoked to see as as you know

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230
are super stoked to see as as you know
 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.140
are super stoked to see as as you know
having built the system is finally

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
having built the system is finally
 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.720
having built the system is finally
realizing this bigger vision of Android

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730

different platforms and translating the

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769
different platforms and translating the
 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.490
different platforms and translating the
UI depending on the screen form factor

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500
UI depending on the screen form factor
 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.259
UI depending on the screen form factor
depending on the input devices that you

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269
depending on the input devices that you
 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.210
depending on the input devices that you
have and I think this is something that

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220
have and I think this is something that
 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.849
have and I think this is something that
we are super excited about and Greg is

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859
we are super excited about and Greg is

now shedding more light on why driving

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799
now shedding more light on why driving
 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.890
now shedding more light on why driving
is really so different than using

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900
is really so different than using
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.990
is really so different than using
regular phone in regular context right

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000
regular phone in regular context right
 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.080
regular phone in regular context right
so when we go when we move into new

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090
so when we go when we move into new
 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.300
so when we go when we move into new
spaces it's really important to take the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310
spaces it's really important to take the
 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.370
spaces it's really important to take the
context of the environment into account

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380
context of the environment into account
 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.740

when we look at driving today we see

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750
when we look at driving today we see
 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.690
when we look at driving today we see
that we're spending a lot of time inside

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700
that we're spending a lot of time inside
 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.569
that we're spending a lot of time inside
the car so from a fairly recent study

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579
the car so from a fairly recent study
 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.580
the car so from a fairly recent study
they found that the average person in

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590
they found that the average person in
 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.670
they found that the average person in
the u.s. spends around 45 minutes in

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680
the u.s. spends around 45 minutes in
 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.849
the u.s. spends around 45 minutes in
the car per day for those of us living

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859
the car per day for those of us living
 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.349
the car per day for those of us living
in the Bay Area it's actually probably

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359
in the Bay Area it's actually probably
 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.449
in the Bay Area it's actually probably
higher given the traffic volumes that we

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459
higher given the traffic volumes that we
 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.520
higher given the traffic volumes that we
have out here but either way that's

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530
have out here but either way that's
 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.069

somewhere on the magnitude of around 280

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079
somewhere on the magnitude of around 280
 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.219
somewhere on the magnitude of around 280
hours per year inside the car it's a lot

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229
hours per year inside the car it's a lot
 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.290
hours per year inside the car it's a lot
of time and it's a lot it's a big piece

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300
of time and it's a lot it's a big piece
 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.990
of time and it's a lot it's a big piece
of our life and what we find is that

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000
of our life and what we find is that
 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.450
of our life and what we find is that
during that time people don't want to

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460
during that time people don't want to
 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.640
during that time people don't want to
necessarily stop their digital life so

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650
necessarily stop their digital life so
 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.230
necessarily stop their digital life so
they want to still be able to be

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240
they want to still be able to be
 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.180
they want to still be able to be
entertained they want to communicate

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190
entertained they want to communicate
 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.270
entertained they want to communicate
they want to be productive and if we

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280
they want to be productive and if we
 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.610
they want to be productive and if we
can't find out if we can't figure out

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620
can't find out if we can't figure out
 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.400
can't find out if we can't figure out
the right way to convey the information

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410
the right way to convey the information
 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.249
the right way to convey the information
then it leads to problems so as an

example texting we we all know that

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349
example texting we we all know that
 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.240
example texting we we all know that
texting isn't good a studies found that

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250
texting isn't good a studies found that
 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.870
texting isn't good a studies found that

text and drive it's approximately

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560
text and drive it's approximately
 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.290
text and drive it's approximately
equivalent to driving the length of a

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300
equivalent to driving the length of a
 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.270

football field while not looking at the
 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.240
football field while not looking at the
roadway so it's not good and we know we

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250
roadway so it's not good and we know we
 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.760
roadway so it's not good and we know we
that we shouldn't do it yet we also know

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770
that we shouldn't do it yet we also know
 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.060
that we shouldn't do it yet we also know
that people are still doing so the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070
that people are still doing so the
 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.850
that people are still doing so the
question is why well one reason is that

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860
question is why well one reason is that
 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.460
question is why well one reason is that
we tend to overestimate our driving

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470
we tend to overestimate our driving
 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.200
we tend to overestimate our driving
abilities so as drivers were generally

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210
abilities so as drivers were generally
 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.890
abilities so as drivers were generally
overconfident and we we tend to try and

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900
overconfident and we we tend to try and
 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.089
overconfident and we we tend to try and
we don't understand the true dangers so

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099
we don't understand the true dangers so
 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.730
we don't understand the true dangers so
basically we were overconfident with our

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740
basically we were overconfident with our
 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.339
basically we were overconfident with our
abilities and we also underestimate the

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349
abilities and we also underestimate the
 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.920
abilities and we also underestimate the
true dangers of driving this leads to a

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930
true dangers of driving this leads to a
 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.499
true dangers of driving this leads to a
pretty bad mix because when we want to

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509
pretty bad mix because when we want to
 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.080
pretty bad mix because when we want to
engage with when we want to be

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090
engage with when we want to be
 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.820
engage with when we want to be
productive or communicate or be

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830
productive or communicate or be
 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.560
productive or communicate or be
entertained it means that we we start to

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570
 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.930
we start to engage in with our phone or

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940
we start to engage in with our phone or
 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.950
we start to engage in with our phone or
do things that we shouldn't necessarily

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960
do things that we shouldn't necessarily
 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.279
do things that we shouldn't necessarily
do and the problem is when we're driving

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289
do and the problem is when we're driving
 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.560
do and the problem is when we're driving
if we screw up if you do something

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570
if we screw up if you do something
 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.270
if we screw up if you do something
stupid you don't just put yourself at

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280
stupid you don't just put yourself at
 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.700
stupid you don't just put yourself at
risk but you put all those the others in

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710
risk but you put all those the others in
 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.140
risk but you put all those the others in
the car with you at risk and you put

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150
the car with you at risk and you put
 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.999
the car with you at risk and you put
those around you risk as well so it's

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009
those around you risk as well so it's
 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.980
those around you risk as well so it's
really critical that we figure out how

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990
really critical that we figure out how
 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.689
really critical that we figure out how
can we re-examine the technology to

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699
can we re-examine the technology to
 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.420
can we re-examine the technology to
better suit the environment didn't you

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430
better suit the environment didn't you
 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.250
better suit the environment didn't you
in fact have a statistic well you said

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260
in fact have a statistic well you said
 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.870
in fact have a statistic well you said
that the

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880
that the
 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.350
that the
of drivers think they are better than

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360
of drivers think they are better than
 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.670
of drivers think they are better than
average drivers which is actually

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680
average drivers which is actually
 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.730
average drivers which is actually
mathematically impossible yeah yeah it

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740
mathematically impossible yeah yeah it
 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.780
mathematically impossible yeah yeah it
was somewhere around i think it was

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790
was somewhere around i think it was
 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.880
was somewhere around i think it was
ninety-three percent of those sampled

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890
ninety-three percent of those sampled
 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.320
ninety-three percent of those sampled
thought they were above average drivers

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330
thought they were above average drivers
 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.570

in the West and West was published

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580
in the West and West was published
 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.400

statistic expert that realized that it

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410
statistic expert that realized that it
 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.180
statistic expert that realized that it
wasn't possible so from this point is

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190
wasn't possible so from this point is
 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.030
wasn't possible so from this point is
really really clear that the phone

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040
really really clear that the phone
 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.920
really really clear that the phone
designing for the phone is not the same

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930
designing for the phone is not the same
 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.660
designing for the phone is not the same
thing as designing for driving really

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670
thing as designing for driving really
 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.760
thing as designing for driving really
two different things i think greg has

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770
two different things i think greg has
 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.740
two different things i think greg has
made abundantly clear with the three

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750
made abundantly clear with the three
 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.360
made abundantly clear with the three
points that you just made that it's a

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370
points that you just made that it's a
 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.940
points that you just made that it's a
very different situation and this

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950
very different situation and this
 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.620
very different situation and this
different environment need to be thought

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630
different environment need to be thought
 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.200
different environment need to be thought
of as such when we start about designing

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210
of as such when we start about designing
 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.010
of as such when we start about designing

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.930
apps and services for this environment
right and one thing to note is it's not

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940
right and one thing to note is it's not
 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.820
right and one thing to note is it's not
necessarily the phone's fault right if

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830
necessarily the phone's fault right if
 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.590
necessarily the phone's fault right if
you go into a car dealership today and

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600
you go into a car dealership today and
 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.270
you go into a car dealership today and
you look at the technology that's going

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280
you look at the technology that's going
 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.650
you look at the technology that's going
inside the car it's a lot of them

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660
inside the car it's a lot of them
 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.980
inside the car it's a lot of them
resemble tablets and phones right now so

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990
resemble tablets and phones right now so
 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.690
resemble tablets and phones right now so
it's not necessarily the technology but

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700
it's not necessarily the technology but
 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.090
it's not necessarily the technology but
again it's the way that the information

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.100
again it's the way that the information
 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.310
again it's the way that the information
is constructed and ultimately conveyed

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.320
is constructed and ultimately conveyed
 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.370
is constructed and ultimately conveyed
that's the critical elements and so far

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380
that's the critical elements and so far
 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.200
that's the critical elements and so far
android auto and this is what this talk

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210
android auto and this is what this talk
 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.900
android auto and this is what this talk
is about the experience needs to be

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910
is about the experience needs to be
 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.760
is about the experience needs to be
designed specifically for driving and

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:32.770
designed specifically for driving and
 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.140
designed specifically for driving and
what this means we're going to start

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150
what this means we're going to start
 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.400
what this means we're going to start
with the next few slides so for one

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:38.410
with the next few slides so for one
 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.350
with the next few slides so for one
thing one easy way that we can think of

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360
thing one easy way that we can think of
 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.090
thing one easy way that we can think of
this is that really drive driving and

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.100
this is that really drive driving and
 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.770
this is that really drive driving and
keeping your eyes on the road is task

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:46.780
keeping your eyes on the road is task
 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.110
keeping your eyes on the road is task
number one and dealing with the phone

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120
number one and dealing with the phone
 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.140
number one and dealing with the phone
should be tossed number two and this is

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.150
should be tossed number two and this is
 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.080
should be tossed number two and this is
very different than then phones were we

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090
very different than then phones were we
 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.480
very different than then phones were we

we actually want to do it differently

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720
we actually want to do it differently
 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.160
we actually want to do it differently
because we don't want you to spend this

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.170
because we don't want you to spend this
 

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.920
because we don't want you to spend this
much time with the eyes of the road

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:06.930
much time with the eyes of the road
 

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.090
much time with the eyes of the road
right and another way to think about

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:09.100
right and another way to think about
 

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.240
right and another way to think about
this is if you substitute primary task

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.250
this is if you substitute primary task
 

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.750
this is if you substitute primary task
for driving and your secondary task is a

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:14.760
for driving and your secondary task is a
 

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.520
for driving and your secondary task is a
distraction so all other activities

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:17.530
distraction so all other activities
 

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.770
distraction so all other activities
inside the car that don't pertain to

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:19.780
inside the car that don't pertain to
 

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.460
inside the car that don't pertain to
driving are in fact distracting and we

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:23.470
driving are in fact distracting and we
 

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.610
driving are in fact distracting and we
find that people engage in distract

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620
find that people engage in distract
 

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.950
find that people engage in distract
activities quite a lot so there's a

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960
activities quite a lot so there's a
 

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.930
activities quite a lot so there's a
recent study that looked at naturalistic

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:29.940
recent study that looked at naturalistic
 

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.630
recent study that looked at naturalistic
driving data and found that over fifty

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640
driving data and found that over fifty
 

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.490
driving data and found that over fifty
percent of the time people engaged in

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500
percent of the time people engaged in
 

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.880
percent of the time people engaged in
distracting activities these this can be

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:37.890
distracting activities these this can be
 

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.219
distracting activities these this can be
anything from texting so we talked about

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:40.229
anything from texting so we talked about
 

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:43.550
anything from texting so we talked about

with the passenger or even dancing in
your car seat so all of this if it

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:48.570
your car seat so all of this if it
 

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.360
your car seat so all of this if it
doesn't pertain the driving it has some

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.370
doesn't pertain the driving it has some
 

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.150
doesn't pertain the driving it has some
element of distraction for the driving

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160
element of distraction for the driving
 

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.990
element of distraction for the driving
test when we look at distraction itself

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000
test when we look at distraction itself
 

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.730
test when we look at distraction itself
we can break it down from the human

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740
we can break it down from the human
 

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.400
we can break it down from the human
perspective we see that ultimately can

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.410
perspective we see that ultimately can
 

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.860
perspective we see that ultimately can
be thought of in three main fundamental

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:03.870
be thought of in three main fundamental
 

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.090
be thought of in three main fundamental
ways so we have visual distraction this

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100
ways so we have visual distraction this
 

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.800
ways so we have visual distraction this
is of course when your eyes are off the

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:09.810
is of course when your eyes are off the
 

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.220
is of course when your eyes are off the
road looking at other things we can have

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:13.230
road looking at other things we can have
 

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.350
road looking at other things we can have
manual distraction this was here when

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360
manual distraction this was here when
 

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.060
manual distraction this was here when
your hands are off the steering wheel or

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:17.070
your hands are off the steering wheel or
 

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.790
your hands are off the steering wheel or
off steering controls fidgeting with

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800
off steering controls fidgeting with
 

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.930
off steering controls fidgeting with
other things like the climate control

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:22.940
other things like the climate control
 

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.070
other things like the climate control
then we can have cognitive distraction

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080
then we can have cognitive distraction
 

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.200
then we can have cognitive distraction
this one's a little bit harder to assess

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.210
this one's a little bit harder to assess
 

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.360
this one's a little bit harder to assess
but it's basically when your mind is not

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:29.370
but it's basically when your mind is not
 

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.040
but it's basically when your mind is not
actively thinking about the driving task

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.050
actively thinking about the driving task
 

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.650
actively thinking about the driving task
and it's attending to other things in

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660
and it's attending to other things in
 

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.880
and it's attending to other things in
the real world we we don't we rarely see

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:37.890
the real world we we don't we rarely see
 

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.890
the real world we we don't we rarely see
a task that takes just one form of

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:39.900
a task that takes just one form of
 

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.860
a task that takes just one form of
distraction most often tasks have some

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:42.870
distraction most often tasks have some
 

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.750
distraction most often tasks have some
element of all of these types of

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760
element of all of these types of
 

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.630
element of all of these types of
distraction so if we use an example

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640
distraction so if we use an example
 

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.519
distraction so if we use an example
something as simple as rolling up the

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:49.529
something as simple as rolling up the
 

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:52.699
something as simple as rolling up the
window in order to determine if you need

00:09:52.699 --> 00:09:52.709
window in order to determine if you need
 

00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:53.960
window in order to determine if you need
to roll up the window you might have to

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:53.970
to roll up the window you might have to
 

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.940
to roll up the window you might have to
glance at the window so there's some

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:55.950
glance at the window so there's some
 

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.120
glance at the window so there's some
visual you have to reach over to the

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.130
visual you have to reach over to the
 

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.829
visual you have to reach over to the
button of course so there's some manual

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839
button of course so there's some manual
 

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:02.660
button of course so there's some manual
distraction and then you have to think

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:02.670
distraction and then you have to think
 

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.940
distraction and then you have to think
about maybe do I need to push or do I

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:04.950
about maybe do I need to push or do I
 

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.250
about maybe do I need to push or do I
need to pull on it so this is a really

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.260
need to pull on it so this is a really
 

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.199
need to pull on it so this is a really
simplified example and of course the

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:09.209
simplified example and of course the
 

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:10.940
simplified example and of course the
levels of distraction here aren't really

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:10.950
levels of distraction here aren't really
 

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.940
levels of distraction here aren't really
critical but it's a good representation

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:13.950
critical but it's a good representation
 

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.910
critical but it's a good representation
and it's a good it helps us to

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920
and it's a good it helps us to
 

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.990
and it's a good it helps us to
understand when we're designing

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000
understand when we're designing
 

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.949
understand when we're designing
experiences we need to figure out how

00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959
experiences we need to figure out how
 

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:25.850
experiences we need to figure out how
can we focus the experience how do the

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860
can we focus the experience how do the
 

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.220
can we focus the experience how do the
experiences affect each of the different

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:28.230
experiences affect each of the different
 

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.120
experiences affect each of the different
channels of

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.130
channels of
 

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.740
channels of
fashion ultimately how can we minimize

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:30.750
fashion ultimately how can we minimize
 

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.570
fashion ultimately how can we minimize
the overall distraction and what we know

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580
the overall distraction and what we know
 

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.370
the overall distraction and what we know
is that we can't fully eliminate

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380
is that we can't fully eliminate
 

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.070
is that we can't fully eliminate
distractions always going to exist in

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080
distractions always going to exist in
 

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.860
distractions always going to exist in
some form inside the car but what we can

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:42.870
some form inside the car but what we can
 

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.900
some form inside the car but what we can
do is we can mitigate it through

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:44.910
do is we can mitigate it through
 

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.950
do is we can mitigate it through
responsible design so then how do we

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:48.960
responsible design so then how do we
 

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.990
responsible design so then how do we
fundamentally rethink how we design the

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000
fundamentally rethink how we design the
 

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.780
fundamentally rethink how we design the
UI for driving away from the interaction

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:53.790
UI for driving away from the interaction
 

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.670
UI for driving away from the interaction

few principles with you that have come

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:00.510
few principles with you that have come
 

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.140
few principles with you that have come
about as we did a lot of research and a

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:03.150
about as we did a lot of research and a
 

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.990
about as we did a lot of research and a
lot of design iterations and let's talk

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000
lot of design iterations and let's talk
 

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.070
lot of design iterations and let's talk
about those so 11 simple principle that

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:10.080
about those so 11 simple principle that
 

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.170
about those so 11 simple principle that

this mean so when you're on your phone

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360
this mean so when you're on your phone
 

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.020
this mean so when you're on your phone
and you're trying to play music for

right and then we also want to try and

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720
right and then we also want to try and

making things consistent and then

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000
making things consistent and then
 

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.180
making things consistent and then

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.250
and to make two again surface actions as
quickly as possible so this really

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260
quickly as possible so this really
 

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.900

from the complexity of going through an
 

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.940
from the complexity of going through an
interface visually and just make a

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:20.950
interface visually and just make a
 

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.889
interface visually and just make a
simple voice command and get it so we

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:22.899
simple voice command and get it so we

other side of this is though we can
 

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.810
other side of this is though we can
alleviate visual and manual distraction

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:54.820
alleviate visual and manual distraction
 

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.540

we do have to be aware that voice comes

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:57.550
we do have to be aware that voice comes
 

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.670
we do have to be aware that voice comes
at a cost through cognitive distraction

takes some element of cognitive

00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:08.709
takes some element of cognitive
 

00:14:08.709 --> 00:14:10.710
takes some element of cognitive
processing so we want to carefully

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720
processing so we want to carefully
 

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.980
processing so we want to carefully
design the voice voice interfaces and

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:13.990
design the voice voice interfaces and
 

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.170
design the voice voice interfaces and
the voice flows to try and mitigate

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:16.180
the voice flows to try and mitigate
 

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.240
the voice flows to try and mitigate
cognitive processing and overall

why don't you just use your phone people

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:24.850
why don't you just use your phone people
 

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.060
why don't you just use your phone people
are using it today right and the phone

really hasn't had a long time to
 

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.900
really hasn't had a long time to
optimize its UI but think about it when

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:36.910
optimize its UI but think about it when
 

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.370
optimize its UI but think about it when
you're driving your attention is

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:38.380
you're driving your attention is
 

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.829
you're driving your attention is
primarily on the road and your phone

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839
primarily on the road and your phone
 

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.540
primarily on the road and your phone
will be an arm's length away from you

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:42.550
will be an arm's length away from you
 

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.880
will be an arm's length away from you
not close to you and then finally if you

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:44.890
not close to you and then finally if you
 

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.560
not close to you and then finally if you
ever driven on the American highways

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:46.570
ever driven on the American highways
 

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.420
ever driven on the American highways
around here you know there's a ton of

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:48.430
around here you know there's a ton of
 

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.860
around here you know there's a ton of
potholes and you know what that does to

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:49.870
potholes and you know what that does to
 

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.199
potholes and you know what that does to
your touch accuracy you know if you

00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:52.209
your touch accuracy you know if you
 

00:14:52.209 --> 00:14:54.389
your touch accuracy you know if you
tried this on the screen it's very very

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399
tried this on the screen it's very very
 

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:57.210
tried this on the screen it's very very
tricky and then you throw in non-ideal

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:57.220
tricky and then you throw in non-ideal
 

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.919
tricky and then you throw in non-ideal
lighting conditions like today when the

00:14:58.919 --> 00:14:58.929
lighting conditions like today when the
 

00:14:58.929 --> 00:15:00.689
lighting conditions like today when the
car turns the light comes from this side

00:15:00.689 --> 00:15:00.699
car turns the light comes from this side
 

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:02.129
car turns the light comes from this side
then from this side sometimes the phone

00:15:02.129 --> 00:15:02.139
then from this side sometimes the phone
 

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:03.600
then from this side sometimes the phone
is full of glare and you can't really

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:03.610
is full of glare and you can't really
 

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.609
is full of glare and you can't really
see anything and you can't change any of

00:15:05.609 --> 00:15:05.619
see anything and you can't change any of
 

00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:07.379
see anything and you can't change any of
these things right and so it becomes

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:07.389
these things right and so it becomes
 

00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:08.759
these things right and so it becomes
clear that we don't have a regular

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:08.769
clear that we don't have a regular
 

00:15:08.769 --> 00:15:10.829
clear that we don't have a regular
handset situation here so first of all

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839
handset situation here so first of all
 

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:12.660

the typography needs to be significantly

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:12.670
the typography needs to be significantly
 

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.699
the typography needs to be significantly
larger to see at a distance the touch

00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:14.709
larger to see at a distance the touch
 

00:15:14.709 --> 00:15:16.259
larger to see at a distance the touch
targets needs to be much more forgiving

00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:16.269
targets needs to be much more forgiving
 

00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:18.689
targets needs to be much more forgiving
and bigger and then finally the contrast

00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:18.699
and bigger and then finally the contrast
 

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:20.429
and bigger and then finally the contrast
needs to be maximized to work in all the

00:15:20.429 --> 00:15:20.439
needs to be maximized to work in all the
 

00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:21.749
needs to be maximized to work in all the
lighting conditions including night

00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759
lighting conditions including night
 

00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:25.559

don't have to necessarily spread all

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:33.490
don't have to necessarily spread all
 

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.129
don't have to necessarily spread all
these details you don't have to be car

00:15:35.129 --> 00:15:35.139
these details you don't have to be car
 

00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:36.540
these details you don't have to be car
and driving experts as you're building

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:36.550
and driving experts as you're building
 

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.639
and driving experts as you're building
an app for Android auto so a few

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:38.649
an app for Android auto so a few
 

00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:40.470

case that developers can call upon we

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:47.410
case that developers can call upon we
 

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.889
case that developers can call upon we
have layouts and component sizes build

00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:49.899
have layouts and component sizes build
 

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:52.829

for automotive touch target sizes so all
 

00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:55.049
for automotive touch target sizes so all
our layouts are actually built on this

00:15:55.049 --> 00:15:55.059
our layouts are actually built on this
 

00:15:55.059 --> 00:15:57.269
our layouts are actually built on this
sort of metric that allows for these

00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279
sort of metric that allows for these
 

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.039
sort of metric that allows for these
large enough touch targets and then

00:15:59.039 --> 00:15:59.049
large enough touch targets and then
 

00:15:59.049 --> 00:16:00.660
large enough touch targets and then
finally we have this icon conscience

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:00.670
finally we have this icon conscience
 

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.309
finally we have this icon conscience
which are mechanism built into the

00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:02.319
which are mechanism built into the
 

00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:05.759
which are mechanism built into the
system where you can provide an icon as

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:05.769
system where you can provide an icon as
 

00:16:05.769 --> 00:16:07.889

an app developer that's one who one
 

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:09.749
an app developer that's one who one
color and then we switch the color

00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759
color and then we switch the color
 

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.280
color and then we switch the color
accordingly to what happens with the

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:11.290
accordingly to what happens with the
 

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.929
accordingly to what happens with the
background and this this happens

00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:12.939
background and this this happens
 

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:14.220
background and this this happens
automatically you don't have to worry

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:14.230
automatically you don't have to worry
 

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:18.389
automatically you don't have to worry
about that yes so this is the whole

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399
about that yes so this is the whole
 

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:21.749
about that yes so this is the whole

little tweaks and things like font

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:28.809
little tweaks and things like font
 

00:16:28.809 --> 00:16:30.809
little tweaks and things like font
weight or font size or contrast can

00:16:30.809 --> 00:16:30.819
weight or font size or contrast can
 

00:16:30.819 --> 00:16:32.789
weight or font size or contrast can
actually have quite significant impact

00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:32.799
actually have quite significant impact
 

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:35.489
actually have quite significant impact
on the overall readability and time it

00:16:35.489 --> 00:16:35.499
on the overall readability and time it
 

00:16:35.499 --> 00:16:39.499
on the overall readability and time it
takes to understand or read text and so

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:39.509
takes to understand or read text and so
 

00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:41.280
takes to understand or read text and so
you know what we're talking about

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:41.290

how does this really affect legibility

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:19.780
how does this really affect legibility
 

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.510
how does this really affect legibility
in a driving context and how can we

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520
in a driving context and how can we
 

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.790
in a driving context and how can we
further optimize our system to again

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:23.800
further optimize our system to again
 

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.530

previously talked about cognitive load

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:46.870
previously talked about cognitive load
 

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.710
previously talked about cognitive load
and one of the biggest loads is actually

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720
and one of the biggest loads is actually
 

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.650
and one of the biggest loads is actually
that what we refer to as mental loading

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:52.660
that what we refer to as mental loading
 

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.510
that what we refer to as mental loading
and unloading of an application model so

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520
and unloading of an application model so
 

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.150
and unloading of an application model so
that basically refers to the user is

switching from one app to another they

00:17:59.790 --> 00:17:59.800
switching from one app to another they
 

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.740
switching from one app to another they
need to learn and relearn a new model

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:01.750
need to learn and relearn a new model
 

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.910
need to learn and relearn a new model
sometimes they remember it of course

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:02.920
sometimes they remember it of course
 

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.230
sometimes they remember it of course
when they use it frequently but they're

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240
when they use it frequently but they're
 

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.180
when they use it frequently but they're
still unlearning an unknown learning

mental capacities already sort of shrunk

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:10.630
mental capacities already sort of shrunk
 

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.660
mental capacities already sort of shrunk
because your attention again is on the

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:12.670
because your attention again is on the
 

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.830
because your attention again is on the
road and so so it means that for us it

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840
road and so so it means that for us it
 

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.260
road and so so it means that for us it
meant that we met we wanted this system

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:19.270
meant that we met we wanted this system
 

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.810
meant that we met we wanted this system
UI to organize in such a way that the

UI to organize in such a way that the
 

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.260
UI to organize in such a way that the
apps are all self similar there's

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:24.270
apps are all self similar there's
 

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.430
apps are all self similar there's
recognizable elements in all the apps

that even if you switch to another apps

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240
that even if you switch to another apps
 

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.330

it sort of works in the same way and

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:30.340
it sort of works in the same way and
 

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.490
it sort of works in the same way and
this is very different from phones

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:32.500
this is very different from phones
 

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.350
this is very different from phones
obviously where every app tries to

distinguish itself and Spotify is a
 

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.740
distinguish itself and Spotify is a
completely different UI then say google

play music but for Android auto we want
to keep this at a minimum so that people

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:42.610
to keep this at a minimum so that people
 

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.250
to keep this at a minimum so that people
don't have to relearn in the situation

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:44.260
don't have to relearn in the situation
 

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.430
don't have to relearn in the situation
of driving so let's look at some wire

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440
of driving so let's look at some wire
 

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.660
of driving so let's look at some wire
frames here this this is a navigation

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:51.670
frames here this this is a navigation
 

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.690
frames here this this is a navigation
application on Android auto and the bio

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:54.700
application on Android auto and the bio
 

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.670
application on Android auto and the bio
frame is the bottom right this is the

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:56.680
frame is the bottom right this is the
 

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.530
frame is the bottom right this is the
phone application you can see the same

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:58.540
phone application you can see the same
 

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.420
phone application you can see the same
system takes place where there is these

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:00.430
system takes place where there is these
 

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.220
system takes place where there is these
recognizable elements and we're going to

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:02.230
recognizable elements and we're going to
 

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.350
recognizable elements and we're going to
go through in a second and this is an

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360
go through in a second and this is an
 

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.140
go through in a second and this is an
audio music application again with very

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:07.150
audio music application again with very
 

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.140
audio music application again with very
very similar elements and in the next

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:10.150
very similar elements and in the next
 

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.460
very similar elements and in the next
slide we're going to talk a little bit

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:11.470
slide we're going to talk a little bit
 

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.930
slide we're going to talk a little bit
about these common elements that are

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:12.940
about these common elements that are
 

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.710
about these common elements that are
used throughout the system so we we

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720
used throughout the system so we we
 

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.700
used throughout the system so we we
basically did

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:17.710
basically did
 

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.460
basically did
the elements in such a way that they

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.470
the elements in such a way that they
 

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.930
the elements in such a way that they
have common functionality no matter

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:21.940
have common functionality no matter
 

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.909
have common functionality no matter
which app you're in and these anchor

00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919
which app you're in and these anchor
 

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:27.029
which app you're in and these anchor
points are the menu on the left top

00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039
points are the menu on the left top
 

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:29.130
points are the menu on the left top
corner where you get access to

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:29.140
corner where you get access to
 

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.659
corner where you get access to
alternative content and compared to what

00:19:30.659 --> 00:19:30.669
alternative content and compared to what
 

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.820
alternative content and compared to what
you're currently playing the microphone

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:32.830
you're currently playing the microphone
 

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.070
you're currently playing the microphone
on the right side which access is what

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080
on the right side which access is what
 

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.480
on the right side which access is what
we call the demand space which is

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:36.490
we call the demand space which is
 

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.060
we call the demand space which is
basically you can query the system like

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.070
basically you can query the system like
 

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.659
basically you can query the system like
a google voice to either do actions or

00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:42.669
a google voice to either do actions or
 

00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:45.630
a google voice to either do actions or
find a specific piece of content then

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640
find a specific piece of content then
 

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.029
find a specific piece of content then
the application has its own actions and

00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039
the application has its own actions and
 

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:50.340
the application has its own actions and
this is the white area and the whole

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:50.350
this is the white area and the whole
 

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.740
this is the white area and the whole
system has an activity strip at the

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:52.750
system has an activity strip at the
 

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.930
system has an activity strip at the
bottom where you can switch between the

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:54.940
bottom where you can switch between the
 

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.880
bottom where you can switch between the
core activities of driving which we

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:56.890
core activities of driving which we
 

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.440
core activities of driving which we
identified as navigation communication

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:00.450
identified as navigation communication
 

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.850
identified as navigation communication
audio and music and entertainment and

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:02.860
audio and music and entertainment and
 

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.200
audio and music and entertainment and
then cause specific activities now let's

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:07.210
then cause specific activities now let's
 

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.260
then cause specific activities now let's
look at the case of music applications

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.270
look at the case of music applications
 

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.600
look at the case of music applications
here so the first one we saw was google

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:12.610
here so the first one we saw was google
 

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.460
here so the first one we saw was google
play music and you can see sort of a

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:14.470
play music and you can see sort of a
 

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.139
play music and you can see sort of a
very familiar structure with a

00:20:16.139 --> 00:20:16.149
very familiar structure with a
 

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:18.299
very familiar structure with a
play/pause button look forward and and

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:18.309
play/pause button look forward and and
 

00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:21.480
play/pause button look forward and and
rebind and you have additional menu on

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.490
rebind and you have additional menu on
 

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:24.000
rebind and you have additional menu on
the right side in this here this other

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.010
the right side in this here this other
 

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.669
the right side in this here this other
screen is a different application this

00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679
screen is a different application this
 

00:20:26.679 --> 00:20:28.919
screen is a different application this
is an audio app that happens to have a

00:20:28.919 --> 00:20:28.929
is an audio app that happens to have a
 

00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:31.590
is an audio app that happens to have a
30-second revine in 30-second forward

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600
30-second revine in 30-second forward
 

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.360
30-second revine in 30-second forward
and even though they have slightly

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:33.370
and even though they have slightly
 

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.220
and even though they have slightly
different functionality and they express

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:35.230
different functionality and they express
 

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.440
different functionality and they express
their brand in a different color it's

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:37.450
their brand in a different color it's
 

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.360
their brand in a different color it's
still fundamentally the same structure

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:39.370
still fundamentally the same structure
 

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.220
still fundamentally the same structure
that the driver can benefit from even if

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:41.230
that the driver can benefit from even if
 

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.380
that the driver can benefit from even if
even if they've never seen is up before

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:43.390
even if they've never seen is up before
 

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.380
even if they've never seen is up before
they can reuse that and you know when

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:46.390
they can reuse that and you know when
 

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.930
they can reuse that and you know when
you at night driving at night has its

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:48.940
you at night driving at night has its
 

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.240
you at night driving at night has its
own specific challenges and we do a lot

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:51.250
own specific challenges and we do a lot
 

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.860
own specific challenges and we do a lot
of automatic switching of some of the

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:52.870
of automatic switching of some of the
 

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.190
of automatic switching of some of the
panels and things like that for them to

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200
panels and things like that for them to
 

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.200
panels and things like that for them to
reduce the overall lighting intensity

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.210
reduce the overall lighting intensity
 

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.630
reduce the overall lighting intensity
but you can still recognize the exact

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640
but you can still recognize the exact
 

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.010
but you can still recognize the exact
same structure and we actually giving

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.020
same structure and we actually giving
 

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.850
same structure and we actually giving
the application developers a way to

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:05.860
the application developers a way to
 

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.399
the application developers a way to
notify them then when they are in a

00:21:08.399 --> 00:21:08.409
notify them then when they are in a
 

00:21:08.409 --> 00:21:10.470
notify them then when they are in a
low-light situation so they can switch

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480
low-light situation so they can switch
 

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.940
low-light situation so they can switch
to a different color palette this is one

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:11.950
to a different color palette this is one
 

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.230
to a different color palette this is one
of those things that we're doing to make

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240
of those things that we're doing to make
 

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.210
of those things that we're doing to make
it easier application developer so they

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:15.220
it easier application developer so they
 

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.130
it easier application developer so they
don't have to redo everything themselves

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:17.140
don't have to redo everything themselves
 

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.269
don't have to redo everything themselves
and so today we're introducing this new

00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279
and so today we're introducing this new
 

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:24.260
and so today we're introducing this new
form factor directly on the phone screen

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:24.270
form factor directly on the phone screen
 

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.789
form factor directly on the phone screen
and unifying the story for the

00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799
and unifying the story for the
 

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:27.810
and unifying the story for the
developers in the overall experience

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:27.820
developers in the overall experience
 

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.780
developers in the overall experience
because what you can see here is these

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:30.790
because what you can see here is these
 

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.310
because what you can see here is these
exactly the same structure from a user

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320
exactly the same structure from a user
 

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.830
exactly the same structure from a user
experience model even though the form

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840
experience model even though the form
 

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.420
experience model even though the form
factor is very different and you may not

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:36.430
factor is very different and you may not
 

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.310
factor is very different and you may not
see as many buttons in the white area

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320
see as many buttons in the white area
 

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.590
see as many buttons in the white area
because frankly the screen is smaller

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600
because frankly the screen is smaller
 

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.540
because frankly the screen is smaller
and and you know is usually in a mount

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:44.550
and and you know is usually in a mount
 

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.920
and and you know is usually in a mount
but it's exactly the same structure

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:46.930
but it's exactly the same structure
 

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.220
but it's exactly the same structure
otherwise and this is what this new form

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:50.230
otherwise and this is what this new form
 

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.620
otherwise and this is what this new form
factor looks like in for example for

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:52.630
factor looks like in for example for
 

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.080
factor looks like in for example for
google play music during day time in the

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.090
google play music during day time in the
 

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.340
google play music during day time in the
next screen we're seeing the same

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:56.350
next screen we're seeing the same
 

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.990
next screen we're seeing the same
application that we looked at before the

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000
application that we looked at before the
 

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.420
application that we looked at before the
audio app which is right on that next

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:00.430
audio app which is right on that next
 

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.940
audio app which is right on that next
screen and again you recognize the same

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:02.950
screen and again you recognize the same
 

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.640
screen and again you recognize the same
structure over and over again and

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:04.650
structure over and over again and
 

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.780
structure over and over again and
finally at night you can see this here

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:08.790
finally at night you can see this here
 

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.580
finally at night you can see this here
again very similar building principals

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:11.590
again very similar building principals
 

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.170
again very similar building principals
and even in different applications like

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:13.180
and even in different applications like
 

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.120
and even in different applications like
the phone application make your phone

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.130
the phone application make your phone
 

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.950
the phone application make your phone
call this looks immediately familiar

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960
call this looks immediately familiar
 

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.440
call this looks immediately familiar
because it's the actions are groups

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:19.450
because it's the actions are groups

just go back this is a lot of complexity
it's a huge amount of complexity but

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020
it's a huge amount of complexity but
 

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.120
it's a huge amount of complexity but
it's really important that we pay

it's really important that we pay
 

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.400
it's really important that we pay
attention to this complexity so that use

what Greg just showed is that you know
 

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.520
what Greg just showed is that you know
you can go outside and look at some of

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:58.530
you can go outside and look at some of
 

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.050
you can go outside and look at some of
the cars and their differences in screen

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:00.060
the cars and their differences in screen
 

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.550
the cars and their differences in screen

the things that we're doing virtually is
 

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.050
the things that we're doing virtually is

could say well these guys are crazy why
are they doing this you know we want a

are they doing this you know we want a
 

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.710
are they doing this you know we want a
uniform UI and it should all be the same

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720
uniform UI and it should all be the same
 

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.890

right but when you look at cars they're

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900
right but when you look at cars they're
 

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.420
right but when you look at cars they're
very expensive they're very emotional

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:20.430

right as your mom just mentioned we have

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:39.750
right as your mom just mentioned we have
 

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.420
right as your mom just mentioned we have
this responsibility of the driver and

this responsibility of the driver and
 

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.920
this responsibility of the driver and
part of that responsibility is

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:42.930
part of that responsibility is

really developing experiences inside the
 

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.659
really developing experiences inside the
car is how can you deliver a positive

00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:18.669
car is how can you deliver a positive

making sure that we're not over taxing
 

00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:26.159
making sure that we're not over taxing
the driver and that leads us to this

00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:26.169
the driver and that leads us to this
 

00:28:26.169 --> 00:28:29.129
the driver and that leads us to this
very typical process of research and

00:28:29.129 --> 00:28:29.139
very typical process of research and
 

00:28:29.139 --> 00:28:31.399
very typical process of research and
design so this is a pretty common

00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:31.409
design so this is a pretty common
 

00:28:31.409 --> 00:28:33.840
design so this is a pretty common
iterative cycle that you see in most

iterative cycle that you see in most
 

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.580
iterative cycle that you see in most
development cycles but I pointed out

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:35.590
development cycles but I pointed out
 

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:36.990
development cycles but I pointed out
because it's really absolutely critical

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000
because it's really absolutely critical
 

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.539
because it's really absolutely critical
for our team to have this close

for our team to have this close
 

00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:42.269
for our team to have this close
hand-in-hand process and we really

00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279
hand-in-hand process and we really
 

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:44.669
hand-in-hand process and we really
overly invest in research in there in

00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679
overly invest in research in there in
 

00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:47.549
overly invest in research in there in

our research because distraction is such
 

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.350
our research because distraction is such
a critical issue so we need this tightly

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360
a critical issue so we need this tightly
 

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.990
a critical issue so we need this tightly
coupled process between the two because

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000
coupled process between the two because
 

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.940
coupled process between the two because
it really helps to facilitate rapid

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:53.950
it really helps to facilitate rapid
 

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.850
it really helps to facilitate rapid
design and helps us to head in the right

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:56.860
design and helps us to head in the right
 

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.009
design and helps us to head in the right
direction early on rather than having to

course-correct later on when it's more
 

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:06.000
course-correct later on when it's more
costly and that leads us more or less to

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:20.860
highly iterative process that's
 

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.669
highly iterative process that's
predominantly led by vast amounts of

00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679
predominantly led by vast amounts of
 

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:26.850
predominantly led by vast amounts of
user testing so we rigorously test again

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:26.860
user testing so we rigorously test again
 

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.250
user testing so we rigorously test again
and again as much as we can and we have

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:29.260
and again as much as we can and we have
 

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.289
and again as much as we can and we have
a lot of tools and methods that we use

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:31.299
a lot of tools and methods that we use
 

00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:33.120
a lot of tools and methods that we use
both on the qualitative side and the

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:33.130
both on the qualitative side and the
 

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.659
both on the qualitative side and the
quantitative side but rather than while

00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:36.669
quantitative side but rather than while
 

00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:38.879
quantitative side but rather than while
on this slide I'll go to the next one so

00:29:38.879 --> 00:29:38.889
on this slide I'll go to the next one so
 

00:29:38.889 --> 00:29:41.840
on this slide I'll go to the next one so
we have this quick video which is from

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:41.850
we have this quick video which is from
 

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.210
we have this quick video which is from
natin low and whose is anybody familiar

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:45.220
natin low and whose is anybody familiar
 

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.529
natin low and whose is anybody familiar
with NAT and low so okay a few people so

00:29:49.529 --> 00:29:49.539
with NAT and low so okay a few people so
 

00:29:49.539 --> 00:29:51.629
with NAT and low so okay a few people so
NAT low is this YouTube channel it's a

00:29:51.629 --> 00:29:51.639
NAT low is this YouTube channel it's a
 

00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:55.139
NAT low is this YouTube channel it's a
couple Googlers that go around Google

00:29:55.139 --> 00:29:55.149
couple Googlers that go around Google
 

00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:56.700
couple Googlers that go around Google
and they film kind of behind-the-scenes

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:56.710
and they film kind of behind-the-scenes
 

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.210
and they film kind of behind-the-scenes
action of different projects and things

00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220
action of different projects and things
 

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.560
action of different projects and things
happening at GU

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:00.570
happening at GU
 

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.629
happening at GU
and then they posted on their their

00:30:02.629 --> 00:30:02.639
and then they posted on their their
 

00:30:02.639 --> 00:30:04.279
and then they posted on their their
YouTube channels so they recently

00:30:04.279 --> 00:30:04.289
YouTube channels so they recently
 

00:30:04.289 --> 00:30:06.019
YouTube channels so they recently
stopped by Android auto to check out our

00:30:06.019 --> 00:30:06.029
stopped by Android auto to check out our
 

00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:08.779
stopped by Android auto to check out our
research lab I'm not going to play the

00:30:08.779 --> 00:30:08.789
research lab I'm not going to play the
 

00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:11.360
research lab I'm not going to play the
whole clip but I recommend everybody go

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:11.370
whole clip but I recommend everybody go
 

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.889
whole clip but I recommend everybody go
and check that out but instead I have

00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:12.899
and check that out but instead I have
 

00:30:12.899 --> 00:30:14.509
and check that out but instead I have
some quick clip so that I'll talk over

00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:14.519
some quick clip so that I'll talk over
 

00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:16.249
some quick clip so that I'll talk over
so we can go ahead and play the video

00:30:16.249 --> 00:30:16.259
so we can go ahead and play the video
 

00:30:16.259 --> 00:30:19.370
so we can go ahead and play the video
and this is just to show some of the

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:19.380
and this is just to show some of the
 

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.870
and this is just to show some of the
different research activities that we do

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880
different research activities that we do
 

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.200
different research activities that we do
so there's their startup and then

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:24.210
so there's their startup and then
 

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.999
so there's their startup and then
there's not a--not a it's really low and

00:30:25.999 --> 00:30:26.009
there's not a--not a it's really low and
 

00:30:26.009 --> 00:30:29.120
there's not a--not a it's really low and
not in that order okay so we have

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.130
not in that order okay so we have
 

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.980
not in that order okay so we have
driving simulators so this is one of our

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:30.990
driving simulators so this is one of our
 

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.100
driving simulators so this is one of our
driving simulators and basically what

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.110
driving simulators and basically what
 

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.049
driving simulators and basically what
you see is it say you know it's a

00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059
you see is it say you know it's a
 

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:38.240
you see is it say you know it's a
representation of a car inside of our

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.250
representation of a car inside of our
 

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:42.169
representation of a car inside of our
lab and allows us to put participants

00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:42.179
lab and allows us to put participants
 

00:30:42.179 --> 00:30:44.930
lab and allows us to put participants
inside a fake car but give them this

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940
inside a fake car but give them this
 

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.909
inside a fake car but give them this
really immersive environment as they

00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919
really immersive environment as they
 

00:30:46.919 --> 00:30:50.840
really immersive environment as they
drive and as they do this will give them

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:50.850
drive and as they do this will give them
 

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.200
drive and as they do this will give them
tasks in Android auto to perform and so

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:54.210
tasks in Android auto to perform and so
 

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.560
tasks in Android auto to perform and so
as they try and drive and complete tasks

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:57.570
as they try and drive and complete tasks
 

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.029
as they try and drive and complete tasks
we then look at their driving

00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039
we then look at their driving
 

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:01.340
we then look at their driving
performance and evaluate how much does

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:01.350
performance and evaluate how much does
 

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.190
performance and evaluate how much does
their driving performance to grade and

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200
their driving performance to grade and
 

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.690
their driving performance to grade and
that's an indicator if we need to

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:05.700
that's an indicator if we need to
 

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.850
that's an indicator if we need to
redesign or not if something's overly

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860
redesign or not if something's overly
 

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.509
redesign or not if something's overly
distracting beyond the simulator we also

00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519
distracting beyond the simulator we also
 

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:15.950
distracting beyond the simulator we also
have we look at I tracking as well so as

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960
have we look at I tracking as well so as
 

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.110
have we look at I tracking as well so as
I mentioned for visual distraction is

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120
I mentioned for visual distraction is
 

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.629
I mentioned for visual distraction is
really critical so here's one of our eye

00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:20.639
really critical so here's one of our eye
 

00:31:20.639 --> 00:31:24.320
really critical so here's one of our eye
trackers it of course tracks the eye and

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:24.330
trackers it of course tracks the eye and
 

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.149
trackers it of course tracks the eye and
it gives us a quantitative assessment of

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159
it gives us a quantitative assessment of
 

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:28.070
it gives us a quantitative assessment of
natural glance behavior inside the car

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080
natural glance behavior inside the car
 

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.769
natural glance behavior inside the car
so we use this again paired with the

00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779
so we use this again paired with the
 

00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:34.070
so we use this again paired with the
simulator to have them engage with tasks

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080
simulator to have them engage with tasks
 

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.169
simulator to have them engage with tasks
in Android auto as they have to also

00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179
in Android auto as they have to also
 

00:31:36.179 --> 00:31:39.590
in Android auto as they have to also
drive and that helps us to determine how

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600
drive and that helps us to determine how
 

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.320
drive and that helps us to determine how
people make glances and if that we find

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:42.330
people make glances and if that we find
 

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.269
people make glances and if that we find
that people have to make too long of

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279
that people have to make too long of
 

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:46.820
that people have to make too long of
glances that's an indicator that it's

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:46.830
glances that's an indicator that it's
 

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.529
glances that's an indicator that it's
overly distracting and we need to go

00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539
overly distracting and we need to go
 

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:52.190
overly distracting and we need to go
back and redesign and we also look at

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200
back and redesign and we also look at
 

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.720
back and redesign and we also look at
cognitive measurement this is a little

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:53.730
cognitive measurement this is a little
 

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.220
cognitive measurement this is a little
bit harder to assess but this is

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:55.230
bit harder to assess but this is
 

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.129
bit harder to assess but this is
detection response task DRT and

00:31:58.129 --> 00:31:58.139
detection response task DRT and
 

00:31:58.139 --> 00:31:59.899
detection response task DRT and
basically she's putting a micro switch

00:31:59.899 --> 00:31:59.909
basically she's putting a micro switch
 

00:31:59.909 --> 00:32:01.490
basically she's putting a micro switch
on her finger that's a little button

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500
on her finger that's a little button
 

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.269
on her finger that's a little button
that she can click and then she also has

00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279
that she can click and then she also has
 

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:07.490
that she can click and then she also has
a Tector thats gets taped we tape it

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500
a Tector thats gets taped we tape it
 

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.470
a Tector thats gets taped we tape it
around the neck area and that vibrates

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480
around the neck area and that vibrates
 

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.580
around the neck area and that vibrates
on a random frequents a random interval

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:11.590
on a random frequents a random interval
 

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.649
on a random frequents a random interval
and once she feels the vibration she has

00:32:13.649 --> 00:32:13.659
and once she feels the vibration she has
 

00:32:13.659 --> 00:32:15.390
and once she feels the vibration she has
to acknowledge it with the button and

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:15.400
to acknowledge it with the button and
 

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.250
to acknowledge it with the button and
basically this is a really rudimentary

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:17.260
basically this is a really rudimentary
 

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.409
basically this is a really rudimentary
way to black box the brain and look at

00:32:19.409 --> 00:32:19.419
way to black box the brain and look at
 

00:32:19.419 --> 00:32:21.419
way to black box the brain and look at
the phase delay of cognitive processing

00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:21.429
the phase delay of cognitive processing
 

00:32:21.429 --> 00:32:23.730
the phase delay of cognitive processing
we can start to evaluate relative to

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:23.740
we can start to evaluate relative to
 

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.680
we can start to evaluate relative to
other tasks how distracting something is

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:25.690
other tasks how distracting something is
 

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.659
other tasks how distracting something is
from the cognitive aspect then we have

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:27.669
from the cognitive aspect then we have
 

00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:30.060
from the cognitive aspect then we have
occlusion goggles these are these really

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:30.070
occlusion goggles these are these really
 

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.460
occlusion goggles these are these really
goofy looking goggles and they cycle

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:32.470
goofy looking goggles and they cycle
 

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.140
goofy looking goggles and they cycle
between fully opaque and fully

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:34.150
between fully opaque and fully
 

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:36.600
between fully opaque and fully
transparent and it's just a really quick

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:36.610
transparent and it's just a really quick
 

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.870
transparent and it's just a really quick
easier way to simulate a dual task

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880
easier way to simulate a dual task
 

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.299
easier way to simulate a dual task
environment for evaluating whether a

00:32:42.299 --> 00:32:42.309
environment for evaluating whether a
 

00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:43.919
environment for evaluating whether a
task can be completed within a

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:43.929
task can be completed within a
 

00:32:43.929 --> 00:32:45.870
task can be completed within a
reasonable time and whether or not a

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880
reasonable time and whether or not a
 

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.240
reasonable time and whether or not a
task is Chung keable thanks big that was

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:48.250
task is Chung keable thanks big that was
 

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.639
task is Chung keable thanks big that was
really great we have a little bit time

00:32:50.639 --> 00:32:50.649
really great we have a little bit time
 

00:32:50.649 --> 00:32:52.470
really great we have a little bit time
left to talk about implications for the

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480
left to talk about implications for the
 

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.269
left to talk about implications for the
future in the areas where interested in

00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279
future in the areas where interested in
 

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:57.539
future in the areas where interested in
in terms of future and also you can't

00:32:57.539 --> 00:32:57.549
in terms of future and also you can't
 

00:32:57.549 --> 00:33:00.180
in terms of future and also you can't
have a presentation about cars with our

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:00.190
have a presentation about cars with our
 

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.669
have a presentation about cars with our
talk about the future I guess we're

00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679

really at the beginning of this journey
 

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.450
really at the beginning of this journey
where we're starting to understand that

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:06.460
where we're starting to understand that
 

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.639
where we're starting to understand that
bringing two industries together us sort

the automotive industry which has much

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:17.860
the automotive industry which has much
 

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.440
the automotive industry which has much
longer development cycles you know

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.450
longer development cycles you know
 

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.480
longer development cycles you know
between car cycles sometimes seven years

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:21.490
between car cycles sometimes seven years
 

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.659
between car cycles sometimes seven years
and more but we're really understanding

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:24.669
and more but we're really understanding
 

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.310
and more but we're really understanding
the thoroughness that they put into the

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320
the thoroughness that they put into the
 

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.990
the thoroughness that they put into the
process is actually essential because

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000
process is actually essential because
 

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.269
process is actually essential because
they're building huge machinery it's

00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279
they're building huge machinery it's
 

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:32.070
they're building huge machinery it's
actually a very non-trivial problem and

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080
actually a very non-trivial problem and
 

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.230
actually a very non-trivial problem and
at the same time they're learning from

of these things coming together is is
 

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:43.380
of these things coming together is is
starting to be a really interesting mix

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:43.390
starting to be a really interesting mix
 

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.500
starting to be a really interesting mix
and a new potential for developing

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:46.510
and a new potential for developing
 

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.330

we're starting to apply this to other
 

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:55.500
we're starting to apply this to other
areas within Android because we're

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:55.510
areas within Android because we're
 

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.200
areas within Android because we're
having some very interesting learnings

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:57.210
having some very interesting learnings
 

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.490

one areas they were going to look at in
 

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.889
one areas they were going to look at in
the in the near future is that we're

00:34:01.889 --> 00:34:01.899
the in the near future is that we're
 

00:34:01.899 --> 00:34:03.269
the in the near future is that we're
very interested in new types of

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279
very interested in new types of
 

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:04.710
very interested in new types of

areas like car health driving monitoring

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:10.169
areas like car health driving monitoring
 

00:34:10.169 --> 00:34:13.169
areas like car health driving monitoring
new forms of car ownership you know or

00:34:13.169 --> 00:34:13.179
new forms of car ownership you know or
 

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.690
new forms of car ownership you know or
even professional drivers that require

really interested in talking about

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760
really interested in talking about
 

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.460
really interested in talking about
how the batteries are doing and things

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:23.470
how the batteries are doing and things
 

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:25.139
how the batteries are doing and things
like that so we're starting to think

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:25.149
like that so we're starting to think
 

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:28.950
like that so we're starting to think
about apps in the car also as something

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960
about apps in the car also as something
 

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.950
about apps in the car also as something
that goes over to Android as morphable

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960
that goes over to Android as morphable
 

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.080
that goes over to Android as morphable
apps morphable systems that can take

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:34.090
apps morphable systems that can take
 

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:35.220
apps morphable systems that can take
different shapes and that's something

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:35.230
different shapes and that's something
 

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.659
different shapes and that's something
we're learning as we're building Android

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:36.669
we're learning as we're building Android
 

00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:39.149
we're learning as we're building Android
auto that might apply to future in other

00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159

form factors different shapes depending

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200
form factors different shapes depending
 

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.840
form factors different shapes depending
on what the context is and what your

cognitive contact your cognitive ability
is and so this is something that's

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:47.710
is and so this is something that's
 

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.560
is and so this is something that's
completely new and other things that i

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:49.570
completely new and other things that i
 

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:52.020

love about designing for cars is that

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:52.030
love about designing for cars is that

it's really sort of a greenhouse at a

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:53.710
it's really sort of a greenhouse at a

it's really sort of a greenhouse at a
very defined environment everything has

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:56.470
very defined environment everything has
 

00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:58.710
very defined environment everything has
its place it's very heavily constrained

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720
its place it's very heavily constrained
 

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.870
its place it's very heavily constrained
and so we can we can start experimenting

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880
and so we can we can start experimenting
 

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.210
and so we can we can start experimenting
and learning from things as people are

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:03.220
and learning from things as people are
 

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.590
and learning from things as people are
sitting in these positions there's

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:04.600
sitting in these positions there's
 

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.690
sitting in these positions there's
clearly a driver a passenger maybe

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:06.700
clearly a driver a passenger maybe
 

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.670
clearly a driver a passenger maybe
passengers in the back they all have

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680
passengers in the back they all have
 

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.100
passengers in the back they all have
their roles and so we're starting to

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:11.110
their roles and so we're starting to
 

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.510
their roles and so we're starting to
learn how we organize the system

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:12.520
learn how we organize the system
 

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.310
learn how we organize the system
optimized for these specific roles and

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320
optimized for these specific roles and
 

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.590
optimized for these specific roles and
we can do this in a car much better than

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:16.600
we can do this in a car much better than
 

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.270
we can do this in a car much better than
we can sort of do this in freefall

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280
we can sort of do this in freefall
 

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.830
we can sort of do this in freefall
environment like the phone or the TV

that really makes it this the whole
holistic experience but also think of it

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:38.890
holistic experience but also think of it
 

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.580

people are using phones in different
 

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.320
people are using phones in different
ways in the people using connectivity in

pointed out expectations of how they can

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:46.620
pointed out expectations of how they can

also use this in the car as they are

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.180
also use this in the car as they are
 

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.610
also use this in the car as they are
spending more and more time in the car

spending more and more time in the car
and so this is very clear that this is a

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.110
and so this is very clear that this is a
 

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.080
and so this is very clear that this is a
brand new platform and we think about

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:54.090
brand new platform and we think about
 

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.520
brand new platform and we think about
computing in a very different way and so

00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:58.530
computing in a very different way and so
 

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.940
computing in a very different way and so
as as we think about this is become very

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:01.950
as as we think about this is become very
 

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.490
as as we think about this is become very
clear to ask that cause connected cars

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500
clear to ask that cause connected cars
 

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.650

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.010
idea so the phone has come a long way to
 

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.570
idea so the phone has come a long way to
sort of develop its own interface and

this evolution and we see this as a

what together you and
us will build from this going forward
