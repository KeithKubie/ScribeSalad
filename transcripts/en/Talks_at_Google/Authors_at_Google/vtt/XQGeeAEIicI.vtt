00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.910
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, I'm Julie Wiskirchen
from the Authors at Google team here at Google

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.370
Los Angeles.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.690
And today, I'm very excited to welcome Greg
Koch, who is the co-founder and CEO of Stone

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.019
Brewing Company.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.800
Please welcome Greg.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.490
[applause]

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.320
Just a little bit of background on Greg.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.300
He and his partner, Steve Wagner, founded
Stone in 1996 and it has become one of the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.190
fastest growing and highest rated breweries
in the world, brewing 148 thousand, 686 barrels

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.280
in 2011.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.290
Stone is the 14th largest craft brewery in
the United States and the largest American-owned

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.090
brewery in the Southwestern United States--a
position it achieved without advertising,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.150
discounting, or giving away freebies.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.239
Greg passionately believes that environmental
and social sustainability go hand-in-hand

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.220
with brewing mind-blowing beer.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.410
And today, here's here to talk about his book,
"The Craft of Stone Brewing Co.: Liquid Lore,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.829
Epic Recipes, and Unabashed Arrogance."

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.360
So, please join me in welcoming Greg.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.360
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Thank you.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360
[applause]

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.360
Thank you very much.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
[applause]

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.430
It's nice to be here, right at the heart of
Google.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.430
[laughter]

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.670
Venice Beach.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.609
I gave a little delay there, so you can edit
that however you see fit.

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:21.719
[laughter]

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.939
So, yeah.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.780
I started Stone a few years ago with my partner,
Steve Wagner.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.420
And let's get right into it.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.719
I have a premise for you.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.770
And this premise is gonna lay out how the
United States became the greatest brewing

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.289
nation in the world.

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:41.289
Fact.

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.649
It is, today, the greatest brewing nation
in the world.

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.929
You can acknowledge that if you like.

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:49.929
[clapping]

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:50.929
[laughter]

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.509
You can acknowledge that if you like.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.509
[laughter]

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.039
No bullshit.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.859
I've always wanted to say that in a Google
talk.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:12.120
Actually, San Diego alone, at the most recent
World Beer Cup, won more medals than Belgium,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.450
Germany, and UK combined.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.720
And in addition to that, the majority of judges
at the World Beer Cup were from Europe.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.590
[pause]

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.819
The Financial Times in the UK said, "There
is a second American craft, revolution going

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.819
on.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:39.269
It's a craft beer revolution and it's breaking
out all over the country."

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.160
But before this bright sunshine that we have
now, there were the dark days.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.599
But let's go back a little bit.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.599
[laughter]

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.390
In fact, let's go back a lot.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.390
[laughter]

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.390
Hop in with me.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.290
We'll fire up the flux capacitor, go back
in time to when their transportation method

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.049
was a horse-drawn cart.

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.159
And each brewery in the United States only
had a distribution area that was the distance

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:10.430
that a horse-drawn cart could go out from
the brewery and back within one day.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.879
But over time, with consolidation and changes
in the Industrial Revolution, with transportation

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.079
and refrigeration--

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.900
[pause]

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.110
the beer landscape in the United States changed
dramatically.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:38.239
We went from 32 hundred plus breweries in
the United States to, well, let's find out.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.280
The era of commodity beer got really in full
swing in the very end of the late-1800s and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.159
the early-1900s, where--.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.099
Well, I can't imagine going into a saloon
like this and asking for anything other than

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.799
beer.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.129
If you'd said, "Which beers do you have?"

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.629
You would have probably gotten a pretty funny
look, let alone calling it out stylistically

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.810
or brand name wise.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.709
It just wasn't the way it was done.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.859
It wasn't what was offered.

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.450
It's not like this beautiful cornucopia that
we have here today.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.860
And then, along comes Carrie Nation.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.870
I like to call her the "Mother of Organized
Crime."

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.870
[laughter]

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.310
Carrie Nation, of course, was the leader of
the women's temperance movement, which led

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:31.510
forth Prohibition and the rise of the true
godfather of crime and some very, very stylishly

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.270
dressed people.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.330
[laughter]

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.390
[pause]

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.630
Bless you, Gene Roddenberry.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.680
[laughter]

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.740
[laughs]

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.980
I love that episode.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.790
And certainly, led to a lot of crying in the
streets, even though there was virtually not

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.940
much choice in the landscape of beer.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.550
There was still the choice of having beer,
except for this period of time.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.970
And there, of course, was a lot of that.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.970
People weren't happy.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.250
I wouldn't be happy.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:14.630
And almost 13 years later, Prohibition was
repealed in 1933.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.390
[pause]

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.880
Well, it's interesting to take a look at the
US brewery count.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:28.220
And you can see, again, in the late-1800s,
nearly, or in excess of 32 hundred breweries.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.940
And take a look at that line.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.250
It dips down all the way, of course, during
the Prohibition years to zero, but you can

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.790
draw your own line across to what it would've
been like, likely, if Prohibition had never

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.790
existed.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.560
Consolidation, mass commodification, homogenization
was happening pretty much every category in

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.840
food and beverage and a lot of other things
in the United States during this era as the

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:03.060
Industrial Revolution kept chugging and chugging
and chugging along, leading us to years later,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.460
when in 1979, we had the low point of just
42 breweries in the country.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.750
All of them being essentially the same.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.120
Well, all but thankfully, one-- Anchor Steam.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.210
The Anchor brewery up in San Francisco was
really the only brewery that was brewing anything

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.000
that was functionally different from pretty
much everything else across the nation for

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.980
its flagship beer.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.030
The other 41 breweries, their flagship beers
were essentially competing with each other

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.040
in the same space.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:48.380
Well, Jimmy Carter, in his infinite wisdom,
actually removed the excise tax for home-brewing.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.060
So, he did it while home-brewing was legal
in many states up to that point.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.370
He actually had to fill out a lot of forms
and pay excise tax.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:03.090
And Jimmy Carter wisely got rid of that, freeing
it up to really start this landscape of home-brewing

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.360
and this culture of home-brewing, led by Charlie
Papazian.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.180
Who recognizes this man right here?

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.790
A couple of hands.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.510
This guy is considered to be the father of
modern home-brewing.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.010
[pause]

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.320
Speaking of which, let's cheers to Charlie
and all of you guys here.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320
&gt;&gt;Audience: Cheers.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320
[clapping]

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.320
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Cheers.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.930
Or, this is Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.750
I will teach you the Arrogant Bastard Ale
cheer.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:35.230
It goes very simply: Here's to me.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.220
[laughter]

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:47.330
And so dawned a new era as home-brewers helped
stretch the bounds of what was considered

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.720
to be beer.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:57.180
In 1978, Charlie Papazian started the Association
of Brewers.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.890
And then in 1981, Charlie started the Great
American Beer Festival.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:08.680
And then in 1982, he wrote "The Joy of Homebrewing."

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.410
And what was I doing in this era?

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.410
Yeah.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.970
In 1984, I graduated from high school.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.940
[laughter]

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:26.160
But in 2010, Charlie was honored with the
Belgian Knighthood of the brewers of the Belgian

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.440
Brewers Federation.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:33.520
And I was honored to stand next to Charlie
to also receive that same honor.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:41.090
So, in the late-'80s and early-'90s, it was
boom times for craft brewing.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.130
Things really started to take off.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:51.030
And in fact, the US brewery count went up
dramatically.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:57.590
You can see that in the '80s and early-'90s,
it started really, really going north.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.670
And beer was flourishing across the nation.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.070
And people were learning about the different
styles of beer that were available--not just

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.940
the fizzy yellow stuff.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:14.450
[sighs] But then, the first bust.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.750
The bubble burst.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:23.050
In 1996, all of a sudden, the growth curve
went from sharp to essentially flat within

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.150
just a year and a half time period.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:31.990
You can see the volume growth went to almost
nothing.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.930
Now, if you were gonna open up a brewery--

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.960
[laughter]

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.930
when would you pick, in this curve, to open
up?

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.120
Well, yeah.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.070
Somewhere in there, that's when we started.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.860
And let's see.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.650
Oh, I don't know.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.870
Maybe I should pick the bottom.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:54.910
[laughter]

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.740
Or maybe just ever so slightly before it hits
bottom.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.610
Yeah, that seems like a good time.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:05.710
Well, we didn't know, but that's when Steve
and I decided to open up the Stone Brewing

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.800
Company.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.180
We didn't realize that this was happening
when we opened up.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:18.620
We only knew that wholesalers, retailers,
well, pretty much everybody or nobody wanted

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.620
our beer.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.270
We couldn't sell our beer to anybody--hardly.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.450
All the wholesalers would tell us, "You know
what?

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.870
It's imports is where it's at."

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.110
And all the retailers would say, "Hey, we're
DC-ing, we're discontinuing all these brands.'

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:39.500
Well, that is when we opened and this is what
it looked like.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.960
I'd like to actually bring up my co-author
in the Stone book, Randy Clemens.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.660
And we're gonna bring him into the conversation
and continue.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.660
[pause]

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.020
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Here we get intimate.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.900
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Whoa.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.960
That wasn't part of the arrangement, Randy.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.960
[pause]

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.400
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Thank you.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.860
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Sure.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.860
Where's mine?

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.300
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Hi.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.250
How you guys doing?

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.710
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Good.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.660
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: All right.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.100
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Randy Clemens, everybody.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.100
Co-author.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.100
Stone Brewing.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.100
Right here.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.100
[applause]

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.100
We'll sell you one.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.930
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: All right.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.640
So, we're doing this a different way than
we've done it before.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.029
I'm not typically involved in these kinds
of things, but if followed suit in that we

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:27.100
just more or less did this in writing a book.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.230
I knew a bit about beer and a little bit about
Stone, but I got to know more just working

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.230
with Greg.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.940
So, we're gonna try it this way.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.070
Enough of that slide, though.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.070
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Cheers.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.279
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Thank you.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.279
[clink]

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:45.279
So, if you could just talk a little bit about
the pre-history--how you and Steve met.

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.650
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.490
So, I actually--.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:55.220
I give a lot to Anchor Steam because Anchor
Steam was the first beer that opened my eyes.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.960
I was living in Los Angeles.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.750
And I went to this dive bar in downtown LA
in the Warehouse District through the Artist

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.930
Loft District, and it was called Al's Bar.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.540
And they had, here and knowing--.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.540
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Alameda?

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.770
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: What's that?

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.770
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Alameda.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.970
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Sort of off Alameda, yeah.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:14.970
Traction.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.170
And it was an incredible hole in the wall.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:22.463
It had just a porthole, no sign, and it was
off this very, very small street in a very

00:12:22.463 --> 00:12:23.910
gritty part of town.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.760
But they had about six beer on tap.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.029
And I would get Anchor.

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:31.460
I saw Anchor Steam.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.520
I decided to try it.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:39.140
And it was then that I realized that it was
the only beer as it warmed up, it just didn't

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.640
taste like hell.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.490
[laughter]

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.520
'Cause the rest of the beers they had on tap
were fizzy, yellow beer.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.200
And I had this reaction, like "Wow, beer can
taste like this."

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.360
I had no idea because previous to that, I
had only been aware of the existence of the

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.720
fizzy, yellow commodity side of the equation.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.120
So, that was that first spark in my journey
towards craft beer.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:09.150
Over the years, I started visiting small breweries,
going to beer festivals, and especially beer

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.589
events and so on.

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:18.130
During a similar time period, Steve Wagner,
my business partner at Stone, had been taught

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.710
to home-brew by one of his band mates.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.490
He was in a band here in LA.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:29.540
And he and I then ran into each other at a
little class at UC Davis called "A Sensory

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.540
Evaluation of Beer."

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.520
Beer geek class.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.890
And I saw Steve during this class.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.470
And we came up to each other in the break
realizing that we'd actually met a few years

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.720
earlier through a common friend in the music
industry.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.880
That sparked our conversation on the beer
side of the equation.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.210
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: All right.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.060
So, you meet at this class at Davis.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.060
[pause]

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.320
Was the conversation had, then and there,
about potentially starting a brewery?

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.430
Was a spark lit?

00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.640
And where did it go from there?

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.330
I mean, how did Davis get you both to San
Diego?

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.810
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: The conversation actually didn't
begin there.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:13.880
Although, not quite literal of "Hey, do you
wanna maybe start a brewery together?"

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:19.560
But instead, we had that in the back of our
mind as we started the conversation of, "Hey,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.270
maybe we should get together and do a home-brew"

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:27.029
Steve was actually living in a little bungalow
in Santa Monica, just a hop, skip, and a jump

00:14:27.029 --> 00:14:28.150
from here.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:33.120
And I started going over to his house and
playing assistant home-brew lackey because

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.290
he had been actually, he was quite experienced
at home-brewing at that point.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.740
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So you were sanitizing everything.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.740
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: I was sanitizing.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.350
I was the bottle washer, cleaner, sanitizer.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.160
Do it again 'cause he would then watch me
do it all and instruct me I didn't do it right

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.690
so I could do it again.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.090
I think he was teaching me to wax on and wax
off.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.090
[laughter]

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.090
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Gotcha.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.090
So--.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.490
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Did I answer the question?

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.640
I forgot what the question was already.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.640
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: You started.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.640
You started.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.040
So, home-brewing See, this is why I'm here.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040
[laughter]

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.310
So, Steve does some professional brewing in-between.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.590
And how does San Diego come into the equation?

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.590
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: OK.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.930
So, Steve and I started planning opening a
brewery.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:16.050
During this time, I was busy with another
business and Steve actually was called up

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:21.920
to Portland to house sit for his brother,
who was going on a long sabbatical and said,

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.920
"Hey.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.540
Come house sit for me."

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.660
And he and his wife, Laura, went up to do
that.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.920
While he was up there, he got a job at a brewery
called Pyramid.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.040
Back before the Pyramid that you know today,
it was really a much earlier version of it.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.380
And it was in Kalama, Washington, just north
of Portland, Oregon where that was.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.970
It was still called Hart Brewing at that time.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:48.600
And Steve got a job as a shift brewer.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:59.720
And spring of 1995, I actually had gone down
to San Diego to see an old friend of mine

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.980
from college.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.180
And I called up Steve and I said, "Hey.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.690
How about San Diego?"

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:10.170
And he said, "Well, once my brother went to
school down in San Diego.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.550
I really like it down there.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.170
Yeah, I'd consider that."

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:19.110
So I moved down just a few weeks later and
started looking for a place to call the home

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.000
of what would be our brewery.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.899
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: All right.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.590
So, you guys obviously agreed on it.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.920
It was July 26th, 1996.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.670
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: It's happened a couple of times
in our 16-year history.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.670
[laughter]

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.670
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: OK.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:31.670
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Not too many.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.930
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: So, you find this spot.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.180
It's in San Marcos, North County, San Diego.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:42.350
It's an industrial park, kind of in the middle
of nowhere, kind of around nothing.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.350
What was the initial reaction?

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:47.560
I mean, what did people think of the brewery
and what did people think of the beer?

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:53.779
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: [sighs] So, craft brewing had
been, as you saw from that chart, had been

00:16:53.779 --> 00:17:00.100
growing from around the 25 to nearly 55 percent
annual growth rate.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.980
You can tell the year we opened, it was around
seven percent, if I remember correctly, but

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.049
then in our first year of business, 1997,
it went down to two percent.

00:17:10.049 --> 00:17:12.319
So, it almost completely flattened out.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.319
What did people think of our beer?

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.330
They thought our beer was bitter and somewhat
nearly undrinkable.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.549
And the very first beer that we produced?

00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:21.299
Stone Pale Ale.

00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:23.110
Quite modest by today's standards.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.689
We brew it exactly the same today as we did
then.

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:32.570
Here was a low-40s, in the IBU range, pale
ale.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.779
And it was aggressive for a lot of people.

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:35.929
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: All right.

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:38.799
You're gettin' it around town in this fancy
Ford Aerostar there.

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:39.799
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: That's right.

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:40.870
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Very nice.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:41.870
[laughter]

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:47.379
We were self-distributed because, as I mentioned
earlier, none of the wholesalers were interested

00:17:47.379 --> 00:17:48.649
in distributing our beer.

00:17:48.649 --> 00:17:55.259
So, we started up our own distribution company,
which we jokingly called "Aerostar Distributing,"

00:17:55.259 --> 00:17:57.720
with the panel van.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.559
And that's when it was brand new.

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:04.399
We hadn't delivered a single keg of beer yet
that day, or yet at that time.

00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:09.049
And unfortunately, we don't have a picture,
I don't think, of what it looked like when

00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:10.440
we finally sold it off.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.440
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Yeah.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.700
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: I can just tell you that it would
go around the corner.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.390
I would see it pull out of the brewery a few
years into it and it would go around the corner,

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.230
laden with kegs, and the van would turn like
this.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.039
It would be like this squishy, bouncy thing.

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:28.139
And I'd go, "Yikes.

00:18:28.139 --> 00:18:29.600
I hope we're gonna be OK."

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.379
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: All right.

00:18:31.379 --> 00:18:35.489
And these are just some of the early tap handles,
which you self-harvested.

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:36.489
Is that correct?

00:18:36.489 --> 00:18:37.489
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah.

00:18:37.489 --> 00:18:44.370
So, I used to go to the beach in Cardiff and
find exact shape size configuration of stones

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:52.440
to then drill to add the ferrule on the bottom
and have them etched with the name of the

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.489
particular beers.

00:18:53.489 --> 00:18:57.279
So, these are super old school and probably
somewhat collectible these days.

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:58.460
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: All right.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.749
So, you had these beers.

00:18:59.749 --> 00:19:00.970
You had Stone Pale Ale, which--

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:01.970
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Mm-hmm.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.820
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: people were telling you was
way too bitter.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.820
So--.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.330
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Not everyone, thankfully.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.280
So, I don't wanna give the impression that
nobody liked our beer.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.280
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Sure.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.669
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: But I can tell you that--I'm
gonna sound like the old guy here now, but

00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:20.690
you know--we had to walk uphill both ways
barefoot in the snow with a heavy load on

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:21.690
our shoulders.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.980
It's not like today where we have--.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.510
I can tell you, a roomful of people would
not have shown up to hear me talk.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.510
[laughter]

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.630
Even with free beer.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:32.710
I'm serious.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.710
[laughter]

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:34.710
I'm serious.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.429
It was an odd time in our nation's history.

00:19:37.429 --> 00:19:38.429
[laughter]

00:19:38.429 --> 00:19:40.471
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So, did you scale back?

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:41.471
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: What?

00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:42.471
Hell no.

00:19:42.471 --> 00:19:43.471
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: OK.

00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:44.471
[laughter]

00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:45.471
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Is that my cue?

00:19:45.471 --> 00:19:46.471
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: It's, yeah.

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:47.471
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Oh, it's my cue.

00:19:47.471 --> 00:19:48.471
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Yes.

00:19:48.471 --> 00:19:49.471
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: I'm gonna read a little--.

00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:50.471
Excuse me.

00:19:50.471 --> 00:19:52.600
[clears throat] May I read just a little bit
from the Stone book?

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:58.450
"The Craft of the Stone Brewing Company: Liquid
Lore, Epic Recipes, and Unabashed Arrogance,"

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.370
by Greg Koch, Steve Wagner, and Randy Clemens.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.370
[clears throat]

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.370
[reads from book]

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.899
"Sticking to our guns.

00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:12.730
So I remember telling you I was talking about
our bar buyers were telling us our Stone Pale

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.259
Ale was too bitter.

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:18.490
Sure, we could've listened and scaled back
on the hops, but we didn't want to.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.490
It wasn't in our nature.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:24.970
We were brewing beers that we liked to drink
and if they didn't like it, well, we'd find

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.640
other people who did.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.690
Maybe.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.740
Hopefully.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.539
Instead of easing up, we went bolder.

00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:36.940
“In August of 1997, we released Stone IPA
to celebrate our first anniversary.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:43.759
IPAs are almost de rigueur now for most breweries,
but at the time, drinking an IPA was a new

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:45.929
experience for a lot of people's pallets.

00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:46.929
Bitter?

00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:47.929
Yes.

00:20:47.929 --> 00:20:52.090
But the fresh flavors and aromas that came
from the hops--who knew beer could taste like

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.110
this?

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:57.190
Hop heads were being born and Stone was certainly
one of the delivery rooms.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:04.200
“To quench this new thirst, we brewed ever-escalating
IPAs for the subsequent four anniversary celebrations,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.759
going bigger and bolder each time, culminating
now with the somewhat legendary Stone fifth

00:21:08.759 --> 00:21:11.039
anniversary IPA.

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:15.200
This hunger for hops was a good thing because
we were gearing up to release yet another

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.200
brew.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.080
It was, and still is, an aggressive beer.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.080
You probably won't like it.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.730
It's quite doubtful that you have the taste
or sophistication to be able to appreciate

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.830
an ale of this quality, no?"

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:28.830
[laughter]

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.799
And that was, of course, the Arrogant Bastard
Ale.

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:34.980
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So, I was going to ask who
here has had Arrogant Bastard Ale, but most

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.539
of us are drinking the Oaked version of it.

00:21:36.539 --> 00:21:38.260
But if you're not, there's still some over
there.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.260
But there was--.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.370
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Seconds.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.370
[laughter]

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:47.850
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So, Greg just gave you a
tease on the back text label, the back label

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:52.759
text--excuse me--but there's this whole angle
of "you're not worthy."

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:56.480
And I think a lot of people have taken that
as a challenge or thought of it as brilliant

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.220
marketing.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.070
And what's with that?

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.070
[laughter]

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.070
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.070
OK.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.070
So, it wasn't.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:14.039
So, when I wrote those words and continued
on with, I suppose, the insults or the elbow

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:19.409
to the ribs of the possible drinker, it was
really written to warn people away.

00:22:19.409 --> 00:22:24.179
Because Arrogant Bastard Ale, we waited a
year and four months to come out with it,

00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:25.879
even though we had created the recipe.

00:22:25.879 --> 00:22:30.119
And by "we" I mean Steve 99 percent and me
one percent, but I'm gonna take my ownership

00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:31.559
here.

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:35.769
We had created that recipe before we had actually
opened the breweries.

00:22:35.769 --> 00:22:39.980
So we squirreled it away knowing that we were
gonna release it at some point, but waiting

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:44.600
until what we thought was a better time.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:50.820
So, when we were producing it, I thought maybe
we would sell 100 cases.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:56.980
I really didn't know, but I was quite certain
that there were not very many people out there

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.650
that could handle the beer.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:04.070
So I wrote the label for the beer from that
angle trying to warn people away.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:08.690
So one, they didn't just buy it and dump it
down the drain, which would've been painful

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.659
because I knew I loved the beer.

00:23:10.659 --> 00:23:16.730
And two, because I never wanted to just goad
or talk somebody into trying our beer when

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.669
they probably wouldn't like it.

00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:21.730
So, I literally tried to warn them away.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:28.779
Now granted, I did have some fun with the
warning and throw that elbow in the ribs,

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:30.870
or hockey stick.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.511
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: But the hundred cases sold?

00:23:33.511 --> 00:23:34.511
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: They sold quickly.

00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:36.970
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So you made more?

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.190
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: We made more and it sold out.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.669
And we made more and it sold out.

00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:45.999
And now fast-forward years later, it's--.

00:23:45.999 --> 00:23:55.029
Arrogant Bastard Ale is now the number one
selling single serve craft beer in US chain

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:56.139
stores.

00:23:56.139 --> 00:23:57.239
Yeah.

00:23:57.239 --> 00:23:58.350
[applause]

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:02.929
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So, you've got these big
beers.

00:24:02.929 --> 00:24:05.460
You've got Stone Pale Ale, Stone IPA.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.460
You've got Arrogant Bastard Ale.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.299
You're still bleeding money in the tune of,
I think you told me, 30 thousand dollars a

00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:13.299
month.

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:14.299
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah, so now we're talking.

00:24:14.299 --> 00:24:17.549
So, Arrogant Bastard Ale came out November
1997.

00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:21.850
Stone IPA came out a few months before that
in--it was either July or August.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:22.940
Forgive me, I don't remember.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.039
It's been a little while.

00:24:24.039 --> 00:24:26.779
Of 1997.

00:24:26.779 --> 00:24:33.639
And this little Ford Aerostar van that we
showed you cost a lot more money to run--it

00:24:33.639 --> 00:24:37.769
was mostly the driver and the gas--than we
ever could have imagined.

00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:43.230
And with every single case that we dropped
off at a beer store, and every single case

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:48.519
that we dropped off at a restaurant or a bar,
cost us more money than we took in.

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:55.110
So, if we dropped off a case of beer, we actually
lost probably--I think I calculated it once,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.940
but only once because it was too painful to
do again--we were losing about five bucks

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.529
a case.

00:25:01.529 --> 00:25:04.700
It's because we had no critical mass at all.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:11.340
While the major brand brewer guy was going
and dropping off 30, 40 cases in a drop, we

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:15.970
were dropping off one, two--if we were lucky
and it was really lucky--maybe three cases

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:16.970
in a drop.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.620
So there was no economies of scale.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.620
And yeah.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:27.989
We were bleeding 20, 30 thousand dollars a
month late through the second half of 1997

00:25:27.989 --> 00:25:29.529
and into early-1998.

00:25:29.529 --> 00:25:30.529
[pause]

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:33.350
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: What turned that around eventually?

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.350
[pause]

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.950
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Well.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:42.830
So we started talking to the big brand wholesalers
and also the wine and spirits wholesalers,

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:50.240
which some of which also carried beer, that
covered San Diego County in late-1997, early-1998,

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.309
in the hopes that one of them might be willing
to take our beer and distribute it.

00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:57.889
And we could stem this bleeding.

00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:04.909
I actually didn't feel very comfortable with
the idea because I knew that nobody was gonna

00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:10.789
steward our beer to treat it and deliver it
and really, frankly, sell it the same way

00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:16.570
we did because we're passionate, zealot geeks
and those guys sell boxes for a living.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.580
It's the nature of it.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.049
But we had no other choice.

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:25.200
So, we actually made an arrangement with one.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.859
It was, it also doesn't exist anymore in San
Diego.

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:29.859
And we said, "OK."

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:36.080
They said, "We'll start distributing your
beer in December of 1997."

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.710
As that got close, they said, "You know what?

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.070
Let's start at the beginning of the year."

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.070
1998.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.070
January 1998.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.070
As that got close, they said, "You know what?

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:49.960
Super Bowl is gonna be in San Diego in late-January
1998.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:55.309
We're gonna be so busy focused on that, we'll
start with you in February."

00:26:55.309 --> 00:27:00.250
And in February--excuse me--in January, they
said, "You know what?

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.250
Our guys have--."

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.250
You seeing a pattern here?

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.320
"Our guys are gonna be so exhausted from working
so hard.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.820
We're not gonna get their focus in February
because of Super Bowl--" which I hear is big

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.870
for the fizzy, yellow guys--

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.690
[laughter]

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.139
"We'll start with you in March."

00:27:16.139 --> 00:27:23.190
And then, in the middle of February, I got
a phone call and our contact at this big brand

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.470
wholesaler said, "You know what?

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.690
We changed our mind.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.679
We're not gonna distribute your beer.

00:27:30.679 --> 00:27:33.009
We're too busy with other stuff.

00:27:33.009 --> 00:27:38.990
So, thanks and the answer is we're not gonna
do it."

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:43.399
And I hung up the phone and I'm sure I was
as pale as a ghost.

00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:47.789
And I actually can feel the lump in my throat--I
don't know if you can hear it in my voice--channeling

00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:52.220
back to that time 'cause I walked over to
my partner Steve's office and I said--.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.149
And I told him because what they had told
me was "We're not gonna work with you."

00:27:57.149 --> 00:28:00.519
And what I heard was, "We're gonna let your
company die."

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:03.200
[pause]

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.570
And, strong imagery.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.330
I can still feel that.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.580
And it was really scary.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.250
It was really, really scary.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.669
But I didn't know how powerful--I gotta pull
myself out of this.

00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:18.669
[laughter]

00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:24.200
I didn't know how powerful March was.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:29.729
And March 1998 happened and the weather warmed
up a bit.

00:28:29.729 --> 00:28:33.149
And the sun shone and the clouds parted.

00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:36.149
And we actually had our first break-even month.

00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:40.169
We might've made a hundred bucks or even 200
bucks that month.

00:28:40.169 --> 00:28:41.169
[laughter]

00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:44.039
Which was a pretty brilliant thing when you're
losing at the rate we were.

00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:49.279
And it was many months of up and down for
several years after that point.

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:55.309
So, we weren’t always in the black, but
that was when we knew that there was that

00:28:55.309 --> 00:28:57.549
light at the end of the tunnel.

00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:58.549
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: All right.

00:28:58.549 --> 00:29:03.190
Well, I think anyone who's [clears throat]
talked to you or seen you over the years,

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.019
you're known for being a stickler and sticking
to your guns.

00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:10.869
I just wonder if there's been a guiding principle
or a mission statement.

00:29:10.869 --> 00:29:13.240
I glossed over that frame.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.240
Sorry.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.889
But there's Greg and Steve signing some bottles--giant
bottles of Arrogant Bastard Ale.

00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:21.450
So, but yeah.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:25.779
Essentially, I mean, how did you do it and
was there this guiding statement?

00:29:25.779 --> 00:29:33.080
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: So, back when we started, we
realized that we had strong philosophies about

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.149
beer, strong attitudes about beer.

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:38.080
Craft brewing, as I told you, had been growing
very rapidly before.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.539
And so, there are a lot of great breweries,
so many great breweries.

00:29:41.539 --> 00:29:48.610
Many, many, really iffy breweries, but there
was enough to really spark our imagination

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.330
of what beer could be.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.769
And we were really inspired by that.

00:29:52.769 --> 00:29:59.330
So, we decided to really just go for the styles
that we liked versus some of the styles that

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.869
were popular at the time.

00:30:00.869 --> 00:30:04.710
Raspberry Hefeweizens were huge then.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:05.710
[laughter]

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.159
No thanks.

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:15.750
So, I wanted to brew beer that was amazing,
that you could literally say, "Hey, while

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:21.080
not everybody might like this or might not
agree with my taste, I think we can look at

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.099
this and go, 'this has it.

00:30:23.099 --> 00:30:27.869
This is for many people, and for myself, an
amazing beer.'"

00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:32.909
And so we just tried to do things that we
thought were as amazing as we could.

00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:36.049
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: There's a quote that you
like.

00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:40.179
I thought of one that I like, but H.L. Mencken
quote.

00:30:40.179 --> 00:30:45.039
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: So, this quote from H.L. Mencken,
"Nobody ever went broke underestimating the

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:50.920
taste of the American public," was actually
a very foundational, philosophical item for

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.119
us because I wanted to be the exact opposite
of this.

00:30:55.119 --> 00:31:00.510
When we started Stone, I said "This person
who was willing to be underestimated, I do

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.880
not want to brew beer for that person.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.529
I wanna make beer for someone who doesn't
wanna be underestimated, who wants to be given

00:31:07.529 --> 00:31:09.370
some credit for good taste."

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.029
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: All right.

00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:13.200
And this one holds true for me.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.200
George Carlin.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.090
"America's most profitable business is still
the manufacturer, packaging, distribution,

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.440
and marketing of bullshit."

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.440
[laughter]

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.230
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Not if I have anything to say
about it.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.639
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Thankfully, but yeah.

00:31:25.639 --> 00:31:27.179
It unfortunately holds true for a lot of industries.

00:31:27.179 --> 00:31:32.450
And for me, why I got into the craft brewing
industry is that largely, this does not hold

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.450
true.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.090
So, that's just my two cents.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:36.090
And then--.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:41.309
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: We were still a commodity-driven
world, but we are showing each other through

00:31:41.309 --> 00:31:47.210
the amazing work that so many artisanal producers
out there do, that it doesn't need to be just

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.469
this commodity world.

00:31:49.469 --> 00:31:55.549
No longer are we stuck in the level that we
had in the '70s where you would go to a grocery

00:31:55.549 --> 00:32:00.679
store and there would be two kinds of cheese--the
processed yellow one and the processed not

00:32:00.679 --> 00:32:04.929
quite as yellow, dark yellow, one that had
holes in it, right?

00:32:04.929 --> 00:32:08.179
And one kind of tomato--the flavorless beefsteak.

00:32:08.179 --> 00:32:14.320
And vacuum-packed, freeze-dried coffee.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.520
Who thought of that?

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.580
And where are they so I can smack 'em?

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:26.190
And bread was the stuff that was in the polka
dot plastic bag.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.769
No longer.

00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:33.899
I intentionally mentioned categories of food
that, I think, that most people in this room

00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:35.950
would find completely unacceptable.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.529
Forgive me if I'm wrong and you prefer vacuum-packed,
freeze-dried coffee.

00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:40.529
One, OK.

00:32:40.529 --> 00:32:41.529
[laughter]

00:32:41.529 --> 00:32:46.039
I think it was a joking one, but our world
has changed a lot.

00:32:46.039 --> 00:32:48.880
And I had a wonderful espresso on the way
over.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.349
Where was that?

00:32:50.349 --> 00:32:52.820
Do you remember the name?

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.830
Just down this street, this little funky little
place.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.759
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Groundworks maybe?

00:32:57.759 --> 00:32:58.960
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Groundworks.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.799
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Groundworks is awesome.

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:02.029
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah.

00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:03.269
It was great.

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:04.500
Thank you, Groundworks.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.500
[laughter]

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.559
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Well, good.

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:07.559
Things have been changing.

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:08.559
It picked up.

00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:09.559
Eventually, you started finding--.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:13.000
The new problem was keeping up and keeping
enough space.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.269
And so, you were expanding.

00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:18.919
And then, there was a big move.

00:33:18.919 --> 00:33:23.340
You went from your small, little San Marcos
brewery down a couple miles to Escondido.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.489
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Over the years, we--.

00:33:24.489 --> 00:33:27.799
We started off with over 700 square feet in
San Marcos.

00:33:27.799 --> 00:33:32.289
And over the years, we added an adjacent suite
and then one more.

00:33:32.289 --> 00:33:38.889
So, we added three times totaling 26 and a
half thousand square feet.

00:33:38.889 --> 00:33:40.169
But then we were stuck.

00:33:40.169 --> 00:33:42.210
We were landlocked within the building we
were in.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:47.159
And also, we could see our capacity as far
as our 30-barrel brew house being exceeded

00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:48.159
with the growth curve.

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:53.609
So, we projected ahead, realized that we needed
to find a spot--a new spot--to call home.

00:33:53.609 --> 00:33:56.029
And that's when we started building this.

00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:58.850
And we moved there in late-December 2005.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:05.080
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: And with every nice house,
you need a kitchen attached.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.070
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:14.389
And so, I've always thought of us as Stone
and really the craft brewing industry as being

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:18.279
very much in the culinary world.

00:34:18.279 --> 00:34:26.580
For decades and decades, even I would say,
several generations before, beer really hadn't

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:31.520
had a meaningful place at the dinner table
other than something to literally wash down

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:37.620
your food with, rather than actually enjoy
with your food.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:43.560
And I felt that I wanted to showcase great
craft beer with great food.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.349
And that's where the restaurant was born.

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:51.589
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So, I mean, if you wanna
talk a little bit, too, about its design and

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:52.589
just--.

00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:56.740
Here's an overview shot of just the scope
of what the restaurant really is.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.250
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Well, we've had this philosophy
at Stone of don't be different to be different.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:01.800
Be different to be better.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.119
So, realizing this is our version of what's
better, it may not be everybody's version

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:11.210
and I always think that's OK 'cause that's
what brings us spice of life to our world.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:17.660
Our version of better was just creating our
own ideals and putting them here.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:24.400
So, we have a spot that is out of the way,
difficult to find, no sign on it.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.760
How many people have actually had a chance
to visit?

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.810
[pause]

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:28.859
Wow.

00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:31.559
From up here in LA, that was pretty impressive
that--.

00:35:31.559 --> 00:35:34.349
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:35.349
[laughter]

00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:37.289
It's difficult to find.

00:35:37.289 --> 00:35:38.460
Am I right?

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.630
And, of course, the first two years that we
were open, Google Maps would send you to the

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.820
wrong place.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.880
[laughter]

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.150
But it works now.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:56.180
And so, we had a complete ban on high-fructose
corn syrup, which means no major brand sodas.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:01.250
And of course, what is 99 point nine percent
of the restaurants and pubs in our country

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.250
serve?

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.250
Major brand sodas.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.250
So that was a bit different.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:08.720
And we had a complete ban on commodity beer
because, you know, you've heard me talk enough.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.920
That just wasn't part of our world and not
part of what we wanted to foster and didn't

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.710
qualify for amazing.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:19.799
If you look at something so simple as soda
or beer, there are ones that you can look

00:36:19.799 --> 00:36:23.270
at and you can say, "You know, this qualifies
for amazing and this one doesn't."

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:28.609
And although we might not agree a lot of the
time, I'll bet 90 percent of the time we would--down

00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:31.410
the check list--yes, amazing, no, not amazing.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:37.020
We would probably come up with very similar
lists--even the people that choose the non-amazing

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.840
list.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.020
Most of the people that drink commodity food,
or excuse me, or commodity beer or eat commodity

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.400
food know that they are making pretty mediocre
choices.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.220
So, difficult to find.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.710
No high-fructose corn syrup.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:51.390
No commodity beer.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.230
No TVs.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.230
Difficult to find.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.319
I said that again.

00:36:55.319 --> 00:37:01.020
Organically-focused, so our prices are more
expensive.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:06.660
A very eclectic menu, so not for the typical
pub grub approach.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.029
And yet, we've been incredibly successful
with this restaurant.

00:37:11.029 --> 00:37:13.349
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: And you were talking about
the beers.

00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:17.100
You're not just serving Stone beers.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.900
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Right.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:24.010
Because my thought process was what's a more
amazing beer list?

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:29.569
An amazing line-up of Stone beers or an amazing
line-up of Stone beers plus an amazing line-up

00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:30.569
of guest beers.

00:37:30.569 --> 00:37:33.980
Well, that's a pretty easy one to decide.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.550
I'm a beer geek.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.079
I love other great craft beers.

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:41.359
So, we have 32 beers on tap.

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:44.520
Usually around eight to ten are Stone and
the rest are guest taps.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.270
So, we actually have more guest beers than
our own beers.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:55.040
And on our 130 bottle list, there's only two
or three are Stone and the rest are guest.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:00.680
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So, with that, you tend to
make some good friends in the industry.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:06.579
I mean, for me, I've really seen just an amazing
sense of camaraderie amongst brewers.

00:38:06.579 --> 00:38:08.730
Not just within San Diego, but across the
country.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:13.390
And it's interesting to see something you
don't really see in other communities and

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:14.390
other industries.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:15.539
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah.

00:38:15.539 --> 00:38:23.750
So, the great thing about craft beer is also
holds true in a lot of the non-commodity,

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:30.980
the artisanal side of the equation for a lot
of businesses--food, drink--but also hell,

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:36.549
the skateboard industry and other things like
that, in that we don't have to behave like

00:38:36.549 --> 00:38:37.549
commodity.

00:38:37.549 --> 00:38:43.040
Commodity, bring it down, make it appealing
to as many people as humanly possible, package

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.960
it in the way that supposes attributes that
really aren't there--"I'm better, in the case

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.230
of beer, I'm better looking.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:57.349
I'm more sophisticated."--all these kinds
of things that they attribute to their brand.

00:38:57.349 --> 00:39:00.849
And if you're in the commodity world, it's
all about that, beating the other guy, right?

00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:03.420
I mean, look at Coke and Pepsi.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:10.400
So, in the artisanal world, we get to appreciate
love, laud, share, seek after each others

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.279
beers.

00:39:12.279 --> 00:39:17.990
Artisanal cheesemakers, artisanal bakers will
get together and appreciate what each other

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.660
is doing and so on and so on.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.970
So, and certainly coffee roasters.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:29.970
If anybody's ever been exposed to Coffee Common,
it's a collective of baristas that get together

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:34.609
at special events and they're from some of
the leading coffee roasters from around the

00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:35.609
nation.

00:39:35.609 --> 00:39:37.480
And these guys, it's amazing to be there.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.420
I mean, really amazing.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.180
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So do you actually get--.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.070
You work with other brewers from other breweries?

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.070
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.970
I think that was a long way of saying "yes"
to that, leading up to that.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:48.970
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: OK.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.641
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Thank you for helping me cycle
back around.

00:39:50.641 --> 00:39:51.641
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: It was the next slide here.

00:39:51.641 --> 00:39:52.641
OK.

00:39:52.641 --> 00:39:53.641
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: OK.

00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:54.641
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: We're there now.

00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:57.930
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: So, it's a picture of me with
Sam, my friend Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.380
Craft Brewery, from Delaware.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:06.490
And from Victory Brewing, Bill Covaleski from
Victory in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:10.859
And we got to create a beer together called
Saison Du BUFF a couple years ago.

00:40:10.859 --> 00:40:13.740
Anybody have a chance to try that?

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.740
Oh.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.740
Just one.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.569
Well, your next chance everybody, is coming
up because this will be the first collaboration

00:40:19.569 --> 00:40:21.160
beer that we've ever repeated.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.869
We're brewing it all together again on May--.

00:40:23.869 --> 00:40:25.089
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Second.

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:27.119
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Thank you, Randy.

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:30.869
May 2nd, this year at Stone.

00:40:30.869 --> 00:40:37.200
And both Dogfish Head and Victory have already
re-brewed, but not yet re-released their versions

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.660
'cause we all three brewed it at each one
of our three breweries.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.260
When we did it two years ago, we all were
there at each brewery.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:48.740
This year, we're only all getting together
at Stone.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.740
And we're having an event.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.019
I call it the Saison Du BUFFet.

00:40:52.019 --> 00:40:53.019
[laughter]

00:40:53.019 --> 00:40:54.269
So, awkward laughter there.

00:40:54.269 --> 00:40:55.269
[laughter]

00:40:55.269 --> 00:40:57.990
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So, any collaborations on--?

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.480
Yeah, I thought it was funny.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.150
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: And by the way, Buff, B-U-F-F,
it's an acronym.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:07.700
Stands for Brewers United for Freedom of Flavor
and it's an organization that Sam and Bill

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.560
and I created together in 2003.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:18.930
And we wrote a manifesto decrying the power
of the fizzy, yellow commodity beers and need

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.839
for the media to pay just a little bit of
attention to the craft brewers.

00:41:22.839 --> 00:41:27.280
And this was really just before the media
started to pay any attention to us.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:33.349
We had a press release, a press conference
together and one person showed up.

00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:34.349
[laughter]

00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:37.760
And he was Jamie Magee from Yankee Brew News.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.920
We had it in Boston and he was the only guy
that showed up.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.740
No mainstream media at all.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:47.150
Now, if we get the three of us together, we
can get some press and then people actually

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.940
think it's really cool and like, "Wow.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:52.240
Look at these guys," and "These are some of
my favorite brewers."

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.940
It just goes to show you how things have changed
over just nine years.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.060
I'm excited about it.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.880
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: And collaborations play a
larger part.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:07.519
I mean, there was this one obviously, but
we do them fairly regularly and we do a few

00:42:07.519 --> 00:42:08.519
with home-brewers

00:42:08.519 --> 00:42:09.740
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:15.570
We just had our American Home-brewers Association
rally at Stone last weekend.

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:22.519
And we have gotten to create some rock stars
out of the home-brewing industry, or industry

00:42:22.519 --> 00:42:23.519
side of the equation.

00:42:23.519 --> 00:42:24.519
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Yeah.

00:42:24.519 --> 00:42:29.890
So, well, it's that boom that you experienced
before is happening again.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:30.890
And--.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.410
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Well, I didn't experience the
first one.

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:33.410
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Well--.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.420
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah, definitely.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.420
It's boom time--

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.420
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So, I mean--

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.420
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: for craft brewers today.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.260
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: do you attribute some of
that to technology that's now available?

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.810
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Unquestionably.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:52.570
Because now enthusiasts, geeks--how many people
in this room are not geeks?

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.020
Wouldn't describe yourself as a geek?

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.020
OK.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.470
So, we're at a hundred percent.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:57.470
[laughter]

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.800
I would notice I didn't raise my hand.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.750
I'm definitely consider myself a geek.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.940
So, now is our time, brothers and sisters.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.510
It's our world.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.349
And is it not?

00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:15.329
We get to communicate with each other in ways
that were previously interfered by the BMOC

00:43:15.329 --> 00:43:19.859
guy, beatin' us out back behind school, OK?

00:43:19.859 --> 00:43:25.150
So, now we can communicate with each other
and band together and actually make movement

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:28.350
in our world in a number of positive ways.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:32.650
And communicating about things that are worth
communicating about is one of those things.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:37.220
In the world of craft beer, we have RateBeer
and Beer Advocate, which have done tremendous

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:43.100
amounts of heavy lifting to just help connect
the dots with craft beer.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:48.940
And, of course, social media has had a tremendous--.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:55.200
It's tremendous power in communicating amongst
enthusiasts about, well, everything from craft

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.789
beer to I suppose Justin Beiber, but whatever.

00:43:57.789 --> 00:43:59.970
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Your two passions.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.140
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Whatever you want.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.450
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Excellent.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:04.450
[laughter]

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:05.450
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Exposed.

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:06.450
What was that song again?

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:07.450
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: You tell me.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:08.450
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: I don't know.

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:10.610
I thought I would catch him, but I didn't.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:11.610
[laughter]

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:16.690
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: So, where do you see, I mean,
lightening round, the future of Stone?

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.940
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: OK.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.400
Lightening rounding with some slides here.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.400
Oh, there we go.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400
Yeah.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400
So, we have a organic farm now.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.760
Our local organic farm failed a year and a
half ago.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.470
And a year ago, we stepped in to revive it.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:33.140
So, we're proud to grow a lot of our own veggies
for the restaurant.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.140
And--

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.140
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Some for beers.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.140
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Pardon?

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.140
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: Some for beers.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.140
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Oh, yeah.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.140
Of course.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:43.680
The Saison Du BUFF, which actually is a lyrically
themed beer, it's a Saison brewed with parsley,

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.119
sage, rosemary, and--

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:46.119
&gt;&gt;Audience: Thyme.

00:44:46.119 --> 00:44:47.519
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: thyme.

00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:48.519
That's right.

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:50.079
It was delicious.

00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:52.559
You know, the only person that had it was,
where?

00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:54.680
I saw one hand raised.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.680
And how did you like it?

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:56.680
&gt;&gt;Male #3: It was good.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.680
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Good.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.000
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I always try a Saison whenever
I can.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.990
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: So, we'll have a chance again.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:07.079
But we grew all of the botanicals this year
for the Saison Du BUFF at Stone Farm.

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:09.840
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: And pumpkins for a previous
beer collaboration that we did?

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.190
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yes, indeed.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:14.910
Down in San Diego, there's an old Naval training
center.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:23.460
It's called now Liberty Station and we're
working to go in and build--opening late this

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:32.779
fall, I hope--23 thousand square foot under
roof restaurant and brewery with about an

00:45:32.779 --> 00:45:34.880
acre of outdoor space.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.779
And then, we've got the Stone Packaging Hall,
which will go directly adjacent to our existing

00:45:38.779 --> 00:45:40.809
brewery to allow us to continue to expand.

00:45:40.809 --> 00:45:45.510
We'll kick all the bottling and kegging out
of our current building into this new building.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:46.510
Well.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.560
We're building this fancy new building.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.380
And our current facility will continue to
expand as far as brewing capacity.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.180
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: And then the proverbial money
shot.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.180
[pause]

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.620
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Oh.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:05.000
This is the first time this has been shared
on camera.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.720
So, you guys will actually be the first to
unveil this.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:14.319
This is the diagram for the, or the elevations
for the new Stone Hotel.

00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:19.650
It's across the street from our brewery--or
will be--approximately two years from now.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:20.880
Hopefully, just under.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.240
We'll be breaking ground this summer.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.090
Forty-eight rooms and a couple of unique features.

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:32.580
For example, each room will have a balcony
about five feet deep and 12 or 14 feet wide.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.820
And on a nice day, you push a button and the
garage door that separates you from the outside

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.500
will roll up.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:43.510
And just completely bleeding indoors and outdoors.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.400
We won't have a check-in desk.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.859
So, what do you do when you want your room
key?

00:46:47.859 --> 00:46:52.170
Well, go to the bar of course.

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:53.530
[laughter]

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:57.250
You traveled to come here, so that's why you
need a hotel room and we figure you must be

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.130
thirsty.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.019
[laughter]

00:47:01.019 --> 00:47:04.900
And we'll have event space there intermixed
with a barrel aging room.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:10.740
We're really, really ramping up our barrel
age program from spare barrels and also going

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.690
to be producing a number of sours.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:15.250
We're very excited about that.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:16.510
Me, well, everybody.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:21.849
But I first got the chance to visit Cantillon
in 1995, the year before we opened Stone.

00:47:21.849 --> 00:47:25.832
So, I've been a fan of Belgian sour styles,
traditional sour styles for a long, long,

00:47:25.832 --> 00:47:26.832
long time.

00:47:26.832 --> 00:47:30.500
So, it's been a long time coming as far as
I'm concerned.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.050
[pause]

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:35.599
And another two acres of outdoor space for
specialty beer festivals and specialty beer

00:47:35.599 --> 00:47:36.980
events.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:42.359
And if anybody's thinking about getting married
or something, we'll accommodate you.

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:43.359
[laughter]

00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:45.890
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: And all good stuff.

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:50.460
And I mean, if you can wax poetical a little
about just where you see the beer industry

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.730
going and continuing to go.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:56.900
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Well, that slide, we're showing
the dip and the rise of the number of breweries

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.900
in the United States.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:03.759
We now have somewhere over 22 hundred craft
breweries or breweries--the majority or vast

00:48:03.759 --> 00:48:09.460
majority, which are craft breweries here in
the United States--with another 700 currently

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.009
on file in planning.

00:48:12.009 --> 00:48:13.210
[pause]

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.940
This is incredible.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.029
When Stone opened, there were about 800 breweries
in the United States.

00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:25.310
And then, there was the downturn period where
as many were closing as were opening for a

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:26.490
number of years.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:29.020
And now, we're in the age of nano.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:35.130
We're in the age of continued, small breweries
opening up and yeah.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:36.130
Where will that go?

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.130
I don't know.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.039
It's really, it's fascinating.

00:48:39.039 --> 00:48:43.150
Three years ago, the--it is.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:48.400
Three years ago, the average American lived
within ten miles of a brewery.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.390
That was three years ago.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:55.450
That was probably a solid 500 breweries ago.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:49:01.230
So, you could probably do a little guess work
on the math and think it's now within seven

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:05.160
miles the average American lives within a
brewery.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:10.130
What can the United States, what can the market
bear?

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:15.190
I think we can handle a tremendous amount
of growth.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.700
And I think things look really good.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:23.319
Right now, craft beer represents about five
percent of the market.

00:49:23.319 --> 00:49:24.880
And I think we can hit easy 20 percent.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.130
What do you guys think?

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.599
Yeah?

00:49:28.599 --> 00:49:30.079
[clapping]

00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:32.770
Together we are heavy.

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:33.770
[laughter]

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:36.200
And it's exciting times.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:42.410
I do just have a word to all the young brewers
who are starting up.

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.799
Be true to yourself.

00:49:43.799 --> 00:49:45.789
Be true to craft beer.

00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:48.119
Be true to the customers.

00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:51.980
Don't try and chase after customers by doing
what you think they might want.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.980
Try and do what you think is the right job.

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:59.490
And then, if you're good at it, people will
gravitate towards your beer.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:07.480
But we have to be careful with so many breweries
opening up that we don't allow some of our

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.410
ranks to do things that bring all of us down.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:15.660
And I don't think that that has to happen,
but I have a little bit of a fear it might

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:20.339
because if there's a bump in the road with
so much capacity and so many players out there,

00:50:20.339 --> 00:50:23.970
that some might resort to desperate measures.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:27.569
Stay strong, brothers and sisters.

00:50:27.569 --> 00:50:31.539
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: With that, our part of the
presentation is done.

00:50:31.539 --> 00:50:36.530
We can certainly open up to a couple questions
for Greg and I guess if you have some for

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:37.530
me.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:39.359
But mostly if you have them for Greg.

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:40.599
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Hi.

00:50:40.599 --> 00:50:46.529
So you were saying that you wanna make beers
that you love and also that you really love

00:50:46.529 --> 00:50:49.460
trying other craft beers.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:54.340
So, how strong is the temptation when you're
having somebody else's beer to like have some,

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.809
"Oh, that's really good.

00:50:55.809 --> 00:50:56.849
I should make this."

00:50:56.849 --> 00:51:01.400
Like, how do you prevent yourself from trying
to make everybody else's beer if you're trying

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.059
to make beer that you love?

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:05.280
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: So, that's a great question.

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.440
I could answer it from a music perspective
'cause I came from the music industry before

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.440
brewing.

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.410
So, I'll give you a music analogy.

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:17.829
If you're a musician and you hear a song that
you love from somebody else, you don't necessarily

00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:22.190
want to try and copy that, but you can love
it and respect it just as much.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:26.970
Sometimes, what you do is go, "Oh, but the
way they did this particular lick or this

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:33.049
character of the song or the rhythm or something,
I think I know how I might use that in this

00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:36.690
other thing that I had in the back of my mind."

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:44.630
So, just like a jazz musician can have classical
and thrash metal influences, it may show their

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:48.809
own little way through into the jazz that
they play.

00:51:48.809 --> 00:51:53.050
We can sometimes be influenced by things that
you don't really see the connection to it,

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:55.279
but it filters through us creatively.

00:51:55.279 --> 00:52:00.280
And this is the same with any artisanal endeavor
I think.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.900
So, no.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:07.880
I think we're often inspired, but rarely want
to copy.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.890
There are some out there that are copying.

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:14.890
Hey, I don't wanna say like, "Well,--."

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:21.210
This doesn't suggest any copying because we
weren't the first ever to brew a double IPA,

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:27.980
but just to give you a perspective, Stone
Ruination IPA, when it came out in June of

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:32.960
2002, three, two, three, two.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.960
Two.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.960
Two.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.430
OK, where was I?

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:41.960
So, Stone Ruination IPA, which came out in
June 2002 was the first full-time brewed and

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.460
bottled double IPA on the planet.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.891
Not the first ever one that was ever brewed.

00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:49.640
It was in, like, the first five arguably.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:55.839
And now, how many double IPAs, how many breweries
are making double IPAs?

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.520
Were they copying us?

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.520
No.

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.980
But did we get inspired by, "Wow.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.529
A beer can be uber-hoppy.

00:53:02.529 --> 00:53:04.339
It can be super aromatic.

00:53:04.339 --> 00:53:09.279
It can be a lot stronger than I thought people
would want to ever drink."

00:53:09.279 --> 00:53:14.990
Because the average ABD was so much lower
at that time.

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:17.619
And we get inspired.

00:53:17.619 --> 00:53:19.859
We do new things and we go in that direction.

00:53:19.859 --> 00:53:20.859
[pause]

00:53:20.859 --> 00:53:22.440
So, that's your answer.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.440
[pause]

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.539
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Well, if your--

00:53:25.539 --> 00:53:28.550
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: No, let's get the mic.

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:35.910
&gt;&gt;Male #5: I'm from San Diego, so I have a
huge appreciation for you guys.

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:40.000
Also a home-brewer Do you guys have, are you
growing your own hops at your--?

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.220
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: At the farm?

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:43.220
&gt;&gt;Male #5: The farm.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.290
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: That's a question of do we grow
our own hops at Stone Farms?

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:50.190
The answer is only on a very, very anecdotal
basis.

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.589
We don't really have a functional hop growing
region in San Diego.

00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:59.150
It is in the Pacific Northwest, where they
have longer days during the summer.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:01.849
And just better overall micro-climate for
that.

00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:08.990
So, we can better grow our veggies and service
the restaurant that way than growing hops,

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.990
which--.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.099
We're losing money growing veggies at Stone
Farms.

00:54:13.099 --> 00:54:15.980
We would really lose money growing hops at
Stone Farms.

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:20.081
And I'm not sure we'd get the yield or the
quality or the character that we would want

00:54:20.081 --> 00:54:21.081
out of it.

00:54:21.081 --> 00:54:22.809
&gt;&gt;Male #5: My follow-up is, do you have a
favorite hop?

00:54:22.809 --> 00:54:25.069
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Do I have a favorite hop?

00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:26.069
Wow.

00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:27.069
I don't actually--.

00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:29.630
I usually get the old, "What's your favorite
beer?"

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:32.650
question, which is an impossible question
to answer.

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:36.630
So, just for if anybody was thinking of asking
it.

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.609
Favorite hop.

00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:40.029
No.

00:54:40.029 --> 00:54:45.109
But I do have--.

00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:50.089
I can mention some new hop styles which, I
think, are capturing my imagination and I

00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:52.160
think a lot of people's imagination.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.279
Citra hops qualify.

00:54:54.279 --> 00:55:00.130
Amarillo, which isn't quite brand new, but
it's recent.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.280
Those are a couple hops that I really love.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.520
How about you, Randy?

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.069
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: I'll say Nelson.

00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:06.069
Nelson Sauvin.

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.069
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Nelson Sauvin.

00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:08.069
Yeah.

00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:13.720
And when you go historically back, the beers
that are being brewed today could not have

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.650
been brewed historically.

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:17.369
They didn't exist.

00:55:17.369 --> 00:55:23.589
While IPAs as a category have been around
for over a hundred years, originating in the

00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:30.240
UK, they couldn't have tasted like they do
today because the hop varieties that are in

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.890
existence today were literally non-existent.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:37.259
Cascade hops didn't even come around until
the '60s.

00:55:37.259 --> 00:55:41.339
And what's different about the hops today
versus the noble varieties, the traditional

00:55:41.339 --> 00:55:53.380
European varieties, are the big citrusy, piney,
floral, sometimes tropical fruit aromas that

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.190
you can get out of these varieties today.

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:57.500
They just didn't exist.

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.549
So, yeah.

00:55:59.549 --> 00:56:02.980
It's a fascinating, wonderful time of actual
new discovery.

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:08.200
I can say that we are actually--music analogy
again--writing new songs that couldn't have

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.499
been written.

00:56:10.499 --> 00:56:13.069
Sometimes you say, "Every note has been played.

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:18.859
Every bit of music has already been created
before and we're just rehashing."

00:56:18.859 --> 00:56:22.420
And you can say that about brewing from one
angle, but from another angle you can say

00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.420
no.

00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.420
That's not true.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.660
We're actually creating new styles that couldn't
have possibly existed.

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:30.700
You couldn't get the flavor and aromatic profiles
of many of the beers that are being brewed

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.290
by craft brewers today, historically.

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:34.290
[pause]

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:41.529
&gt;&gt;Male #6: How do you explain such a renaissance
of craft beer scene in San Diego and a full

00:56:41.529 --> 00:56:43.960
out wipe-out happen in Los Angeles?

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.809
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: I can actually answer that.

00:56:45.809 --> 00:56:56.420
I lived in Los Angeles for 12 years, from
'84 to, I guess it was 11 years now that I'm

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.490
doing that.

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.490
'95.

00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:03.539
And craft beer got an early start in Los Angeles,
but it was a rocky start.

00:57:03.539 --> 00:57:11.859
Wolfgang Puck started his Eureka Brewing Company,
which was a very notable failure.

00:57:11.859 --> 00:57:15.930
And there was Rhino Chasers, which was a contract
brewed brand that was based out of the Los

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:17.700
Angeles region.

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.839
Also ended up being a notable failure.

00:57:19.839 --> 00:57:23.690
Gorky's, which was around, ended up failing.

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:25.529
Anybody ever go to Gorky's back in the day?

00:57:25.529 --> 00:57:26.529
One.

00:57:26.529 --> 00:57:27.529
Awesome.

00:57:27.529 --> 00:57:28.529
I was there, too.

00:57:28.529 --> 00:57:29.529
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Not far from Al's.

00:57:29.529 --> 00:57:30.529
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Not far from Al's Bar.

00:57:30.529 --> 00:57:31.529
That's right.

00:57:31.529 --> 00:57:32.529
[laughter]

00:57:32.529 --> 00:57:33.529
You guys think I'm lousy.

00:57:33.529 --> 00:57:34.529
Downtown LA.

00:57:34.529 --> 00:57:37.890
And there were some beach breweries within
the beach area of Los Angeles.

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:41.740
They were really brewing mediocre beer and
some of them were just faking it with fake

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:45.530
takes and actually having the beer contract
brewed for them.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:50.670
There was so much going on in the beer industry--the
craft brewing industry--in LA that wasn't

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:56.509
real or failed notably that it put a pall
on LA for a number of years.

00:57:56.509 --> 00:58:01.640
So, when Steve and I both were looking at
starting a brewery, we thought to ourselves,

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.920
"We don't wanna this in LA.

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.779
This is not a good place for craft beer."

00:58:06.779 --> 00:58:14.799
And that's why we moved down to San Diego
because we thought there was more of an opportunity.

00:58:14.799 --> 00:58:15.799
[pause]

00:58:15.799 --> 00:58:16.799
But then, now why San Diego?

00:58:16.799 --> 00:58:23.390
So, in San Diego, we have had the luck of
having a number of really amazing quality

00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:28.430
inspired, creative brewers.

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:34.480
And I think if we've done anything at Stone,
is we helped set the example that you could

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.089
go where the market wasn't.

00:58:37.089 --> 00:58:40.970
And the market didn't think it wanted to go
or didn't know it wanted to go.

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:44.019
And you could go that direction and you could
be successful with it.

00:58:44.019 --> 00:58:51.390
So, as other brewers saw us taking all these
left turns and going big and going odd and

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.540
such, other breweries said, "Wait.

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.540
Well, you know?

00:58:55.540 --> 00:59:05.839
We'll break out of the amber ale, golden ale,
hefeweizen, dry stout, and premium golden

00:59:05.839 --> 00:59:09.549
ale categories and start branching out into
more unique styles."

00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:12.299
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: And I'll add in real quick.

00:59:12.299 --> 00:59:14.560
Just, I mean, there is great stuff happening
now in LA.

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:18.480
I mean, you got, certainly there's great beer
bars, but Craftsman Brewing Company up in

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.480
Pasadena has been there since 1995.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.480
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Yeah.

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.109
&gt;&gt;Randy Clemens: You've got Eagle Rock Brewery
that's open in Eagle Rock a few years ago,

00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:24.490
a little over two years ago.

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:26.289
El Segundo, really close to here.

00:59:26.289 --> 00:59:27.670
Rob's doing some great stuff there.

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:28.920
His Wheat IPA is fantastic.

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.420
His Hyperion's Stout's great.

00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.500
And there's other people.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.230
If you're up Agoura Hills way, there's Ladyface
Ale Companie.

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:36.720
There's some really cool stuff happening now.

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:40.950
And I think there might be something again
its infancy.

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:45.730
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: I think LA is coming into its
renaissance time for craft beer definitely.

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:48.720
This is good time.

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.720
I think all the way in the back.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:50.720
Last, a last--.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.720
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Is there a East Coast/West Coast
rivalry?

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.720
I'm from New England and I know there's a
lot of good craft beers up there.

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.720
I feel like some of the ones back East taste
a little different.

00:59:53.720 --> 01:00:01.000
Is there a different styles or different--?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.829
You talked about--.

01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:09.750
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Is there East Coast/West Coast
rivalry in craft brewing?

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:15.789
Well, I worked with my friend, Sam, from Delaware
at Dogfish.

01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:21.859
I did take him into the hop cooler and feel
compelled to actually say, "By the way, these,

01:00:21.859 --> 01:00:23.599
we call them hops."

01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:24.609
[laughter]

01:00:24.609 --> 01:00:32.650
To which he said, "Oh, good one Greg."

01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:33.660
[laughter]

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:34.960
Not so much rivalry.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:41.630
I think it's only poetry slam rivalry level,
which we have a lot of respect for each other.

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:47.230
And we love throwing elbows and making fun,
but then give me another one of your delicious

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:49.930
beers that you brew 'cause I really like what
you do.

01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:50.930
Yeah.

01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:54.849
&gt;&gt;Male #8: So, I had a baby about a year ago.

01:00:54.849 --> 01:00:56.250
My wife had the baby.

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.250
[laughter]

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:58.250
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: I'm glad you're clear on that.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:01.849
&gt;&gt;Male #8: And I had just thought stopped
home-brewing and I'd been drinking mostly

01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:05.309
Stone IPAs since then because damn they're
good.

01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:10.170
They're all just as good as my home-brew And
I--.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:15.089
Because what I discovered was the worst home-brew,
as long as it didn't skunk out, was better

01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:18.609
than almost any beer you could reliably find
except for Stone.

01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:24.089
So, what advice might you have for home-brewers
or things that home-brewers who want to get

01:01:24.089 --> 01:01:29.140
closer to what you guys are doing in terms
of density and richness and alcoholic content

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.210
and that sort of thing?

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:35.660
What are home-brewers not doing that they
could be doing to get a better beer?

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:40.319
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Nice segue for buying our book,
which has home-brew recipes in it.

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:41.319
[laughter]

01:01:41.319 --> 01:01:43.140
Or my other book called "The Brewer's Apprentice."

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.140
But no.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:51.590
Other than showing my book, the answer to
that is as a home-brewer, the best piece of

01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:56.029
advice I can ever give: join a home-brew club.

01:01:56.029 --> 01:02:00.259
Start home-brewing with somebody else just
like I did with Steve, who was much more advanced

01:02:00.259 --> 01:02:02.940
at the time we started home-brewing when we
worked together than I was.

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.980
So, I had the benefit from learning from somebody
else.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.079
And he had learned from a friend of his.

01:02:08.079 --> 01:02:12.290
So, instead of just opening up a book, no
matter how brilliantly written and well-designed

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:15.000
it might be,--

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.339
[laughter]

01:02:17.339 --> 01:02:20.869
get together with friends because brewing,
home-brewing with friends, of course, is a

01:02:20.869 --> 01:02:21.930
great way to do it.

01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:25.400
And you amplify your learning curve by doing
what people who have been doing it.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:30.650
So, I recommend get together with home-brewers
And the American Home-brewers Association--fantastic

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:32.109
resource for that.

01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:33.109
[pause]

01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:34.590
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Great.

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:36.460
Well, it's time for Happy Hour.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.859
So, let's give a big hand to Greg and Randy.

01:02:38.859 --> 01:02:39.859
&gt;&gt;Greg Koch: Thank you very much.

01:02:39.859 --> 01:02:39.860
[applause]
