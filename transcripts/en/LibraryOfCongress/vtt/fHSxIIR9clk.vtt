00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.363
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.570
&gt;&gt; Our next author is probably known
pretty much as the brother-in-law

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.196
of a guy he sometimes plays
basketball with who's living

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.656
in a house that we can
almost see from here,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.393
kind of like Sarah Palin
seeing the Soviet Union

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.660
from her porch [laughter],
and I think both our author,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.793
as well as his famous
brother-in-law, they both have game

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.093
which I was telling the
author beforehand, I do not --

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.320
I was on my high school
basketball team,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.190
I scored only two points
during the entire season

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.076
and that was an accident.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.476
So, I could never play for him.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.946
And so it's easy to get
to know him as that,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.273
but what is really interesting
about him and his book,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.713
"A Game of Character," is that
it is a truly American story.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.990
It is the story of how
you can come from --

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.720
in this country you can be in one
place, and you can achieve things

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.873
that you thought you could achieve
like, perhaps, going to Princeton,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.080
but going beyond that, even
more, you can be exposed

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.736
to things you never
knew even existed,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.810
and then you become a part of those.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.543
That is truly an American story.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.540
That is truly a story of
a very important journey

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.210
from the south side of Chicago
to Princeton and beyond,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.416
that is truly the story
of a game of character.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.126
Our author now is a coach
at Oregon State University.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.783
He played at Princeton, he coached
at Brown, but more importantly,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.303
he's succeeding in the game
of life and helping others

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.796
to succeed in the game of life.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.836
It is my pleasure to present to
you, Craig Robinson [Applause]

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.690


00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.330
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.263
I thought I was going
to have to adjust this.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.010
I'm usually used to adjusting
mikes when I come to the table.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.070
I want to thank Milton for
that wonderful introduction,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.036
and I want to thank all of you.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.780
This is my first National
Book Festival,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.563
first as an author
or as a participant.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.280
We couldn't do it without
all of you.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.213
Thank you very much.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.880


00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.350
[Applause] Now what
I thought I'd do,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.483
because I'm on a short
time frame here,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.703
and I got my timer here watching me,
I thought I'd tell you a little bit

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.330
"A Game of Character" and why and
how I wrote it, tell you a couple

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.600
of my favorite stories in
there, and then open it

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.096
up for you guys to
ask some questions.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.860


00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.623
But before I start, I
know Milton told you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.680
to turn yourself cell phones off,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.613
that is unless there's
somebody expecting a call

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.473
from a seven footer, let
that call come through.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.190
Please. We can use all
the help we can get.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.396
The inspiration for "A Game of
Character," and I have to start

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.933
out by saying how humbled
I am to be included

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.596
with so many wonderful authors,
because I still view myself

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.520
as just a basketball coach.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.210
I mean, it's hard -- you know one
of my friends from Chicago called up

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.296
and said, "Hey, I saw a book in
Borders that had your picture on it.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.783
What's going on?"

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.526
[Laughter] And I had to
confess, "Yeah, I wrote a book."

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.643
He's like, "Get out of here,
you didn't write a book."

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.570
So it's really hard for me to
realize that I wrote a book,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.713
but the inspiration comes solely
from my parents and my family,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.473
that was the first inspiration, and
I want to share with you a story.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.510
My father, Fraser Robinson, and
this is before all of this happened

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.303
to our family, was just a
hard-working man from the --

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.830
working at the Water Department
in the City of Chicago,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.956
raising a couple of kids.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.423
My mom was a homemaker,
and all they were trying

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.766
to do is provide a good
life for us, good lessons,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.443
good principals, good values.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.403
And my father happened to be the
keeper of the family folklore,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.090
so you guys know what's that's
like when you have somebody

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.343
in your family who, at all of
the events tells all the stories,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.830
gives all the advice,
cracks all the jokes.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.396
Well, that was my dad.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.063
And in doing that he always
imparted some lesson or some story,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.640
or some adventure that you could
take away some positive things to.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.903
And quite honestly when
I was younger, my sister

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.140
and I would always say, "Dad,
don't tell that story again.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.096
We've all heard it, we
know the punch line."

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.116
Now, jump ahead to
about 19 years ago.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.160


00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.110
That's when my dad
died, early, mid 50s.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.716
And at that time I thought
to myself, you know,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.273
somebody has to chronicle
the stories that he told,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.196
the lessons, the adventures.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.443
And I said yeah, maybe
I'll do that some day.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.090
Now jump ahead to two summers
ago when I'm standing backstage

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.016
at the Democratic National
Convention.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.870
Getting ready to introduce
my sister, I'm backstage,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.523
listening to the introduction
and I'm thinking to myself,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.890
what the heck am I doing here?

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:40.890


00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.393
But I also thought, boy, wouldn't
it be nice if my dad was here

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.780
to experience this with us.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.250
And it was at that point that I knew
that I had to actually take a pencil

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.710
and put it on paper and start
writing, even if I didn't succeed,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.983
I had to do it or it
wouldn't get done.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.106
You know how life comes at you.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.593
And what came out of that
was "A Game of Character,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.653
which is basically a tribute,
a love story to my parents,

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.196
whose lessons resonate in the
classroom, on the basketball court,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.600
at the dinner table, or in the
boardroom, and what I tried

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.150
to do was write it so that it
was fun to read for everyone

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.783
and that everybody could
take something from it,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.476
and there were only three people
I needed to impress: my wife,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.146
my mother, and my sister.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.420
And after they read it and enjoyed
it, I knew that I had something.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.650
Now there are a couple
of stories that I --

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.600
there are plenty of
stories in there.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.066
But a couple of the ones that
really bring home the lessons

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.326
that we learned, you know,
I talk about sacrifice,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.073
and to give you guys an idea,
Milton was kind enough to talk

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.233
about the things that you can do
when you think outside of the box

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.926
and you can try and do things
because of good parenting,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.950
good education, and good jobs.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.510
Well, everyone knows the
story about our family now.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.936
I went to Princeton first,
and as my sister tells it,

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.593
she knew she was getting into
Princeton because I got in,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.746
because she is much
smarter than I am.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.626
Can you believe she said --
she says that out in public.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
"I'm much smarter than he is."

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.730
But it's true, it's true, she is.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.866
I was one of those guys who
was -- I wasn't a good student.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.383
I could take tests and do things
like that, and I was motivated

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.736
because I had to do well in
order to play basketball.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.756
So, the story that no one
knows is that I was this close

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.073
to not going to Princeton.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.166
This close, and I'll tell you why.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.900


00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.240
In high school I was getting
recruited to play basketball,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.296
and the schools that were recruiting
me were the University of Texas

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.183
at Arlington, University of
Washington, which is ironically now

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.770
in the Pac-10 which is the Pac-8
by now and I work in the Pac-10

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.550
so there's always a little Northwest
humor to go with that, and again,

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:37.776
I'll digress for a minute --

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.170
the person who hosted me on my
recruiting trip at the University

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.490
of Washington is the head coach
at the University of Washington.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.170


00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.163
And I haven't beaten him
yet, and that really bugs me.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.750
Purdue University and
Princeton University.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.143
And as some of you folks
might have experienced,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.286
at the kitchen table there's
the time you come to decide

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.490
where you're going to college.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:08.580
And I remember it like
it was yesterday.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.933
My mom was standing at
the sink doing dishes;

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.746
my dad was at the table at
his spot that he always took.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.953
I was sitting across from him, and
my sister was nowhere to be found.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.593
And my father said to me, "Okay,
where are you thinking about going?"

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:31.486
And I said, "Well, I've done all
the research, I visited three

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.506
of the four or five schools,
and I think I'm going

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.720
to the University of Washington."

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.293
And my dad what dads do when
you said the wrong thing.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.370


00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.426
And he did this.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.960
This is what my dad did.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.860
[Laughter]

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.413
And then he rubbed his chin
on his chest like this.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.696
But he was calm.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.536
And then he took a
big sigh like this,

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.990
and then I knew I had
made the wrong decision.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.710


00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.076
So he said, "Now, why did you pick
the University of Washington?"

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.423
And I said, "Well, they're in
a great conference, the Pac-8.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.373
I think by the time I'm a
junior I could be able to play,

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.896
maybe even start," and the biggest
and most important thing was his,

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.103
that it's a free education

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.806
because Princeton doesn't
give athletic scholarships,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.000
so we would have to pay at the time,
of the 13,000, we had to pay 2900

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.456
and that -- you might as well have
said that was a million bucks to me.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.210
So I said, and it's
free, and my dad,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.533
who suffered from MS
his entire life --

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.993
I mean, I never, ever remembered
him not walking without a limp

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.570
and it got progressively
worse -- said to me, "Well,

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:13.866
if you pick a school based on
how much money I have to pay,

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.993
I'm going to be very disappointed."

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.976
And you can understand what happens
in a house when you've got a guy

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.303
with MS who gets up every day and
goes to work, didn't miss a day.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.376
I mean, I -- maybe he missed
five days until he died,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.873
says he'd be disappointed.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.763
The whole house is disappointed.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.230
So, he said think about
it, sleep on it,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:45.620
and let's talk about it tomorrow.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.246
And that's when I did.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.780
I thought about it, and I really
did want to go to Princeton.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.513
I knew about the education

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:53.843
and I knew the opportunities
it would afford me,

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.316
but I didn't think
we could afford it.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.990


00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.156
So the next day we're back
at the kitchen table again

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.640
and he said, "So, what
do you think?"

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.380
And I said, well, you know,
after listening to what you said,

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.696
I really did like Princeton.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.046
"Okay, you can go."

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.180
Didn't let me finish.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.246
Did not let me finish.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.400
But that's not the
punch line of the story.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.933
The punch line came after he died
some 19 years ago when I'm going

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.563
through his effects and his
bills and stuff and I'm in there

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.816
with my mom and we're
talking, and I go in his drawer

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.650
and there's like 15 credit cards.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.443
Now my parents weren't
in debt, to my knowledge.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.456
But my mom shared with me that
they paid for our education,

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.853
both my sister and me at Princeton
University, on credit cards.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.340
Now that's sacrifice.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.283
That's sacrifice.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.126
And that's one of the reasons why
I felt like I had to write "A Game

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.713
of Character," because not only
is that sacrifice, that's teamwork

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.406
because they both had to
work to pay those bills off,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.813
which is absolutely unheard of now.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.980


00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.303
There's so many wonderful
stories in my life,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.466
I don't know where to
start, but another one

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.506
of my favorite ones
was I was younger.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.790
I was in grammar school,

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.923
and my family was a working
class family, as I mentioned.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.250
My mom was a stay-at-home mom.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.050
My dad worked for the city.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.983
I had no idea what the
value of money was.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.933
And I went to school one day, and
a kid came up to me and he said,

00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.530
"Man" -- we were talking
about something --

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.063
he said, "Man, I want to know what
it's like to be rich like you."

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.940
And I thought to myself,
rich like me, huh?

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.460
I was like oh, well, my dad's got
a job and we eat out every now

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.696
and then, you know, pizza on
Fridays every now and then,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.630
we go to the drive-in and have
fun and do what we want to do.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.070
So I was like oh, maybe we are rich.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.640
I was like, I'm going to
ask my dad when I get home.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.220
Yeah, you guys laugh.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.616
He wasn't laughing.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.150
I got home, I said,
"Hey dad, are we rich?"

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.806
And he did what he did when a
kid asks something he doesn't

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.440
really know.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.573
He was like, hum.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.106
And he did this again, and
he said, "What makes you say,

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:54.216
what makes you ask that question?"

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.750
And I said, "Well, so and so
at school says he wants to be

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.816
like us because we're rich."

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:04.283
And he said well, -- and it must
have been a Tuesday or Wednesday,

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.910
he said, "Well, I'll
show I how rich we are

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.616
on Friday when I get my paycheck."

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.350


00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.170
So Friday comes, I can't wait.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.076
And my dad cashes his entire
paycheck, all right, which,

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:22.336
at the time, was probably
like, you know,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.450
it could have been
$200, I don't even know.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.570
It may not even have been that much.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.796
And he gets it all in cash and he
gets in 20s, 10s, 5s, and ones.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.840
And he says, "Hey, cat" -- he used
to call me cat - "come on in here."

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.066
And I go in his bedroom and the
money was laid out on the bed,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.656
and I said when I walked in,
"Holy smokes, we are rich."

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.016
And he was like, "Wait a minute,
wait a minute, hold your horses,

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.363
you see this stack of
envelopes over here?

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.063
These are the bills.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.663
You've got to pay the bills."

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.396
So I was like oh, great, so by the
time we pay this there's still going

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.196
to be money left over.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.063
So he pulls out each individual
bill, opens it up, shows it to me,

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:09.900
shows how much is owed and
takes the actual cash money,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:13.243
puts it in the envelope,
sets it to the side.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.570
And he does this and keeps doing it
and keeps doing it, and he's like,

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.260
you gotta pay rent, you gotta pay
the light bill, which I used to love

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.240
because everybody called
it the light bill.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.706
Nobody called it the electric
bill, it was always the light bill.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.483
And then there's money left
over, and finally he says,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.410


00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.136
"All right now this
is what's left over."

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.070
I was like, we are rich.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.830
Because that was, you know,
it looked like there was

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.243
about $42 left, and $42 for
a kid, that's a lot of money.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.240
He was like, "All right, hold on.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.640
You gotta buy groceries.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.706
This is how much we
spend for groceries."

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.640
He put that to the side.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.640
I was like still, that's
still 20 bucks.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.773
He said, "Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute,

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.240
you like to eat pizza on Friday."

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.640
And he shelved that off.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.406
And what I skipped,
which is another lesson,

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:08.550
is that before he started paying
any bills, he took $10 and he said

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.083
that goes into the savings account.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.410
So he did that.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.810
So we're down to about 12, $15 left,

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.803
and he says to me,
"What do you think?"

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.633
I said, "I think you can buy
a lot of stuff with $15."

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.706
And he said well, what about Little
League and all the things you do

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.150
and so he absolutely used
up every single dollar.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.486
And that lesson has stayed
with me my entire life.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.580
First, there's the savings
lesson, then there is the value

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.620
of a dollar lesson which
is so hard to teach people.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.663
And you've got to remember, I was
in grammar school when he did this.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.290
The hard work lesson.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.890


00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.176
But most of all, he asked me
what I thought after the fact.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.193
And I do that today with my
own kids, with my players,

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:24.356
with anybody I've managed
in business.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.350
I ask them what do they think.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.453
And it taught me and it
taught my sister how to think.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.590
And that is why I wrote
"A Game of Character,"

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.430
because it is chock full
of lessons like that.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:47.690


00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:52.403
Thank you, thank you, [Applause] In
addition, I also included lessons

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.296
that I learned from people
who were outside of my family

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.983
and provided a -- both negative
and positive lessons learned

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.593
through experiences, so mentors, and
teachers, and coaches that I played

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.840
for and people I worked with,
and I want to leave enough time

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.596
to entertain questions, so
without any further adieu,

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.383
if you have a question, just walk
up to the mike, feel free to ask me

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.290
about anything except
for recruiting.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.590
Yes, sir.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.913
&gt;&gt; Well, coach, I am going to ask
you a question about basketball.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.600
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:33.826
&gt;&gt; You know, Bobby Knight, in '76,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.130
won the championship
with a motion offense.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:42.416
So my question is, do you think a
team running an offense predicated

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.770
on making mid-range jumpers is
going to ever win the tournament?

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.893
&gt;&gt; Well, [laughter] that's
a very good question.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:56.910


00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.153
No, I think that it's
possible, but with the advent

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:07.420
of the 35-second shot clock, the
three-point line, and cable TV,

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.116
kids don't want to have anything
to do with the mid-range jump shot.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.090
Now, I happen to have
been an aficionado

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.123
of the mid-range jump
shot, and I'm trying

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.263
to teach my players
how important that is,

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:25.390
because no one defends the
mid-range jump shot anymore,

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.020
so it's your best opportunity
to have a wide-open shot.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.760
Thanks for the question.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.360
That was terrific.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.160
Yes, sir?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.160
&gt;&gt; It's also about basketball.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.626
&gt;&gt; I see a theme here.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.093
&gt;&gt; What coaches, past or present
that we'd be familiar with,

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.183
do you admire most
for their character?

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.200
&gt;&gt; I don't know if you
guys all heard that.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.766
The question was, which coaches,
past or present, would I look to

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.460
and look up to with
regard to character.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.236
Well, that's very easy, and I talk
about this in "A Game of Character."

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.310
The first coach that
I ever had was my dad.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.786
So, enough said.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.920
The second coach that I looked up to

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:26.123
from a character standpoint was a
guy by the name of Johnnie Gage.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:26.963
And he was what would now
be known as an AAU coach,

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.890
so he was a travel team coach.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.173
And at the time I didn't realize
that he was only about four

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.410
or five years older than we were.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.676
We were 14 and he was 19.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.670
And I tell a story in
"A Game of Character"

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.600
about a former Indiana basketball
player who's from Chicago and played

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.443
in the NBA by the name
of Isiah Thomas.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.990
I played Biddy Basketball with
him, and Johnnie Gage coached us.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.963
And what I learned
from Johnnie Gage is

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.433
that no one's bigger than the team.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.483
Now it was clear even back
then when we were 14 years old

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:18.003
that he was the -- Isiah
Thomas was the best player

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.723
on the court all the time,
and there was one situation

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.670
where we had a trip to go
to the New Orleans to play

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.036
in the National Championships,
and the --

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.120
how do I want to put this
politically correct since I'm

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.146
in Washington, D.C. -- his attitude
left something to be desired.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.973
And do you know that Johnnie
Gage left him in Chicago,

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.753
the best player probably in that age
range nationally, he left him home.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.820


00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.240
I learned something that that.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.296
You can't be afraid to
discipline your players.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.786
And then I'll end it up with another
coach that you guys might know,

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.536
Pete Carril, former coach

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.686
of Princeton University
who I played for.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.643
He was very similar.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:13.603
He was probably the
first coach that I had

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.856
that spoke absolutely the truth

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.036
out of his mouth every single
time, and boy did it hurt.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.476
But I became a better player
because of it and because of him.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.966
Thanks. Next question.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.710
&gt;&gt; I'll take off this hat out
of respect for Oregon State.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.370
&gt;&gt; Oh, I didn't see,
what hat was it?

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:45.406
He's got a Stanford hat that he
took off in respect to Oregon State.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.720
And you would have to know,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.796
if he played for me his hat would
have been off because he's inside.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.043
[Laughter and Applause]

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.556
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.856
I agree to disagree whether
this is in or outside.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.540
[Laughter]

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.340
&gt;&gt; Just like a Stanford guy,
got an answer for everything.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.540
[Laughter]

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.540
&gt;&gt; I'll defer to your
existentialism, I guess.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:13.730
I walked in actually, this is --
it's more a question about art.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:17.776
I walked in as you said that
you felt like you needed

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.800
to write your book because you
felt like it needed to be written

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.470
and it was almost like you
were secondary to that process.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:27.376
I find myself in kind
of a similar situation

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.710
and sort of needing advice.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.663
I started something called
"Mathalicious" and I'm rewriting all

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.290
of the middle school and
Algebra 1 curriculum,

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.253
and I find myself spending
like, you know and 14

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:46.656
so 16 hours every day writing math
lessons, and my question for you is,

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.673
when you wrote your book, did you
feel like (1) you were a conduit

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.220
for something else, or whether
the product was sort of coming

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.793
from inside have you, and (2)
did you feel like you sort of had

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.120
to step out of the
quote unquote real world

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.340
to get done what you needed to get
done, and almost was that an act

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:04.963
of faith, sort of, and did it even
matter whether it ever got read

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:08.840
to you, or was the real product
just the act of creating the thing?

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.766
&gt;&gt; Wonderful question,
all kidding aside.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.450
And first of all, let me --
thanks for being a teacher.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.810
Thank you for being a teacher.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.783
I don't think we thank
teachers enough.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.250


00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.613
Now, I -- the feeling I had before
I wrote it was that I wanted

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.420
to do this really for
someone else, my family.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.636
But once I started, the part that
you talked about where I needed

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.720
to step away was evident,
evident early, early on

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.936
and this was a very
personal book that I wrote.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.936
I was digging deep and
needed help to dig deep,

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.950
and probably because I'm
like you, have another job,

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.246
I felt under the pressure
to get it done.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.590


00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.510
So I went from that sort of
conduit mode or step-away mode

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.000
into the actual, "I have to write
and work on this and finish it

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:30.356
because I'm afraid that I
won't" after I got started.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.956
And that - well, I hadn't thought
about it as being an act of faith,

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.560
it really is, it's
faith in yourself,

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.720
it's faith in self-confidence,
and you've given me another thing

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.030
to think about, but
it is truly, for me,

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.440
I've heard the giving birth terms,
since I don't know what that is.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:54.710


00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.233
It's truly for me, it was like a
marathon that I wanted to finish.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.203
And since I would never
run a marathon,

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.946
I wanted to make sure
I finished this.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.320
Thanks. Over here?

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.790


00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.416
&gt;&gt; Bravo, Mr. Robinson
for being here today.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.683
I just want to talk about
the value of a dollar.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.500
I pushed the send button on
my fourth book this morning

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:25.356
at 1:36 this morning, and then
I got the inspiration as I rode

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.596
into New York City with my
husband at 4:30 this morning,

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.256
I could get on a boat bus to get
down here today for 20 bucks.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:37.420
And when you were talking I
remembered at the County Fair,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.920
my dad's paycheck was
something like a 114 bucks,

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.323
he was a hundred yesterday --

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.363
deceased, but he was
a hundred yesterday -

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.896
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.560
&gt;&gt; -- and he spent it all
on a Snoopy dog for me.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:52.966
So I just really appreciate it.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.433
I have to get your book

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.883
and my husband is a librarian
and I'm a new author.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.250
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, thank you.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.530
The biggest compliment that I
get when people read "A Game

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.090
of Character," the biggest one I've
gotten is that someone e-mailed me

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:16.463
that "A Game of Character" made
them a better family member,

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:17.680
and not that they were a bad family
member, but they sort of forgot

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.560
about family, and you forget
about the lessons you've learned

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.933
from older folks who
have come before you,

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.756
so thanks for your story.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.090
Yeah. Yes?

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.756
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is only fitting
that I come behind a teacher,

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.510
and I'm an assistant principal
at an elementary school.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.536
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.870
&gt;&gt; And we want a shout out
for the assistant principals

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:39.603
and administrators of schools, too.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.520
&gt;&gt; Yes, administrators in education,
as well, thank you, thank you.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:48.153
&gt;&gt; My question is being a brother of
a famous sister and brother-in-law,

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:51.763
what have been the positives
and negatives for you?

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:53.860
&gt;&gt; Well, for me, not much, because
I'm not in the fishbowl they're in.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.960
The positive things
have been, you know,

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:00.583
really what has been really
positive for my immediate family is

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:08.736
that I've seen the children in
our family take a real interest

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.096
in government, not
politics, but government.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.190
That is something that
I didn't really achieve

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:23.816
until I was an adult working on
my brother-in-law's campaigns.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.863
Secondly, it is really nice for
me to be able to take a look

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:34.983
at who goes on here
from the inside out

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.940
and understand what everyone goes
through, not just my brother-in-law,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.253
but what Bush, Clinton,
all the people before them,

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:45.553
what they all go through, and it's
a tough job no matter what side

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.440
you're on.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.240
[Applause] All right we've got
time for one more question.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.230


00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.500
Nobody's there.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.500
It's on you.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.003
&gt;&gt; All right, so, do you ever give
your brother-in-law some advice

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:07.463
on his jump shot?

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.596
Because it seems like he's
been working a lot more

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.130
on his golf swing recently.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:12.746
I expected you'd see him
out on the court more.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.313
&gt;&gt; You know, I don't give
my brother-in-law advice,

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.516
and I'll tell you why.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.523
And I'm on overtime so this
has got to be the last story.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.413
Back when he met my sister --

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.253
you guys all know that story that
my sister had been around my father

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.086
and me and asked -- and
heard us popping off

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.213
about how you can tell
a guy's personality

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.546
by the way he plays basketball.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.410
So when she met Barack and they -

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:45.760
and it was her first real
long-term relationship,

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.946
because she fired guys
left and right.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.996
Don't tell her I told you that.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.516
So after she'd been dating him a
while, she comes to me and says,

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.936
"Hey, Barack fashions
himself a basketball player,

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.380
would you take him out
and play with your guys

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.046
and see what kind of
personality he has?"

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.980
And, "I was like no way.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:09.780
Uh-huh. You do your own dirty work."

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:11.430
She was like, "Oh, come on, you
know, I'm your sister, do this."

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:16.626
So finally I acquiesced and
I went and watched him play.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.366
And he was perfect.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.433
He was a team player, he was --
for those have you who don't know,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:30.416
pick up basketball has a lot of
integrity and honesty in it --

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.050
you have to make your own
calls, there are no referees,

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.443
you have to give up calls,
he did it all perfectly.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.150
The best thing was, though,

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.446
that he didn't pass me the ball all
the time trying to suck up to me

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:44.853
because he was dating my sister,

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.853
because I was clearly the
best guy on the court.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.503
[Laughter] So I report back to
my sister that everything's good

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:54.406
and everything's fine, and he -- at
least from a basketball standpoint,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.666
his character was intact.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
But I tried to give him
some advice back then.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.043
I was like, dude, be careful.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:06.293
&gt;&gt; So you're not saying he
should move to a man-to-man

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.593
or his own defense this fall?

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.793
&gt;&gt; No, no, what I tried to tell
him was, my sister's a handful,

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:15.226
and he didn't listen to me then,
and that was the end of the advice.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.860
Thank you very much, you
guys have been terrific.

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:25.580
[Applause ]
