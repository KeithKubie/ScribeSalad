[music playing]

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.120
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.040
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.960
[laughs] And there she went.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.710
[music playing]

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.290
Are you Steve Carell?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.290
No.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.000
I get that a lot.
I'm not.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.710
OK.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.710
Yeah.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.540
I thought he was a lot shorter.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.750
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.500
What do mean a lot shorter?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.580
Everybody thinks I'm 5' 8".

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.750
So you are Steve Carell?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.250
No.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.080
[laughter]

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.330
I love when stuff
like this happens.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.210
What I love about
Vegas is you never know

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.710
who you're going to bump into.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.750
so, you want to buy anything?

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.080
I would like to buy something.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.420
I've been looking
for one of these.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.880
The World War II,
a divers knife.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.420
OK.
Yeah.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.750
So it's a knife, and a
bottle opener, and a corkscrew.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.580
And a billy club.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.880
I know that's what
you were going for.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.380
[laughter]
Oh.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.210
Yeah.
Serrated.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.620
What is the going price
on a diver's knife?

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.210
- $2,500.
- OK.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.290
You know what?

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.210
I will give you 4,000.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.960
How about 5?

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.580
5,500.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.120
- $3,200, it's a deal.
- 6,000.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.880
[laughter]

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.790
I could spend hours in
here just looking around.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.120
I think I'm going to be
back in the shop tomorrow.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.880
I've got some stuff
I want to sell.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.710
Namely, this suede jacket.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.460
I was wondering if I
might look at that Mark

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.420
Twain signature piece?

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.120
Sure.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.460
Thanks.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.040
Wait a minute.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.540
Katie Holmes?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.620
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.330
Although I'd like to
look like Katie Holmes.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
Winslet?

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.250
Kate Winslet?

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.330
Really?

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.670
- Katy Perry?
- Definitely no.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.500
No.
- I got this, Corey.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.420
All right.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.250
Katie Couric, how's it going?

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.960
Fine.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.330
Thank you.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Your employees are not
particularly helpful,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.960
I've got to be honest.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.330
Good help is hard to get.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.500
So tell me about this.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.420
This is a Mark Twain signature.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.830
He used to give these out.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.790
He'd scratch little
things on a card, sign it.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.750
And this one's even dated.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.330
January 1900.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.420
Cool.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.250
It's a great piece of advice.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.710
We ought never do wrong
when anyone is looking.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.620
[laughter]
- Yeah.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.880
That's excellent advice.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.210
How much are you looking for--

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.210
for this?

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.380
- $20,000.
- Really?

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.830
Mhm.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.880
Oh, it's a little more
than I wanted to spend.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.500
How much would you give me?

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.380
What about 12?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.170
[music playing]

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.380
- Deal.
- Really?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.880
Sold?
- Yeah.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.000
It's not every day we
get Katie Couric in here.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.290
We have a deal.
- Give me five.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.880
[laughter]

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.380
I think maybe he threw
me a bit of a bone.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.790
A woman came in
with this platinum

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.210
record signed by Bret Michaels.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.880
If this thing is legit, it
is definitely worth money.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.170
And I know the exact guy
who can give me that info.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.580
What is going on, man?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.040
Good to see you, Rick.
Good to see you.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.420
Doing good, brother?
- Doing good, man.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.000
Good.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.750
[gasps]

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.920
Hello.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.080
How are you doing?
- Oh, my god!

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.170
Oh, my gosh!

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.210
Shut up!

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.580
[laughs] And there she went.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.750
[laughter]

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.170
Come in.
Come in.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.580
Hi.
Hi.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.080
How aer you doing?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.210
I don't know
why, but a girl has

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.000
never reacted like that to me.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.250
[laughs]
- All right.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.580
So this plaque and
platinum record

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.920
was to commemorate all the
sales combined together,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.670
both Poison and myself.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.540
But we did it for my
foundation, right?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.880
And for charity.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.960
And we only made a
limited amount of these.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.290
This particular plaque
is awesome to me

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.290
because as a lifelong type 1
diabetic, I do a lot of stuff

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.580
with charities.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.960
And this plaque was
made specifically

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.710
for charitable events.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.460
And it raises a lot of money.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.040
And we've only made
so many of these.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.960
Very limited edition.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.790
Sometimes it can be around
5,000, in that area.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.460
We've sold them for 30,000.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.750
Well, I've got to figure
out a price with her.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.420
I totally understand, but
do not let him be hard on you,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.460
all right?

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.920
I'm promising, do not--
- OK.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.120
Go big on this, all right?

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.080
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you $2,500.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.460
What about 3,500?

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.580
$2,500 is it.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.290
I mean, can we do this?
- OK.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.670
Sounds good.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.170
- We got a deal?
- Deal.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.330
OK.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.670
Tell me you bought it.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.290
- I bought it.
- OK.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.170
And now you can auction it
off at your charity again.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.290
And--
- For real?

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.170
For real.
It worked out great.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.080
She got money.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.330
I get a tax write off.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.330
And you get to
auction it off again.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.080
Awesome, dude.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.960
So when you see me tomorrow
night, you going to let me on

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.960
stage again?
- Done.
