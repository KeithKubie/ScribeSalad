 The same is true for item sales. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.810
 It is most important that you show the item you want 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.810
 I'll let you know how to do it. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.220

 So you just have to show them the items you want to ride 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.460

 If you do not see it, come see me now. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.620
 However, no matter how many users you purchase, 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.850
 100 If my life shows the same item to the Son of Man 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:58.140
 Well, that's not it. 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.660
 The more you can advertise the items that fit the user-by-user decomposition, the more 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.159
 So you can make a profit, so AdMob can 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.310
 I prepared. 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.590
 If you use this, you can customize it for 9 minutes 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.930

 You can also provide instructions 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:28.229
 So let's take a peek at how the prospects feed. 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.610
 Let Ed Mobs use the House Advertising feature and Ed Thoggogle Analytics together 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.520
 It's possible 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.240
 We use Analytics to collect data. 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.260
 After making it an audience list in AdMob 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 When creating an Adam item sales ad, 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.490
 I am interested in selling only those users who belong to Montgomery. 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.680
 You'll be able to see your ad. 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.690
 First, let's set it up first. 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.560
 Please connect me. 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:03.300
 If you do not have one, you can make it right away. 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:08.040
 Oh, you can not do it again. 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:12.840
 Are you ready then you will see this screen 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.459
 At the bottom left, select Create an audience and click the new locked customer button. 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.050
 Press 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:23.040
 If you click New here, you'll see that Analytics automatically 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.510
 You can create a user list from the settings of the conditions 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.610
 In addition to these, conditions such as the nap user level 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.540
 To create a list, use Analytics, and pre-create an event. 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.820
 please 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:42.810
 So the event came up in the area of ​​advanced Iran below. 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.730
 If you do not know anything about the event, 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.580
 Please refer to 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.750
 You do not have to create a new audience list. 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.900
 Go back and press the Segment button once. 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.150
 You can use the segment you created right away. 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.330
 You can use the recommended segment to make it look more comfortable. 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.390
 Let's create a new user list. 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.709
 Name it New User Test. 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.120
 You just saved it. 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:18.049
 Now you can set this item to show you what item to sell. 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.340
 Let's go ahead and advertise the item sales that we made in the previous video. 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.689
 Please select 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:29.480
 And when you open the settings, you'll see advanced ad targeting. 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:30.739
 Click here to see if you have a list of new user tests you have created 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.810
 Find 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.590
 If you do not see it, do not get hurt. 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.019
 Please try 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.189
 Then you will see again. Select 2 to add and save. 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.650
 It's finished. 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:51.139
 Now, for those users who are likely to pay for the item sales ads, 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.629
 It's only visible to users. 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:58.400
 Now all the settings are done. 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.689
 I just need to adapt the code. 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.200
 Let's see. 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:07.519
 I need your help. 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:11.900
 It is in favor of both. In order to have more time, we need two things. 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.599
 How to properly mark the items you want with proper targeting 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.000
 It's a way to measure the performance of your ads. 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:24.889
 So from now on, how do you analyze and target your behavior in your app? 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.570
 Let's see if we can measure the performance of an item sales ad. 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:33.710
 In order to record and analyze the behavior of Mnet users, 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.789
 You can use it through Google Play services 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.409
 There is 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:41.479
 Many developers, including me, say that data analysis is somewhat complex 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:46.669
 You feel like you have a hard time. 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.870
 In fact, if you look at the complex menu and the unfamiliar terms, 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.220
 Do it 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:56.360
 One good news is that Google has just released a few basic features 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.780
 The fact is that you can effectively target users 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.409
 Let's take a look at what features we can leverage. 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.870
 In order to use any of these special functions, 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:10.610
 You must create a tracker to record 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.620
 If you link your account to Google via your account, 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.699
 You can get a tracking id. 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:21.380
 You can create tracker objects using these tracking children. 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:25.219
 First, demographic information like user age gender 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:29.270
 Which can be used in common across all apps, such as 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:34.190
 To enable you to verify the information, enable basic tracking as follows: 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:38.570
 It's just a couple of lines, but when you open it, 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.740
 And it allows you to target users based on activities they have visited. 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.880
 Have been 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:47.360
 Furthermore, it's important for your apps, such as your stage clearance government 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.560
 You can also use event information to target your ads. 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.660
 4 led an ordinance player and level pack 1 say my player the same 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.010
 If you advertise an item, 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.230
 Take advantage of the event builder included in tc to get it to your desired value 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.770
 Event Category Action 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:08.150
 You can set up information such as labels to be forwarded to the server and saved 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:12.220
 Just call the sandbox function on the cracker. 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:17.810
 The data will soon accumulate in the tick sub and will be based on this information 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.160
 Create an audience list and target users to show the most relevant ads. 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.720
 can 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:27.650
 So how do you measure the performance of these item sales ads? 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.410
 Download the Google Conversion Tracking SDK and download the included resource files 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:34.640
 You need to add it to your project 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:38.480
 If you are using your Play Store für Switzerland, 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:42.760
 Add conversion track quest k to your project and you're ready. 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:47.780
 Each time an item is sold, the result is automatically sent to the server in the callback 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.890
 You can check the effect of the ad at a glance on the tab to make it publicize on Ed Page 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.210
 can 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:57.230
 It seems that there is an item sale. 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.040
 If you are using a pulse listener for some reason, you should add a little 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.900
 I do. 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:07.430
 Each time a user clicks on an item sale, on first request callback 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.650
 You can call this code play billing resolution method directly in 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:14.570
 You must be a server. 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:19.070
 Likewise, ad performance can be checked through the tabs to make the ad richer 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:23.120
 Until now, I do not know how to write user behavior based on potential customers 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:25.850
 A basic way to create a list and target users is to use the 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.840
 I looked at how to measure performance. 

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:32.120
 Effective ways to target your ads are based on the nature and user 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.780
 It could vary from floor to floor. 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.760
 For more information, see the developer site documentation and the Google Korea Developer Blog 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:42.620

 Always do not lie data Joe Ad Mocha Google One Piece powerful 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:51.140
 You can take advantage of the features to test different methods and 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.970
 Now that you've provided a user experience, let's make more money.
