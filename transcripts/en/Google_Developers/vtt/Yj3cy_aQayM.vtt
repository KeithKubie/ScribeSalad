JOHN DONHAM: TuneIn
lets you listen

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.820
to live audio from
around the world.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.619
So you can think about
what it's like listening

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:12.660
to your radio in the car.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.520
You have about 70 different
options, local radio stations.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.870
TuneIn turns your mobile
phone into a radio

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.510
that can pick up
100,000 stations

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.980
from all over the world.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.840
I think the first time we
turned on push notifications.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.360
So we were able to tell our
audience for the first time

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.400
something live
happening right now.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.860
And that was a big
surprise, because we

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.330
were wondering if
every one would care.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.790
I think we used it for the
World Series, actually.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880
And so, the first time
we turned that on, it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.320
was a huge surprise at the
sheer number of people that

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.900
didn't know that event was
going on at this moment and then

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.760
would click on
something and come in.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.050
And so we saw a huge
traffic spike, as a result.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.244
And now its part of every day.

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:56.160
You pick the things that
you're interested in.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.002
When you pick things
like news or sports,

00:00:58.002 --> 00:00:59.460
we just inform you
what's going on.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.110
We're in 55
different car models.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.490
We're in things like
connected speakers,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.400
like Sonos or Samsung.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.880
We're in connected televisions
like Samsung or with Google,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.760
with Google TV.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.112
And so in total, those
200 different platforms

00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:20.070
are a big product challenge,
because how do you

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.050
design a consistent experience
when sometimes there's

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.227
no screen and sometimes
it's an 80-inch screen

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:27.310
and everything in between?

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:32.700
I think that's one of the really
interesting things about being

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.510
an entrepreneur.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.640
When you're at a big
company, what happens

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.590
is you start gobbling up
additional things that

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.590
become your task and
your responsibility

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.184
as you climb up
through the ranks.

00:01:42.184 --> 00:01:43.600
But when you're
at a startup, it's

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.440
more about firing yourself
as swiftly as possible.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.970
How do you get rid
of tasks and hire

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.930
someone who's better than
you are at something?

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.980
And then you do that
over and over again.
