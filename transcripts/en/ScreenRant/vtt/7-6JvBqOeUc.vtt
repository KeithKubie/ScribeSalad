00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.500
Over the past decade, China has emerged has
emerged as one of the most important markets

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.370
in the world for film distribution.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.270
Even big-budget movies that bomb in the US
sometimes become profitable in China, like

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.020
Warcraft did earlier this year.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.750
Still, China’s government isn’t completely
open to Hollywood films crowding their movie

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.750
screens.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.300
Sometimes, movies get banned for reasons you
wouldn’t even think of.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.110
Here is Screen Rant’s list of 10 Famous
Movies That Were Banned In China.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.189
Star Wars: A New Hope
Last year’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.020
was a huge hit in China last year, but ironically,
the first Star Wars was never released in

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.020
the country.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.380
Back in 1977, the only movies that got to
play in the communist nation were produced

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.380
by the government.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.860
Mao Zedong, the long time dictator of China,
only died one year before George Lucas made

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.610
Star Wars, and he didn’t want the people
of China to be “corrupted” by western

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.190
influences.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.200
It wasn’t until 1994 that the government
opened up the market to only 10 foreign films

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.200
a year.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.379
Recently, that quota has been increased to
34 foreign films per year, but it’s still

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.600
far more restrictive than most countries.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.720
To Live
Hollywood movies aren’t the only ones to

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.310
get banned in China.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.350
In 1994, acclaimed Chinese filmmaker Zhang
Yimou made the film To Live.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.920
The film played at the Cannes Film Festival,
where it won the Grand Prix, and was released

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.100
across the world to fantastic reviews.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100
But the one place it couldn’t be released
was China.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.619
Taking place in the early decades of China’s
Communist regime, the film was accused of

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.420
portraying the government and its policies
in a negative light.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.619
Not only was the movie banned, but the director
was forbidden from making movies for two years.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.090
Still, it’s regarded as a classic by connoisseurs
of Chinese cinema.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.689
Brokeback Mountain
Brokeback Mountain is an Oscar-winning drama

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.479
about a forbidden romance between two cowboys.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.490
Due to its subject matter, the movie was even
controversial when it came out in the United

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.869
States in 2005, so you can imagine how it
went over in China.

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.270
Chinese censors rejected the movie for its
depiction of homosexuality, but the government

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.829
was also ambivalent about the success of its
Taiwanese director, Ang Lee.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.399
To this day, China still claims that Taiwan
is a part of its territory, from a conflict

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.439
that dates back to the Chinese civil war in
the 1940s.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.280
Still, that didn’t stop a state-run Chinese
newspaper from declaring “Ang Lee is the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.670
pride of Chinese people all over the world”
when he won the Oscar for Best Director.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.250
Avatar
Avatar may be the most financially successful

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.890
movie of all time, but it didn’t get much
help from China.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.640
Two weeks after it was released in 2009, the
Chinese government unexpectedly banned the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.040
movie, and forced theaters to replace it with
an historical epic about the life of Confucius.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.190
Apparently, the government was worried that
the movie’s depiction of the Na’vi -- you

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.470
know, the blue people -- would inspire a popular
revolt among the people of China.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.070
Weirdly, however, they only banned the movie
in 2D.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.560
It continued to play in about 900 3D theaters
after they put the ban into effect.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.090
Back to the Future
A number of these movies were banned for political

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.780
reasons, but here’s a movie that was banned
for the grave crime of… time travel?

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.110
In 2011, China banned depictions of time travel,
which was becoming an increasingly popular

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.390
trope in Chinese film and television at the
time.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.880
Apparently, there was concern that depictions
of time travel were disrespectful to the history

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.140
of China, especially when characters end up
re-writing Chinese history.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.340
One casualty of this ban was the super-popular
‘80s comedy Back to the Future.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.080
If you’ll remember, Marty McFly not only
changes the course of history in that film,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.470
but also introduces Chuck Berry’s cousin
to the guitar riffs of “Johnny B. Goode,”

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.600
surely angering Rock-n-roll purists all over
the world.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.200
Ghostbusters
Paul Feig’s recent reboot of the Ghostbusters

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.700
franchise was controversial in the United
States because the original film’s busters

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.620
were exchanged for an all-female cast.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.160
But in China, it got rejected by the censors
for a completely different reason: It was

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.860
because the country is still suspicious of
movies that “promote superstition.”

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.230
Though this rule may seem silly in relation
to Ghostbusters, it often applies to films

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.680
that depict ghosts and other supernatural
beings.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.030
Sony reportedly tried to appease censors by
removing the character for “Ghost” from

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.050
the Chinese title, but the film still wasn’t
approved for release.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.350
Considering the film’s disappointing box
office in the US, is was probably a blow to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.750
the studio that they’re missing out on the
Chinese audience.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.310
Shinjuku Incident
For over a century, Hong Kong was a British

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.560
colony, separate from the Chinese mainland.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.960
To this day, it still retains a degree of
independence over its own affairs -- including

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.380
its famous film industry.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.230
In 2009, Hong Kong superstar Jackie Chan produced
and starred in a hardboiled crime film called

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.230
Shinjuku Incident.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.060
While the film was released in Hong Kong without
incident, mainland Chinese censors banned

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.040
the film on the grounds that it was too violent
for Chinese audiences.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.350
China has yet to implement a rating system
like other countries, so Jackie Chann has

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.290
made more family-friendly action comedies
in the years since.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.710
Deadpool
Deadpool was another film that was rejected

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.090
by Chinese censors for its adult material.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.810
Comic book fans flocked to the movie on account
of its irreverent, potty-mouthed sense of

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.130
humor, but that’s the exact same reason
it never made it to theatres in China.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.520
Without the equivalent of an “R” rating
to keep out kids, censors had no choice but

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.180
to ban the movie entirely.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.289
Movies are sometimes edited to appease censors
in China, but that hardly would have been

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.099
possible for a movie like Deadpool.

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.330
The Ryan Reynolds-starring superhero movie
is so full of dirty jokes and gruesome violence

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.009
that studios would probably have to cut most
of the movie to make it suitable for all ages.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.430
The Dark Knight
Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight is another

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.900
comic book film that was rejected by Chinese
censors.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.699
It’s been speculated that the film was rejected
because of a scene where Batman captures a

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.060
fugitive from an office tower in Hong Kong
and extradites him to the US to face prosecution.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.750
The Chinese government probably didn’t like
the way Batman flouted international law or

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.770
Chinese sovereignty.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.900
They also may have objected to a brief cameo
from singer Edison Chen.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.460
Sexually explicit photographs of the Hong
Kong celebrity leaked online earlier that

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.389
year, and he had become quite controversial
by that point in time.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.009
Regardless, The Dark Knight is widely available
on pirated DVDs for Chinese comic book fans.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.789
Suicide Squad
Suicide Squad was a major hit when it was

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.039
released in the US, but it never even got
a chance in China.

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.879
Even though it was retitled to the less suggestive
“Task Force X” for a potential release,

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.400
the government hasn’t included it in their
quota of Hollywood films for 2016.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.629
This could be because of the violence, or
because of the supernatural themes, or maybe

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.830
they just didn’t like the idea of a movie
about supervillains who become heroes.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.729
Perhaps Jared Leto’s performance as The
Joker was just a tad bit too twisted for Chinese

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:37.729
authorities.

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.800
Whatever the case, it’s a big blow to Warner
Bros., whose Batman v Superman earned a big

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.699
chunk of its box office in China earlier this
year.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:45.699
-

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:46.699
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.569
Were any others banned from China for crazy
reasons?
