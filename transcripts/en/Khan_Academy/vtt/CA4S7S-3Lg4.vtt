00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.430
Graph the solution
set for this system.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.930
It's a system of inequalities.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.480
We have y is greater than x
minus 8, and y is less than 5

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.180
minus x.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.370
Let's graph the solution set
for each of these inequalities,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.230
and then essentially
where they overlap

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.380
is the solution set for the
system, the set of coordinates

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.020
that satisfy both.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.360
So let me draw a
coordinate axes here.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.730
So that is my x-axis, and
then I have my y-axis.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.540
And that is my y-axis.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.490
And now let me draw
the boundary line,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.059
the boundary for this
first inequality.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.600
So the boundary line
is going to look

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.596
like y is equal to x minus 8.

00:00:43.596 --> 00:00:44.970
But it's not going
to include it,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.966
because it's only
greater than x minus 8.

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.170
But let's just graph x minus 8.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.310
So the y-intercept
here is negative 8.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.030
When x is 0, y is
going to be negative 8.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.030
So just go negative 1,
negative 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.780
So that is negative 8.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.850
So the point 0, negative
8 is on the line.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.890
And then it has a slope of 1.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.330
You don't see it right there,
but I could write it as 1x.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.752
So the slope here
is going to be 1.

00:01:13.752 --> 00:01:15.710
I could just draw a line
that goes straight up,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.240
or you could even say that it'll
intersect if y is equal to 0,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.890
if y were equal to 0,
x would be equal to 8.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.810
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.707
And so this is x is equal to 8.

00:01:29.707 --> 00:01:31.290
If it has a slope
of 1, for every time

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.414
you move to the right 1,
you're going to move up 1.

00:01:33.414 --> 00:01:35.770
So the line is going to
look something like this.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.840
And actually, let me not
draw it as a solid line.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.270
If I did it as a
solid line, that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600
would actually be this
equation right here.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.750
But we're not going
to include that line.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.352
We care about the y values that
are greater than that line.

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:49.060
So what we want to do
is do a dotted line

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.268
to show that that's just
the boundary, that we're not

00:01:51.268 --> 00:01:54.020
including that in
our solution set.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.270
Let me do this in a new color.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.310
So this will be the
color for that line,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.030
or for that inequality,
I should say.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.260
So that is the boundary line.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.960
And this says y is
greater than x minus 8.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.563
So you pick an x,
and then x minus 8

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:10.979
would get us on
the boundary line.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.100
And then y is greater than that.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.010
So it's all the y values above
the line for any given x.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.646
So it'll be this region above
the line right over here.

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:24.020
And if that confuses
you, I mean,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.890
in general I like to just
think, oh, greater than,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.970
it's going to be above the line.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.980
If it's less than, it's
going to be below a line.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.355
But if you want
to make sure, you

00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:32.130
can just test on either
side of this line.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.370
So you could try the
point 0, 0, which

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.050
should be in our solution set.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.460
And if you say, 0 is
greater than 0 minus 8,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.431
or 0 is greater than
negative 8, that works.

00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.680
So this definitely should
be part of the solution set.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.110
And you could try something
out here like 10 comma 0

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.320
and see that it doesn't work.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.340
Because you would have 10 minus
8, which would be 2, and then

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.080
you'd have 0.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.800
And 0 is not greater than 2.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.310
So when you test
something out here,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.962
you also see that it won't work.

00:02:56.962 --> 00:02:58.420
But in general, I
like to just say,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.040
hey look, this is
the boundary line,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.690
and we're greater than the
boundary line for any given x.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.990
Now let's do this one over here.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.080
Let's do this one.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.260
The boundary line for
it is going to be y

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.480
is equal to 5 minus x.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.510
So the boundary line is
y is equal to 5 minus x.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.790
So once again, if x
is equal to 0, y is 5.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.460
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.310
And then it has a
slope of negative 1.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.850
We could write this as y is
equal to negative 1x plus 5.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.620
That's a little bit
more traditional.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.430
So once again, y-intercept at 5.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.170
And it has a slope
of negative 1.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.720
Or another way to think
about it, when y is 0,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.330
x will be equal to 5.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.176
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:44.800
So every time we move
to the right one,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.730
we go down one because we
have a negative 1 slope.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.190
So it will look like this.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.780
And once again, I want
to do a dotted line

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.727
because we are-- so
that is our dotted line.

00:03:57.727 --> 00:03:59.310
And I'm doing a
dotted line because it

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.640
says y is less than 5 minus x.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.870
If it was y is
equal to 5 minus x,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.000
I would have included the line.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.360
If it was y is less than
or equal to 5 minus x,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.930
I also would have
made this line solid.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.110
But it's only less than,
so for any x value,

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.250
this is what 5
minus x-- 5 minus x

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.790
will sit on that boundary line.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.160
But we care about the y values
that are less than that,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.250
so we want everything
that is below the line.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.650
And once again, you can test
on either side of the line.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.240
0, 0 should work for this
second inequality right here.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.370
0 is indeed less than 5 minus 0.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.710
0 is less than 5.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.140
And then you could try
something like 0, 10

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.270
and see that it doesn't
work, because if you had 10

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.610
is less than 5 minus
0, that doesn't work.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.070
So it is everything
below the line like that.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.230
And like we said,
the solution set

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.810
for this system are all
of the x's and y's, all

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.000
of the coordinates that
satisfy both of them.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.030
So all of this shaded
in purple satisfies

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.330
the second inequality.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.680
All of this shaded in green
satisfies the first inequality.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.470
So the stuff that satisfies
both of them is their overlap.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.460
So it's all of this
region in blue.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.320
Hopefully this isn't
making it too messy.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.340
All of this region in blue
where the two overlap,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.470
below the magenta dotted
line on the left-hand side,

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.340
and above the
green magenta line.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.840
That's only where they overlap.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.350
So it's only this
region over here,

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.398
and you're not including
the boundary lines.
