00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.640
PROFESSOR: Today, we are having
a table read, which basically

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.700
means that we're all going
to go around and read

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.890
the scripts where you have
them standing as if now.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.820
The way it'll work is
that say, Siri goes first.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.000
She would read the script aloud.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.310
We would all keep our laptops
closed for the first reading.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.390
So just listen to her
script as it flows.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.030
And then the second
time she reads it,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.790
we will follow along on her
script on annotation studio

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.120
and make notes in real time.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.480
And then afterwards we'll
talk about any feedback

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.076
that we have for her.

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:02.316
And then we'll just
go around the class.

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:04.149
Do you want to say
anything before we start?

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.584
AUDIENCE: I think not
really, other than the fact

00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:12.000
that, I'm sure you
guys know this,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.040
but feedback is best
when it's very specific.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.690
So as we give feedback
to each other,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.565
and you've been doing
this for the most part,

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.470
is to just really
as much mentioning

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.265
the things that
really work as it does

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:25.850
the things that don't work.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.980
Because I'm sure you all
maybe felt this way when

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.875
we were work-shopping the
other day, but as a writer,

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.416
it's very hard to put yourself
out there and have people just

00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:36.660
give you critical feedback.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.220
So if we can also
remember to just

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.859
give some positive critical
feedback as well, about things

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:42.400
that we liked and
things that worked,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.676
that helps the person in the hot
seat feel a little bit better.

00:01:45.676 --> 00:01:46.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah, for sure.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.600
And I also wanted to say, don't
be afraid to repeat comments

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600
that other people
have made, especially

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.950
on annotation studio.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.440
If you notice that someone has
made the same note that you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.600
were going to make,
just that tag a reply

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.240
to it saying like
ditto or something.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.250
Because that'll draw
people's attention to a space

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.742
that's worth looking
at a little bit more.

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:09.325
AUDIENCE: Andrea had
something to say.

00:02:09.325 --> 00:02:10.220
I just want to make
sure I don't lose it.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.680
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.180
Sorry.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.620
AUDIENCE: Just one of the
techniques that I learned,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.770
actually from an
entrepreneurship class,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.220
was the technique of
doing the yes/and,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.810
as a way of giving positive
feedback where you're

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.910
sort of riffing a little
bit or adding something

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.340
to what somebody just said.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.800
And I think you guys did that,
actually, in your comments.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.434
And that was received
very positively,

00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:30.850
because it's like
yes, you get it,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.621
and you're adding more to it.

00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.120
PROFESSOR: And I will say that
looking over the scripts that

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.790
were sent in this
weekend, I think

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.680
everyone's in a really good
spot as far as ideas go.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.120
Like the topics of your
videos are actually

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.460
very, very fascinating.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.370
So it's a really
good space to be in.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.930
I think that the common
sort of room for improvement

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.690
that people have right now is
connecting specific examples

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.039
to the bigger picture.

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.830
And I think that you
get that in your head,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.980
but making it a little more
explicit in your script

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.620
is where your focus
should be on next.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.340
And I tried to give some
of that feedback online.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.660
And maybe today I can explain
some more of the comments

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.790
if you didn't
understand them as well.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.490
But connecting the facts
that make up a tutorial video

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.210
into a bigger picture, like
this is why you should care,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.720
is a very tricky thing to do.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.380
But hopefully today, with the
feedback of everyone in class,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.590
you can have a better
sense of how to do it.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.840
And I'll also say that
at the end of the day

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.320
this is your video, and the
final decisions are up to you.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.580
So it is OK if people offer
different pieces of advice,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.070
conflicting opinions.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.780
In a lot of my feedback
I was saying this

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.120
as a matter of personal taste.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.870
I don't really find this
necessary in this part.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.024
And that's OK.

00:03:49.024 --> 00:03:51.190
Final decisions are up to
you as long as you sort of

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.250
justify why you've made
the choices that you have.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.200
And that I don't want you to
feel like you need to come away

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.680
from this table read with
a checklist of things

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.980
that you need to do.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.000
And then once you do
them, like, the script

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.770
is magically finished.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.380
Because that's not
going to happen.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.040
And unfortunately, that's
sort of how a lot of us

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.760
approach these sort of things.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.540
At least that's how I
first approached them.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.899
So it's OK to repeat people.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.620
Constructive feedback is good.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.330
The yes/and thing
is a good strategy.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.925
And I don't know if
there's anything else.

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:30.675
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I'm the only one who

00:04:30.675 --> 00:04:33.060
doesn't know how to get onto
the annotation software.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.930
Does everyone know
how to do that?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.440
No?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.910
Yes?

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.311
OK, then maybe I'm
the only one who

00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:38.100
doesn't know how to do this.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.470
AUDIENCE: Here's the
homework on the first day.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.800
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.425
AUDIENCE: There's a
link on the Tumblr.

00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:42.272
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:04:42.272 --> 00:04:44.730
We should probably, in order
to make this run smoothly, all

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.784
be ready so that
there isn't a big gap

00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:47.950
in between the first person.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.469
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:59.982 --> 00:05:01.940
PROFESSOR: Oh, this will
also be an opportunity

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.050
to practice hosting.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.070
So whenever you're
reading the script,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.470
it's OK if things aren't
memorized completely.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.860
But try to deliver it
as you would on screen

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.150
and we'll give you feedback
on the hosting as well.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.890
So for this first
reading, Julia, just

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.100
go ahead and read
it start to finish.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.400
If you have queues for like
b-roll or something like that,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.950
just say this is the part where
I'm going to have some b-roll.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.030
AUDIENCE: OK, and should I
also describe the animations?

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.210
PROFESSOR: Um, yeah.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.190
Just like briefly,
briefly go over that.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.050
And so for this first
read, everyone just

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.990
close the computers.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.504
If you have to make
notes, do it analog.

00:05:45.504 --> 00:05:46.420
Whenever you're ready.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.210
AUDIENCE: What do a cellphone,
a river, and a cancer cell

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.430
have in common?

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.530
The answer is fractals.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.410
Fractals in mathematics
are never ending patterns.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.080
Scientists can program
these infinite patterns

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.470
by repeating a simple
mathematical process

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.860
over and over.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.380
So if you zoom in, you'll see
the shape-- the same shape,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.670
again and again and again.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.210
And here I would
show an animation

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.230
of that on a computer.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.290
Similarly, a tree grows
by repetitive branching.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.710
Just like a fractal, a
tree extends its branches

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.500
one smaller than the
other, but similar.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.950
A tree can't grow
as far and precisely

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.200
as a truly mathematical fractal,
but we can still study nature

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.830
in terms of fractals.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.120
In fact, so many
things in nature

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.420
have these pattern
properties-- and show animation

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.900
of all those
things-- it sometimes

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.060
feels like the world itself
is one giant fractal.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.410
Rivers of the planet flow
like the blood vessels

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.630
in our bodies.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.160
Lightning bolts become
electrifying rivers of the sky.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.140
And just look at this honey--
show fractal honey-- here's

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.950
something even wackier, a
brain-fractal shaped forest.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.260
One way to explain this
abundance of patterns

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.040
is the fact that nature
is just great at reusing

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.520
efficient mechanisms.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.820
How and why that happens,
we can't really tell.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.970
But although the existence of
fractals remains a mystery,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.280
mathematicians have found a way
to study the wacky structures.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.820
Clouds are not spheres
and bark is not smooth,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.050
but with fractal geometry we
can mathematically explore them.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.220
In the 1970s, a mathematician,
named Benoit Mandelbrot,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.460
was hired to investigate
noise in telephone lines.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.130
Now Mandelbrot loved
connecting images with numbers,

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.740
so he immediately graphed
the data he collected.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.060
And he came up with this--
show Mandelbrot fractal,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.420
and also the equation
that comes along with it.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.680
At first, the image
didn't look too special.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.070
In fact, it kind of resembled
a turtle with a giant head.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.560
It wasn't until night time
that Mandelbrot looked closer.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.160
He zoomed in once and found
a smaller turtle etched

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.960
onto the original one,
and an even smaller turtle

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.150
on that one.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.280
Mandelbrot kept
zooming and zooming

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.610
and the turtles kept
shrinking and shrinking,

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.340
but they were still
all the same shape.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.300
Mandelbrot was convinced
he'd seen a nightmare.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.830
But when the shape remained
on the screen the next day,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.790
Mandelbrot knew he
was onto something

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.490
huge, a simple equation
applied repeatedly,

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.910
carried incredible properties.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.100
What if, thought he, you
could create such expressions

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.530
for other natural phenomena?

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.210
And that's exactly what
mathematicians do today.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.550
Fractal geometry allows them
to model, say, mountain ranges,

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.350
and then use the models to
study earthquakes or creed

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.480
realistic special effects
for our favorite movies.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.289
So you would show
animating a mountain

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.880
range from fractal triangles,
and then a scene from Star Wars

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.300
where that was used,
or other movie.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.990
In healthier news,
fractals may also

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.190
help doctors diagnose cancer
faster and more accurately.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.090
They can study the
edges of various cells

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.410
in our bodies using
fractal geometry.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.000
Here the cell on the right
is more jagged and repeating

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.030
than the one on the
left, which means

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.110
it's the more aggressive,
faster-growing cancer cell.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.570
This way of
discovering cancer can

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.480
be that 10 times more effective
than the current methods.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.430
So that's how cancer
cells and rivers relate.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.360
But what about cell phones?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.710
They aren't really
part of nature.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.050
Well, in the '90s
a radio astronomer

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.290
by the name of Nathan
Cohen was having

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.160
troubles with this landlord.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.210
The man wouldn't let him put
a radio antenna on the roof.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.490
So Cohen decided to make a
more compact fractal radio

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.240
antenna instead.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.850
The landlord didn't notice it.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.400
And it worked better
than the ones before.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.350
Working further, Cohen
designed a new version,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.550
this time using a shape
called the menger sponge.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.530
The fractal's
infinite sponginess

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.100
allowed the antenna to receive
multiple different signals.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.850
The menger sponge is
not really the sponge

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.460
you'd be scrubbing
your back with,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.220
but you can still
think of it like that.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.490
Imagine both water and soap
getting through sponges holes,

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.800
except the water is wifi and
the soap is, say, Bluetooth.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.790
Without Cohen's
sponge, your cellphone

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.830
would have to look
something like a giraffe

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.800
to receive both those signals.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.130
Not quite as handy, is it?

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.360
Fractals are
already very common,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.690
yet we're still searching
for more applications,

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.150
asking questions,
building new patterns,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.810
and exploring nature's best,
here at MIT and everywhere

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.010
in the world.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.010
Look around you.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.600
What beautiful
patterns do you see?

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.864
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:28.864 --> 00:10:29.739
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:10:29.739 --> 00:10:30.760
TEACHER ASSISTANT: Can I ask
a question before we start?

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.676
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:10:31.676 --> 00:10:36.575
AUDIENCE: Is the reason why you
have us not having our laptops

00:10:36.575 --> 00:10:38.980
up so that we don't
want to start writing.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.672
Or from your
perspective, as someone

00:10:42.672 --> 00:10:44.570
who doesn't process
information auditorily,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.150
like with my ears, that was a
really hard activity for me.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.355
Is it possible to still
accomplish your goal

00:10:50.355 --> 00:10:52.392
while looking if we don't type?

00:10:52.392 --> 00:10:54.100
PROFESSOR: So the
reason why George and I

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.792
don't have people look at the
text the first time around

00:10:56.792 --> 00:10:59.000
is because when you're
watching the video, ultimately

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.130
you're not reading it with
the script in front of you.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.170
And you'll notice that there may
be moments where you tune out

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.010
when you don't have a script in
front of you following along,

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.590
which is going to be the
experience that a viewer is

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.180
going to have.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.170
And I know that that's
very difficult to do,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.520
because we don't have the
visuals, which is why we also

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.730
do it again with the script.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.500
But the first time
is more to just like

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.715
experience it as
close to an experience

00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:30.050
as the viewer would
have of the video,

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.690
because they're not going to
be following along with notes.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.320
They're not going to
know what's coming next.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.210
So whatever confusion you may
feel in this first read-through

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.370
is probably more similar to what
an actual viewer of the video

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.224
will feel.

00:11:43.224 --> 00:11:44.890
AUDIENCE: That helps
me understand that.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.120
I can deal with
my discomfort now.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.000
PROFESSOR: So how about
for this next part,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.790
let's all go to
annotation studio

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.205
and look at the
fractals document.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.110
Sorry, my internet's slow.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.000
Would you guys find it more
helpful if, for the second time

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.570
through, everyone got to
read through the script

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.597
at their own pace and
then offered feedback?

00:12:26.597 --> 00:12:27.930
Would you rather do it that way?

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.270
Yes?

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.230
OK.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.130
Then how about everyone take
a look through Julia's script.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.970
Take a couple
minutes to do that.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.260
And if you have feedback
while you're reading through,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.610
go ahead and make notes.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.956
And then we'll talk
about it afterwards.

00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:46.720
All right, has everyone gotten
a chance to at least read

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.246
through the whole script?

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:49.745
OK.

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.180
Let's go ahead and
talk about it now,

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.164
just in the interest of time.

00:12:57.164 --> 00:12:58.830
Julia, did you want
to talk a little bit

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.620
about some of the
edits you were already

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.420
thinking about making
or some of the things

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.660
that you're struggling
with right now?

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:13.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so what the
instructors have suggested

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:20.880
is to take out some of
the stories and examples

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.860
and focus on one story,
which is the one that

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.150
has to do with the
cellphone, because that

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.720
is an example of taking
a mathematical concept

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.430
and applying it to real life.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:39.690
So that way I could delete or
shorten the Mandelbrot story.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:44.190
But also some of the examples
of fractals in nature,

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:49.350
I would focus on them less and
kind of put them at the end,

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.950
maybe describe them less.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.710
But instead, explain more what
a fractal is and some equations

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.070
that come along with it, which
to me is the hardest part,

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.080
because the equations
of fractals,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.040
even though they are--

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.290
So the equation for
Mandelbrot, for example, is z

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.700
equals z squared plus c.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.300
But the z's in there
are complex numbers.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.140
And you just keep
iterating the equation.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.280
So even though it could
be simple to show what's

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.960
happening in just a quick
animation kind of plugging

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.790
in numbers and see
what happens, I

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.790
cringe at the idea of
simplifying it to that,

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.840
because that is not necessarily
the accurate representation.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.900
So that's why originally I
did not include the equation.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.870
I kind of wanted
to, maybe, animate

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.050
just the z equals
z squared plus c

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.980
at some point just to
show what it looks like,

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.750
but let the reader kind of
explore that on their own

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.560
if they wanted to.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.070
So I guess right now
my biggest problem

00:14:55.070 --> 00:15:02.780
is can I and should I include
more math in this or not?

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.780
PROFESSOR: I mean I don't
think it's necessarily

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.870
about the math.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:11.160
I think that the script has
a good specific example.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.070
And it has a really
great big picture.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.610
Like the pitch is awesome.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.710
I think that's a really
great point to work from.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.610
It's just that the connecting
piece seems a little bit--

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.880
like there's not as much
connective tissue there.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.320
So when I'm reading
through this,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.080
and I saw Nathan kind of
had a similar comment, too,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.190
I don't quite get how all the
specific examples actually

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.080
relate to that big picture.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.860
And for me, personally, it was
understanding what exactly-- I

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.030
don't fully understand
what a fractal is yet,

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.140
so I can't make
that jump with you

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.820
to all the applications
of fractals.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.450
So I understand what you're
saying how the math itself

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.500
is maybe a little
complicated to explain,

00:15:52.500 --> 00:16:00.230
but I don't understand how
a fractal is math, I guess.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.120
Does that make sense
to other people?

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.180
I don't know if anyone else
felt that same confusion But it

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.180
was like, I get
the turtle thing,

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.660
and I get it's a
repeating thing,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.499
but I don't understand
how math describes that.

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:18.040
AUDIENCE: OK, I guess that's an
easy fix because you can just

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.320
say there's an equation
that goes along

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.250
with all of these fractals
that we can program.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.320
AUDIENCE: I had a
similar-- like to me,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.770
that's the big piece
that's missing with this.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.620
That being said, let's
pause and take a moment,

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.740
and like you're big idea
at the very beginning

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.670
was to talk about how
math isn't real, right?

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.849
And this is so amazing
that you've come so far.

00:16:38.849 --> 00:16:40.640
And these stories--
that I just commented--

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.026
that they make it
real in this way

00:16:43.026 --> 00:16:44.400
that when we were
first sketching

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.860
on the board that first day,
you were really struggling

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.609
to figure out what
were those anchors that

00:16:48.609 --> 00:16:52.810
were going to help you talk
about that abstract idea.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.640
And I feel like you really
are doing a fantastic

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.710
job at grounding this big
idea in these stories.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.185
That being said, this
is when being an expert

00:17:03.185 --> 00:17:06.140
or thinking deeply about
a topic is so hard,

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.810
being able to separate
and to figure out

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.810
what the rest of the
world does or doesn't

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.530
know about this thing, right?

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.780
To you, what is
probably very obvious,

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.490
and I'm going to be
very honest that I'm

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.470
not quantitative person, right?

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.010
So I'm probably at
a sixth grade math

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:25.848
level for this kind of a video.

00:17:25.848 --> 00:17:28.280
And I completely had a
gap for me being like,

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.125
I faintly recall
having studied fractals

00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:32.570
in my early middle school years.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.750
I remembered that it's
a pattern and I remember

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.590
kind of what it looks like.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.080
I have no idea how
a mathematician goes

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.330
from seeing a tree to being able
to break that into an equation,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.560
and what that would
even look like,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.450
or how it would--
that to me-- and how

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.060
that becomes into a fractal.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.330
And to me, that's a
big mystery to me,

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.180
that I don't want you
to explain everything

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.123
because that would probably
be really boring, honestly.

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:03.310
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.140
AUDIENCE: Totally.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.250
But if there's some
way, on a high level,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:12.490
explain what a mathematician
is doing in there,

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.090
why would I study that?

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.640
Like, the big
questions for me are

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.210
like, why would I want
to study that tree?

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.470
How would I go about doing it in
such a way that would bring me

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:26.050
to some sort of
mathematical-- the why and the

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:30.092
how is very interesting
to me in terms of what

00:18:30.092 --> 00:18:32.550
the mathematician's actually
doing and why they would do it

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.280
and then how you would
apply that to other things.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.180
So I don't need you to go
into the whole equation,

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.473
but I need to understand the
process that a mathematician

00:18:42.473 --> 00:18:43.181
would go through.

00:18:43.181 --> 00:18:44.882
I don't know if you
guys feel similarly.

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:46.340
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking with that,

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.050
what I was thinking
the whole time,

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.220
I know it's not fractal
geometry or anything like that,

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.470
but if you were to take--
you mentioned mountains,

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.429
and just to describe
how they're doing this--

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:59.970
because they know y equals mx
plus b in sixth, seventh grade.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.761
I think that's when
they start to learn it.

00:19:01.761 --> 00:19:05.567
So you could just put
like a slope of this line.

00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:06.900
It's described by this equation.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.070
And it described this
slope of a mountain.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.374
And that's kind of what it does,
just to a lot higher degree.

00:19:12.374 --> 00:19:13.790
I think that's
something that they

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.215
would understand
what they already

00:19:16.215 --> 00:19:17.520
know with the math behind that.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.339
And it's just a little
bit more complex.

00:19:20.339 --> 00:19:22.630
And one part where I thought
that you could put that in

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.580
is in scene three.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.040
So you just described fractals
as never-ending patterns.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.640
So I think there's
room there where

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.128
you could kind of go into--
there's not even much

00:19:33.128 --> 00:19:34.253
rearranging you have to do.

00:19:34.253 --> 00:19:36.660
You could probably just
insert something right there.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.494
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:37.494 --> 00:19:39.452
Good to hear.

00:19:39.452 --> 00:19:40.952
AUDIENCE: I thought
there was really

00:19:40.952 --> 00:19:44.146
good examples that describe--
I thought it was pretty good.

00:19:44.146 --> 00:19:45.645
PROFESSOR: Nathan
brought up a point

00:19:45.645 --> 00:19:48.856
that I also had when I read
this script for the first time

00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:51.326
about having so many examples.

00:19:51.326 --> 00:19:53.737
Do you want to
explain that further?

00:19:53.737 --> 00:19:55.278
AUDIENCE: Well, just
at the beginning

00:19:55.278 --> 00:20:01.370
I thought that there are a lot
of different examples in a row

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.210
that were really cool examples.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.497
But all of them, I
was like, each one I

00:20:06.497 --> 00:20:09.689
tried to stop and think,
well how is that a thing?

00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:10.671
How does that work.

00:20:10.671 --> 00:20:12.117
But then there's
another example.

00:20:12.117 --> 00:20:13.617
I just kind of got
a bit overloaded.

00:20:13.617 --> 00:20:15.590
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.460
I think the animation
might help with that

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.000
because where I talk
about rivers, blood

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.700
vessels, and lightning
bolts, and honey,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.780
if you look at them from above,
like if you have pictures,

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.610
they look very, very similar.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:34.150
So the idea is kind of
to show the similarity.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:41.656
I guess somebody mentioned that
the brain-shaped forest was

00:20:41.656 --> 00:20:42.780
kind of overkill with that.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.160
So I can definitely
understand that.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.470
PROFESSOR: I think that
they're good examples.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.530
But what might be
an issue here is

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.620
that it's taking too long to
get to the bulk of the video.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.260
And this is something
that George and I

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.690
were talking about, too, that
you have really three themes

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:08.910
in this video, cancer cells,
nature, and cellphone lines.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.190
And I like how you open it with
what do all these things have

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.830
in common.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.200
But there's honestly so much
to explore in each facet,

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.250
that I'm wondering if you
should just really focus on one,

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.150
like you had said earlier.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.190
Just because the thing that
I kept thinking about-- which

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.050
is along the lines
of Nathan's thinking,

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.090
and I mentioned it
in the comments,

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.880
too-- but it really reads
like a BuzzFeed article almost

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.040
at the beginning, with
all these examples.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.430
And I keep thinking about
how awesome of an article

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.060
it would be with
like GIFs showing

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.490
all these different things.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.870
But there's not enough
of a compelling reason

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.510
to make a video
out of it, right?

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.460
The whole story line of
what's his name, Nathan Cohen,

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.840
is actually, I thought that
was really interesting.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.130
I don't know what
example you guys

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:58.490
thought was the most compelling
to listen to or read.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.561
What did you guys feel
about the cancer cells or--

00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:05.120
AUDIENCE: From a
biologist's standpoint,

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.655
exactly what your concerns are
with reducing the equations

00:22:09.655 --> 00:22:15.060
and math, that's what I felt you
did unintentionally with cancer

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.822
cells, in that you have to
this really punchy statement,

00:22:18.822 --> 00:22:20.280
like this way of
discovering cancer

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.085
can be about 10 times
more effective than

00:22:22.085 --> 00:22:23.080
the current methods.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.100
But coming from a
biology background,

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.180
you cut out so
much in explaining

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.690
how cancer is detected,
what are the current methods

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.700
and comparing it to the fact
that the edges of the blubbing

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.350
cells look like fractals
in the first place.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.350
And so for me this was
your weakest example.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.600
And I enjoyed
reading your script.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.297
And the other examples,
I feel like just

00:22:47.297 --> 00:22:49.630
because you spent more time
explaining them and fleshing

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.175
them out, and you have, I think
from your background, a better

00:22:53.175 --> 00:22:56.425
understanding of the
Nathan Cohen story.

00:22:56.425 --> 00:22:58.980
They just sounded like
stronger examples.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.700
So in my opinion, cut out the
cancer even though it's cool

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.050
and cancer is a
very hot topic right

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.260
now in all fields of study.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.700
I think people will get more out
of your video and more focused

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.345
point if you choose
fewer stories to tell.

00:23:15.345 --> 00:23:16.970
AUDIENCE: And by
doing so, you actually

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.210
allow yourself to be able to
allude to the cancer topic

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.210
without diving into it.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.530
If you pick the Nathan
story, for instance,

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:29.280
and you go more deeply into
explaining more of the meat

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.050
that we're talking
about, it doesn't

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.172
mean that you don't get to
mention how fractals could have

00:23:36.172 --> 00:23:38.130
an impact on cancer, right?

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.042
It doesn't give
you the same depth,

00:23:40.042 --> 00:23:43.090
but it's easier to
apply the concept

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.160
when you understand
something deeply in that way.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.092
If that makes sense.

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:49.336
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it
does make sense.

00:23:49.336 --> 00:23:51.210
PROFESSOR: I think in
general, and again this

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.740
is sort of something that I
saw with a lot of scripts,

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.880
it's a lot of breadth
and not enough depth.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.110
So lots of examples,
but sort of shallowly

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.997
sitting on top of them.

00:24:01.997 --> 00:24:04.080
I think this is an opportunity
to really challenge

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.540
your audience and teach them
something really substantive

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.210
that they're not going
to get in school.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.030
And you can do that
through the example.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.990
And I think there's a
lot that you can cut out.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.770
And again, we've noted
them on the annotation

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.770
so you can see exactly
what we're talking about.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.630
But if you really rely
on showing not telling,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.300
for example scene nine where
you're describing rivers

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.030
of the planet, the
brain-shape forest,

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.840
like you don't even have
to say any of those things

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.260
if you have the images pop up.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.350
Like there are lots of pattern
fractal patterns in nature,

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:39.050
like in rivers, anatomy,
the sky, honey, right?

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.260
Like you've reduced
an entire scene down

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.870
to basically five words there.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.340
The other thing I
wanted to mentioned,

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.987
because this is sort of a
tool that anyone can use,

00:24:51.987 --> 00:24:53.570
we talk a lot about
the reveal, right?

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.778
So Chris was talking about
how you can use the camera

00:24:55.778 --> 00:24:56.750
to make a reveal.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.620
You have a really good
set up for a reveal

00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.690
in the first scene.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.400
What do x, y, z have in common.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.554
That's pretty much exactly how
the plants video was set up.

00:25:04.554 --> 00:25:06.720
What do all these chemical
compounds have in common?

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.450
They all come from plants.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:13.390
And the reveal is that all
these unfamiliar things

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.680
come from a familiar thing.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.610
Here you've got sort
of the reverse set up.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.210
You have all of
these familiar things

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.880
come from an unfamiliar thing.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.200
And I don't think a reveal
works as well, necessarily,

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.220
when you've got that
set up, because people

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.360
don't know what a fractal is.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.150
And so if you maybe switch
scenes three and two,

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.280
or maybe get rid of scene
two, and just go straight

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.840
to seem three, the
answer are never

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:46.080
ending patterns seen in nature
and math called fractals.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.260
That's like a subtle
nuance, but a reveal set up

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.510
to where you lead with
a set of familiar,

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.840
and then you reveal what the
punchline of an unfamiliar.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.820
It doesn't work as
well, necessarily,

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.630
because the response
is going to be "what"

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.641
instead of oh, whoa, plants.

00:26:05.641 --> 00:26:06.140
You know?

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.410
AUDIENCE: Can I add one thing?

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, of course.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:20.870
We talked about how the math
stuff was really complicated.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.280
I feel like this--
maybe I'm way out

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.780
in left field with this one--
but I feel like as soon as you

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.600
feel like you're in
that zone of being like,

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.295
oh, I know a lot about this and
it would be really hard for me

00:26:31.295 --> 00:26:33.630
to figure out how to share
this with my audience, then

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.370
to me, that's our negative
truth is with these videos,

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.600
is figuring out how to share
those complicated ideas

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.097
with the lay-audience.

00:26:41.097 --> 00:26:42.930
As soon as you're in
that uncomfortable zone

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.580
and being like, I
know a lot about this

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.380
and it's complicated,
that's where the truth is.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:49.930
That's it.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.846
That's our gift that
we're offering the world,

00:26:51.846 --> 00:26:54.050
is how can you simplify
a complicated idea

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.410
for the public.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.809
So if you're in that
discomfort place,

00:26:57.809 --> 00:26:59.350
I fell like we need
to live in there.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.240
That's our zone.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.448
That's just the way I see it.

00:27:05.346 --> 00:27:06.720
AUDIENCE: Would
it help if like--

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.964
because I feel like
I'm very curious of all

00:27:08.964 --> 00:27:10.900
the fractals
[INAUDIBLE], would it

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.850
help if [INAUDIBLE]
explained it.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.429
When she said
[INAUDIBLE], I just

00:27:16.429 --> 00:27:18.549
couldn't stop thinking about it.

00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:21.375
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:21.375 --> 00:27:24.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's up
to Julia to figure out

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.687
what style helps her the
best, whether talking it

00:27:27.687 --> 00:27:31.560
out or writing it out or
what is your tool that's

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.810
going to help you to get
that complicated idea shared.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.930
And that's each of your
challenges to figure out

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:38.770
your own learning.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:41.180
To figure out how
do you go into that

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.682
challenging place and figure
out how to simplify it.

00:27:43.682 --> 00:27:46.240
And if it's talking it
out, then that's great.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.470
But maybe it's not for
Julia, I don't know.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.310
PROFESSOR: I also wanted to
use your script as an example

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:58.520
to talk about a broader
thing that everyone can use,

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.840
which is how you set up
things with your intonation.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:09.580
So people generally
associate emphasizing things

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.940
with emphasizing your voice.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.770
At first-- this is scene 12--
at first the image didn't

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:17.580
look too special.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.070
In fact, it kind of resembled
a turtle with a giant head.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.195
But it wasn't until nighttime
that he looked closer

00:28:22.195 --> 00:28:23.160
and he zoomed in.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.287
And there was a smaller
one and a smaller one.

00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:27.120
And he thought they
were all the same shape.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.340
And he had a nightmare.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.020
Like that's sort
of the default way

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.570
that we try to bring focus
onto a natural subject

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.000
when we're hosting.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.050
But you can play a lot with
emphasizing with the smaller

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.990
voice, if that makes sense.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.149
So instead of saying he
zoomed in on a smaller one,

00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:48.690
and a smaller one,
and a smaller one.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.430
And then he had a nightmare.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.232
You can emphasize the
weirdness by pulling back

00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:54.190
at an unexpected point.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:57.230
He zoomed in and he saw a
smaller one, and a smaller

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.070
one, and then a smaller one.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.510
Those are two different types
of deliveries that you can use.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.480
But you don't
always have to rely

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:12.220
on using your volume and sort
of the brashness of your voice

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.930
to emphasize certain
topics, because it

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.020
gets a little repetitive
over the course

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.600
of the entire episode.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.360
So you can do that
for certain sentences,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.490
but for others, really
play up the power

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.550
of actually a quiet volume
and an unexpected pull back

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.710
that also draws attention too.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.680
Does that makes sense to people?

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.830
OK, does that give you
enough to work with?

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.610
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.443
PROFESSOR: I think it's
a really good start.

00:29:39.443 --> 00:29:42.610
And again, let me know if you
guys disagree, but I think

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.530
that if you jump into
the meat of your episode

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:48.950
a little bit earlier, really
dive into the Nathan Cohen

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.930
story, you can use the
anecdotes to actually explain

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.180
some of the things
instead of having

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.030
to take whole scenes to go
over concepts with an analogy

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.321
that you don't need necessarily.

00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:02.945
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
definitely hear that.

00:30:02.945 --> 00:30:04.927
That makes a lot of
sense. [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:04.927 --> 00:30:06.760
PROFESSOR: And just so
you know, I timed it.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.650
And took you five minutes
to read through the script.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.040
And I would give yourselves
about a minute buffer

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.810
room on top of however long it
takes you to read the script

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:16.800
and even describe the scenes.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.190
Because with b-roll
and with cuts,

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.090
you're going to have a little
more time that your video is

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.190
going to last, in addition
to the time it takes

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.090
for you to read the script.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.620
All right, does anyone
want to go next?

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:41.970
How about, the top
one on the list.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:46.750
Why do some people handle
the cold better than others?

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.107
So this is David.

00:30:48.107 --> 00:30:50.690
And did you change the script
at all since last time I saw it?

00:30:56.810 --> 00:31:02.520
DAVID: So my idea was-- I
added some more research,

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.125
to make it more [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:10.837
But I also think that maybe
the wording in it is not ideal.

00:31:10.837 --> 00:31:12.920
PROFESSOR: Wording is
definitely the easiest thing

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.667
to address in editing.

00:31:14.667 --> 00:31:17.000
So why don't you just go ahead
and read the script aloud

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.500
to us.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.409
And if everyone can
pull their laptops down.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.320
DAVID: So why do
people handle cold--

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.020
why do some people handle
cold better than others?

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.870
Why do some people need to where
lots of layers, where others

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.350
feel fine in running shorts.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.040
What makes all the difference?

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.400
Imagine a giant furnace.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.330
To generate more heat, we
need to burn more coal.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.860
Now imagine your body
as this giant furnace.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.860
Our metabolism is the fire.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.550
And sugars, which are broken
down carbohydrates [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.050
are the coals.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.730
Inside your cells, the sugars
are burned by mitochondria

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.650
to produce heat and
ATP, a molecule that

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.470
starts and releases energy
as required by the cell.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.750
To generate more heat for one,
our bodies burn more sugars.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.670
This the first way
we deal with cold.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.350
The second way we
react to cold is

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:07.645
that our blood is restricted
by the other-- our blood is

00:32:07.645 --> 00:32:10.460
restricted through
the other organs.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.270
The blood circulatory
system exits highways

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.510
to the different organs.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.770
Imagine [INAUDIBLE] trucks
carrying oxygen and heat

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.440
to the organs.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.280
As the speed of the
trucks is higher,

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.880
more heat falls out and is
lost to the surroundings,

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.270
hence our body slows
down the flow of blood

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.000
by tightening the blood vessels.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.450
It is the same way as squeezing
a lane on the highway.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.670
The third way is during
more extreme case of cold.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.360
Our body results to quick
skeletal muscle contractions,

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.140
called shivering, in an
intent to create warmth

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.460
by expending energy.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.610
It turns out that our bodies
aren't always equally created.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.930
A team of California
geneticists,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.240
led by Doctor Douglas C.
Wallace of the University

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.500
of California, has found that
many of the world's people

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.370
are genetically
adapted to the cold

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.600
because their ancestors
lived in northern climates

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.030
during the ice age.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:03.120
This is a very big
chuck [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.366
The genetic change affects
basic body metabolism.

00:33:06.366 --> 00:33:07.990
The genetic adaptation
is still carried

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.550
by many northern
Europeans, East Asians,

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:13.640
and American Indians,
most of whose ancestors

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.370
once lived Serbia.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:18.170
But is absent from
people native to Africa.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.570
The genetic change
affects the mitochondria,

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:24.110
causing it to generate more
heat and less chemical energy,

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.200
which was very helpful
to early ancestors trying

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.484
to survive the cold.

00:33:28.484 --> 00:33:30.150
Other than our genetic
make up affecting

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.270
how much we can
withstand the cold,

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.939
our physical makeup also plays
a part in our resist to cold.

00:33:35.939 --> 00:33:38.480
We lose heat to the environment
through convection of the air

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.019
surrounding our bodies.

00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:42.060
When there's a greater
difference in temperature,

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:46.620
or more surface area exposed,
there's a greater heat loss.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.000
We can slow down this process
by reducing the surface

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.400
area in contact with
the cold surface

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.630
or by increasing thermal
resistance by insulation.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.549
In 1877, American
biologist [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:58.549 --> 00:34:00.090
showed that the
length of one's limbs

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.700
affected the amount of heat
lost to the environment.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.880
Bodies with stockier
frames and shorter arms

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.240
mean less surface area
exposed to the cold.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.280
This is so men with
smaller bodies,

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.659
which have more surface area to
volume, lose heat more rapidly.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.080
Fat, which acts
as an insulation,

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.969
helps increase
thermal resistance,

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:19.199
making one lose heat
at a slower rate.

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:21.520
Thus more people with--
[INAUDIBLE] people

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.678
with a healthy [INAUDIBLE] will
be able to withstand the cold.

00:34:25.678 --> 00:34:27.469
Other than our genetic
and physical makeup,

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.370
there's one more way to
resist the cold, meditation.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:32.810
Introducing Wim Hof
from the Netherlands.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.100
In 2009 he completed a full
marathon in temperatures

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.250
below minus 30 degrees
Celsius, dressed

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.070
in nothing but his shorts.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.219
Wim Hof is aptly named
Iceman for his ability

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.870
to withstand extreme cold
conditions by turning up

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.210
internal thermostat of his mind.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.830
Wim Hof practices
geothermal meditation

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.380
that allows his
body to produce more

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.880
heat than the average person.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.610
Now this sounds wishy-washy
and non-scientific,

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:03.010
but a team of researchers, led
by associate professor Maria

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:07.450
[INAUDIBLE], from the
department of psychology at NUS,

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.215
faculty of arts
and social science,

00:35:09.215 --> 00:35:10.590
showed for the
first time that it

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.860
is possible for the
core body temperature

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.340
to be controlled by the brain.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.740
The scientists found that core
body temperature increases

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.250
can be achieved using certain
meditation techniques.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.720
A second study was conducted
with Western participants who

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.090
use a breathing technique of the
geothermal meditative practice.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.050
They were able to
increase their core body

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.880
temperature within limits.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.320
Now that we understand our
genetic and physical makeup,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.525
and how it affects
resistance the cold, as well

00:35:35.525 --> 00:35:37.947
as how to combat the cold,
maybe if the next Ice Age

00:35:37.947 --> 00:35:40.530
were to come, you will better
be able to withstand and survive

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.030
it.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.650
PROFESSOR: Now, so we'll
all go look at his script

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:53.710
and-- actually,
maybe this time we

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.960
can talk more of the feedback
and you can take notes,

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.190
because you took a little
longer than I thought it would.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:03.250
So I just want to leave
enough time for everyone.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.772
But a quick note, when
you guys read your scripts

00:36:05.772 --> 00:36:07.230
during the table
read, read it like

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.890
you would actually host it.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.170
You clocked in at
exactly five minutes,

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:15.920
but you read a lot faster
than you talk normally.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.310
And when people read, they often
have the exact same intonation

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.880
structure when they
read a sentence.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.370
Which is to go, this is how
I'm reading this sentence.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.690
I'm reading it, and my
tone goes down at the end.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.273
I'm reading the next sentence,
and it's going down at the end.

00:36:30.273 --> 00:36:33.140
And so every single
sentence sounds the same.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.940
Does that makes sense?

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.070
And when you do that-- and
I know that you're just

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.970
reading off of the
script, but it's a habit

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:43.350
that everyone falls into.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.109
When you do that,
it makes it very,

00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:47.150
very evident that you're
working off of a script.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.566
When you talk in real life,
you have different intonations

00:36:49.566 --> 00:36:50.520
in your voice.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.160
You go up.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.620
You take kind of pauses.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.900
Your voice goes down at
the end of some sentences.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:00.460
Sometimes it goes up if
you're asking a question.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.780
But when you're reading
verbatim from text,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.340
your intonation tends to
fall into the habit of having

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.070
the same intonation structure.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.370
So just be mindful of that.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.930
And for people who
are going next,

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:13.690
really try to read
your script as you

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.880
would present in the video.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.220
So that was just a quick note.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:24.590
Now how about everyone just
read through the script.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.510
Don't worry about commenting.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.410
And then we'll all just sort
of do live comment feedback

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.570
on this one.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:36.940
OK, so I think this script
has similar strengths

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.110
as Julia's in that you have a
lot of very specific examples.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:44.550
But I think it also
struggles with having

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.410
a hodgepodge of anecdotes,
and not necessarily

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:52.440
a real, unifying,
noticeable theme.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.840
My big question
about this script

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.040
is, is your theme more
about why some people feel

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.510
more comfortable in the cold
or why some people would

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.755
survive better in the cold?

00:38:01.755 --> 00:38:03.130
Because that's a
point that Jamie

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.057
brought up in the last class.

00:38:05.057 --> 00:38:06.430
DAVID: The second.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:07.910
PROFESSOR: The second.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.480
Because what I don't understand
is how these specific examples

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.300
actually imply better
survival in the cold,

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:21.200
because they're all about
you burn more energy

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.870
to produce more heat.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:28.820
But are some people's
genetic makeup actually--

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.560
does it make them more prone
to surviving in the cold?

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.712
Or does it just make them
more comfortable in the cold?

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:36.170
DAVID: Some people's
genetic makeup

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:40.720
allows them to create
more heat, and therefore

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.921
better survive the cold.

00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:43.670
Which is what makes
them more comfortable.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:49.520
PROFESSOR: But the way
you open up the video,

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:54.160
it kind of implies why do some
people wear a lot of layers

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.060
while other people
can go running.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.430
Are you implying that the
people who go running in shorts

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:03.229
could survive being
out in the cold longer?

00:39:03.229 --> 00:39:04.020
DAVID: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.850
They are able to do that
because-- maybe because

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.500
of the reasons
below, maybe they're

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.820
genetic makeup is predisposed
to better withstand the cold.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.110
Or maybe they have
a physical makeup

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:19.540
that is just there
that helps them to do.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.980
PROFESSOR: But is that
scientifically proven?

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.940
DAVID: Yeah.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:29.230
Based on the-- I
cited the documents,

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.956
the scientific study.

00:39:30.956 --> 00:39:33.330
PROFESSOR: Because to me, I
don't know how you guys feel,

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.705
but to me, that's actually
not established with the facts

00:39:35.705 --> 00:39:38.337
that you've given.

00:39:38.337 --> 00:39:40.420
Like if you took the person
who was wearing shorts

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.294
running and the person
who was wearing a coat

00:39:42.294 --> 00:39:45.040
and you stuck them in
Antarctica, would the person

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.974
who was wearing
shorts live longer?

00:39:47.974 --> 00:39:49.640
I mean the person who
was wearing shorts

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.540
wouldn't complain
as soon, right?

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.450
The person who
bundles up, they'd

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.790
complain about being cold,
but would they necessarily

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.470
die first?

00:39:59.954 --> 00:40:02.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]
while you were talking I

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:02.987
put on my jacket.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.850
AUDIENCE: Like I
have seen stuff.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.747
I mean-- and I
know whatever I've

00:40:11.747 --> 00:40:14.330
seen there's probably a million
things out there to debate it,

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:19.040
but if people are in hypothermic
conditions-- and this kind

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.877
of alludes to the
metaphysical, I

00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:24.460
guess, like that aspect of you
talking about with the marathon

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:30.030
runner-- some people are able
to make their core temperature

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:33.710
warmer than it would be in
just like ambient temperature,

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.090
if they're actually in
a colder environment.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.690
I have seen stuff like that.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.340
What I thought would be
cool with that piece,

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.320
though, was if at
the beginning you

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.770
say why do some people handle
the cold better than others,

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.540
well, it's all these questions.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.890
But if you introduced
with like, in 2009,

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.560
whoever ran this marathon
and he was wearing shorts.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.460
Like how was he able to do that.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:00.040
That way I think you're
taking out that first chunk

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.685
and you're replacing it with
what you already have in there.

00:41:02.685 --> 00:41:04.280
So you're shortening
it a little bit.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.581
And I think it's more of an
interesting introduction.

00:41:08.581 --> 00:41:10.205
Because that's the
stuff that I thought

00:41:10.205 --> 00:41:11.663
was really interesting,
is like how

00:41:11.663 --> 00:41:14.820
are people able to do this
and scientists study them

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:19.200
and whatever your facts are.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I agree.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.550
I think it's a much
more compelling opening

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.950
than why do some people
wear shorts outside.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:30.000
So basically moving scene
3C to the beginning.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.432
Go ahead, Julia.

00:41:37.432 --> 00:41:40.786
AUDIENCE: The way that
the scene 3C is currently

00:41:40.786 --> 00:41:43.762
placed it almost seems like
the odd one out because it

00:41:43.762 --> 00:41:45.746
talks about meditation.

00:41:45.746 --> 00:41:48.230
So if you did start with it,
that would be really cool.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:52.656
But also maybe replacing the
word meditation with you're

00:41:52.656 --> 00:41:54.644
controlling something
with your brain,

00:41:54.644 --> 00:41:59.320
just so it seems more like a
scientifically-related concept.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:03.865
And the also,
another thing is you

00:42:03.865 --> 00:42:06.910
name a lot of
scientists and dates.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:11.580
So maybe you could talk about
those experiments but not,

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:14.840
name, people or locations.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.798
That might make it
easier because then you

00:42:16.798 --> 00:42:19.990
don't have to think about
California and Northern Europe

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:25.401
in the same sentence that
mean different things.

00:42:25.401 --> 00:42:27.526
PROFESSOR: Nathan, were
you going to say something?

00:42:27.526 --> 00:42:30.998
AUDIENCE: I actually think
it's more of the second scene.

00:42:30.998 --> 00:42:32.810
I feel like the
second scene is kind

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:37.960
of explaining on a cellular
level and anatomic level

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.800
how we stay warm.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.778
And it doesn't really connect
to well to either the intro

00:42:45.778 --> 00:42:47.272
or the third scene.

00:42:47.272 --> 00:42:49.264
I think it's actually
really interesting,

00:42:49.264 --> 00:42:51.754
but right now it's kind of
like-- it doesn't really

00:42:51.754 --> 00:42:53.414
talk about why
some people do any

00:42:53.414 --> 00:42:55.240
of these better than others.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.726
And then there's only like
one part in the third scene

00:42:58.726 --> 00:43:01.216
where mitochondria is mentioned.

00:43:01.216 --> 00:43:03.955
I think that just needs a
little bit better connected

00:43:03.955 --> 00:43:05.740
to everything else.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.545
PROFESSOR: How
vital is scene two?

00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:11.390
DAVID: Basically,
my thought process

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.870
of how this is going
to go is introduction,

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.700
and then how our body
handles, and what is

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.570
the difference between people.

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:21.270
PROFESSOR: It's a very classic
five paragraph essay form,

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.910
right?

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:29.510
Intro, background knowledge,
question, example, right?

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.190
Which is a very
logical flow of ideas,

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:36.680
which is why so many people
write essays that way.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.070
But I think it's also why
it's reading a little bit

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:42.120
like a news story right now.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:50.240
It's reading a little bit like
a part of a textbook, almost.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.150
And it really-- the
stuff at the end

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:57.800
is really the more interesting
part, to me at least,

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.500
the reason why maybe it should
be a video over an article.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.600
And I think PJ's idea
of moving the example

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.250
from the guy from Iceland
as your opening will

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.870
help with that.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.650
And I also agree with
Nathan that you may not even

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:18.840
need most of scene two, right,
because the point of the video

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.060
isn't to explain
how we stay warm.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.840
The point of the
video is to explain

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:30.380
why some people are more
predisposed to handling

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.850
incredibly harsh
environments than others.

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:37.080
Like I think the concept of
hypothermia is fascinating,

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.170
but that word isn't mentioned
that all in this video.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:41.830
And let me know if
you guys disagree,

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.130
because this is a totally
personal taste thing,

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:47.760
but I feel like that would be
a much more compelling example

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.264
to use than to say you
stay warm by shivering.

00:44:52.264 --> 00:44:54.430
And you stay warm by your
blood vessels contracting.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:57.700
Like those are all very true
facts that don't take away,

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.487
necessarily, from understanding
how people are more

00:45:01.487 --> 00:45:03.820
predisposed, it's just that
you spend such a long amount

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.470
of time on that.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.660
And it takes a while to
get the bulk of your body.

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.830
It's like the same thing that
was happening with Julia's.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:14.010
And it's very
counter-intuitive because it's

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:18.360
very different from typical
science communication.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.480
That's not how you
write a journal article.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.410
With a journal article, you span
like five pages with an intro

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.290
and set up.

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:29.000
But with the video,
I don't think

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.650
you need the second thing.

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:34.980
I think you need bits and pieces
from it to explain the point,

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.770
but what do you guys think?

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.990
AUDIENCE: I think may be to
just like identify second scene.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.880
So it's on a cellular level.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.850
And then we shiver.

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.760
So skeletal.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.480
Maybe just identifying it but
not really expanding on it

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.234
might be something to do.

00:45:55.234 --> 00:45:57.150
PROFESSOR: Jamie, were
you going to something?

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm
just processing.

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:03.180
This is one by going deep
it allows you to go shallow

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.846
as well, like with the Julia
with diving deeply [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:06.846 --> 00:46:09.630
to something else.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:15.495
I'm with you now,
about if we start

00:46:15.495 --> 00:46:18.492
with the idea of
this runner who was

00:46:18.492 --> 00:46:20.900
able to beat the
cold with his him,

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.150
through telling that
story, you can actually

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:26.620
tell me about what's
happening on a cellular level

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.990
and how he was able
to beat it, right?

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.220
So one thing that I think needs
to be said somewhere in this

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.180
is the idea that
if you strip away

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.700
some of the variables
like what people ate

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:45.267
or-- as someone who used to be
a serious hiker, if someone has

00:46:45.267 --> 00:46:47.392
to go to the bathroom versus
doesn't, that actually

00:46:47.392 --> 00:46:49.308
makes a really big
difference on staying warm.

00:46:49.308 --> 00:46:53.680
Because if you think about it,
if you have all this liquid

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.190
and you need to go
to the bathroom,

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:56.675
your body's warming
all of that up.

00:46:56.675 --> 00:46:58.175
And if you just
went to the bathroom

00:46:58.175 --> 00:46:59.690
you'd suddenly get a lot warmer.

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.250
So taking those
variables out, I'd

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:06.790
say all things being the same,
these two fundamental bodies,

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.830
what's going on in
a cellular level?

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:12.340
That helps you understand
the mind breaking,

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:17.300
the cool extreme example
we have of this guy

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.120
beating the system somehow.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.620
But in order to understand how
cool it is that he's broken

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.464
and beat the system,
we kind of need

00:47:24.464 --> 00:47:27.790
to understand what the
norm is for the system.

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.370
So by using him as
your freak example,

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.300
it allows you to also
tell the story of how

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:36.850
things should work in a normal--
do you see what I'm saying?

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:40.190
And then suddenly his story
becomes your streamline,

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:45.010
that forward motion
throughout your video.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:49.200
And the backward telling
of the story of the facts

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:54.154
about how a person
breaks down glucose

00:47:54.154 --> 00:47:57.230
or whatever, ends up being
part of that forward motion

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:00.600
because you're trying to
explain this cool, weird freak

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.800
thing of someone can
actually use their mind

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.760
to change, or at least to appear
to change their temperature.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.570
So I really like
this re-framing.

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:13.980
And I think it allows
you to go deeper

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.344
and to make it more
interesting by doing less.

00:48:17.344 --> 00:48:20.010
PROFESSOR: I think you also need
to bring the point of the video

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:25.900
earlier on, because right
now it comes in scene four

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.430
at the very end.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.250
Maybe if the Ice
Age were to come,

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:32.740
we would better be able to
withstand and survive it.

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.370
It's really random right now,
because you haven't really

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:37.550
set that up as an argument.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:39.980
So I would say put that
at the beginning, too.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.020
Like there was this
guy a long time ago.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:47.310
And he ran this
marathon half naked.

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.980
Why didn't he die?

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:52.840
Is there something
about him that

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.670
is genetically-- don't
say genetically superior

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:57.730
because that's very un-PC.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.670
But you know, are there
genetic traits about him

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:05.550
that would equip him to not only
withstand cold temperatures,

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:07.850
but maybe survive
the next Ice Age.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:11.420
Is there something about him,
about humans like him, that are

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:13.509
different from other people.

00:49:13.509 --> 00:49:15.050
That's what I'm
saying about it needs

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:17.120
to get into the meat and
the bulk of the video

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.240
sooner, because right now it's
a lot of intro, intro, intro.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.490
And the example
doesn't even come

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:31.490
until scene 3C, which is over
halfway through the video.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.110
Does that makes sense to
people, what Jamie just said,

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:37.170
about using a specific
anecdote to describe

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:41.270
a lot of the core concepts
instead of just describing

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.212
the core concept separately?

00:49:43.212 --> 00:49:45.610
Does that make sense?

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.485
AUDIENCE: You can have
a lot of fun with that

00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:49.782
as it being your main story.

00:49:49.782 --> 00:49:55.380
Like imagine you running half
naked across the football field

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.060
with obvious snow out, right?

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.070
That's a really fun intro.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:00.700
I mean, there are
really fun things

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.234
you can do that also
make it concrete.

00:50:03.234 --> 00:50:05.226
Because you've done all
the hard work already,

00:50:05.226 --> 00:50:07.640
which was coming up with
the science behind it.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.870
You've already made it
into a concrete story.

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:13.970
Here are three specific things
that might be happening.

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:17.711
You just need a hook and a story
line to help you tell that.

00:50:17.711 --> 00:50:19.210
PROFESSOR: The
application is what's

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:22.240
going to differentiate it
from a textbook as well.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:28.140
Because right now, scene two
is a textbook moved to video.

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.050
And that's fine, but it's
not going to be interesting,

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:33.950
I think, has all your anecdotes.

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:37.750
I mean I have the concern
that this-- what's

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:41.760
his name-- coldman, Iceman.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.640
I had a concern that is wasn't
scientific enough or robust.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:49.800
But since you added the stuff
about the research from NUS,

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.450
I do think that's interesting.

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.020
Expand on that more.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.870
And cut out stuff from scene
two to give you time to do that.

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:01.200
So I would say open with Iceman.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.890
Open with the big
picture question,

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:06.990
what are the fundamental
qualities about him that

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:10.640
differentiate him from
other humans like me.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.310
Then you can talk about what
exactly happens when people

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:16.260
die of the cold, essentially.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.780
Like why is that happening, it's
because your body can't keep up

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.052
with burning enough fuel.

00:51:22.052 --> 00:51:23.760
So you're talking
about the whole furnace

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.920
concept in that
reason, but you're not

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:30.100
taking the time to separately
explain it to people.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:33.590
And then-- so you
have the example.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.220
You have the huge question.

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.880
You go into the details of
explaining the core concepts.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.810
Then go back out to the
research question again.

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:44.147
Does that makes sense?

00:51:44.147 --> 00:51:46.230
AUDIENCE: I think the
really critical part of what

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:48.396
[INAUDIBLE] just said that's
not in your video right

00:51:48.396 --> 00:51:51.460
now is explaining what happens
when people die of the cold.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:54.920
Because that'll really drive
home your big question,

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.285
how will we survive
the next Ice Age.

00:51:57.285 --> 00:51:59.380
How people died in the
cold in the first place.

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.880
So what happens when these
systems that generate heat

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.380
fail.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.398
And what about them fails.

00:52:05.398 --> 00:52:08.310
AUDIENCE: And this
may be too much.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:12.060
So as author, totally feel
free to ignore this next idea,

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:15.068
but at the very
beginning you talk

00:52:15.068 --> 00:52:19.680
about putting clothes on as a
way of combating that cycle.

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.582
What are the ways that
we-- and I don't want you

00:52:22.582 --> 00:52:24.310
to dive deeply into
this, but it might be

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.900
a nice beginning of a wrap up.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:30.230
What are the ways that
we can fight the cold

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.140
given our current
cellular structure.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.980
So I'm born this way.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:35.760
This is me in the world.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:39.680
What can I do right
now to fight the cold.

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.290
Obviously I can put
on another jacket.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.374
What's my jacket
doing, fundamentally.

00:52:43.374 --> 00:52:45.790
PROFESSOR: And you talk about
that right now in scene two,

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:48.970
but do you see that makes
much more sense in the context

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:50.310
of Jamie's example?

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:52.950
So you don't have to
take the time to say,

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:54.320
let me define shivering.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.980
Let me define
blood constriction.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:01.990
Let me define metabolises.

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:05.390
Don't take the time to define
those things separately

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:06.430
from a context.

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:08.690
Just seamlessly integrate
that into the examples

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:10.240
you're already talking about.

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.620
AUDIENCE: Or would eating a big
spoon of peanut butter help me.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.914
I would want to probably
know some concrete things

00:53:16.914 --> 00:53:19.874
at the end, just wrapping up,
along with the scientific.

00:53:19.874 --> 00:53:22.770
As someone who used to do some
pretty extreme outdoor stuff,

00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:25.286
I know that eating a
spoonful of peanut butter

00:53:25.286 --> 00:53:28.400
actually will help, but why?

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.900
And just bringing it back
on that very concrete level

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:34.580
to your audience, to be like,
because of carbohydrates here.

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:37.590
So next time you're about to
stand out and watch a football

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:41.328
game in the cold, eat
a huge bar of chocolate

00:53:41.328 --> 00:53:45.760
or put on an extra layer,
or something concrete.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.677
And not a lot of time.

00:53:47.677 --> 00:53:49.585
Don't waste a lot of time.

00:53:49.585 --> 00:53:51.493
That might tie it
back to the concrete

00:53:51.493 --> 00:53:52.785
for your audience a little bit.

00:53:52.785 --> 00:53:54.368
PROFESSOR: I wouldn't
end it that way,

00:53:54.368 --> 00:53:56.330
though, because that's
a little too simplistic

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.140
for what you could do.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.430
So end it by tying it back to
the big question, for sure.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.950
And that's what I meant when
I said in your comments,

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.130
like what type of
research is going on.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:10.530
Because there must be people
out there who are studying ways

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:13.740
to sort of trick our
bodies against the way

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:18.120
we're naturally hardwired beyond
just putting on another jacket.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.720
So if you can talk
about those things,

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.530
I mean that's
another opportunity

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:24.970
to differentiate it from a
traditional textbook content.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.970
So right, now the way
your script is structured,

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:32.290
is simple question,
facts, background facts,

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:36.860
a bunch of research questions,
and then really good question.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:40.360
That's like a very standard
five paragraph format.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.560
I would say restructure it
so that you open with one

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.470
of the anecdotes, Iceman.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:48.320
Open with the big question.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.500
Go into the details in the
context of the example.

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.560
Then go back out to
the research question.

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.770
Then you can do what Jamie
says, which is like well,

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.870
if some people, like
Iceman, just are better off,

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.220
like what about
for the rest of us?

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.740
What are researchers
doing or what can

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:12.110
we practically do to
sort of trick nature.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:15.345
And then point it back to
the big question again.

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:16.220
Does that make sense?

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:19.710
AUDIENCE: It might be
worth it to-- hibernation's

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:23.690
like a hot topic right now with
all the space travel and stuff

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:25.610
that they're thinking of.

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:28.610
So that's like-- I
mean that's addressing

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:31.170
eating a lot, low
metabolic, it kind of,

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.240
I think, gets all of that.

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:39.290
PROFESSOR: But also they're
doing that for space research,

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:40.430
too, right?

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:46.710
There are a lot of
resources at your disposal,

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:48.790
so you can talk about
things that have never

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:50.720
been talked about before.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.617
That's the whole
point of these videos.

00:55:53.617 --> 00:55:55.200
That's what I mean
by don't leave them

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.390
as instructional
tutorial videos,

00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:02.250
because anyone can make those,
but we have current research

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.134
at our disposal.

00:56:03.134 --> 00:56:04.550
There's so many
things that we can

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:07.260
talk about that just haven't
been talked about yet,

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:11.230
so I really want you to spend
most of the time of your videos

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:12.596
on that.

00:56:12.596 --> 00:56:14.304
AUDIENCE: And you
might be able to find--

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:16.200
I mean I have no idea
who does this on campus--

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.616
but I bet we could probably
do some research to figure out

00:56:18.616 --> 00:56:20.470
is anyone in [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:21.976
I don't know, someone.

00:56:21.976 --> 00:56:23.940
There might be someone
on campus that you

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.440
could talk to that's doing some
research on this [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:26.940
thing.

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.416
If you could add a little
of that it would be cool.

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.440
What's the pacing that
you're planning for this?

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.174
PROFESSOR: Pacing for today?

00:56:41.174 --> 00:56:43.340
AUDIENCE: Like how many
people are we hoping to get?

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:46.006
PROFESSOR: I was going to try to
get as many people as we could.

00:56:46.006 --> 00:56:48.720
Tomorrow I'm going to do my
last lecture to give you guys

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.345
more time to work on your video
than we had originally planned.

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.589
Yeah, so just as many as
we can get through today.

00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:58.380
Whatever we don't finish
we'll do tomorrow.

00:57:00.674 --> 00:57:02.340
AUDIENCE: We should
probably give people

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.330
a chance to break soon.

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:04.454
PROFESSOR: Yes, absolutely.

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:08.070
Let's do one more and
then take a break.

00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:10.610
David, do you have any
questions about that?

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:12.767
About all of our feedback?

00:57:12.767 --> 00:57:13.558
DAVID: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:18.478 --> 00:57:21.670
AUDIENCE: So for
example, one section

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:28.820
I think could be condensed to
a single sentence, like 3A.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.930
So you have this
really big paragraph.

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:33.070
It's like a paragraph
in your essay.

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:34.620
You have a citation
and everything.

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.890
But that section
can just be reduced

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:43.850
to some people have
different mitochondria, which

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:47.080
generates more hear and
less chemical energy.

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.317
Like that's it.

00:57:48.317 --> 00:57:50.589
That was the essence
of section 3A.

00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:51.380
DAVID: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:00.604
AUDIENCE: You are-- you are a
reliable narrator, inherently,

00:58:00.604 --> 00:58:01.580
in your video.

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.240
So this is a citation
to something,

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.740
as something you can include
in the video description below.

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.092
And oftentimes a lot of
educational channels do.

00:58:09.092 --> 00:58:11.300
It's like, if you want to
do further reading on this,

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.220
you can include it
in the description.

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:20.550
But if you say a statement like
that, that because of genetics,

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:23.900
because of the
hard-wiring of our DNA,

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:27.756
some people's mitochondria is
more efficient in this way,

00:58:27.756 --> 00:58:29.950
less efficient in this way.

00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:31.480
They're accepting this.

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:35.660
And I think because
you're a scientist

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.450
and because you're
making this at MIT,

00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:39.750
that adds to your reliability.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:43.280
And the fact that, for your
more dubious claims, which

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:47.230
in my opinion are the mediation
stuff, because psychology

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.710
is inherently a
more dubious field,

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:51.685
like anything with
people's brains,

00:58:51.685 --> 00:58:55.160
we have a very, very loose
understanding of brains.

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:59.301
Because that's where if any
citations go on your video,

00:58:59.301 --> 00:59:01.550
that's where you should start
referencing researchers,

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:03.730
because that's where
people are going to go,

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:06.687
hm, this kind of sounds
like pseudo science.

00:59:06.687 --> 00:59:08.270
But people have heard
of mitochondria.

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:09.645
People know what
mitochondria do.

00:59:09.645 --> 00:59:12.890
So if you make a claim that
some people's mitochondria, not

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:16.822
everyone's, acts differently,
then that's an acceptable fact.

00:59:16.822 --> 00:59:19.280
PROFESSOR: David, I know this
is not what you want to hear,

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.130
but what I actually
recommend you do

00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:25.930
is write a script from scratch.

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:28.580
Write your next draft.

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.580
Because you have all this
knowledge in your mind

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.996
already, so it's
not like you need

00:59:31.996 --> 00:59:33.630
to look at it to rewrite it.

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:36.830
But approach it from
this completely fresh,

00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:40.900
new structure, of
opening with an anecdote,

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:43.590
connecting that to
the big question.

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:44.980
Explain the anecdote.

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:46.910
And in the process
of explaining it,

00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:49.910
you can hit the
definitions of why people--

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:55.370
or how your body shivers, or how
many Iceman, when he meditated,

00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:57.020
maybe his blood
vessels constricted.

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.144
I'm totally making this up.

00:59:58.144 --> 01:00:01.430
You have to fact check all this.

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:05.300
Then go back out to how this
could affect our survival

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.387
rate in the Ice Age.

01:00:06.387 --> 01:00:07.970
If you approach it
from-- because this

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:11.610
is going to take a completely
different structuring.

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:13.250
So I almost don't
want you to even look

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.750
at this when you try your
next draft, because you're

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.366
going to have the
habit of thinking

01:00:17.366 --> 01:00:19.240
about it in the same
five paragraph structure

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.073
that you did before.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:24.300
Send the next draft that way.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:30.920
I think in the process, you
will end up not including things

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.570
just naturally.

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:35.969
But if you try to look at
this draft and say what do

01:00:35.969 --> 01:00:36.760
I need to take out.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.801
What do I need to put in.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:40.760
What do I need to move around.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.507
I think it might be a
little confusing to you,

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:44.501
does that make sense.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.226
All right.

01:00:50.226 --> 01:00:51.975
And I will stick around
after class today,

01:00:51.975 --> 01:00:53.760
if people want to talk
more about their scripts.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.343
But I wanted to give
everyone a chance

01:00:55.343 --> 01:00:56.820
to read it out loud to people.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.780
Oh, when you are reading
also, this is a tendency

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.880
that a lot of people have.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.500
And I just noticed it
because you read last.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.696
But carry your words through.

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:08.070
You're going to want to talk
a little bit slower than you

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:09.900
usually do naturally.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:14.160
And you don't want to drop the
ends of words off like this.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.380
Because the effect that that has
is you sound robotic on camera,

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:23.620
and it's really hard to
understand the ends of words.

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.020
So that's it for
everyone, just make sure

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:33.396
that you carry all of your words
out to the end of the sentence.

01:01:33.396 --> 01:01:35.520
All right, let's do one
more and then take a break.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.876
How's everyone--

01:01:36.876 --> 01:01:38.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.956
PROFESSOR: You want to
take a break right now?

01:01:39.956 --> 01:01:41.379
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:41.379 --> 01:01:42.920
PROFESSOR: All right,
let's do a five

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.650
minute break and come back.

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:45.494
AUDIENCE: And I need to
make a quick phone call,

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:47.119
so I'm going to be
late coming back in.

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:51.506
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:51.506 --> 01:01:52.380
PROFESSOR: Go for it.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.770
All right, Nathan, take it away.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.016
And remember, read it like you
would actually try to host it.

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:15.500
AUDIENCE: What does food in
your fridge start to smell,

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.162
and where does that icky
black liquid come from?

01:02:18.162 --> 01:02:19.870
Wouldn't life just be
easier if we didn't

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.320
have to worry about that?

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.910
Well, to answer these questions,
let's talk about decomposition.

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:26.730
Wikipedia says
that decomposition

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:29.400
is the process by which organic
substances are broken down

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.065
into much simpler
form of matter.

01:02:31.065 --> 01:02:32.970
Well, what does that mean?

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:35.472
Basically, in your
fridge, on a forest floor,

01:02:35.472 --> 01:02:37.430
almost everywhere, there
are fungi and bacteria

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:39.680
that live entirely by
eating dead things.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.200
These dead things
that make up food

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.730
can be more or less divided
into three categories,

01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:45.320
carbohydrates, which
are like things

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.300
like sugars and starches,
lipids, like fats,

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.691
and proteins, like meat.

01:02:49.691 --> 01:02:51.690
All of these are chemically
different compounds,

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:53.960
so they each get digested
in a different way.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.515
Enzymes like
amylases, which yields

01:02:55.515 --> 01:02:58.000
us starches, and
cellulases, which

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.310
deal with cellulose, the
main component of plants,

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.860
create sugar from complex
carbohydrates, which cells

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.900
can easily get energy from.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.090
Lipase has split
lipids into two parts,

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:11.130
glycerone and fatty acids, both
of which can produce energy.

01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:13.980
Lastly, proteases break
protein into the amino acids

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.900
that they're made of, which both
releases energy and provides

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.670
a bacteria and fungi with
crucial building blocks.

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:25.790
So how does a-- so how does a
perfectly nice broccoli floret

01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:28.200
start giving off this
foul black liquid?

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.320
Well, fruits and vegetables
are almost entirely

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.040
water, so one the
most basic level,

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.670
you could say a plant cell
is an extremely complex water

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:35.550
balloon.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.700
The elastic outside is
the cellulose cell wall,

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.980
and the [INAUDIBLE] inside
is the intracellular fluid.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.680
When a bacteria or fungi use
a cellulases to break down

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.720
the exterior of
a cell, it's like

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.194
if I were to pop the balloon.

01:03:47.194 --> 01:03:48.860
But liquid and other
materials that come

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:51.570
are what cause the muck
you see in your fridge.

01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:53.720
And so what about that smell?

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.490
It depends on the food type.

01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:58.230
Basically, if a meat starts
to get rancid and smell bad,

01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:00.920
it's because when lipases break
down the fat and the meat,

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.942
a lot of the fatty acids you
end up with aren't too pleasant.

01:04:03.942 --> 01:04:05.650
If it's a fruit or
vegetable, [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:08.540
all the time, the smell happens
after that icky liquid forms.

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.030
Other bacteria that weren't
involved in initial breakdown,

01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:13.762
move in and start to
stink everything up.

01:04:13.762 --> 01:04:15.220
So looking at this
all, wouldn't it

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.560
be easy if we didn't have
to deal with decomposition,

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.010
if things just lasted forever?

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:22.360
Well, maybe but probably not.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.220
The USDS found that the average
American household wastes

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:29.460
about 25% of its food, and a lot
of restaurants are even worse.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.430
Sure, that number could go down
if there's no decomposition.

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:34.570
But other factors
can affect how good

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.900
a food is, too, like
moisture and exposure to air.

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.620
And if we didn't
have decomposition,

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.290
what would happen to all
that food we throw away?

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:44.930
Food items in landfills are
dealt with by decomposes,

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:47.710
and allow the nutrients in
food to return to the soil

01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:49.900
and eventually
other living things.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.650
If things just sat
idle in landfills,

01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:54.900
we'd end up with a crisis
on our hands, eventually.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.300
Aside from just food,
bacteria, fungi, and protists

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.680
are responsible for breaking
down other dead things,

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.020
like trees.

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.780
In fact, they're more or less
the only things that can do it.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.280
So while your house
would never have

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.029
to worry about termites,
who rely protists

01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:09.400
in their stomachs, the
forest would pretty soon

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.570
be flooded with dead stuff.

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:16.010
So decomposition,
while maybe annoying

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:18.410
when you can't eat that now
fuzzy peach in your fridge,

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:21.547
is essential to the continuation
of our world as you know it.

01:05:21.547 --> 01:05:23.130
And it's pretty darn
interesting, too.

01:05:28.785 --> 01:05:30.160
PROFESSOR: Just
so you know, that

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.610
was also exactly five minutes.

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:37.650
but keep in mind, the
pacing of your reading

01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:41.790
is a lot faster when you're
reading off of a script.

01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:43.879
And then you got to
account for all the b-roll

01:05:43.879 --> 01:05:45.295
that you're going
to put in there.

01:05:45.295 --> 01:05:49.880
So it's clocking in at a
little bit over five minutes.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:54.989
For this one, let's look
at the script altogether.

01:05:54.989 --> 01:05:57.030
And I'm going to go ahead
and make my first point

01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:01.340
in the interest of time, if
I can find my cursor, which

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:07.700
is that this script has the
same issue that I was talking

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.720
about with David,
which is that I think

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.010
the coolest part
about your episode

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:17.680
is this whole part right
here, these two paragraphs.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.790
What would happen if we
didn't have decomposition,

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:23.650
and why it's
actually super vital.

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:28.710
But it doesn't come until you've
gone through all this stuff.

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:32.450
And I wonder how much of
this stuff you actually need.

01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:39.050
Like this whole sentence,
and actually this one,

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:42.220
I think you could
take out completely.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.681
Go from why does the food in
your fridge start to smell,

01:06:45.681 --> 01:06:47.180
wouldn't life be
easier if we didn't

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.310
have that to worry about.

01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:55.950
You could just say,
well, in your fridge,

01:06:55.950 --> 01:07:00.310
or on a forest floor, there are
fungi and bacteria that survive

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:03.190
entirely by eating dead things.

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:08.710
And they're responsible
for turning your broccoli

01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:10.595
into the black mold.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.270
This stuff is informative.

01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:22.370
I don't think anyone here
suffers from the inability

01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:24.360
to be informative.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.640
This is all very factual.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.520
But I personally don't
care about it as much

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.320
as the stuff at the end.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.790
How do you guys feel?

01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:38.158
Yeah.

01:07:38.158 --> 01:07:39.887
AUDIENCE: I was
kind of zoning out

01:07:39.887 --> 01:07:42.110
when there was the amylases.

01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:44.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.890
It's OK to use
technical terminology.

01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:49.420
But I think this gets
a little too jargony

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.620
to the point where people
are going to have a hard time

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:56.090
understanding why they need
to know what a protease is.

01:07:56.090 --> 01:07:59.120
This is what I meant
by David's structure.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.050
We're so used to
writing stuff in this

01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:07.160
is form, where you
have the question,

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.440
and you have the background.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.260
Then you usually go into
an example or an anecdote.

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:30.850
Add then you have some
sort of conclusion where

01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:42.590
you say-- your
conclusion is, so that's

01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:46.490
why decomposition is important.

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:50.630
In a video, this is your
money shot, usually.

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:52.220
This is the thing
that looks cool.

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.600
Have you guys ever
seen that-- it's

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.310
a commercial for Sprint where
they have the people cutting

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:00.399
their bills in half.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.680
Have you guys ever
seen that before?

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.340
I find that a very weird
commercial, because it takes

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.520
them such a long
time to get-- they

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.529
interview people about
how much they're spending

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:11.609
on their monthly wireless bill.

01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:13.600
It's not until halfway
through the commercial

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.766
that you get the part where
they're actually cutting

01:09:15.766 --> 01:09:17.029
all their bills in half.

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:19.180
And I'm like, it they
just opened the commercial

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.359
with those shots,
then they could

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:23.700
go into the interview stuff.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.160
But whoever produced that
commercial was like, no, no.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.220
We have to establish that people
hate their current cellphone

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.010
plan.

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:32.290
And we have to get them
to talk about who they are

01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:33.779
before we can show that stuff.

01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:34.950
That's not true of video.

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:36.580
You can start with the example.

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.090
You can start with
the big question.

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:41.370
And instead of
having a conclusion,

01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:45.229
you can have a connecting--
instead of this conclusion,

01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:48.979
oftentimes you revisit
the question instead.

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:54.360
So I think you should
move your example up.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.980
You should move it up
right after the question.

01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:00.330
And in David's case, I
think you should actually

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:03.080
do the example, and
then the question.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.640
You should talk about
Iceman and then say

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.050
what is it about certain people
that give them the advantage.

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:19.450
For you, I think you
should say why does food

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:22.180
in your fridge start to smell?

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.880
Because it's like a nice,
familiar intro into the topic.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.820
But then I think
you go into what

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:32.720
would happen if we didn't
have decomposition.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.480
And that's not
exactly an example,

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.650
but do you see what
I mean by just diving

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:40.104
straight into the meat in
the bulk of your video?

01:10:40.104 --> 01:10:41.770
Were you going to say
something, Andrea?

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:44.280
AUDIENCE: Well I just remember
when you did your one line

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.990
or two line summary, which
was so amazingly awesome.

01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:53.392
And I'd love to see that
in the script, of well,

01:10:53.392 --> 01:10:55.579
it turns out that there
are lots of other things

01:10:55.579 --> 01:10:56.937
that like to eat your food, too.

01:10:56.937 --> 01:10:57.770
And that's the hook.

01:10:57.770 --> 01:11:02.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think that
is where the video exists.

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:06.230
I don't think you actually need
most of this stuff, which again

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.330
I know is like super
disheartening for people

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:11.100
to hear that the majority
of what you wrote

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.970
isn't actually necessary.

01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:14.940
But I think that in the
act of writing this,

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:18.150
you've discovered what
the really compelling part

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:23.450
of your script and your
content it, which is this.

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:26.260
AUDIENCE: I'd said the big
problem is that, for me, it's

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.670
accepting that in the end what
I really wanted to make a video

01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:31.270
about is how it happens.

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:33.540
Because that's the
part that I look at

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.900
and when I want to
figure it out on YouTube,

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:39.460
there's nothing that
told me how it happens.

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:42.040
And I don't know, that's
the problem for me.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:46.570
Because that's more-- I
guess that's the issue,

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:49.530
is that it's not as compelling
what I want to make a video,

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:52.680
as what is probably a
better video as what I'm not

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.470
as interested in as myself.

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:59.450
PROFESSOR: Then I think simply
by moving these two paragraphs,

01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:03.809
basically, to the beginning,
prefacing all this stuff,

01:12:03.809 --> 01:12:05.350
you can have the
best of both worlds.

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:06.660
And I actually think
that, you're right,

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.600
you do want to explain
what's happening,

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.290
because that's like
substantive science

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:13.570
that people can
be learning about.

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:18.810
So this is a really
compelling hook.

01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:21.800
What if we just didn't
have the thing that

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.900
seemingly inconveniences us.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.610
What if things could
just last indefinitely?

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:33.095
Is this crisis unrelated to
all the stuff with the enzymes

01:12:33.095 --> 01:12:35.220
that you were talking about
earlier in your script?

01:12:38.217 --> 01:12:40.050
AUDIENCE: I think the
crisis is more the-- I

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:43.370
tried the very in a
couple of like-- it's

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:46.220
like nutrient cycling and
nitrogen are very complex

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:46.720
topics.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:51.290
So basically I tried
to very succinctly,

01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:56.280
sum it up that basically you
need to have things returning.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.810
PROFESSOR: Then what
if you just simply say

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:02.460
you need to have things
returning to the soil

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.590
just like you have
in this sentence.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:11.170
And then you could say, so what
averts this crisis, basically.

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:15.180
And then you can
go into this stuff,

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:20.186
that you have
bacteria that break

01:13:20.186 --> 01:13:24.370
the outside walls of plants.

01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.840
And all the liquid comes out.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.250
And that's like the muck.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:31.250
That's what rot is, basically.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:37.190
But in doing so,
drive home the point

01:13:37.190 --> 01:13:42.240
that this stuff is
important and desired.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.510
So you set it up with well,
what would happen if we

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:48.930
didn't have decomposition.

01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:51.000
You wouldn't have stuff
returning to the soil.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.360
You'd have just endless material
piling up on each other.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.860
So what averts this crisis?

01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:58.030
Well, bacteria do this.

01:13:58.030 --> 01:14:00.840
And by allowing it to
rot and allowing things

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.380
to go back to the soil,
go back to the question

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:08.007
of that's why stuff
rots in the first place.

01:14:08.007 --> 01:14:10.090
So actually, maybe it just
needs like a little bit

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:12.640
of restructuring
more than anything.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.909
What do you think you, Julia?

01:14:13.909 --> 01:14:18.899
AUDIENCE: I really enjoy
your informal language,

01:14:18.899 --> 01:14:21.893
so saying things like
pretty darn interesting.

01:14:21.893 --> 01:14:25.386
So I think also if you can
put the science-y jargon

01:14:25.386 --> 01:14:32.871
into that informal language,
that would make it more fun.

01:14:32.871 --> 01:14:35.865
Because that's kind
of how you talk,

01:14:35.865 --> 01:14:38.859
and so if you can explain it
that way, that would be great.

01:14:38.859 --> 01:14:40.855
And also, you can add images.

01:14:40.855 --> 01:14:42.851
So for example,
for you saying how

01:14:42.851 --> 01:14:46.344
does a perfectly nice broccoli
florets start giving off

01:14:46.344 --> 01:14:47.841
this foul black
liquid, you could

01:14:47.841 --> 01:14:51.900
show this black liquid instead
of mentioning it or describing

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:55.267
it and just say, how does it
end up like this. [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:55.267 --> 01:14:56.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a great point.

01:14:56.850 --> 01:15:00.560
It'll save you a
lot of time, too.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.954
I actually don't think you
need this sentence, personally,

01:15:03.954 --> 01:15:05.370
because by then
you've established

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:07.750
that it is interesting,
and you sort of

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:10.790
highlight it through your tone.

01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:13.440
And in general, again it's
totally a personal taste thing,

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:19.050
but I try to avoid observations
that a viewer could come to

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:25.110
on their own, or ones that I
could say quickly in passing

01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:27.360
in the context of a sentence.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.855
I rarely try to
have an observation

01:15:28.855 --> 01:15:32.090
like that merit its own
sentence or its own thought.

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:38.106
AUDIENCE: Do you want to
touch the concept of recycling

01:15:38.106 --> 01:15:47.070
at all, like the idea that some
things that may seem like waste

01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:51.228
or dead stuff is actually
really useful to other things.

01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:57.186
I don't want to complicate this.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:59.435
AUDIENCE: I actually don't
know what you mean by that.

01:15:59.435 --> 01:16:05.080
AUDIENCE: Like for instance,
mushrooms are decomposers.

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:09.130
Their job is to help
speed up the cycle.

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:19.960
And there are other creatures
and microorganisms out there

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.770
that have an important role
in this part of the materials

01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:27.920
cycle, that I'm not
sure whether it's worth

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.431
mentioning that that
ooze and that black stuff

01:16:30.431 --> 01:16:32.340
is actually someone's delicacy.

01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:35.770
PROFESSOR: I think
that's what you're

01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:39.490
trying to get at with the
whole having the nitrates

01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:41.465
and everything
return to the soil.

01:16:41.465 --> 01:16:44.090
And maybe that's something that
you can hit in just a sentence.

01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:51.420
Like it goes back-- it
allows nutrients in food

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:56.000
to return to the soil that's
vital to the organisms that

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.180
live in that environment, and
eventually other living things.

01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.750
AUDIENCE: And this
is one where maybe

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:06.190
having a visual of
the food chain cycle,

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:11.030
like that whole-- really hammers
this down visually for people

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.910
while you're talking.

01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:17.920
As the sun creates-- like just
a visual map of just the food

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.970
chain cycle, starting from
the sun and going back to you.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.940
And maybe that's all
you need with this

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.275
to hone that
biological concept down

01:17:25.275 --> 01:17:26.970
for people, that life cycle.

01:17:30.428 --> 01:17:32.485
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:17:32.485 --> 01:17:33.860
AUDIENCE: Going
off of what Julia

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:39.520
was saying a little bit
earlier, so right now,

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.150
the part where you
discuss enzymes

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:45.420
sounds a lot like the videos
I'm making right now for MITx.

01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:49.070
It's super factual
and really concise,

01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:51.800
which is good for
those kind of videos.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.690
For these kind of
videos, I feel like you

01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:58.880
need to integrate this
information in the greater

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.550
structure of the story
like we were talking about.

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:12.090
So jumping off of what
Andrea was saying earlier,

01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:15.060
if you structure it as,
we are not the only people

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:15.870
who eat our food.

01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:20.640
Bacteria and protists and things
like that also eat our food.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.865
They use enzymes like
proteases to break the protein

01:18:25.865 --> 01:18:27.090
in our food to do this.

01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:29.870
As opposed to
introducing them as list,

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.570
like these are
different enzymes.

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:36.510
If you can figure out a way
where the outer story is,

01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:39.620
they also are eating our
food and breaking it down.

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.740
And then bringing up
these enzymes when

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:44.870
it's necessary to define them
instead of just giving blanket

01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:46.930
definitions of all of
them at the beginning,

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:49.220
it helps keep that
viewer engaged,

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.970
because then they're
still getting

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:54.220
the same amount of
information overall,

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.990
but they're getting
it in smaller doses,

01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:57.830
and when that
information is relevant.

01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:59.660
So they're more
likely to remember it

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.160
later on, because they'll
see a picture of the meet.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.010
And be like, oh,
the bacteria uses

01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:07.210
proteases to break the
proteins down in the meat

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:09.920
because they use those as
amino acids for themselves,

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:11.160
or something like that.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.154
As opposed to giving
this list of enzymes.

01:19:14.154 --> 01:19:14.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.450
That's a really good
tip for everyone.

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:18.050
I think you Julia,
that's definitely

01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:19.200
relevant in your script.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.510
David, for sure.

01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:25.640
Maybe a litmus test is
if you find yourself

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.070
with an entire sentence or
an entire paragraph that

01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:32.940
is just a definition on
its own, really rethink how

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:33.960
that's being done.

01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:40.950
Enzymes like amylases,
which deal with starches,

01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:43.760
create sugar from complex
carbohydrates, which cells

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.790
can easily get energy from.

01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:48.560
Like that's a textbook
definition of what

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.870
enzymes and amylases do.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:55.220
And you can explain that stuff
in your examples of well,

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.540
it turns out we're not the
only things that eat our food.

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:02.260
Bacteria do that, too.

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:04.190
I don't think it's
super accurate to say

01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:05.360
that enzymes eat our food.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.560
But you know what I mean, never
leave an island of a definition

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.240
out on its own.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.070
I guess.

01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:17.325
Like don't have
this random-- don't

01:20:17.325 --> 01:20:20.520
leave random islands of
facts just hanging out

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:25.490
in the middle of your script,
for the purposes of this video.

01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:28.700
I think this is
an important idea.

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:31.490
I think you can integrate in the
context of an example, though.

01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:34.189
Does that make sense?

01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:35.730
Is that making sense
to other people?

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:37.678
Yeah, what were you
going to say, Joshua?

01:20:37.678 --> 01:20:44.384
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I
had the question in my mind

01:20:44.384 --> 01:20:47.740
that the topic of
smell wasn't addressed.

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:50.455
PROFESSOR: Oh, right about here.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.270
Yeah, right now you
set up sight and smell

01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:58.600
as two unrelated things.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.390
But I think you don't have
to separate the smell out.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:05.370
You can say, when the
bacteria break down

01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:11.210
the exterior of the cell,
and the crap oozes out of it,

01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:19.130
it also is leaking out chemicals
that cause rancid smells.

01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:22.072
So you don't necessarily
have to differentiate

01:21:22.072 --> 01:21:23.238
that it is a separate topic.

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:32.800
One more thing, again
this is a personal thing,

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.300
but I just think the word rot
is a lot more visceral and a lot

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.130
more the familiar to people.

01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:41.400
So I know that you talk a
lot about decomposition,

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.290
but maybe if you
open it with why do

01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:45.560
things rot in the first place.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.450
What would happen
if things didn't.

01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:54.180
That might be a little bit
more welcoming to viewers.

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:58.020
Any final thoughts
about this one?

01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:00.260
Again, I think in
general people are

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:03.200
in really good shape with
their ideas, and the concepts,

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.630
and the topics of their scripts.

01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:07.850
It's really a matter of
restructuring it, escaping away

01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:10.480
from the traditional
five paragraph structure

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.850
and really hitting into
money shots right away.

01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:14.600
That's going to help
your videos the most.

01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:21.915
Andrea, would you
mind reading next?

01:22:27.168 --> 01:22:28.668
AUDIENCE: Can you
pass the mic over?

01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:38.060
Everyone gets to hear my
nice bronchitis voice.

01:22:48.027 --> 01:22:49.860
I'm going to mime through
most of this, too.

01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:55.140
Mmm, delicious.

01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.070
Eating foods is one of the
great pleasures of life.

01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:01.060
And to enjoy foods from
apples to candy bars,

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:05.220
we rely on one part of
our bodies, our teeth.

01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.420
Teeth are the
hardest substances in

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:10.460
our bodies-- little
animation holding

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:13.420
a tooth-- harder than
our bones and even harder

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:15.560
than iron or steel.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:19.040
While we chew, our teeth
actually experience forces up

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.180
to 225 pounds.

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.800
That's like having a mountain
goat jump up and down

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.300
on our teeth hundreds
of times each day--

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.730
little animation
of a mountain goat.

01:23:31.730 --> 01:23:33.570
So why doesn't our
jar just crumble

01:23:33.570 --> 01:23:38.900
under all of those forces--
explanation graphic.

01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:39.790
Between your tooth--

01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:42.081
PROFESSOR: Are you guys
following along on your script?

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.570
AUDIENCE: Between your
tooth and your jawbone

01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:51.980
there's a specialized
piece of tissue

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:56.770
called the periodontal
ligament, or PDL for short.

01:23:56.770 --> 01:24:00.070
The PDL can easily
absorb the normal forces

01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:02.140
that a tooth
experiences while we

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:05.440
chew, say, an apple,
cushioning or protecting

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.340
our jaw bone from our teeth.

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:12.380
And inside the PDL there are
all different kinds of cells.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:15.450
One type, called
mechanoreceptors,

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:19.920
sense forces of movement or
pressure applied to the tooth.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.190
If the force is large enough,
such as biting into an apple

01:24:23.190 --> 01:24:25.800
seed, these receptors
tell your brain

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:30.780
to stop biting down-- graphic.

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:34.650
But what if we want to force
teeth in a certain direction,

01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:37.320
like with braces?

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:40.920
As the braces pull
on the tooth, the PDL

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.050
is squeezed in one direction
and stretched in the other,

01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:46.190
kind of like a rubber band.

01:24:46.190 --> 01:24:48.280
And here's where it
gets really interesting.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.240
To make room for the
PDL, cells called

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.380
osteoclasts come in and
dissolve a little bit

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.780
of the bone in your jaw.

01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:00.530
Another type of cell called an
osteoblast comes in and then

01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:03.990
builds up the jaw bone so
the PDL cushion can get back

01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:08.770
to its proper shape holding
the tooth in its new position.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:12.220
Cut to image of the entire body
with the skeleton highlighted.

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.260
Your jaw isn't the
only place where

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:16.760
these osteoclasts
and osteoblasts

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:18.530
alter your bone structure.

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:21.390
In fact, this bony
remodeling process

01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:24.840
is happening throughout
your body all the time.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:29.020
When braces-- where braces use
osteoblasts to physically move

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:31.950
things around that are
already in our bodies,

01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:35.290
what if we try to use them to
replace things in our bodies,

01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:37.320
like implants?

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:41.040
Implants are kind of like
spare parts for our bodies.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.820
And MIT engineers are
using the properties

01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:48.240
of osteoblasts and osteoclasts
that are already in our bodies

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.860
to create a chemical
coating for these implants.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.230
Just like in a
mouth with braces,

01:25:54.230 --> 01:25:57.740
this osteoblast coating
will create natural bone

01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:01.050
to help lock the
implant in place.

01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:04.540
And this is a new section.

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.760
Right now, implants
are designed to have

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:10.800
the same functionality as the
body parts they are replacing.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.880
But in the future, scientists
could make implants

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.630
that work better than
the original body parts,

01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:21.890
using bone remodeling to make us
lighter, stronger, and faster.

01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:24.690
And then, at a certain
point, like at the end,

01:26:24.690 --> 01:26:28.680
I'm actually wearing this
weird cyber thing over my eye.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.030
That's the end.

01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:34.479
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:34.479 --> 01:26:37.020
PROFESSOR: So you're clocking
in at about four minutes, which

01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:40.180
is good.

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:43.550
And I thought the delivery
was also a really nice, too.

01:26:46.538 --> 01:26:49.028
AUDIENCE: I got so much more
out of it than reading it,

01:26:49.028 --> 01:26:51.020
which is funny because
I don't usually

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:54.030
process things that way.

01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:58.720
Yeah, but the way that you did
it was so slow and dramatic,

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.430
like the way that
you emphasized,

01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:02.260
it was helping me process it.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.610
It was really good.

01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:07.320
PROFESSOR: I like the way that
you emphasize the word same.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:10.400
Lot of people would
do the same thing.

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.180
They would just sort of
accent the word the same.

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:16.580
But you sort of linger on
in it, it's same thing.

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:18.390
And I actually really like that.

01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:21.300
I think it's a delivery
that is not necessarily

01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:24.280
intuitive to a lot of people,
but it works really nicely

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.150
in that context.

01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:33.070
All right, so this has
changed quite a bit

01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:36.360
from your original
idea, which was

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:42.480
the first on how braces work
to more about bone remodeling

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:44.370
and rebuilding.

01:27:44.370 --> 01:27:47.200
Does anyone have comments
off the bat about the script?

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.888
Yeah, Julia.

01:27:48.888 --> 01:27:53.352
AUDIENCE: I really enjoyed it,
especially at the beginning

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:58.755
when you're talking about our
teeth are stronger than steel.

01:27:58.755 --> 01:28:00.296
And you kind of
demand the attention.

01:28:00.296 --> 01:28:03.272
And also when you mentioned this
is where it gets interesting,

01:28:03.272 --> 01:28:08.728
so I kind of, oh, I should
listen to this is the reaction.

01:28:08.728 --> 01:28:11.730
The only thing I kind of
wanted to learn more about

01:28:11.730 --> 01:28:18.546
was how can you withstand the
mountain goat on your teeth.

01:28:18.546 --> 01:28:25.665
That was something very--
it had a large wow factor.

01:28:25.665 --> 01:28:28.820
And to me that was like, oh,
how does that actually happen.

01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:31.300
That's the only thing I
wanted to know more about.

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.800
But other than that I
enjoyed the information.

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.787
And it made a lot
of sense because it

01:28:35.787 --> 01:28:41.320
wasn't very scientific, as in
didn't have a lot of jargon.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.775
AUDIENCE: I did get great
feedback from Elizabeth,

01:28:43.775 --> 01:28:47.170
and [INAUDIBLE], and
Jamie, and George.

01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:51.450
I think the crumbling
job was Elizabeth.

01:28:51.450 --> 01:28:54.070
PROFESSOR: I agree that
you did a really nice job.

01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:57.790
You don't start with a
money shot, necessarily.

01:28:57.790 --> 01:29:00.010
Like you don't start with
the big picture question,

01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:01.560
but I think it
works in the script

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.460
because she has so
many shareable facts

01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:06.150
off the beginning.

01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:09.510
And it's not a traditional
five paragraph set up

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:12.680
where she talks a lot about
defining what the PDL was,

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.315
which is kind of what your
earlier iteration of the script

01:29:15.315 --> 01:29:17.500
did.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:21.060
But I think this is a great
example of not necessarily

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:23.230
defining every
single fact that you

01:29:23.230 --> 01:29:27.110
need to know about
dentistry to get the point.

01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:29.560
I want you to follow
along because you're

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:34.360
setting up sort of-- it's sort
of establishing characters.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.680
Like the PDL is a
character in the story.

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:40.560
And what all of these
shareable facts do

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.800
is that it creates
the persona of the PDL

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.990
as being something
really strong,

01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:48.110
and something really robust.

01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:50.500
And the fact that
we're now, as humans,

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:53.950
going to try to manipulate
that, it establishes

01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:55.530
the challenge in
that, which I think

01:29:55.530 --> 01:29:57.030
is a really nice
thing that it does.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.040
This section is not
as related to it,

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.104
but I think the
video is short enough

01:30:11.104 --> 01:30:13.020
to where you can include
it, because it's just

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:14.850
kind of a cool fact.

01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:18.235
Do you guys find
that distracting?

01:30:18.235 --> 01:30:19.985
Or do you think it's
OK to leave in there?

01:30:19.985 --> 01:30:20.901
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:34.858
AUDIENCE: I have a different
question to go with that.

01:30:34.858 --> 01:30:38.958
So there's something that's kind
of missing at the end, which

01:30:38.958 --> 01:30:40.270
is the four minute question.

01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:42.478
I don't know that this is
actually a four minute one,

01:30:42.478 --> 01:30:44.206
because if you
add on my comment,

01:30:44.206 --> 01:30:47.650
it might add some
[SOUND] to the end.

01:30:47.650 --> 01:30:52.600
I feel like the end ends
kind of abruptly for me.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.990
And so I think we get
back to your question

01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:56.810
once we know where we're ending.

01:30:56.810 --> 01:31:00.430
But part of me wants-- you
asked some really good questions

01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:04.570
at the very end about
what if we manipulate

01:31:04.570 --> 01:31:08.450
the body to be better, stronger,
lighter, all of those things.

01:31:08.450 --> 01:31:12.100
Then it asks all these moral
questions, of like, is that OK.

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:17.112
I mean, what about the Olympics.

01:31:17.112 --> 01:31:20.070
What does that do for people who
have replacement arms and now

01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:21.570
they can throw faster.

01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:24.540
There's all this world of
questions that have nothing

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:28.310
to do with the actual
physicality of pulling it off,

01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:33.280
but it makes you wonder about
this super human race that

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.685
could be created by replacing
a lot of our functional parts

01:31:36.685 --> 01:31:39.110
with things that are
better, faster, stronger.

01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:40.580
All of the above.

01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:43.956
But aside from
even going there, I

01:31:43.956 --> 01:31:45.414
feel like I want
you to tie it back

01:31:45.414 --> 01:31:48.910
to the apple at the
beginning somehow, and teeth.

01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:50.930
So I don't know if
it's possible to allude

01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:54.370
to all of the moral questions
that this might bring up

01:31:54.370 --> 01:31:57.170
without having to
go deeply into it,

01:31:57.170 --> 01:31:59.440
because we don't
have to answer that.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.360
We just have to get
people thinking.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:06.471
And maybe tying it,
somehow, back to the teeth,

01:32:06.471 --> 01:32:09.333
somehow, because that's
what we started with.

01:32:09.333 --> 01:32:12.195
I'm not sure what that
direct [INAUDIBLE] is yet.

01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:17.690
But that, to me, would
feel-- so you start with--

01:32:17.690 --> 01:32:20.760
and the apple is very central
and the teeth are a very

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.433
central part of the story.

01:32:22.433 --> 01:32:24.130
And then we sort of go forward.

01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:26.903
But forget why we
started there at the end.

01:32:26.903 --> 01:32:30.065
And I'm wondering maybe
you guys have a clever way

01:32:30.065 --> 01:32:32.460
to tie it back to that concept.

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:35.160
But I feel a little unsatisfied
leaving that apple at the front

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:38.604
and not coming back at all.

01:32:38.604 --> 01:32:42.048
AUDIENCE: Maybe if
you added [INAUDIBLE],

01:32:42.048 --> 01:32:44.508
not just in the future
can scientists do that.

01:32:44.508 --> 01:32:46.968
But they're already kind
of doing that with braces.

01:32:46.968 --> 01:32:48.936
And then it goes
back to the teeth.

01:32:48.936 --> 01:32:49.930
AUDIENCE: There you go.

01:32:49.930 --> 01:32:50.430
Right.

01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:51.860
And just bring it
back to the idea

01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:54.730
that they're doing all
these crazy things.

01:32:54.730 --> 01:32:56.820
Think about your arms,
your legs, your nose,

01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:59.010
or whatever piece of
your body that you might

01:32:59.010 --> 01:33:02.590
want to trade out and upgrade.

01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:06.630
But every day people around you
are doing that with their teeth

01:33:06.630 --> 01:33:07.820
and we take it for granted.

01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:11.524
Just something that-- just
a quick tie back to that.

01:33:11.524 --> 01:33:17.002
AUDIENCE: Also, and that kind of
goes along with the goat thing.

01:33:17.002 --> 01:33:20.986
The fact that these implants
work better make people

01:33:20.986 --> 01:33:25.966
want to replace the
bones in their body.

01:33:25.966 --> 01:33:30.946
Just I want stronger arm
bones, or something like that.

01:33:30.946 --> 01:33:34.432
So I think, for me, that's
another question that I had,

01:33:34.432 --> 01:33:39.940
what are the implications of
these implants for our society?

01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:42.213
AUDIENCE: Are they,
right now, are they

01:33:42.213 --> 01:33:43.213
prohibitively expensive.

01:33:43.213 --> 01:33:48.659
Are they-- you don't have
to go totally out there.

01:33:48.659 --> 01:33:49.700
But I think you're right.

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:53.600
And as an audience member you're
wondering, oh, I love running.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.630
Maybe I could run
faster if I just traded

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:57.990
my legs for different ones.

01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:59.800
Like why couldn't I do that?

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.080
Are we ten years away from that?

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.354
Ten thousand years away
from being able to do that?

01:34:05.354 --> 01:34:07.020
PROFESSOR: The only
thing is I'm worried

01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:09.450
that this is opening
up a huge can of warms

01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:11.020
at the end of your video.

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:13.370
So maybe a quick way to sort
of gloss over it, and maybe

01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:16.860
this is a little
cheap, but what I would

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:19.680
do if I were trying
to fix or rework

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:22.510
some of the ending-- and
endings are so hard to write.

01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:25.060
I don't know if you guys
have experienced this before,

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.810
but I've always found the
ending to be the hardest

01:34:27.810 --> 01:34:29.610
part to write in the script.

01:34:29.610 --> 01:34:32.856
But what if you went, your
jaw isn't the only place

01:34:32.856 --> 01:34:34.480
where these osteoclasts
and osteoblasts

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.760
alter your bone structure.

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.000
In fact, this bony remodeling
processes happening

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.930
throughout the entire body.

01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:43.310
And where braces use osteoblasts
to physically move things that

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:47.400
are already in our
bodies, Engineer

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.260
use the properties
of these cells

01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:54.350
to replace things in our bodies.

01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:59.370
Now the idea of building
ourselves as bionicle people

01:34:59.370 --> 01:35:01.577
and replacing our bones
with stronger ones

01:35:01.577 --> 01:35:03.785
may sound like something
out of science fiction book.

01:35:03.785 --> 01:35:05.430
But when you think
about it, that's

01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:09.800
what the things that most
teenagers have to use

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.880
do as well.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.020
Then add an ending
sentence that I

01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:18.430
can't think of right now,
crunch, into your apple.

01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:20.721
So that way you've
kind of reduced--

01:35:20.721 --> 01:35:22.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that's what we need.

01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:26.212
It doesn't need to be long, but
it needs to tie those concepts.

01:35:26.212 --> 01:35:27.325
Yeah, I like that a lot.

01:35:27.325 --> 01:35:29.700
PROFESSOR: And I can talk to
you more about it afterwards

01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:33.690
because I can't ad lib a
great script impromptu.

01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:37.040
But that way you're sort of
condensing all this down,

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:40.800
because I really love the
example of the implants.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.320
But I want your
focus of the video

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.990
to be on braces, basically,
so that way you're

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:47.740
just sort of hinting
at it and then

01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:50.720
tying it back to the
beginning with the apple.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.771
AUDIENCE: Do you-- people know
that if your braces come off

01:35:55.771 --> 01:35:58.830
and you don't wear your
retainers they go right back.

01:35:58.830 --> 01:36:02.630
Which I just wonder if someone
who's listening to this

01:36:02.630 --> 01:36:05.970
is like, well, if you
follows Andrea logic,

01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:10.500
my teeth have
permanently rebuilt

01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:12.710
their cellular structure
in this new space.

01:36:12.710 --> 01:36:15.970
Why would I need to do that?

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:18.270
PROFESSOR: That's a good point.

01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:20.950
AUDIENCE: Like if
understand what you're

01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:25.736
sharing in this from a cellular
level is actually going on,

01:36:25.736 --> 01:36:28.180
I shouldn't have
to wear a retainer,

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:32.814
because my cells have--
things have ground together.

01:36:32.814 --> 01:36:35.174
And a change has actually
happened in my mouth.

01:36:35.174 --> 01:36:37.350
It's not just the movement,
but it's physically

01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:39.410
changing my mouth, right?

01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:42.660
So why should I have
to wear a retainer

01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.949
if my mouth is actually
changed because of my braces?

01:36:45.949 --> 01:36:47.740
PROFESSOR: Can you just
add a line in there

01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:54.720
after you say that the
PDL cushion gets back

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.290
into its proper shape.

01:36:56.290 --> 01:36:59.750
And then having
a retainer make--

01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:02.770
because bone remodeling and
rebuilding happens constantly.

01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:04.860
I think that's the
one fact that isn't

01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:08.640
in there that might be
the crucial point here,

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.700
that even after you get
braces your osteoclasts

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:14.240
and osteoblasts are continually
remodeling your jaw.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.350
That a retainer make sure that
the osteoblasts and clasts

01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:21.486
reformation is happening
in the right place.

01:37:21.486 --> 01:37:23.360
You can just throw in
a quick sentence there,

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.770
or a quick afterthought
to that sentence.

01:37:25.770 --> 01:37:27.220
And I think that clarifies that.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.245
AUDIENCE: I think another
thing to point out

01:37:38.245 --> 01:37:44.370
is that your descriptions of
the science that goes behind it

01:37:44.370 --> 01:37:46.330
don't seem very heavy.

01:37:46.330 --> 01:37:50.270
So if you wanted to
add more science,

01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:54.230
maybe, I think that would
be OK in this video.

01:37:54.230 --> 01:37:57.210
I wasn't distracted by the
science that was there.

01:37:57.210 --> 01:38:02.412
So if necessary, to
add more about the PDL,

01:38:02.412 --> 01:38:05.540
that could be done.

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.915
AUDIENCE: Well, I originally
had a lot more about the PDL

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:10.290
and I ended up cutting it out.

01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:15.750
PROFESSOR: I mean the reason why
I suggested that you take some

01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:19.180
of the stuff about the PDL out
is because the video was really

01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:22.140
starting to seem
more about the PDL

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:24.810
and less about bone remodeling.

01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:27.230
So I agree that the way
you've worded things,

01:38:27.230 --> 01:38:30.610
it's not too jargony.

01:38:30.610 --> 01:38:33.790
So if you wanted to add
more about remodeling

01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:36.130
and rebuilding, and more
about the osteoblasts

01:38:36.130 --> 01:38:41.700
and osteoclasts, maybe how
that bone remodeling happens

01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:47.170
to you in your leg bones
all the time when you grow.

01:38:47.170 --> 01:38:52.100
I think that's a perfectly
nice place for that addition.

01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:57.780
If you want to make room for it,
I do think that-- what is it--

01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:59.150
the mechanoreceptors part.

01:38:59.150 --> 01:39:02.069
It's a neat thing that I'm
OK with having in there.

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:03.610
But if you need to
make room for more

01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:05.750
science about the
osteoblasts and osteoclasts,

01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:07.790
I think it's OK
to take out, too.

01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:10.404
But I would hesitate to
talk more about the PDL,

01:39:10.404 --> 01:39:11.820
because then you're
really getting

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.440
into a different type of video.

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.640
Which if that's what you want
to pursue, that's totally fine.

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:22.560
But I think to me the
video is really more

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.070
about bone remodeling than it is
about the periodontal ligament.

01:39:27.070 --> 01:39:29.344
So that's my only hesitation
with adding more facts

01:39:29.344 --> 01:39:30.338
about the PDL.

01:39:39.284 --> 01:39:41.290
Does that sound good?

01:39:41.290 --> 01:39:43.430
All right, any last
thoughts Andrea's?

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:49.070
No.

01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:51.400
All right, Paul, do
you want to go next.

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:52.310
Or PJ.

01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:55.410
Paul is actually a PJ,
as discovered last week

01:39:55.410 --> 01:39:56.952
at the end of class.

01:39:56.952 --> 01:39:58.916
AUDIENCE: My parents
told me the other day

01:39:58.916 --> 01:40:01.249
that I didn't have a first
name for the first three days

01:40:01.249 --> 01:40:01.870
I was born.

01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:03.300
AUDIENCE: Wait, so
you're formally PJ?

01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:04.633
AUDIENCE: No, I'm formally Paul.

01:40:04.633 --> 01:40:06.831
But it took them three
days to [INAUDIBLE].

01:40:06.831 --> 01:40:08.330
AUDIENCE: But
everyone calls you PJ?

01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:11.823
AUDIENCE: Uh, it's 50-50.

01:40:11.823 --> 01:40:13.198
AUDIENCE: OK,
because I was like,

01:40:13.198 --> 01:40:14.739
gosh, why didn't we
know this sooner.

01:40:14.739 --> 01:40:16.992
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this was
my reaction last week, too,

01:40:16.992 --> 01:40:18.474
at the end of class.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.270
Oh yeah, the doc is gone.

01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:33.235
Siri's updating it-- or Sari.

01:40:33.235 --> 01:40:35.608
Sorry, I don't know
why I keep doing that.

01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:41.530
Wait, so your parents knew
that you were going to be a PJ,

01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:42.292
they just didn't--

01:40:42.292 --> 01:40:43.440
AUDIENCE: No, no,
they didn't know

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.648
what my name was going to be.

01:40:44.648 --> 01:40:45.592
PROFESSOR: Oh, ok.

01:40:45.592 --> 01:40:47.550
AUDIENCE: It's amazing
how many people do that.

01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:49.530
Did they know you were
going to be a boy?

01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:52.005
AUDIENCE: No.

01:40:52.005 --> 01:40:53.985
They did it old school.

01:40:53.985 --> 01:41:09.825
[INAUDIBLE] No, I don't.

01:41:09.825 --> 01:41:11.999
I'm the youngest [INAUDIBLE].

01:41:11.999 --> 01:41:13.290
AUDIENCE: You run out of names.

01:41:16.076 --> 01:41:17.076
PROFESSOR: Is it up now?

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:20.980
Refresh.

01:41:30.192 --> 01:41:31.900
Yeah, it's still
showing up blank for me.

01:41:35.386 --> 01:41:37.520
Do you mind reading it
from your Google doc

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.544
while Sari figures that out?

01:41:41.544 --> 01:41:43.492
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:41:43.492 --> 01:41:44.953
PROFESSOR: All
right, laptops down.

01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:51.710
And remember, read it
like you would host it.

01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:00.190
AUDIENCE: Let's take the
small foam box, Orca One,

01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:02.160
and cut a hole in it.

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:06.330
Now, let's put this box in
water and see what happens.

01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:08.100
As you can see, the
box unfortunately

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:11.290
sinks due to the weight
of the added water.

01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:15.400
Now what if that box contained
cargo, or oil, or even people.

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:19.010
That would make for a very bad.

01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:22.710
Now let's take Orca Two
and do the same thing.

01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:24.876
You can see that Orca Two
do not sink, all though it

01:42:24.876 --> 01:42:26.660
is sitting at an angle.

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.910
So why did Orca Two not sink?

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:32.130
As easy as it sounds,
this simple demonstration

01:42:32.130 --> 01:42:35.447
is essential to the design
of huge, complex ships, ships

01:42:35.447 --> 01:42:37.280
that are responsible
for safely transporting

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.510
90% of all our stuff.

01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:42.090
As naval architects,
how do we design

01:42:42.090 --> 01:42:45.040
ships carrying our stuff to
make it into port safely and not

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:45.989
sink?

01:42:45.989 --> 01:42:47.280
Well, let's take a look inside.

01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:52.870
Here we have Orca One
and Orca To from before.

01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:55.980
Even though these boxes do not
engage in international trade,

01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:59.940
they behave just as 1,000
foot steel cargo ship would.

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.910
If we remove the top the
boxes and take a look inside,

01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:05.130
we see that Orca Two is
divided into compartments

01:43:05.130 --> 01:43:07.410
by these walls, called
transverse bulkheads,

01:43:07.410 --> 01:43:10.740
while Orca One is not.

01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:12.800
These compartments
are water tight,

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:15.250
meaning even if
damage-- [INAUDIBLE].

01:43:15.250 --> 01:43:17.270
So these compartments
are water tight.

01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:19.280
Even if damage occurs in
this part of the ship,

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.840
water rushing in won't go
into other compartments

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:24.240
because the damage is isolated.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:28.240
We refer to Orca Two
as being subdivided.

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:29.870
It is unclear when
subdivision started

01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:32.980
being used in boat building, but
accounts of Chinese trade ships

01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:35.190
as far back as the
fifth century indicate

01:43:35.190 --> 01:43:37.840
that water would enter
ships without sinking.

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:40.760
So how exactly does this work?

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:43.492
Well, when we divide the
ship into water compartments,

01:43:43.492 --> 01:43:44.950
we are limiting
the amount of water

01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:46.700
that can enter the vessel.

01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:51.150
If we divide a ship into 10
equal watertight compartments,

01:43:51.150 --> 01:43:53.650
and one compartment
sprung a leak,

01:43:53.650 --> 01:43:56.130
only that compartment
would take on water.

01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:59.910
This would likely cause
the ship to heel and trim,

01:43:59.910 --> 01:44:01.520
but it would not
cause a complete loss

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:02.810
of shipping cargo.

01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:05.210
And the ship would be able
to hobble back into port

01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:06.395
and get repairs.

01:44:06.395 --> 01:44:09.320
But why is it so important,
you might be asking.

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.690
Because ships are huge and
they carry a ton of stuff.

01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:15.250
A ship the size of more the
four football fields can

01:44:15.250 --> 01:44:18.860
carry 715 million
bananas, that is about one

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:20.600
for every European.

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:23.730
Also, US takes in
almost $2 trillion

01:44:23.730 --> 01:44:26.230
worth of goods every
year through ships.

01:44:26.230 --> 01:44:28.070
So by subdividing
ships, we're ensuring

01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:30.590
the safe delivery of
our stuff and the health

01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:32.850
of international World Trade.

01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:36.580
But sadly, even with subdivision
vessels still can sink.

01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:39.080
It is both expensive
and impractical

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:41.900
to design a ship that can
withstand any amount of damage,

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:44.400
so Naval architects consider
the likelihood of damage

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.320
in writing ship
design regulations.

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:49.560
Also, the use of computers
in naval architecture

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.320
allows us to simulate a
likely damage scenarios,

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.930
so we can better prevent
them from happening.

01:44:54.930 --> 01:44:57.584
So the next time you use your
cellphone or eat a banana,

01:44:57.584 --> 01:44:59.000
remember the amount
of engineering

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.840
that went into safely
delivering it to you.

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.560
PROFESSOR: You are good on time.

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:11.660
It was about four minutes.

01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:15.300
It's up now?

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:20.554
So you guys should be able
to access the script now.

01:45:20.554 --> 01:45:22.595
Does anyone have thoughts
about this off the bat?

01:45:28.295 --> 01:45:32.720
AUDIENCE: PJ slash Paul, there
have been moments in class

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.650
when I feel like your
personality has come out

01:45:34.650 --> 01:45:37.890
and I've your eyes
sparkle and your voice--

01:45:37.890 --> 01:45:39.890
I feel like there's
two versions of you.

01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:41.970
There's probably
serious coastguard man.

01:45:41.970 --> 01:45:45.386
And there's like [INAUDIBLE].

01:45:45.386 --> 01:45:48.434
And I think the thing that we
need to make sure we tap into

01:45:48.434 --> 01:45:51.640
is not super serious
coast guard man,

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:54.943
because when you read
that just now, I was like,

01:45:54.943 --> 01:45:57.200
he's talking like this
and I'm kind of board.

01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:58.575
AUDIENCE: That
was me inflecting.

01:45:59.652 --> 01:46:01.610
PROFESSOR: Remember that
you have to exaggerate

01:46:01.610 --> 01:46:02.780
in front of the camera.

01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:03.821
AUDIENCE: You're smiling.

01:46:03.821 --> 01:46:04.578
You're dynamic.

01:46:04.578 --> 01:46:06.720
Your voice is alive.

01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:08.910
I know it's in there
because I've seen it.

01:46:08.910 --> 01:46:11.490
And when we talked about giving
fifth graders pornography,

01:46:11.490 --> 01:46:14.134
it was definitely there.

01:46:14.134 --> 01:46:15.050
PROFESSOR: Wait, what?

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:23.330
AUDIENCE: Teaching faux pas
that I had back in the day.

01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:25.835
So I know that that
personality in you

01:46:25.835 --> 01:46:29.250
is totally there,
regardless of the content.

01:46:29.250 --> 01:46:31.605
I feel like you
need to find a zen

01:46:31.605 --> 01:46:35.890
way to channel that part of you,
being whatever video content

01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:39.245
you do, because there's
something innately very

01:46:39.245 --> 01:46:41.845
fascinating about this.

01:46:41.845 --> 01:46:42.970
Like content's really cool.

01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:46.280
The fact that you have this
is really awesome experience

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:50.400
that none of us have and I
totally think is amazing.

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.380
But if you gave it the way
that you gave it right now,

01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:55.450
you would kill us.

01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:57.730
So we've got to
figure out how to get

01:46:57.730 --> 01:47:01.752
that energy in your being.

01:47:01.752 --> 01:47:04.650
AUDIENCE: I agree with you.

01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:09.970
AUDIENCE: What was your two
line summary of the whole.

01:47:09.970 --> 01:47:13.470
AUDIENCE: So my initial
one was wasn't that great.

01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:17.460
But like it's pretty much taking
something simple that people

01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:20.320
know how to do, like
floating and sinking,

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:24.190
and how there's a
lot of complex things

01:47:24.190 --> 01:47:27.140
that are designed and built
to carry a lot of really

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:29.280
important things
that we depend, based

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:36.340
off very elementary principles.

01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:39.724
PROFESSOR: I will show you
your two sentence pitch.

01:47:39.724 --> 01:47:40.390
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:41.380
-Yes.

01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:43.330
-It feels a lot like a document.

01:47:43.330 --> 01:47:44.980
-What do you mean by that?

01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:47.977
-Kind of like the
image I get like kind

01:47:47.977 --> 01:47:50.555
of walking through a museum.

01:47:50.555 --> 01:47:51.729
[INAUDIBLE]

01:47:51.729 --> 01:47:53.685
-Tell us what it is.

01:47:53.685 --> 01:47:57.110
-So it's about subdivisions,
subdivision in ships.

01:47:57.110 --> 01:48:01.050
So if you take something
that floats, like a shoe box,

01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:03.890
and you put a hole
it in, it'll sink.

01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:07.590
But if you divide that shoe
box into watertight sections,

01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:11.574
this one compartment might
not cause it to sink.

01:48:11.574 --> 01:48:17.110
And how we've advanced to a time
where a ship can be extensively

01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:19.330
damaged and still stay afloat.

01:48:19.330 --> 01:48:20.860
And people won't die.

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:24.690
[END PLAYBACK]

01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:27.115
AUDIENCE: Sort of like
the first little section

01:48:27.115 --> 01:48:29.530
that you gave about
it, it's almost

01:48:29.530 --> 01:48:31.530
like I'd like you
to say that and then

01:48:31.530 --> 01:48:36.880
say hey, we can just do this
experiment live right now.

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:39.210
Why don't we just
do this, right now.

01:48:39.210 --> 01:48:42.160
Let's take this-- and here's
a small foam box, that I've

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.740
decided to call Orca One.

01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:44.630
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:48:44.630 --> 01:48:46.210
OK.

01:48:46.210 --> 01:48:48.710
PROFESSOR: And I think again,
I mean the showing not telling

01:48:48.710 --> 01:48:51.740
is really hard to script when
you haven't actually worked

01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:53.930
with the video stuff that much.

01:48:53.930 --> 01:48:56.340
And maybe as you shoot,
you'll realize, oh,

01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:58.930
I don't actually need
to say, as you can see.

01:48:58.930 --> 01:49:01.880
I can just say the box sinks.

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:05.210
And you don't need
to say-- you don't

01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:06.960
put any contractions
in your script, which

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.240
I think is interesting.

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:12.380
And when you deliver the lines,
you're not going to say do not.

01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:14.220
You're just going to
say it doesn't sink.

01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:16.671
AUDIENCE: I say
let's right there.

01:49:16.671 --> 01:49:17.420
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:19.509
One apostrophe.

01:49:19.509 --> 01:49:21.050
AUDIENCE: Doing
this, you're probably

01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:23.190
going to ad lib based
on what happens,

01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:26.282
just like the crazy
Russian hacker

01:49:26.282 --> 01:49:28.530
guy who's like, OK,
that didn't [INAUDIBLE].

01:49:28.530 --> 01:49:31.690
And that's what gives it,
kind of, your personality

01:49:31.690 --> 01:49:34.440
will come out as
this is happening.

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:39.350
AUDIENCE: So with the
introduction I was-- Elizabeth

01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:43.040
and Sari's comments kind
of allude to there's

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:45.605
got to be some
sort of like-- just

01:49:45.605 --> 01:49:46.980
to know what we're
talking about.

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:47.860
So I did that.

01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:49.912
And then that turned
out to be bad.

01:49:49.912 --> 01:49:50.995
It was a bad introduction.

01:49:53.610 --> 01:49:56.600
So the George said,
just get right into.

01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:59.660
Just get right into
the box and how this--

01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:02.682
so I'm kind of
confused, though, what--

01:50:02.682 --> 01:50:04.390
AUDIENCE: What you
just said was perfect.

01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:05.732
AUDIENCE: With?

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:08.190
AUDIENCE: We all know that some
things sink and some things

01:50:08.190 --> 01:50:08.950
float.

01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:11.680
But it's actually
not that simple.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:14.300
And this fairly
rudimentary concept

01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:18.180
is something that naval
architects use every day.

01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:21.580
PROFESSOR: Wait, but
that was the original--

01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:24.780
do you mind if I pull up the
Google doc that you sent me

01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:25.280
before?

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:35.570
AUDIENCE: I just felt like
it started really abruptly.

01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:38.510
And you needed just a
little, little, little bit.

01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:39.655
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:50:39.655 --> 01:50:42.270
Even just having a
mock Navy ship smashed

01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:45.055
and then watching
it sink or float.

01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:47.530
Because like, what you're
talking about is the grey zone

01:50:47.530 --> 01:50:50.910
in between sinking and floating.

01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:54.410
And you want us to get in that
grey zone quickly with you.

01:50:54.410 --> 01:50:57.130
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I like that
you're starting a right away.

01:50:57.130 --> 01:50:59.755
Like I know that we
had talked about-- Josh

01:50:59.755 --> 01:51:01.800
had mentioned that
during his workshop,

01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:04.480
like to start in the action.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.260
But I think that
your intro itself

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:11.930
is visually interesting enough
and topically foreign enough

01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:18.470
to most people, to where that in
itself is a bit of a hook, too.

01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:21.660
And by setup, we don't mean
like an entire paragraph.

01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:26.150
I think like that one
sentences is fine, actually.

01:51:26.150 --> 01:51:29.086
And when you guys
shoot, I really

01:51:29.086 --> 01:51:30.960
challenge you guys not
to use a script, which

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.300
sounds terrifying.

01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:35.305
And often times that'll
just mean, what line do I

01:51:35.305 --> 01:51:36.045
have to say here.

01:51:36.045 --> 01:51:37.170
I'm going to say this line.

01:51:37.170 --> 01:51:38.378
And you put down your script.

01:51:38.378 --> 01:51:39.600
And you deliver it ad lib.

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.710
But it's going to come out so
much more natural that way.

01:51:42.710 --> 01:51:48.090
When you talk in real life,
you turn your head a lot,

01:51:48.090 --> 01:51:54.190
that's what makes you seem like
a human, versus a humanoid.

01:51:54.190 --> 01:51:56.240
Not saying that the
delivery was this time.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:59.660
But there are a lot of things
that people do naturally

01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:00.867
that they don't realize.

01:52:00.867 --> 01:52:02.950
And so I think it's fun
to point it out to people,

01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:06.220
because when you're shooting
in front of a camera,

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:09.374
it's very hard to
remember those things.

01:52:09.374 --> 01:52:11.540
It's really hard to be
natural in front of a camera,

01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:13.140
basically.

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:15.380
But like all of you guys
were saying-- or some

01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:16.480
of you guys were
saying, like I'm not

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:17.646
good in front of the camera.

01:52:17.646 --> 01:52:19.760
And I watched some of the
raw footage from class.

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:21.040
And you guys are all great.

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:25.230
And it's technically in
front of a camera, right?

01:52:25.230 --> 01:52:27.630
So you're just not looking
and not aware of it.

01:52:27.630 --> 01:52:31.030
So it's somehow being
able to extrapolate

01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:34.160
how you are in this
classroom and carrying

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.660
that over to when
there's a camera

01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:38.350
right in front of your face.

01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:41.000
And I do think that it's the
little things, like sometimes

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:41.920
you tilt your head.

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.710
Sometimes you look
off and not directly

01:52:43.710 --> 01:52:45.480
in front of the camera.

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:46.850
Blinking is a big thing.

01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:49.930
I don't know if I mentioned
that in earlier classes.

01:52:49.930 --> 01:52:54.090
But if you look at your footage
and you're like I seem off

01:52:54.090 --> 01:52:55.580
and I don't know why.

01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.080
I feel like my voice is fine.

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.110
I feel like my pacing is fine.

01:53:00.110 --> 01:53:01.950
Try to notice how
many times you blink.

01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:04.500
A lot of times people
will keep their eyes

01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:06.410
for a really long
period of time.

01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:09.620
And they don't blink where it
makes sense in their speech.

01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:11.376
And so they're just
talking like this.

01:53:11.376 --> 01:53:12.348
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
who does this.

01:53:12.348 --> 01:53:14.125
When he gives presentations
it's totally creepy.

01:53:14.125 --> 01:53:14.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:15.370
Yeah so--

01:53:15.370 --> 01:53:18.120
AUDIENCE: I'm like,
dude, you have to blink.

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:21.950
PROFESSOR: Blinking, head
tilts, looking off to the side

01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:25.200
like you would normally,
those are little techniques

01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:27.360
that you can think about
when you're hosting.

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:30.170
And it's sort of counter
intuitive to force

01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:31.940
yourself to be
natural, but sometimes

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:33.787
that's what you have to do.

01:53:33.787 --> 01:53:36.120
AUDIENCE: I really recommend,
if you haven't already-- I

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.700
think most of you have already.

01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:41.100
But for your reflections,
think about doing a vlog,

01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:45.250
because vlogging is like the
basest form of video creation

01:53:45.250 --> 01:53:48.950
in that you like literally
stare at your computer.

01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:50.870
And if you want
to get comfortable

01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:53.395
with the idea of a camera,
you can set up your camera

01:53:53.395 --> 01:53:55.040
as though you were
recording yourself

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:57.470
for your video, or
something like that.

01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:59.840
And just talking to it.

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:04.120
Because we have no expectations
for your daily reflections.

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:08.310
You can be like, I was really
scared going into class today.

01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:10.970
And then you can stop thinking.

01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:12.370
And you can look off camera.

01:54:12.370 --> 01:54:12.720
And you can say um.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:13.970
And we won't judge you at all.

01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:17.620
And it gives a good
reference point for when

01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.900
you do have a polished video.

01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:21.270
It's like do I have
even some of the quirks

01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:23.230
that I showed my vlog.

01:54:23.230 --> 01:54:24.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:27.085
AUDIENCE: And it just gets
you more-- I don't know,

01:54:27.085 --> 01:54:29.200
I was really uncomfortable
in front of the camera.

01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:30.158
And I still kind of am.

01:54:30.158 --> 01:54:33.710
But vlogging and
doing that process

01:54:33.710 --> 01:54:37.050
and seeing how, oh, if I make
a mistake, like forgetting what

01:54:37.050 --> 01:54:40.122
I'm going to say, I can just cut
that out and seal it together.

01:54:40.122 --> 01:54:41.830
It really gets you a
lot more comfortable

01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:44.450
with just seeing your face on
the screen, which is a really

01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:46.625
foreign experience for people.

01:54:46.625 --> 01:54:48.750
PROFESSOR: I think the
overall format of the script

01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:50.492
is pretty strong.

01:54:50.492 --> 01:54:52.700
I don't think you need to
change a whole lot in terms

01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:55.280
of the format.

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.890
Adding a little bit of context
at the beginning would help.

01:54:59.890 --> 01:55:03.004
Stuff like this
sentence, though, I

01:55:03.004 --> 01:55:04.670
don't think you would
ever say these two

01:55:04.670 --> 01:55:07.277
sentences in real life,
in your speech, right?

01:55:07.277 --> 01:55:08.485
AUDIENCE: That's what I said.

01:55:08.485 --> 01:55:10.860
I think while he's doing it,
he's going to be ad libbing.

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:15.016
PROFESSOR: And again, you
don't have to script it.

01:55:15.016 --> 01:55:17.140
It's OK if you deviate from
the script a little bit

01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:20.030
when you actually
deliver your lines.

01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:22.080
But this sentence,
that would make

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:25.260
for very bad day, or the one
that at the end of your video,

01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:30.340
you know, that's why we can't
enjoy-- or decomposition

01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:31.920
is awesome.

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.640
You don't necessarily have to
say that out loud to people,

01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.670
they're just going to
kind of know already.

01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:41.810
The one comment I
wanted to make was

01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:55.044
that the context--
I think introducing

01:55:55.044 --> 01:55:56.710
a little bit of context
at the beginning

01:55:56.710 --> 01:55:59.820
will help with this issue,
because right now without it

01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:04.120
this jump seems really
huge all of the sudden.

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:06.740
Talking about sinking
and then talking

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:09.740
about economy and money,
all of the sudden.

01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:12.720
I don't know if any of you
guys felt that way, too.

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:15.900
But it seems a little
like, oh man, first we

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:18.315
were talking about
cardboard boxes,

01:56:18.315 --> 01:56:20.190
now we're talking about
trillions of dollars.

01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:21.920
And I think it's a
good point to make.

01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:23.270
Because you do want
to take people out

01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:24.186
to the bigger context.

01:56:26.710 --> 01:56:28.100
Yeah, but it is a little abrupt.

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:36.410
And instead of saying, but sadly
even with this subdivision,

01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:38.880
I think you can set
this up as a question.

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:41.590
So we have the subdivision,
why do ships still sink?

01:56:43.623 --> 01:56:45.956
AUDIENCE: And last comment,
then I have to hit the road.

01:56:45.956 --> 01:56:47.830
But if any of you didn't
get feedback from me

01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:51.790
and you want it, because I
have to leave a little early.

01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:54.265
Just email me.

01:56:54.265 --> 01:56:56.368
My [INAUDIBLE]
address is not the one

01:56:56.368 --> 01:56:59.220
that grants me access
to Google Docs.

01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:01.312
So if you want, just
email me and I'll

01:57:01.312 --> 01:57:05.944
give you my gmail account so
that I can actually read it.

01:57:05.944 --> 01:57:10.970
The naval, ship is such a
cool thread throughout this,

01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:13.698
that I don't think
you necessarily--

01:57:13.698 --> 01:57:18.162
like if you can use the
cardboard box as Navy ships,

01:57:18.162 --> 01:57:21.634
and not have them me
be just abstract boxes.

01:57:21.634 --> 01:57:23.618
And if the cargo
ship carrying bananas

01:57:23.618 --> 01:57:25.810
is carrying military personnel.

01:57:25.810 --> 01:57:28.845
You don't have to go outside
of that genre in order for this

01:57:28.845 --> 01:57:30.372
to be a really cool video.

01:57:30.372 --> 01:57:31.830
In fact, I think
it's cooler if you

01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:35.950
stick with the military theme,
because that's something that's

01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:39.170
actually-- especially to middle
school boys who like blowing up

01:57:39.170 --> 01:57:41.740
things-- that's even
more authentically

01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:44.340
cool than bananas.

01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:47.260
And plus, if you
can even make Orca,

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:50.226
the box, look a
little bit like--

01:57:50.226 --> 01:57:51.476
AUDIENCE: I already made them.

01:57:51.476 --> 01:57:52.910
AUDIENCE: You made them?

01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:58.168
But even if you just [INAUDIBLE]
and put some stars on them.

01:57:58.168 --> 01:58:00.809
It doesn't have to be crazy
fancy to still get the idea

01:58:00.809 --> 01:58:04.073
that this is like
a Navy ship, right?

01:58:04.073 --> 01:58:06.550
But I think that if
that Navy theme hums

01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:09.580
throughout the whole
thing, then it's

01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:14.100
like that becomes a
really cool theme.

01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:15.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:58:15.810 --> 01:58:16.782
AUDIENCE: I gotta run.

01:58:16.782 --> 01:58:17.782
I'm gonna miss my train.

01:58:17.782 --> 01:58:19.760
But you guys are
awesome. [INAUDIBLE].

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.870
PROFESSOR: Julia, do you
want to say something?

01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:23.373
Thanks, Jamie.

01:58:23.373 --> 01:58:25.788
AUDIENCE: When the
football fields and bananas

01:58:25.788 --> 01:58:29.170
were introduced, that was kind
of taking me out of the video

01:58:29.170 --> 01:58:32.554
and making me think of monkeys.

01:58:32.554 --> 01:58:35.458
And then at the
end, also, you're

01:58:35.458 --> 01:58:37.394
mentioning cell
phones and bananas,

01:58:37.394 --> 01:58:40.800
but you never mentioned
cell phones before that.

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:43.835
So I do like the idea
of kind of keeping

01:58:43.835 --> 01:58:45.775
with the military theme.

01:58:45.775 --> 01:58:48.522
Also some of the--
there was a part

01:58:48.522 --> 01:58:51.584
where you had to
questions-- a question

01:58:51.584 --> 01:58:53.292
at the end of the
paragraph, and that was

01:58:53.292 --> 01:58:55.500
for two consecutive paragraphs.

01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:57.467
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right here.

01:58:57.467 --> 01:58:58.300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:59:01.235 --> 01:59:02.770
PROFESSOR: That's a good point.

01:59:02.770 --> 01:59:05.006
AUDIENCE: Taking
out of the video.

01:59:05.006 --> 01:59:10.791
But other than that, I
really enjoyed the content.

01:59:10.791 --> 01:59:13.713
This is very different
from the original draft,

01:59:13.713 --> 01:59:17.609
but I would very much
enjoy watching this video

01:59:17.609 --> 01:59:18.272
at this point.

01:59:18.272 --> 01:59:19.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
originally you had

01:59:19.730 --> 01:59:22.189
talked about Archimedes'
principle and buoyancy,

01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:24.230
but I think this is a lot
stronger because you're

01:59:24.230 --> 01:59:29.300
actually getting into why
the compartments itself.

01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:33.330
AUDIENCE: So just like pretty
much fix those questions

01:59:33.330 --> 01:59:39.184
and take out the whole
merchant marine-type thing.

01:59:39.184 --> 01:59:40.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
I think the point

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:44.130
that you're trying to make with
those examples is basically

01:59:44.130 --> 01:59:46.810
just the sheer
importance of making

01:59:46.810 --> 01:59:49.110
sure your ships stay afloat.

01:59:49.110 --> 01:59:51.970
And I think you can do that
with other examples that

01:59:51.970 --> 01:59:56.480
are a little more
unified to the theme.

01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:59.160
I will say that this
stuff at the end,

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:08.189
like this sentence right here,
no, this portion right here.

02:00:08.189 --> 02:00:09.980
If you want to expand
on that a little bit,

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:11.950
I think it would be
interesting, because it's

02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:16.070
more of like a current
event engineering problem.

02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:18.990
And again, like that
makes the video more

02:00:18.990 --> 02:00:21.820
unique than a typical
engineering textbook.

02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:24.460
You're talking about what are
the actual problems that I

02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:28.470
myself as a naval
architect am dealing with.

02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:34.104
And you can talk about the--
I don't think you need an also

02:00:34.104 --> 02:00:35.520
right here, because
this is really

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.320
a continuation of
this explanation.

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:42.140
Ships sink because they're
expensive to design.

02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:46.000
So you have trade offs
in the engineering of it.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.760
But we use computers
to simulate the damage,

02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:51.780
so we know exactly
how to subdivide them

02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:56.000
and what the best way to
design those subdivisions are.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.520
And then instead
of this sentence,

02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:03.320
I mean this point is a little
bit different than the point

02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:09.300
that you're intending, which is
that very simple principles are

02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:14.750
what allow huge, seemingly
complicated machines to work.

02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:17.020
So maybe you can somehow
revisit that point

02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:18.720
at the end instead
of this sentence.

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:20.489
I think that would
end it a lot stronger.

02:01:23.447 --> 02:01:27.884
AUDIENCE: So was your advice
generally to drop the cargo

02:01:27.884 --> 02:01:28.705
ship.

02:01:28.705 --> 02:01:30.205
AUDIENCE: That
wasn't even in there.

02:01:30.205 --> 02:01:31.980
I added all that.

02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:38.740
It was more, I'd say, the
equations and stuff like that.

02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:43.186
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
the draft that he sent us,

02:01:43.186 --> 02:01:47.091
and there was a big part
about Archimedes principle

02:01:47.091 --> 02:01:47.632
and buoyancy.

02:01:47.632 --> 02:01:51.584
Which again, is super
informative, very accurate.

02:01:51.584 --> 02:01:53.507
It's the type of
material that they're

02:01:53.507 --> 02:01:54.548
going to learn in school.

02:01:54.548 --> 02:01:57.030
But it isn't necessarily
vital to-- this

02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:59.488
is more of an engineering video
than it is a physics video.

02:01:59.488 --> 02:02:02.946
And I think that's very valuable
because there's actually

02:02:02.946 --> 02:02:04.922
not a lot of material
on this out there.

02:02:04.922 --> 02:02:08.380
So I think it's more
unique [INAUDIBLE].

02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:10.850
I'm going to give him
a chance to-- like

02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:14.583
someone who's teaching
Archimedes principle may find

02:02:14.583 --> 02:02:17.541
this video really
[INAUDIBLE] in class

02:02:17.541 --> 02:02:20.006
because it gives them
a different context.

02:02:20.006 --> 02:02:22.342
So you took out this
big chunk, but I

02:02:22.342 --> 02:02:24.050
think that you replaced
it with something

02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:26.456
a lot better for the video.

02:02:26.456 --> 02:02:31.770
AUDIENCE: I'm looking
at simple demonstration

02:02:31.770 --> 02:02:34.965
is essential to the design of
huge, complex ships, ships that

02:02:34.965 --> 02:02:36.590
are responsible for
safely transporting

02:02:36.590 --> 02:02:38.830
90% of all our stuff.

02:02:38.830 --> 02:02:40.770
PROFESSOR: Wait, where is this?

02:02:40.770 --> 02:02:42.690
AUDIENCE: It says new
angle way up at the top.

02:02:42.690 --> 02:02:43.315
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:47.670
AUDIENCE: I mean--
I kind of thought

02:02:47.670 --> 02:02:51.220
the container ships are sort
of a theme in the entire thing.

02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:55.417
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I don't think
cargo-- I'm not saying get rid

02:02:55.417 --> 02:02:56.500
of the cargo stuff at all.

02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:59.995
AUDIENCE: OK, because
I mean, that's my bread

02:02:59.995 --> 02:03:04.450
and butter is merchant ships
and not-- because I'm not

02:03:04.450 --> 02:03:06.619
really in the Navy or anything.

02:03:06.619 --> 02:03:08.410
AUDIENCE: And then the
tie-in with the cell

02:03:08.410 --> 02:03:10.500
phone thing is that
safely transporting

02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:13.070
90% of all of our stuff.

02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:16.070
If you take like a zoom in
on a cell and flip it over

02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:19.323
and it says "Made in China"
that's sort of like how

02:03:19.323 --> 02:03:21.726
did this get from
China into my hand.

02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:27.330
PROFESSOR: I don't think that
you should get rid of the cargo

02:03:27.330 --> 02:03:28.960
stuff completely.

02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:32.440
Sorry if it sounds like we're
having competing opinions.

02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:34.310
I think the thing
that throws us off

02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:38.640
is the connections to
the examples you make

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:39.990
aren't necessarily immediate.

02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:45.040
So I hear four football fields
can carry 750 million bananas.

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:47.530
Wait, why is he talking about
bananas all of the sudden.

02:03:47.530 --> 02:03:50.830
AUDIENCE: I was just trying to
say like how-- yeah, I got it.

02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:53.410
I'll try to revisit that.

02:03:53.410 --> 02:03:55.330
PROFESSOR: And maybe
it's as simple as adding

02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:57.380
a single sentence
right here, about they

02:03:57.380 --> 02:04:00.700
carry a ton of stuff,
a lot of products

02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:03.930
that we have to import
from other places.

02:04:03.930 --> 02:04:05.670
Things like bananas.

02:04:05.670 --> 02:04:10.722
And a ship the size of this
can carry 750 million bananas.

02:04:10.722 --> 02:04:12.721
So it just sets up the
example a little bit more

02:04:12.721 --> 02:04:14.412
clearly, if that makes sense.

02:04:18.770 --> 02:04:21.365
Any other thoughts for PJ?

02:04:24.530 --> 02:04:27.240
So I think that we're at a
good stopping point here.

02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:30.420
I don't want to hold
you guys over today.

02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:34.000
So we have Kenneth and
Joshua left, right?

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.950
So tomorrow we will
finish up the table

02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:38.320
reads with their stuff.

02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:42.540
And then I'm going to give my
final talk on post production.

02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:45.860
So this is everything
from editing, to music,

02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:48.440
to thinking about what you do
with the footage that you take.

02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:50.400
We'll also tell
you tomorrow what

02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:52.010
groups you're going to film in.

02:04:52.010 --> 02:04:56.560
Was anyone planning on
filming stuff tonight?

02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.350
No?

02:04:58.350 --> 02:04:58.850
That's fine.

02:04:58.850 --> 02:05:02.480
Just use tonight to
rework your scripts.

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:05.300
As far as deliverables
and assignments,

02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:10.140
I think really reworking your
scripts tonight and tomorrow

02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:11.320
should be the main focus.

02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:13.592
So I'm not going to have
anything particularly due.

02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:23.060
How about all that footage
that you shot last week,

02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:25.470
I'll let you guys tinker
around with the editing of that

02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:26.895
after I give my editing lecture.

02:05:26.895 --> 02:05:28.940
Does that makes sense to people?

02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:31.830
So for tonight,
rework your scripts.

02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:34.830
And for people who haven't,
I mean Kenneth and Joshua,

02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:37.420
if you want to update
stuff based off

02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:39.500
of the things we talked
about today, that's fine.

02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:42.380
And you can just
send Sari an update.

02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:44.780
Make sure to do your
daily blogs, though.

02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:48.160
That'll be really helpful.

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:50.240
And then just come to
class ready tomorrow

02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:54.030
to finish up the two reads
and then do some editing.

02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:56.180
Does that sound good?

02:05:56.180 --> 02:06:01.090
The first cut of your video is
going to be due this Friday.

02:06:01.090 --> 02:06:03.170
Do you think that is
feasible and reasonable?

02:06:07.670 --> 02:06:12.194
So this would be the first
draft of your video, basically.

02:06:12.194 --> 02:06:14.360
Like you'd have to film
everything for it this week.

02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:23.009
AUDIENCE: Is there a day where
we're submitting the shots--

02:06:23.009 --> 02:06:24.050
PROFESSOR: The shot list?

02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:25.810
Yeah.

02:06:25.810 --> 02:06:32.120
I would like to see that
by Wednesday, if possible.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:36.900
But that's really more for
your benefit over mine.

02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:38.794
AUDIENCE: And Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday

02:06:38.794 --> 02:06:40.974
will be in class workdays.

02:06:40.974 --> 02:06:42.390
PROFESSOR: Friday's
the screening.

02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:44.990
What I could do-- so this
weekend is a three day weekend.

02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:46.710
We don't have class next Monday.

02:06:46.710 --> 02:06:49.690
If it would help people to
use that weekend to film more,

02:06:49.690 --> 02:06:51.246
I could have the
rough cuts due--

02:06:51.246 --> 02:06:52.620
or we could screen
the rough cuts

02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:55.690
on Tuesday instead of Friday.

02:06:55.690 --> 02:06:58.890
Would that help people?

02:06:58.890 --> 02:07:01.460
AUDIENCE: My
question is, I guess,

02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:03.111
what are like the
things you generally

02:07:03.111 --> 02:07:07.260
would do between a rough cut and
a final cut that would like--

02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:11.300
PROFESSOR: So, I will talk a
little bit about that tomorrow.

02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:13.670
I'll actually show you the
rough cuts of our old videos.

02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:16.500
But a rough cut
takes all the footage

02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:20.130
that you've shot and puts it
together into a draft that

02:07:20.130 --> 02:07:24.230
doesn't have music, and
may be missing some scenes,

02:07:24.230 --> 02:07:27.880
or may require
reshooots of scenes.

02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:31.110
So usually what happens between
a rough cut and a final cut,

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:34.890
in addition to music and
maybe better editing,

02:07:34.890 --> 02:07:38.930
is you almost always end
up reshooting something

02:07:38.930 --> 02:07:41.780
because it doesn't look that
good in the context of all

02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:43.270
your other footage.

02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:45.709
So the only reason why I
had a rough cut due so early

02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:47.250
is because I wanted
to leave you guys

02:07:47.250 --> 02:07:50.420
enough time to reshoot
if you needed to.

02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:52.270
But if it's going
to be too much work

02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:54.620
to get the rough in
place in the first place,

02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:57.975
I'd rather you really try to
get as good of a rough cut

02:07:57.975 --> 02:08:01.419
as you can than try
to rush one together.

02:08:01.419 --> 02:08:02.210
DAVID: [INAUDIBLE].

02:08:07.348 --> 02:08:08.472
PROFESSOR: Not necessarily.

02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:15.430
So if it-- are we on consensus?

02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:18.810
You guys want rough cut due
on Tuesday instead of Friday?

02:08:18.810 --> 02:08:20.810
Because that totally
works for me.

02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:24.740
Basically, after tomorrow,
and aside from the screening

02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:27.020
of the rough cut, every
other day of class

02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:30.806
is work time for the projects.

02:08:30.806 --> 02:08:32.180
AUDIENCE: And that
next week it's

02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:34.952
Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?

02:08:34.952 --> 02:08:38.060
Because doesn't the class end--

02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:43.340
PROFESSOR: The class ends--
so today is the 12th.

02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:46.480
Yeah, so the class
ends that Thursday.

02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:50.050
It was sort of optimizing like
leaving enough time to get

02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:51.910
the rough cut, but also
leaving enough time

02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:55.570
to give you time for reshoots.

02:08:55.570 --> 02:09:00.490
Our screening is the
evening of the 22nd.

02:09:00.490 --> 02:09:02.003
Yeah.

02:09:02.003 --> 02:09:03.669
AUDIENCE: But then
what happens, though,

02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:04.920
the last week [INAUDIBLE].

02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:07.610
PROFESSOR: So the
last week of IEP

02:09:07.610 --> 02:09:12.740
we'll pick scripts to produce
for season three of Science

02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:13.710
Out Loud.

02:09:13.710 --> 02:09:16.880
And if you guys are
interested and if it

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.330
fits into the casting, then
we would produce your video,

02:09:21.330 --> 02:09:24.150
basically.

02:09:24.150 --> 02:09:27.810
I'm I'm sorry to the SUTD
guys, you have to go back.

02:09:27.810 --> 02:09:28.450
Yeah.

02:09:28.450 --> 02:09:30.850
You could stay another week.

02:09:30.850 --> 02:09:32.600
So that's why we
end so early, is

02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:34.940
because you guys have to
go back and then we're

02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:36.790
producing season
three in parallel.

02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:43.020
So that's all I have.

02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:45.620
I'll make the rough
cut due Tuesday.

02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:48.110
If you finish stuff
before Tuesday

02:09:48.110 --> 02:09:52.160
and want me to look over
it, I'm happy to do so.

02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:53.860
Because I know
that the turnaround

02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:56.720
is insanely quick for this.

02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:58.820
And I know that we're
cramming a ton of stuff

02:09:58.820 --> 02:10:00.916
into these three weeks.

02:10:00.916 --> 02:10:05.796
AUDIENCE: Do we need to meet
up with our groups to film

02:10:05.796 --> 02:10:08.240
over the weekend, then?

02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:10.940
PROFESSOR: No, and
tomorrow we were

02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:14.610
going to hand out assignments
for who your groups would be.

02:10:14.610 --> 02:10:16.170
If you can shoot
stuff on your own,

02:10:16.170 --> 02:10:18.380
like b-roll, feel
free to do that.

02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:21.000
Like you don't have to just
use class time to work.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.120
If it's more convenient
for you to just catch

02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:26.920
some stuff on your own, do
a tripod selfie type shot,

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.090
go ahead and do that.

02:10:30.810 --> 02:10:33.750
But no, you don't have to
just only work in class.

02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:39.770
Everyone has their own camera
and their own equipment, right?

02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:42.180
OK, yeah.

02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:46.400
So tomorrow we'll do editing,
finish the table reads.

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:48.560
You'll have the rest
of the week to work.

02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:53.830
We will screen rough cuts
on Tuesday the 20th, then.

02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:57.050
But that means that you won't
get feedback from your peers

02:10:57.050 --> 02:10:58.450
until Tuesday the 20th.

02:11:01.650 --> 02:11:02.860
That OK?

02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:04.520
So basically your
rough cuts are going

02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:06.930
to be so good that
you're not going

02:11:06.930 --> 02:11:10.110
to have to reshoot anything.

02:11:10.110 --> 02:11:11.392
No, I'm just kidding.

02:11:11.392 --> 02:11:11.975
It'll be fine.

02:11:15.370 --> 02:11:17.310
AUDIENCE: How good
does our video need

02:11:17.310 --> 02:11:21.190
to be in terms of the visuals.

02:11:21.190 --> 02:11:24.880
PROFESSOR: I mean I totally
understand that you have a week

02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:26.380
to do this, basically.

02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:31.630
So if you can't, you know,
do a full-fledged animation,

02:11:31.630 --> 02:11:33.780
you can't fully
realize those things,

02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.135
I completely understand that.

02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:42.400
This is going to sound stupid,
but just try your best.

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:44.890
Because that's why
I have-- creating

02:11:44.890 --> 02:11:47.130
the rubric for this class
was really hard, actually,

02:11:47.130 --> 02:11:49.860
because I knew that all
these constraints were here.

02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:54.000
And so I couldn't raw scale
points, like 10 points

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.070
it's lit correctly, because
that's just unreasonable.

02:11:58.070 --> 02:12:00.490
But what I really
want is the intent

02:12:00.490 --> 02:12:04.600
to be there, the thoughtfulness,
the understanding and self

02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:06.480
awareness of maybe
what's lacking,

02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:08.740
what you'd like to
develop further.

02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:12.860
If you can't-- if a film
location falls through

02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:16.120
at the last minute and you
can't film there, stuff happens.

02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:17.900
I totally understand.

02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:21.570
If you can just maybe write
what you wanted to do instead,

02:12:21.570 --> 02:12:23.300
that's totally fine.

02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.388
But--

02:12:25.388 --> 02:12:27.320
AUDIENCE: Same thing
with animations.

02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:31.200
I'm sure some of you have very--
especially with the fractals.

02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.180
Zooming in on fractals,
that's a difficult animation

02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:37.430
to accomplish, especially if you
haven't done animation before.

02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:40.480
Think of using still images,
because it's really easy

02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:42.610
to overlay a still
image, or even something

02:12:42.610 --> 02:12:44.280
you draw yourself.

02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:47.461
And it would just kind of like--
what Science Out Loud videos

02:12:47.461 --> 02:12:47.960
do.

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:50.430
As opposed to making
this really complex,

02:12:50.430 --> 02:12:51.720
like multiple moving pieces.

02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:54.070
The more moving pieces
you have, the harder

02:12:54.070 --> 02:12:58.920
it's going to be to do faster.

02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:02.120
PROFESSOR: We will be around
during class every day.

02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:05.110
So if people want
specific help, like

02:13:05.110 --> 02:13:07.934
Sari's done some
animations herself, too.

02:13:07.934 --> 02:13:09.350
So we can help you
with that stuff

02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:10.920
if you have specific questions.

02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:12.592
But shoot for the best you can.

02:13:12.592 --> 02:13:15.050
Definitely don't be like, well,
I'm going to leave this out

02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:17.216
because I'm just going to
justify to Elizabeth later

02:13:17.216 --> 02:13:19.490
that I couldn't get it.

02:13:19.490 --> 02:13:21.037
Try to do the best you can.

02:13:21.037 --> 02:13:22.870
But I understand the
constraints that you're

02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:25.710
working under for sure.

02:13:25.710 --> 02:13:27.930
So don't stress out about that.

02:13:27.930 --> 02:13:30.900
AUDIENCE: And feel free to email
us, because some things like

02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:33.060
after Elizabeth's
editing lecture,

02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:35.900
there might be something like,
you're in the editing program,

02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:37.730
and it might take
you three or four

02:13:37.730 --> 02:13:39.580
hours to figure out
where this tool is

02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:40.788
and how to do this one thing.

02:13:40.788 --> 02:13:42.750
Like my audio disappeared, what?

02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:44.390
But if you bring
it to one of us,

02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:46.640
chances are we've
encountered it before it

02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:49.642
and can fix it in a
couple minutes, hopefully.

02:13:49.642 --> 02:13:51.600
PROFESSOR: Sari's probably
a lot better at that

02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:52.808
than I am, just to be honest.

02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:58.840
Does that sound OK to everyone?

02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:01.350
I do apologize for
the quick turnaround.

02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:03.990
I know it's a lot to
cram into three weeks.

02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:10.046
So I understand the limitations
that we're working with.

02:14:10.046 --> 02:14:11.920
All right, well I'll
stick around after class

02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:13.960
if people want to talk
about their scripts

02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:15.840
more, or have other questions.

02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:17.040
But you guys are free to go.

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:18.890
I'll see you tomorrow.
