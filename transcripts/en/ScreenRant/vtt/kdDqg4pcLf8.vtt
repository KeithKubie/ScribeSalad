00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.160
Casting is arguably the most important aspect
of a film.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.190
It’s extremely pertinent to find the right
actors for each role, and in the age of social

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.930
media, everyone thinks they have what it takes
to be a casting director.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.310
When the actual filmmakers go the other way
and pick a choice out of left field, they

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.599
can draw the ire of fans before even a frame
of footage is shown.

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.850
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Most Controversial
Casting Decisions in Popular Movies.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.850
The Dark Knight

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.990
Batman fans could not believe that Heath Ledger
was cast as the Joker, who was known primarily

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.040
for roles in 10 Things I Hate About You and
Brokeback Mountain.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.460
Nobody could see how he could play one of
the most intimidating villains in comics,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.170
but Christopher Nolan knew best.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.550
Ledger’s performance was a genre-defining
moment, raising the bar for film antagonists

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.809
and earning the actor a posthumous Oscar.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.620
Many fans now retroactively will say they
were always for the casting, but a look back

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.659
at the Internet archives say otherwise.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.629
The odds were against Ledger, but he proved
all the doubters wrong.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.629
Fantastic Four

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.679
Josh Trank’s reboot was doomed from the
start, as fans expressed supreme displeasure

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.629
with the director’s casting choices.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.549
Some fans could not stand the idea of Michael
B. Jordan playing Johnny Storm, a traditionally

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:08.710
Caucasian character.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.100
The controversy seemed silly and had some
ugly undertones, since race is not an important

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.780
element of getting the Human Torch right.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.119
Once the film was released, any furor over
Jordan’s casting became an afterthought,

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.189
with many happy that the talented actor would
not have to appear in any sequels to the bomb.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.690
Luckily, Jordan won fans over in Creed and
seems to have a franchise there.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.690
Batman

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.820
Even before the days of the Internet, comic
book fans found ways to protest castings for

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.820
adaptations.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.109
Many bemoaned the idea of Michael Keaton as
Batman, especially since he was known mostly

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.619
as a comedic actor and did not have the appearance
of a superhero.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.250
But Keaton established himself as Bruce Wayne
for an entire generation of moviegoers, wowing

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.549
them with his portrayal of Gotham’s Dark
Knight.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.649
The actor has said he’s proud of the work
he and director Tim Burton did, and it’s

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:54.649
easy to see why.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.479
For some, there will be no topping Keaton,
which is a statement few would have believed

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.180
before 1989.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.280
Casino Royale

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.690
When fans think of the cinematic James Bond,
a suave, dark-haired gentleman comes to mind.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.350
So when the producers went with the blue-eyed
blonde Daniel Craig for reboot Casino Royale,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.180
there was enormous outrage.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.160
The website craigisnotbond.com was started
and some petitioned for Pierce Brosnan to

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160
return.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.950
Craig took it all in stride and redefined
the character, giving the franchise the shot

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.110
in the arm it needed.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.370
After four films as 007, Craig is seen as
one of the better incarnations and all the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.340
controversy surrounding his casting makes
little sense in retrospect.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.040
It’ll be hard to replace him when he steps
down.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.040
Aloha

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.750
A rom-com pairing Bradley Cooper with Emma
Stone seems like a charming winner, but Cameron

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.330
Crowe learned the hard way that wasn’t the
case.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.900
There was much uproar over the director’s
decision to cast Stone as Allison Ng, a character

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.510
who is of Hawaiian and Chinese descent.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.230
Though the defense was that Ng wasn’t supposed
to overtly resemble a person of her background,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.680
many took issue with Stone’s involvement
and saw it as the latest example of Hollywood

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.680
whitewashing.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.970
The film could not bounce back from the negative
publicity and succumbed to poor reviews, killing

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.660
its chances of being a box office hit.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.660
The Hunger Games

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.280
Having Jennifer Lawrence star in your movie
seems like a no-brainer, but some Hunger Games

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.459
fans did not approve of the actress playing
Katniss Everdeen when she was first announced.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.080
For starters, a primary complaint was that
Lawrence did not look like someone from an

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.200
impoverished place such as District 12.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.720
In addition, the novel describes Katniss as
an olive-skinned, dark-haired tomboy – an

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.620
appearance Lawrence did not have.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.650
But she changed her hair color for the role
and was a big reason why the films were massively

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.650
successful.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.280
She won people over and became an action heroine
to look up to.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.409
Spider-Man 3

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.840
Spider-Man fans couldn’t wait to see villain
Venom on the big screen in Spider-Man 3, but

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.329
the enthusiasm died quickly when they found
out who Sam Raimi cast.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.360
Topher Grace of That ‘70s Show was hardly
the living embodiment of one of Spidey’s

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360
greatest foes.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.170
Grace did not have the physical frame of Eddie
Brock, a character known for being extremely

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.299
large and muscular.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.230
Grace didn’t seem threatening, even when
he was wearing the suit, making the character’s

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.290
cinematic debut a major fail.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.849
Fingers crossed that Marvel Studios gives
Venom another shot in the new reboot and do

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.110
the fan-favorite justice.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.250
Interview With A Vampire

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.730
No actor was a better box office bet than
Tom Cruise in the 1990s, a main reason why

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.480
he was cast as Lestat in Interview With A
Vampire.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.160
But the move upset many, including author
Anne Rice, who penned the source material.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.340
There were questions concerning the short
actor’s ability to portray a character known

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.739
for being an imposing figure.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.070
Cruise ended up turning in a great performance,
breaking type and playing a compelling villain.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.700
Even Rice was swayed by the star’s commitment
to the role, learning that sometimes you should

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.760
wait to see the final product.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.760
The Lone Ranger

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.850
Johnny Depp has become a global superstar
playing oddball characters like Jack Sparrow

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.350
and the Mad Hatter, but not every such role
is a proper fit for the actor.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.500
In Disney’s reboot of The Lone Ranger, Depp
was cast as the Indian Tonto, which angered

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.500
many.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.200
Depp is not a Native American actor, though
he says he is partially of Native descent.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.850
In addition, the film’s depiction of Tonto
was criticized for relying heavily on stereotypes

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.100
instead of doing something interesting with
the Lone Ranger’s famous companion.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.970
Few were impressed by what they saw, and any
franchise hopes were quickly dashed.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.970
Star Trek

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.230
Replacing the incomparable William Shatner
as Captain James T. Kirk is a daunting task,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.550
and when J.J. Abrams cast Chris Pine for the
role in his Star Trek reboot, few were happy

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.550
with the decision.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.720
At the time, Pine had only appeared in a couple
of mediocre rom-coms and had not proven himself

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.290
as an action lead just yet.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.260
Some fans wanted Paramount to go with Matt
Damon, but Pine quickly silenced the critics.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.820
His charisma and charm perfectly capture the
spirit of Captain Kirk, and he helped reinvigorate

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.340
the classic sci-fi property.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.750
Pine’s now on-board for at least a couple
more movies, cementing his place in Trek lore.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.970
Those are our picks for the most controversial
casting decisions in films.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.290
Are there any we missed?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.630
