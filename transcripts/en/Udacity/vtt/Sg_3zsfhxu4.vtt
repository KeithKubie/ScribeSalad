00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.620
We define stress as the response to a

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.455
situation that a person perceives to be
overwhelming

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:11.660
in that the person does not think he or
she can meet the demands of the situation.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.684
The interesting thing to note here, this
is the perceived

00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:19.500
inability to meet the demand of the
situation facing them.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.320
For example, perhaps you have a ten page
paper due in two days.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.758
In addition, you have to work nights, and
you have a test the same

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.450
day the paper is due.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.226
For some people, they may perceive this to
be

00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:31.002
way too much for them to handle, and feel
that

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.970
they're unable to meet the demands of
getting the

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.670
paper done, studying for the test, and
going to work.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.400
Thus, the person in this situation is
experiencing stress.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.414
This is true for having projects due at
work or

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:47.481
also having to take care of household or
family responsibilities.
