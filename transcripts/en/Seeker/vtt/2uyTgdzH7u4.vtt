00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.040
In the shadow of the atomic bomb, science
and politics became entwined.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.560
And as World War II progressed, countries
began to capitalize on the power of technology.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480
This shift in wartime strategy gave way to
rapid advancements in weaponry like the development

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.120
of the world's first long-range, self guided
ballistic missile.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.120
And unlike those before it, this rocket had the
potential to go to space

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.340
and its creation would ultimately lead to a man on the moon.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.480
In the final years of the war, Nazi scientists
successfully tested the V-2 rocket, the world's

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.819
most sophisticated missile and the first man-made
object to cross the Karman line which is commonly

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.640
represented as the start of space.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.760
When the war ended in 1945, the new world powers were dead set on acquiring the Nazi's V-2 technology.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.879
This man, Wernher von Braun, was known as
the brains behind the rocket.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.610
He, along with other Nazi scientists, surrendered
to the Americans and were transported to the

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.460
US under a top secret project known as "Operation
Paperclip".

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.080
The Germans were put to work, helping American
scientists design and build military missiles

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.200
that would ultimately be used in the beginnings
of the space program.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.140
Meanwhile, Soviet scientists were repurposing
the remains of Nazi rockets, and they were

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.900
working much faster than the Americans.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.480
By the mid 1950s, the USSR developed an intercontinental ballistic missile equipped with a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:47.020
multi-stage design and multi-engine propulsion system
making it capable of reaching orbit.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.820
[Newscast] "Today a new moon is in the sky. A 23 inch metal sphere placed in orbit by a Russian rocket."

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.360
On October 4th, 1957, the Soviet Union used
its new missile to launch

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.920
the first artificial satellite into space.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.400
[Newscast] "You are hearing the actual signals transmitted by the Earth circling satellite."

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.720
The satellite known as Sputnik sent a wave
of paranoia over the United States.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.000
Its Cold War enemy now had a vantage point
from space,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.860
increasing the fear of a nuclear attack.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.620
[Newscast] "Always remember the flash of an atomic bomb can come at any time,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.360
no matter where you may be."

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.520
The Space Race had officially begun.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.989
The US quickly tried to match the Soviet's
success by launching the Vanguard satellite.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.719
But the rocket only made it about a meter
off the ground before its embarrassing explosion,

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.989
earning the nickname, "flopnik".

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.680
Now in full Sputnik crisis mode, the government
shifted its priority to the space race.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.800
President Dwight D. Eisenhower accelerated
the 1958 launch of Explorer 1 - the first

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.380
US satellite to reach space and established
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.239
Within eleven days, NASA launched its first
spacecraft and within six months it announced

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.220
the United States' first man-in-space program.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.280
Project Mercury had three objectives: orbit
a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.420
man's ability to function in space and recover
both man and spacecraft safely.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.599
In the late 1950s, these were seemingly improbable
tasks considering this was all happening around

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.049
the same time the first computer hard disk
was used, the electric printer was invented

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.920
and this... was considered a revolutionary
toy.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.769
Needless to say, technology had a long way
to go.

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.480
On top of that, NASA's first astronauts had
never actually been to space.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.760
They did, however, meet all the other necessary
qualifications for a job

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.680
that hadn't been done before.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.140
The candidates were all military pilots, were highly educated and physically fit

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.500
and they were the right height and weight to squeeze into the one-man Mercury spacecraft.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.140
The seven astronauts chosen for Project Mercury
were painted as American heroes.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.389
And for a country inundated with a fear of nuclear attack, they provided much needed

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.389
hope and distraction.

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:08.080
After a series of errors, tests and a brave
chimp named HAM, in May 1961

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.159
astronaut Alan Shepard became the second human in space.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.240
The US came up short... again.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.720
Less than one month earlier, Russian Astronaut
Yuri Gagarin became the first man to complete

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.370
an orbital mission.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.660
But the trajectory of the Space Race was about
to change.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.420
[JFK] "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.220
before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth."

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.360
Under pressure to catch up to the Soviet Union
at the height of the Cold War, President John

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.200
F. Kennedy set an ambitious deadline.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.520
And from that moment forward, NASA's human
spaceflight efforts were guided by a single goal.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.760
[Astronauts] "See you on the other side."

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.020
NASA's second man in space program acted as a bridge to the moon.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.000
Project Gemini had four main objectives: test
an astronaut's ability to fly long-duration

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.410
missions; understand how spacecrafts could
rendezvous and dock in orbit; perfect re-entry

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.380
and landing methods; and further understand
the effects of longer space flight on astronauts.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:22.560
[Mission control] "We have ignition sequence start."

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.560
All the while, Project Mercury was achieving
major milestones.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.180
And on February 20, 1962, astronaut John Glenn
became the first American to orbit Earth.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.680
[Glenn] "Roger, zero G and I feel fine.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.500
Capsule is turning around. Oh, that view is tremendous."

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.980
By 1965, the first crewed Gemini mission took
flight.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.360
The missions to follow set a series of firsts
not just for the United States but for the world.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.700
[Mission control] "Roger, congratulations, excellent."

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.620
A new race was on for the United States.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.550
But now it was a race against time.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.670
In under five years, NASA needed to land a
man on the moon.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.790
The Apollo Program would become one of the
country's biggest challenges, costing billions

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.760
of dollars and risking dozens of lives.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.840
[Astronaut] "Hey! We've got a fire in the cockpit."

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.780
But if the decades of war and innovation leading
up to this moment proved anything, it was

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.340
that some of the biggest breakthroughs unfold
when pressure is at its highest.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.840
And, just like challenges before it, Apollo
would redefine the boundaries of possibility,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.040
taking humanity on a ride 
to an entirely new world.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.400
Seeker is going back in time to look at the missions that led us to the moon.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.240
