00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:42.870
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.670
Hi, everyone.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.762
Thanks for joining today.

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.910
Today, I'm really excited,
because we're announcing,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.660
actually we just already
announced this morning, a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.990
brand new part of the Google
Drive SDK called the Google

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.060
Drive Realtime API.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.720
This is, I think, one of the
coolest APIs that we've done

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.240
in a while.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.270
Definitely very forward
looking.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.870
And for today's GDL, I want to
give you just a quick overview

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.590
of what the Realtime API is,
why it's important, to show

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.770
you a couple of the tools and
the samples that we've built.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.140
But over the next few weeks,
we'll go into a lot more

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.960
detail on a lot of
these topics.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.260
Next Friday, we'll show you how
to get started with the

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.170
API with our quick start.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.960
Next week, we'll have one of
the engineers who actually

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.480
worked on the API join us for
some Q&amp;A. And, of course, as

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.810
we hear more from the community,
we'll be back with

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.930
additional topics.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.870
But today, we're going to focus
on an overview and some

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.110
quick demos.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.160
But first, the Realtime
API is pretty simple.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.300
It's a JavaScript API that
allows you to access a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.270
persistent model that can be
manipulated by multiple users

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.535
in real time to give you the
same level of interactivity

00:01:55.535 --> 00:01:59.100
and collaborations that you see
in our own applications

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.440
that are built around
Google Drive.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.890
So Google Docs, spreadsheets,
presentations, are all well

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.790
known for the collaborative
features that are built into

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.570
the editors.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.840
With this API, you can now build
other applications that

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.050
users need for productivity that
have that same level of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.930
interactivity.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.730
This really dovetails nicely
with some of the features that

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.810
we've been releasing over
the past few months.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.490
Back in the fall, we added
commenting, of course sharing

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.600
has always been a
part of the API.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.650
But when you throw all those
together, between sharing,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.740
commenting, and real-time
collaboration, it's now very

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.180
possible and very easy to build
applications like Google

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.620
Docs at the same level of rich
interactivity, but can cover a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.650
whole bunch of different
demands.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.100
And we'll talk about some
of the use cases a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.640
little bit later on.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.530
First thing I just want to
show you is, if you are

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.680
interested in getting started
with the API, you can find the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.750
documentation at
developers.googl

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.250
e.com/drive/realtime.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.800
And there's a few different
things on here to

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.750
help you get started.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.480
There's some quick start code.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.570
This is a really simple
JavaScript application.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.690
Some helper classes to make it
really easy to get started.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.210
Of course the Developer's Guide
will introduce you to

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.135
all the different concepts
for working with it.

00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:16.170
It's actually very simple if
you're familiar with standard

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.670
data structures like maps and
lists and adjacent objects

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.240
and, of course, you know
strings, you can build an app

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.770
using this API.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.340
If you want to dive a little
bit more into it without

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.490
writing code, but get a feel for
how it works, what some of

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.320
the features are, what exactly
it means to have these type of

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.400
real-time features, we have the
Realtime API playground.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.756
I'll show you that app
and walk through

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:43.670
it in just a moment.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.520
And then, of course, you can
go and read more about it,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.330
understand the event models,
and look at the source.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.420
Lots of cool stuff.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.130
So the first thing I want to
show you, actually, is a

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.340
really cool tool called the
Realtime API Playground.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.100
This was developed by one
of the colleagues on

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.950
the DevRel team here.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.290
It's a really cool app, and it
walks you through the process

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.040
of working with Realtime
Documents.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.209
First thing you need to
understand is these are models

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.630
of documents that are stored
in Google Drive.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.330
So you could think, just like
we have documents in

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.160
presentations and slides, we
can have other things.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.430
So it could be images, they
can be project management

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.250
applications, they could be the
drawings, charts, videos

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.480
that we're editing, lots of
different things that people

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.510
want to work on together.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.600
But these models, and all these
Realtime features are

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.650
geared around files in Drive.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.410
First thing we need to do with
an app is authorize.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.640
I've already done that, but this
is standard OAuth 2.0.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.610
We've seen it all before.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.740
It's in all our quick starts
and sample applications.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.120
Next thing is we create
a document.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.840
I've already done this, and we
can actually go back over to

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.740
Drive, and we can see a file
that I created earlier.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.950
This is just the standard name
that the playground gives you.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.190
Of course you could rename this,
share it, invite other

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.800
people to collaborate with us.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.980
For right now, I'm
just going to

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.840
collaborate just with myself.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.470
I have two different browsers
open, and we'll

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.840
see how that works.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.120
Of course, if we have a file
that somebody shared with us,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.910
we can open it.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.710
This is just using our standard

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.443
JavaScript Picker API.

00:05:31.443 --> 00:05:35.810
Of course, you can see the same
file is here, as well.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.970
And if you want to share it,
you can do that, as well.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.480
Again, this is the sharing
widget that has been part of

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.670
the Drive SDK for a while now.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.730
So we have a file.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.205
We've created it,
we've shared it.

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:50.460
In this case, I just have two
windows side by side here.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.290
I'll switch back and forth just
to show you a little bit

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.360
of what's going on.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.660
But the first thing is, let's
talk about some of the objects

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.560
that we can have in
the Realtime API.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.650
Kind of the obvious
one is strings.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.370
We have here a string
that we can do, and

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.670
this is really fun.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.250
You can see, as I type,
we see all these

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.900
different events here.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.700
And this actually character
by character.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.200
Some of them are little bit
aggregated, depending on how

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.690
fast I type, but we see what
is actually being sent.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.800
So these events, the way it
works, this is based on

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.980
operational transform.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.780
So as we type and make changes
to the model or strings or

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.680
objects within it, the
API is figuring out

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.200
what exactly changed.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.030
So if it's a string, if it's a
character insertion, it will

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.630
generate insert x, y,
z at this position.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.670
Likewise, if we delete and then
re-insert, we'll see a

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.640
delete event followed
by the inserts.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.930
So all these deltas are being
applied locally and then sent

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.940
back to be applied to the
persistent model.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.480
If somebody else is
making changes,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.820
those changes are resolved.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.660
They're reordered so everything
makes sense, and

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.230
then rebroadcast out.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.970
You can see over here, in this
other window, that string has

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.080
been updated.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.960
And if you actually watch, we
have both of these visible

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.100
here, so as I type, you
can see there's a

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.840
little bit of lag.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.600
It's probably a few hundred
milliseconds.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.670
But as I type, you can see in
the background window, that

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.920
text is being updated.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.250
Strings are the first one.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.880
Strings are particularly
interesting because there are

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.980
some additional behaviors
that are pretty

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.230
important for usability.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.670
Particularly the issue
of cursor management.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.360
So I'm not entirely sure if this
has been implemented in

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.670
here, but--

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.430
it's a little hard to show with
just one browser, but I

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:58.340
have my cursor here right before
the N. And if I go and

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.335
delete, let's say,
delete really.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.340
OK, so this is actually a case
of why, so it's actually good

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.360
that I showed this.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.910
So you notice that
my cursor moved.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.420
It didn't actually
change position.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.360
Actually, where the position
is is the offset, but not

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.280
logically in the string
where I'm at.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.630
Really I wanted my cursor
to stay at neat.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.240
Part of the API is a set of
utilities to help manage

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.930
cursor position as these
events happen.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.690
So you can implement
this yourself.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.809
You can sit there and listen for
string events, and detect

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.820
when a character is added or
a character is deleted, and

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.240
figure out where your
cursor should be.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.360
But part of the API is
a set of binders.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.309
These are really
simple things.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.680
You can just say, connect this
string to this text field, and

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.570
we'll actually do some
of that for you.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.790
It' s something I've actually
implemented in the Realtime

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.090
Playground.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.470
It's something that we'll
add so you can see

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.210
just how that works.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.130
But beyond strings, of course,
we have collections.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.200
Obvious one are lists.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.080
You can see here.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.500
Scroll down.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.360
Keep that visible in
the background.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.790
And let's add lemurs,
I like lemurs.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.360
You can see that was
added to the list.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.620
I also like sloths.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.190
I think they're ridiculously
cute.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.050
You can see these added.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:21.580
Likewise, you can come back
up here and remove sheep.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.850
Again, you could see that's
been removed.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.400
You can see the event up here.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.450
So we had events that we added,

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.140
things that were removed.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.220
You could do the same thing
for Maps, as well.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.290
And we can see down here.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.600
And the last thing, which is
actually kind of cool is, if

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.870
you don't like working with
generic collections, you can

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.990
define your own objects.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.780
So here we have, you can even
see the source code.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:58.960
So our key value pairs, if you
jump directly to the source,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.740
actually even better than
the source, let's

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.210
just show the Docs.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:07.930
Let's go to Developers' Guide,
and Building a Data Model.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.500
So you can have code in your
application that basically

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.650
looks like this.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.220
You can define objects, you
can tell us about the

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.810
different properties on your
object that are persistent and

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.500
should be collaborative.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.840
And then once you have those,
you just access these just

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.600
like a regular JavaScript
object.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.460
Turns out to be really,
really simple.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.370
Sorry for zooming in a
little too far there.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.180
But you can actually see
here how this is done.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.570
We create a constructor, just
like we would normally.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:44.550
We do need to register this
type so that you know how

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.680
these things should be stored.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.370
The API is designed so you can
evolve your models over time.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.360
So there are symbolic names
for all your types and for

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.880
your properties.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.390
Clearing our fields, create, add
some listeners if we want

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.210
to track changes, and,
of course, just

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.050
deal with our property.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.160
Really simple.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.880
The nice thing with the Realtime
Playground is, well

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.840
besides just giving you a good
idea of how things work and

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.550
letting you see the events, you
can actually open up the

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.190
Chrome dev tools, you can watch
the wire traffic, just

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.180
to get a sense of what the
payloads look like as they're

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.970
being sent across the wire.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.380
But the cool thing is, for each
of these, you can go back

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.740
to the reference docs.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.990
For this feature, talk about
strings, talk about lists.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.950
And the source code
is available for

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.960
this, as well on GitHub.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.220
Go to GitHub.com/googledrive
and see the Realtime

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.710
Playground source.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.230
There's also another example
out, which I

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.850
think is really cool.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.670
It is a Realtime collaborative
3-D cube.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.630
Again, I'm not really
collaborating with anyone in

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.180
particular right now.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.650
Let me make it visible.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.880
So now, what we do is we can
start to mess up our cube, and

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.190
you can see, as I turn this in
one, you can see the changes

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.450
reflected here.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.420
And likewise, if I go over here,
everything is mirrored

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.480
in the other one.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.160
And, of course, you can
have this with as many

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.880
collaborators, as well.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.900
If you have four or
five people in

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.050
there, that's just fine.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.660
And you can see this in the
app here, this list of

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:25.870
collaborators, and the same
thing here in the Realtime API

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.030
Playground.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.570
So this is actually something
that is built into the API,

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.040
the notion of collaborators.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.970
We can actually see
what happens if I

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:41.870
exit out of this document.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.830
We're going to see I dropped
off from this window.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.610
And we actually see an event,
user closed the document.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:53.870
I can now go back and rejoin,
and pretty soon we're going to

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.570
see user opened.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.010
So it's a great way, if you want
to have presence built

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.510
into your application, you just

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.880
subscribe for those events.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.820
We'll tell you any
time that another

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.990
user joins that session.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.790
Or if they leave, and you can,
of course, render this.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.190
And even things like the profile
photos of the users

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.140
are available as part of the
API, along with the name of

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.630
the person that you're
collaborating with.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.550
So you can build some really
cool, very, very interactive

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.180
collaborative applications
with this.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.810
And we worked with a couple of
external developers to build

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.980
some proof of concepts
of this.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.420
If you've seen today's my blog
post, there are three apps

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.490
that are mentioned, which we're
talking about briefly.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.450
The first is Gantter.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.510
Gantter is a project management
application.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.580
It lets you build Gantt
charts, set up

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.370
your project plans.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.520
They've updated their
application so that it has the

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.700
same sort of real-time
collaboration features that

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.920
you've seen here.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.120
So, yeah, if you change the due
date of a project, anyone

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.160
who's in there and updating
their tasks will see

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.990
everyone's changes pretty
much immediately.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.070
Again, the latency with this
is actually really,

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.150
surprisingly good.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.350
Only a few hundred
milliseconds.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.500
Basically the same that you
would see within Google Docs

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.710
or Slides or Sheets.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.280
So, Gantter.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.060
A very cool app.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.060
Definitely encourage people
to check it out.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.390
The other is draw.io.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:24.050
This is a technology demo from
the people who do Jgraph.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.110
They do a graphing library.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.440
But they have this really cool
charting application.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.570
It lets you build everything
from flow charts, electrical

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.000
diagrams, to mock-ups.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.390
A very, very large template
library of shapes.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.780
And, again, they've been enabled
real-time features so

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.210
now you can store those drawings
in Drive in a way

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:44.370
that is persistent.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.120
So that when people are in the
diagram drawing, if I move a

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.220
shape or I add a shape, you'll
actually see that.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.810
Other collaborators will
see those happen.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.560
They actually do some really
interesting things around

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.220
visual clues to let you know
when a collaborator did

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.270
something, and certain things
like flashing a border around

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.420
a shape that was moved by a
collaborator, and they match

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.120
the colors with the
collaborators.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.170
Up here we can see
them both green.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.010
Really cool thing.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.810
Really good use of visual
clues there.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.780
Gantter also does some really
interesting things.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.800
Going back a brief moment for
Gantter, they do some

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.760
interesting things with bolding,
integrated chat into

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.750
their application using the
Realtime API, in addition to

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.520
having the model.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.120
And then the last one I want to
mention is Neutron Drive.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.010
This is an online IDE that is
backed by Google Drive.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.120
So you can use it for
editing text files.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.650
You can also use it for
editing source.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.880
And they're doing some cool
things in that they're

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.690
actually letting you
work in multiple

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.570
documents at the same time.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.190
It's a really cool app.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.790
It kind of fills a void in
Google Drive in terms of just

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.765
working with source code or
working with plain text files.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.690
And one thing really important
about Neutron Drive is they

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.720
actually do some really cool
stuff with syncing the

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.810
Realtime model.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.960
So the representation of the
file in a way that we can do

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.010
these operational transforms
on, and then syncing those

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.400
changes back to the underlying
text file, so that if you have

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.300
the sync client installed and
you're having those files

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.900
copied down to your desktop,
maybe you're using an IDE for

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.590
when you're offline, all that
works pretty seamlessly.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.960
There are a number of issues
that come up when you try to

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.470
do these types of things.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.060
But there's actually some really
good resources in the

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:47.330
SDK documentation that talks
about this, particularly using

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.420
collaborative models
with files.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.880
Talks about some of the issues
that happens when you want to

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.680
work with some sort of external,
serialized format,

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.510
say an image, or a text
file, Visio diagrams,

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.910
whatever that may be.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.230
Trying to enable collaborative
features on these is a little

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.420
bit more complicated than
if you were a purely

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.450
collaborative app, something
like Google Docs, for example,

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.030
but it is possible.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.310
Just read through
these guides.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.690
We'll actually probably have
another GDL to go into this

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.839
topic in particular.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:22.970
There's a lot of things to talk
about here, but I don't

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.619
want to go into too
much detail today.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.920
But really just, for now, just
want to give you a taste of

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:33.200
what the API is about, to show
off some of the demos, and

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.450
that's about it.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.130
Really, for the past couple
months I've been playing

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.120
around, doing a couple
sample apps that I'll

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.830
be adding to GitHub.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.560
It is an incredibly fun
API to play with.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.360
It is highly satisfying,
primarily because you don't

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.370
have to worry about
all that much.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.450
So a lot of the applications
have been building, have been

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:02.170
pure JavaScript applications,
not even using a server.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:07.460
I mean, technically, you could
serve your application out of

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.090
Google Drive using the
ability to serve

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.790
directories as resources.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.480
It doesn't require a server.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.870
Authentication is, use
your Google account.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.980
You can take advantage
of things like

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.520
the new Google+ Sign-In.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.080
The files themselves, the data,
is persisted in Drive.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.710
So I create a file in Drive, I
attach a Realtime model to it,

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.860
and then I just work with that
as if it were just a local

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.950
data structure memory.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.810
And it's persistent.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.190
I can close the browser, come
back three days later, open

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.350
the file from Drive, and I'm
exactly where I left off.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.500
If other people were in there
making changes, I see all

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.320
those changes.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.890
Doing things like [? presence ?]
are incredibly

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.010
easy, and you saw with the
Realtime API Playground, how

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.080
you can add things like sharing
and the file picker

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.490
and everything.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.220
You can build these really
powerful apps just with

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.820
JavaScript and HTML5 and not
have to worry about scaling,

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.210
you don't have to worry
about your servers.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.840
Really, the only thing you need
to be able to do is serve

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.510
some HTML and JavaScript and
whatever assets you need for

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.370
your application.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.430
And you're good to go.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:17.500
It's really powerful.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.350
I'm incredibly excited to see
what people start to build

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.380
with this API.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.200
It does open up a whole bunch
of different use cases.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.200
Certainly with Docs, we're very
proud of the applications

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.430
that we have.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.140
We cover a lot of the core
productivity applications, but

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.230
there's a whole bunch of
applications that people need

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.980
to do their jobs on a
day-to-day basis.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.880
We're not going to build all
of them, but many of them

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.052
would benefit from having
real-time collaboration like

00:19:46.052 --> 00:19:51.110
we've seen from draw.io, and
Gantter, and Neutron Drive.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.530
These are all really useful
applications that benefit from

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.920
real-time collaboration, but I
would love to see things like

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.460
collaborative video editing,
or audio editing, different

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.790
charting applications, drawing
specialized editors for

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.820
different cases.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.300
If you like to author scripts.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.470
I know there's some great web
apps out there to help people

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.210
do that, that could be made
collaborative, as well.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.360
Really, just about anything.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.130
If you work with documents, the
Realtime API is definitely

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.380
something to check out.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.390
That is, I think, all
I want to cover

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.400
today for the overview.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.370
Again, we're going to be back
to talk about this and a

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.740
couple of topics I mentioned
earlier.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.480
On Friday, we'll be talking
about the Quick Start.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.500
I'll just give you a quick
overview of it.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.070
I'm not going to go into a lot
of detail, but really it takes

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.620
about five minutes to get this
set up and you can start to

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.630
play with it, learn how
to use the code.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.440
You can see here, it's all about
100 lines of HTML and

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.660
JavaScript.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.000
So Friday, we'll be back, we'll
go into this in a lot

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.790
more detail, show you how you
can take the Quick Start,

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.210
modify it a little bit to start
exploring some of the

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.790
other features.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:16.910
We'll be back again next Tuesday
with Brian [? Carns ?]

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:21.190
who's one of the engineers
who worked on this API.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.600
And we'll have a chat
with him, go

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.860
through some questions.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.380
So that should be really
great session.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.700
And, of course, there's a whole
bunch of other things

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.520
that we can talk about.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.750
If there's particular things
that you would like to know

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.870
about the Realtime API, join us
in our Google+ Community.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.820
Go to Google Drive Developers,
post questions there.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.480
We will respond to them in the
community, but they will also

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.530
help us determine what we're
going to talk about Brian and

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.100
in future GDLs about this.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.390
If you have ideas for what
you would like to

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.980
build, let us know.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.980
Again, I'm really excited.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.780
I think this opens up a whole
bunch of new opportunities for

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.480
developers to build really
powerful, really amazing

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.080
applications.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.140
So let us know if you have an
idea, what you're working on,

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.380
if you have any questions,
we're here to help.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.030
Other than that, I'm
very excited.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.600
I have a whole bunch of ideas
for my own, of sample apps

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.130
that I want to do.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.630
So we'll keep updating
our repositories, so

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.210
keep an eye on that.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:28.800
If you use Angular, I've been
playing a lot with that.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.910
Angular is nearly magical.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.400
It's actually a really
beautiful development

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.840
experience.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.320
So we'll see some samples
there, as well.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.860
But really, just go out
and try the API.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.540
It's really fun, really
satisfying, and, of course, we

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.020
look forward to seeing
what everyone builds.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.440
So on that note, I'm going to
end today's GDL, but again,

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.560
reach us in the community.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.770
If you have questions, comments,
ideas, we'd love to

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:54.640
hear from you.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.890
Thanks.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:24:00.310
