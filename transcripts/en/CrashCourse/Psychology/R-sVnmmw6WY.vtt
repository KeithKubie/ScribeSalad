00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.020
Why do smart people make dumb decisions?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.000
Why do conspiracy theorists think that we
didn’t land on the moon or that Hillary

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.759
Clinton is a space alien?

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.980
And why won’t Bernice admit that the new
Superman movie just isn’t very good?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.920
We’ve talked about cognition before.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.949
We usually refer to it as the process that
we use to think and solve crossword puzzles

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.949
and stuff.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.310
But really, cognition involves knowing, remembering,
understanding, communicating, and to a certain

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.310
extent, learning.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.590
And as truly wonderful as our brains are,
we can be spectacularly bad at ALL of these

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.590
things.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.180
We used to think our cognition worked like
a computer -- logically processing information.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.960
But that cabbage-sized chunk of pink, wet
brain matter in your skull can do a lot more

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.860
than math, and the things that it does are
certainly not always logical.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.530
Many experts argue that it’s cognition that
makes us truly human, and that everything

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.649
that comes with it -- our preferences, prejudices,
fears, and intuitions -- are what make us

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.350
the individuals that we are.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.960
We’re not the only animals that show some
evidence of cognition, of course: Chimps and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.860
gorillas exhibit insight and planning; crows
use tools; elephants teach each other.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.600
But our capacity as humans to figure stuff
out is matched only by our ability to totally

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.389
misjudge stuff.

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:17.200
As prone as we are to brilliance and insight,
we’re equally likely to succumb to irrational

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.779
thinking and false intuition.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:23.539
So, to borrow a riff from Rene Descartes,
you think, therefore you are.

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.299
Which means you’re brilliant a lot of the
time.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:38.299
And sometimes, you’re just going to look
stupid.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.829
[INTRO]

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.459
We all want to make sense of the world.

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.310
And one of the major ways our cognition allows
us do that is by forming concepts -- mental

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.679
groupings of similar objects, people, ideas,
or events.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.649
We like to lump things together.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.899
Concepts simplify our thinking in such a fundamental
way that we usually don’t have to stop and

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.939
think about using them, they’re just there.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.200
And yet without concepts, we’d need a unique
name for everything.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.149
You couldn’t just ask me to shake the anglerfish
-- because there’d be no concept of shake

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.709
or fish, let alone stuffed, blue anglerfish.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.459
And if I told you I was devastated that I
lost my anglerfish -- which I probably would

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.680
be -- I’d also have to explain my emotions,
their intensities, even the words themselves

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.959
that I had to use.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.280
So basically, without concepts, no one would
ever get anything done.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.879
We’d all be like a bunch of ents taking
all morning to say “Hey, what’s up?”

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.430
We often organize our concepts by forming
prototypes--mental images or pinnacle examples

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.459
of a certain thing.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.069
For example, if I say “bird”--the general
shape of a songbird probably pops into your

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.750
head before like, a penguin or chicken or
emu, because robins and cardinals more closely

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.750
resemble our bird prototype.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.730
Still, if I show you a picture of some crazy
creature you’ve never seen before, and you

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.989
note that it has feathers and a beak, you’ll
probably file it under the bird category because

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.989
it more closely resembles your concept of
bird than your concept of rodent or overcoat

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.280
or footstool.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.091
Concepts and prototypes speed up our thinking,
but they also can box in our thinking, and

00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:08.370
lead to prejudice if we see something that
doesn’t fit our prototypes.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.629
A hundred years ago the sight of a female
doctor might have caused some heads to explode,

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.540
because in peoples’ tiny minds, the prototypes
of “doctor” and “woman” didn’t have

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.749
any overlap.

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.500
And actually some people today still feel
that way.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.500
Haters gonna hate.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.361
So it’s important to actively keep your
mind open mind to make room for evolving concepts,

00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:29.550
and remember that concepts may sometimes hurt
as much as they help.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.499
One of the biggest ways our cognition works
to our benefit, though, is through our ability

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:34.650
to solve problems.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.930
We use our problem-solving skills all the
time: How to assemble Scandinavian furniture,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.230
bake muffins with a missing ingredient, or
handle the crushing disappointment of the

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.280
new Superman movie.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.880
And we approach problem-solving in different
ways -- sometimes we value speed; other times,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880
accuracy.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.159
Some problems we figure out using trial and
error--you know, you try something and if

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.459
it doesn’t work, try it a different way,
and keep at it until something works.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.950
Trial and error is slow and deliberate--which
may be good or bad, depending on the problem.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.540
We can also use algorithms and heuristics
to come up with solutions.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.689
Algorithms are logical, methodical, step-by-step
procedures that guarantee an eventual solution,

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.810
though they may be slow to work through.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.810
Heuristics, on the other hand, are more like
mental shortcuts -- simple strategies that

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.299
allow us to solve problems faster, although
they’re more error-prone than algorithms.

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.210
Say you’re at the store, looking for a family-sized
bottle of Sriracha.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.630
You could use an algorithm and methodically
check every shelf and aisle in the store.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.870
Or you could use heuristics and first search
the Asian or condiment sections--the places

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.550
that make the most sense based on what you
already know.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.080
Heuristics may be way faster, but the algorithmic
approach guarantees you won’t overlook the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.460
sauce along the way, because they stuck it
in the deli or whatever dumb thing they did

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.460
this week.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.300
So algorithms, heuristics, and trial-and-error
are problem-solving strategies that involve

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.300
a plan of attack.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.251
But sometimes we get lucky while puzzling
out a problem, and Aha!, out of nowhere a

00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.330
sudden flash of insight that solves our problem.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.830
I’ll use orange in the muffin recipe instead
of lemon!

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.720
Or, Sriracha lives in the Mexican section!

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.770
For some reason!

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.830
Neuroscientists have actually watched that
kind of sudden, happy brain flash on neuroimaging

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.830
screens.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.639
In one experiment, they gave subjects a problem
to solve:

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.360
What word can be added to the three words
CRAB, PINE, and SAUCE to create a new compound

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360
word?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.880
Then they asked the subjects to press a button
when they had the answer.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.740
While the subjects thought about it, scans
showed activity in their frontal lobes, the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.370
areas involved in the focused attention of
typical problem-solving.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.000
But right at the Aha! moment, just as they
pushed the button, there was a clear burst

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.820
of activity just above the ear in the right
temporal lobe, which, among many other things,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.979
is involved with recognition.

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.800
The answer, by the way, we already gave you
the hint earlier in the episode.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.289
Where’s my fish?

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.180
Those sudden bursts of insight are awesome,
but you can’t count on them to solve all

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.229
your problems.

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.569
And just because something feels, doesn’t
mean it’s truly correct.

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.849
Because as inventive and smartypants as we
may be, our cognition often leads us astray

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.069
in all kinds of ways.

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:06.770
For instance, we often look for, and favor,
evidence that verifies our ideas, while we’re

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.770
more likely to avoid or ignore contradictory
evidence -- a tendency known as confirmation

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.770
bias.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.800
This is really similar to the overconfidence
we’ve talked about, when you’re basically

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.420
more confident than you are correct.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.160
When this kind of cognitive bias takes hold,
you might cling to your initial conceptions

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.720
in a kind of belief perseverance, even in
the face of clear proof to the contrary.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.410
This happens all the time, and it can be maddening
for people watching it happen.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.020
People still think that the earth is flat!

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.160
It’s like...WHAT?

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160
HOW?

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.430
There’s space pictures!

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.570
I probably don’t need to tell you -- people
can really get weird and defensive when they

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.909
evade facts and choose to see only the information
that confirms their beliefs.

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.759
They may even become functionally fixed, unable
to view a problem from a new perspective.

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:58.050
Instead they just keep approaching a situation
with the same mental set, especially if it’s

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.050
worked in the past.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.480
Say you’ve got a nail sticking out from
a board, and you’re like “I need to take

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.120
care of that!”

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.939
There’s rocks, and bricks all around you.

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:10.120
But because of your functional fixedness on
the idea that only hammers work on nails,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.434
you don’t even consider hitting it with
the brick, and instead you waste a bunch of

00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:17.210
time in the garage looking for a hammer, and
you’re angry and frustrated, and there’s

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.620
still a nail sticking up from the board.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.220
So, our mental set predisposes how we think,
just as you’ll remember that our perceptual

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.650
set predisposes how we perceive.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:32.009
This is what makes heuristics -- those super-convenient
mental shortcuts that we all use -- so easily

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:33.009
fallible.

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:37.500
In the 1970s, cognitive psychologists Amos
Tversky and Daniel Kahneman researched how

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.150
we make snap judgments, and discovered one
way smart people make dumb decisions.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.069
They found that people believe an event will
be more likely to occur if they can conjure

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:51.159
up examples or memories of it, especially
if those examples are particularly vivid,

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:52.389
scary, or awesome.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.919
So, say you’re in a casino and you win two
dollars at a slot machine.

00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:00.060
Suddenly every flashing light and ringing
bell in the place goes off.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.629
But when you lose -- which is the vast majority
of the time -- it’s just...crickets.

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:07.880
With all their lights and noise-making, the
casino makes sure that wins are super vivid

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.530
and memorable, while losses just go away unacknowledged.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.580
That way, the next time you’re standing
there with 100 bucks in your pocket, you’re

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.699
more likely to overestimate your chances of
winning, because the memories of winning are

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:19.699
more striking.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:23.150
The more mentally available those memories
are, the more it seems that it’s going to

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.360
happen again.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.860
This is known as the availability heuristic.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.340
And it can warp our judgements of people,
too.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.390
If we keep remembering news footage that shows
people of a given group shooting guns, that

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.840
can shape our impression of the entire group
-- even if what we saw was only a tiny minority

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.900
within that group.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.710
Essentially, we are great at fearing the wrong
things.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.530
We worry about being killed in a plane crash
or getting bitten in half by a shark or accidentally

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.770
choking on a dumpling.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.850
Thanks to our brain’s b-roll of horrific
images, we come to fear what’s actually

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:58.610
very rare, instead of worrying about much
more common, but less memorable ends like

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.200
car accidents, cancer, and heart failure.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.170
Our thinking can also be swayed by framing,
or how an issue is presented.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.730
Imagine you’re considering climbing Everest
or getting a nose job or eating a bowl of

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.730
raw blowfish.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.630
I can frame the risks in different ways.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.850
Telling you that you’ve got a 95 percent
chance of survival sounds a lot different

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.190
than saying five out of a hundred people die
doing this activity, though the information

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.190
is the same.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:27.030
Our cognitive minds are capable of incredible
intellectual feats and tremendous failures.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.160
We can solve problems better than any organism
on the planet, but given the chance, we can

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.550
also mess up a pretty simple judgment every
day of the week.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:39.230
But if we’re mindful of our capacity for
error -- and if we honor our ingenuity and

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.150
intellect -- I think our ability to solve
any problem is nearly infinite.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.210
And that, gives me a lot of hope.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.700
Seriously though where is my fish?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:53.170
Today you learned how we use concepts, prototypes,
and our mental sets to think and communicate,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.160
and how algorithms, heuristics, and insight
help us solve problems.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.830
You also learned about how fixation, the availability
heuristic, fear, overconfidence, and belief

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.720
perseverance can get in the way of good decision-making
and thinking.
