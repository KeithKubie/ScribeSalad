00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.560
A wise philosopher once pondered, who let
the dogs out, who? who? who?

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.910
No but seriously, where did modern dogs come
from?

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.760
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.500
Dogs come in all sorts of varieties.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.770
From tiny chihuahuas to great danes, dogs
are more variable in size, shape and temperament

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.400
than any other living mammal.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.250
The American Kennel Club recognizes 167 dog
breeds, but the world governing body of dog

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.970
breeds, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale
(FCI), recognizes 340 breeds!

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.240
Dogs are members of the family Canidae, which
is a lineage of Carnivorans that include wolves,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.610
foxes, and jackals.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.660
Fossils show that Canidae split off from the
ancestors of Carnivora about 40 million years

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.660
ago.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.290
Despite the wide spectrum of body types, colors,
and behaviors, all dogs share a common ancestor.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.420
They are all direct descendents of the canis
lupus, or gray wolf.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.970
What’s unclear is exactly when these wolves
became domesticated.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.660
At some point, wolves began to linger around
humans, who eventually bred them into different

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.860
forms of dogs.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.440
One study published in the journal Current
Biology found that modern dog ancestors split

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.710
from wolf ancestors at least 27,000 years
ago.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.350
Fossils dating back as far as 36,000 years
ago hinted at the transition, with mixed features

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.070
of both wolf and dog.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.509
A May 2013 study in Nature Communications
reported that wolves and Chinese indigenous

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.329
dogs split 32,000 years ago.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.780
Researchers used demographic analysis of different
mutations in the genomes of dogs and wolves,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.299
with results indicating that dogs initially
scavenged with humans.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.250
But a recent discovery has experts rethinking
dogs ancestry altogether.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.609
According to a study in Scientific Reports,
the remains of a supposed dog from over 31,000

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.229
years ago were actually those of a wolf.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.119
Researchers used 3D imaging to compare the
fossil found at Goyet Cave in Belgium to other

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.119
dogs and wolves.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.020
The results found the features to be more
wolf than dog, which indicates that dogs did

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.299
not gradually evolve from wolves over a long
period of time.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.950
The study says the domestication of dogs took
place during the Neolithic era (10,200 B.C.-2,000

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.659
B.C.), when humans started forming settlements
and farming around 12,000 years ago.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.119
If this is true, it refutes previous research
that stated that dogs emerged in the Paleolithic

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.539
era (2.6 million years ago to 10,200 B.C.)
when people were hunter-gatherers.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.469
So when did dogs become man’s best friend?

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.799
The bones of a puppy and an elderly person
were found buried together in Israel, dating

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.429
back to 14,000 years ago.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.989
Even though dogs were domesticated so long
ago, most dog breeds were developed within

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.610
the last few centuries.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.910
And some breeds have even changed a lot just
within the past 100 years.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.220
Ancient humans started to breed dogs for desired
features, like a louder bark or a calmer demeanor,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.640
which effectively meant they were messing
with the selection of dog genes.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.560
Over time, the breeds increased due to natural
mutations and climate in addition to human

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560
preferences.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.170
To this day, dogs are still evolving as we
continue to create new dog breeds.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.900
This is evident in the trend of designer dogs
like the labradoodle and the puggle.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.330
So do you love dogs, have you always loved
dogs?

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.390
So does Andrew Fladeboe, a photographer who
tries to capture the precious moments of working

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.390
pooches.
