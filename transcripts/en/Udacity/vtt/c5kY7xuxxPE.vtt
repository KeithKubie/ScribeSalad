00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's assume I'm using Google AdWords and I'm paying $0.50 per pay-per-click.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, let's assume my campaign at $0.50 each gets me 10,000 people to come look at my website.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well, $0.50&lt;i&gt;10,000, that cost me $5,000, but the goal isn't to just have people visit,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the goal is to get them to the end of the funnel and at the end of the funnel,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I want them to actually have paid for and/or used the product, so the goal is to activate them..

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, what's interesting is assume I'm offering a trial

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and assume that maybe just 5% of the people who I've acquired actually now take the trial.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And so I now have 500 people using my freemium product

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but the goal is not to just have them use the freemium product--.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the goal is to actually have them pay for it and what's interesting is,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
assume 10% of those now actually paid.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'd start with 10,000 people who came to my site and I spent $5000 for them,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
500 people took a trial of the product and 50--only 50 actually paid for the full version of the product.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So while 10,000 people upgrade for 5 grand because it only cost me $0.50 per person.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If we now do the math, we can now see it cost me $100 to acquire one paying customer.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That $100 equals my customer acquisition cost.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I used this example for a web/mobile channel but it's similar for physical channel.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You might not be doing pay per click, you might be doing direct math,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
or you might be doing television or radio math, but the math works the same.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
How much did it cost to acquire a customer? How much did the campaign cost?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
How much did it cost to get them to consider your product?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
How much did it cost them to take a test drive of your car or fly your airline?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And what in the end was your customer acquisition cost?

00:02:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's a key number for any founder thinking about a startup.
