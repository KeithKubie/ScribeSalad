a vulnerable species you look at how
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.700
a vulnerable species you look at how
we're built our skin is so thin if we

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
we're built our skin is so thin if we

other through through the dangers of
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940
other through through the dangers of
life and so forth if our ancestors

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
life and so forth if our ancestors
