00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.510
Hey, what's up guys welcome back for another desktop project. In today's video

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.790
We're gonna be making something called a mini longbow.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.080
These little spear slinging devices can be made with materials you may already have around the house.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080
You can put them together in about 10 to 20 minutes

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.939
Materials are going to need for this product very simple and very inexpensive

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.180
I just ran down the local Walmart

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.319
And I picked up some bamboo skewers some girls hair clips

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.399
Some mini popsicle sticks and some embroidery thread you can get the color of your choice

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.449
I'm going with yellow

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.529
And as far as tools go all you're really gonna need is a hot glue gun and a pair of scissors

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.449
Now to get started building our longbow

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.429
We're going to need to grab one of these small craft sticks and put a hole through the center of this popsicle stick just wide

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.210
Enough to accommodate a bamboo skewer

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.279
you can do that in a number of ways you can use a sharp point of a knife and just spin it in circles or

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.879
You can grab something like a 9/16 inch drill bit and very quickly drill a hole right through it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.119
And then take two of these little hair clips and give them a small modification

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.360
What we need to do is get rid of this centerpiece in the hair clip

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.280
And if you just use your finger to press the back of it

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.980
You can see it pops up if you grab that and bend it over

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.499
You can actually snap it clean off then press the center to pop the clip back and your first piece is complete

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.300
Once you've got your two Clips modified

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.739
We're going to use a couple of dabs of hot glue on the ends of our popsicle sticks to secure them in place like that

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.989
Now while the glue still hot it's a good idea to set it facedown on the table and make sure that the hair clips are

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.380
Straight then just give it about 20 to 30 seconds to cool completely

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.010
Now hot glue is amazingly impressive and very durable however to reinforce our bow and make a little bit stronger more versatile

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.440
We're gonna reinforce these joints with a little bit of embroidery thread

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.220
We want to do is start with a very small dab of hot glue just on the

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.580
Backside of the popsicle stick and use that as a place to start your strength

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.630
You can overlap the string a little bit just to get it started because it's very easy to snip that off later

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.000
When we want to do is just get about five or six turns going around to base that hair clip

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.809
now eventually we get to the point where that hair clip gets so narrow at the bottom. It wants to slip down and that's okay

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.359
we'll go ahead and slip down start wrapping that and then we're gonna work our way from the bottom all the way up until the

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.830
Top until we can't see anymore the popsicle stick we're gonna use one more dab of hot glue on the back

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.290
to secure the back end of the string I find if you lick your finger and press it down it helps prevent the glue from

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.689
Sticking your fingers and helps prevent you from getting burned

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.640
Alright with that one done finishing. The other side is just as simple as doing the same thing

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.820
So there we have a guys that pretty much completes all of the lashings for our bow

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.980
Now we can use some of the same embroidery thread to create the bowstring we're gonna start off with a piece of string a little bit longer than one of these bamboo

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.940
Skewers and we're gonna start by looping it through the Centers of the hair clip and then bring it around and looping it back down

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.540
Through the hole at the top

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.029
Then we're just gonna make a simple overhand knot and use a little dab of hot glue to prevent it from unraveling

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.510
And then tie it a second time before the glue cools to help secure it in place

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.640
Now that we got one end tied and secure there's important thing we need to do before we tie the other end and that's take

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.610
A little string and twist it up to make it a little bit tighter

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.320
This will increase durability and give it a little bit longer lifespan then with our string tighten

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.139
We're gonna take the other end we're gonna loop it back through the hole at the other end

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.639
Tie it in a single knot and then that point. We're going to adjust the actual tightness of our bowstring itself

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.320
You can use the table or your stomach just to press in a little bit as you tie the knot and then secure it with

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.869
A second knot like you did the other one to hold everything securely in place

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.449
So here we are guys at this point our micro longbow is just about complete

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.880
We've just got these long strings flipping off the end here

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.460
But because they're glued in place and double knotted we can very easily

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.979
Snip those off with a pair of scissors and reuse this material to make some silencing tassels for the bowstring itself

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.929
You can see I just took those leftover bits and string I tied them with a double knot on the tops and bottoms of the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.170
Bowstring itself kind of in line with the lashings we did earlier

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.399
And I snipped them down so they're about a quarter to half an inch long and then just ruffled them up a little bit

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.400
So they look like decorative castles that act as improvised dampers for the bowstring now of course these are mainly just for looks

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.980
But it's another cool way to use up some of those scraps before they go in the garbage

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.530
Alright at this point our bow is finished, so let's go ahead and make some arrows so for these improvised arrows

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.140
We're not going to be making true arrows that fly perfectly straight

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.859
But we're gonna be making something good enough start off by finding a few bamboo skewers

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.009
And it is important to find the ones that are as straight as possible

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.040
You see some of them are kind of wonky and jut off angles

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.329
We don't want those we want to go with the ones that are as close to perfectly straight as you rotate them around

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.079
In the actual length of these arrows are gonna be about the same length as our bow itself

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.510
so just lay the skewer over top find the distance and then break it off near the bottom and to help them walk into the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.229
bowstring a little bit better

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.789
We can put a little knock in the end which can be easily made with a knife a pair of scissors or in my case

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.790
a piece of broken hacksaw blade

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.880
Now these arrows are made for very short-range target practice if we wanted them to go longer

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.779
We'd actually have to add fletchings to the end which isn't gonna work shooting them out through this hole here

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.559
but one little trick that we can do to add a little bit of weight and help keep them centered as they fly through the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.199
Air is to add a dab of hot glue about an inch down from the tip

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.899
It's kind of like glassblowing I think you want to keep it moving

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.080
Try and get it to settle into

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.640
as an aerodynamic of a ball as you can

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.380
But of course if you're impatient like me you might just want to stick it on your tongue roll it around a little bit

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.180
They'll help dissipate the heat and get to cool down a little bit quicker plus

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.519
You can kind of shape it a little more aerodynamically as well

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.360
So there we have it guys our long bow and arrow are completely finished and ready for short-range

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.809
Target testing and for that we're gonna be using a couple pieces of toast

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.000
I just grabbed a paper plate cut a slit down the middle and shove some toast down it to form a makeshift target

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.190
And I made up a couple more long bows as well

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.480
I think they all look really great

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.560
So let's put these things to the test and see how our little micro long bows hold up to the battle at the breakfast table

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.900
Bang sweet

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.519
Well there you have the guys that is how to make a micro

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.199
Longbow that you can now add to your arsenal of desktop weaponry. Thanks for joining me for this project
