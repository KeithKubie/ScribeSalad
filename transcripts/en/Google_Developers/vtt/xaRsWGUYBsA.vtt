00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:10.112
MIHAI IONESCU: Hello,
everyone.

00:00:10.112 --> 00:00:12.080
Welcome to Payments Live.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.130
We have an office hours slide
show today, answering

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.010
questions from Stack Overflow
groups and the moderator.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.020
But before doing that, we'll
do something special.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.470
Here in the studio with me
is my colleague, Peng.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.870
Peng.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.860
PENG YING: Hey, how's
it going?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.630
MIHAI IONESCU: Say
hey to everyone.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.324
And what we are doing is, as
we are getting close to the

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:36.520
end of a great year for Google
Payments and Wallet APIs, and

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.980
since this will be the last
show until next year, we

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.960
thought let's do a recap of all
the important events and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.520
launches that happened
in 2012.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.560
So let's get started.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.220
Just as we crossed into 2012, we
launched the international

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.270
introduction of the
digital goods API

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.310
or the In-App Payments.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.580
And that came with the
availability in 18 countries

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.465
and nine currencies.

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:04.090
And it was a nice,
new present.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.040
And we made quite a [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.030
developers very happy.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.490
Pong, what happened next?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.545
PENG YING: And shortly after we
launched that, we also made

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.980
a few additional improvements
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.960
We've added a streamlined
sign-up.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.650
We call that [? mailing ?]
address sign-up.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.690
And it makes it a very seamless
experience to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.030
purchase virtual goods
from within the app.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.925
So we simplified sign-ups
for in-app payments.

00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:32.150
MIHAI IONESCU: So now even
the sign-up was in-app.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.740
That's pretty cool.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.840
And along the way, we also
had some cool developer

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.690
conferences and events, where we
met a lot of developers, we

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.570
talked about the multi-synch
apps, the Google Wallet.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.740
And among those, some of the
most important work, the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.585
Google Developer Conference,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:52.710
Conference, and South
by Southwest.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.570
Both happened in early spring.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
And they're coming again
this spring in 2013.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.135
And we may have some cool
things to talk about.

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:02.640
So stay tuned for the
announcements.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.140
We try to post the
announcements in

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.590
advance on this show.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.620
PENG YING: And then in March and
April, we also announced

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.370
mobile web support for in-app
payments to API.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.040
And what this means is that you
can just integrate once,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.070
and you will be able to accept
purchases on the desktop and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.210
mobile devices while
on the mobile web.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.620
We also launched a Google+ page
for Google Wallet to keep

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.340
you up to date on the latest
Google Wallet news.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.730
And in June, at Google I/O, we
had a few other great new

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.470
announcements.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.200
We launched subscription support
and a new pricing

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.790
structure with fees
as lows as 1.9%.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.660
Oh, and we also announced Save
to Wallet for offers.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.590
MIHAI IONESCU: Lots of
announcements at

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.290
I/O. That's very nice.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.290
And then the summer came,
and what did we do?

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.020
We took a vacation?

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.650
Not really.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.350
Just right after Google I/O,
we launched this show on

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.610
Google Developers Live.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.440
It's an amazing way to reach
developers in all

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.390
parts of the world.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.400
We hold office hours
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.050
We try to give you a sneak
preview into things to come.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.180
And to name just a few, we
showed you the new Merchant

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.220
Center, and also the new
commerce [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.950
features.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.890
And the all these are very nice
new features that will

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.140
come in the coming months.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.020
PENG YING: And then in August,
we did something new.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.890
We moved the concept of Google
Wallet into the cloud.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.820
So now instead of digitally
representing your credentials

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.990
on your phone or your device,
we are now storing digital

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.550
representation in the clouds.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.120
And the benefit of that is that
it's now accessible from

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.680
any device connected to the
clouds or even off-line

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.360
sometimes, depending
on the device, that

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.670
supports Google Wallets.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.960
Anywhere you want to purchase
from, whether it's your mobile

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.702
phone, whether it's your tablet,
whether it's your PC,

00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:18.750
on any purchase flow that
supports Google Wallet, you

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.140
can make a purchase using the
same credentials across all of

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.890
those things.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.580
MIHAI IONESCU: That's
really cool.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.362
That was one big step forward.

00:04:28.362 --> 00:04:31.050
You used to have only one card
available on Google Wallet.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.800
Now you can have any of them.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.200
And the cloud gives you
so many more security

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.230
enhancements and new features.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.660
And with all those things going
along, we kept in touch

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.550
with the developers through
our Payments Live show.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.850
But we also like to
meet face-to-face.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.050
And in early fall, we had quite
a few conferences, where

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.500
again we met with developers and
talked about Wallet APIs.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.710
And we had a lot of what we call
[INAUDIBLE], sponsored by

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.170
Google and local developer
communities in Washington, DC,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.380
and in Mountain View
California.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.530
To all those people there,
if you're watching, hi!

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.430
Later on this fall, we met with
quite a few people in

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.980
Kansas City.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.340
And these are all great ways
to connect with developers.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.895
And we'll make sure to
let you know about

00:05:18.895 --> 00:05:22.406
any upcoming events.

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:26.170
PENG YING: And finally, closer
to the end of year, we

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.410
announced a new mobile wallet
API for mobile web

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.290
transactions.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.360
What it does is it enables OAuth
2 like access to carrier

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.430
credentials.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.860
Currently, it's only available
to select merchants.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.290
But we're accepting new
merchants every day, and you

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.380
can request to be a merchant
on our site at

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.400
developers.googl
e.com/wallet-online.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.970
MIHAI IONESCU: And of course,
we kept announcing more and

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.760
more mobile devices that come
preloaded with Google Wallet.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.940
And the last few we mentioned in
previous shows are from the

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.140
Nexus line.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.610
Phones and tablets from
Samsung and LG.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.470
And let's see.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.430
So we got closer to the
end of the year.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.785
What else?

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:16.675
Oh, on the developer support
front, we are now focusing and

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:19.670
have centralized the support
to Stack Overflow.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.430
And this is where we'll
actually take

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.312
some questions today.

00:06:23.312 --> 00:06:27.440
And on Stack Overflow, please
make sure you only use

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.480
technical questions.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.430
Either too generic or not on
technical topics, they may not

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.210
be accepted.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.550
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.680
They may get closed out
by the community or

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.156
down-voted into oblivion.

00:06:37.156 --> 00:06:38.632
MIHAI IONESCU: Yep.

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:39.420
All right.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.120
So what a great year.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.820
With that, let's move on
with the Q&amp;A section.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.070
So let me start with
the first question.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.940
We had quite a few on
Google Checkout.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.020
And this one involves the
carrier-calculated shipping

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.215
API, a very nice feature
of Checkout.

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:58.250
And the question is, I'm
using the Checkout

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.480
carrier shipping API.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.635
I have three shipping methods
set up, and they work fine.

00:07:02.635 --> 00:07:06.400
I added a new set of products,
and for those, the Checkout

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.520
order page only shows the
default shipping costs.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.955
So obviously, your
carrier-calculated shipping

00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:16.580
methods are not applying
to these new products.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.960
It should be relatively easy to
debug and test this in the

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.390
sandbox, because you can then
complete the entire

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.170
transaction.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.030
You don't just stop
at the order page.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.490
And then you can analyze the
shopping cart [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.130
Google to try to figure out why
only the default shipping

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.340
cost is applied.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.520
But if you cannot do that, since
this is happening only

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.520
for those new items, that's a
pretty good indication that

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.750
there's something probably
wrong with those.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.770
There's some missing or
incorrect data in the

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.670
inventory when you added
them to your database.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:52.080
And to give you a way to start
investigating, please know

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.330
that carrier-calculated shipping
needs the item weight

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.620
in order to calculate the total
shipping cost, because

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.100
carriers calculate cost
based on weight.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.160
And most likely, you
have weights

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.960
missing on those items.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.900
And that's why by default
there is zero, and then

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.550
carrier-calculated shipping
will use the default cost.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:16.360
And another thing to make sure
regarding to weights is that

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.020
the total weight of the package
will have to be at

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.750
least 1/4 pound in
order for carrier

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.290
calculated shipping to apply.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.850
So if you have smaller items,
just set them to 0.25 pounds,

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:33.789
or 1/4 pound, and then the
shipping methods will kick in.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.700
So I think, probably, this is
what's happening, and you'll

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.220
figure it out.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:37.710
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.299
Seems like it.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.960
I've seen a lot of issues, and
most of them are mainly around

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.880
the weight.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.049
MIHAI IONESCU: It's
easy to miss.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:46.080
And when you're adding new items
to inventory, it's easy

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.110
to miss the weights, or add
smaller weights than is

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.600
actually the case.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.456
PENG YING: True.

00:08:53.456 --> 00:08:54.430
I'll take the second question.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.740
So I have trouble with
taxes in Checkout.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.340
The taxes set in the Merchant
Center are not applied.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.470
And then I've seen this a few
times before as well.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.085
And what's typically occurring
here is that I'm guessing that

00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:10.480
the merchant is using an
e-commerce platform.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.220
And e-commerce platforms also
sometimes can include their

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.810
own tax rules.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.960
And these tax rules are defined
within the shopping

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.635
cart XML that your platform is
sending over the Checkout and

00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:25.316
overwrites the tax rules that
are defined within Checkout.

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:29.680
So you're probably seeing the
default tax rules that the

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.200
e-commerce platform
has provided.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.310
To get rid of this or fix this,
you have two options.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.900
You could either fix the tax
data or update the tax

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.740
[INAUDIBLE] within your
e-commerce platform, or you

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.130
could ask your e-commerce
provider how to remove the tax

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.252
rules from [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:48.910
MIHAI IONESCU: Makes sense.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.600
Let me take the next one.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.340
So the question is about
passing specific order

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.440
information and private merchant
information in a

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.100
Google Wallet transaction.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.500
And I think we touched
on this topic before.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:11.850
Most wallet APIs give you a way
to ask private merchant

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.480
information [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.425
back to you so that you cannot
associate that information

00:10:16.425 --> 00:10:17.700
with the order.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.060
So since this does not mention
the particular wallet API, let

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.770
me talk about two of them that
offer this capability.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.350
For the digital goods API and
the In-App Payments API,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.435
there's a field called "Seller
Data," where you can pass

00:10:32.435 --> 00:10:34.105
private information.

00:10:34.105 --> 00:10:36.980
Probably it's a good
idea to encrypt it.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.430
And this information will be
sent back to you in the

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.050
postback or when the transaction
completes.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.350
And you can use it to update
your inventory, your user

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.420
management information,
everything there.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.790
And similarly, on the Checkout
side, there is a "Merchant

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.930
Private Data" field
in the XML.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.590
Merchant-private-data.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.010
You can search for it in
the documentation.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.620
Which behaves in a similar way,
and you'll receive the

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.130
same data back through
the notification API.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.790
So two different APIs.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:12.410
Similar methods to handle
merchant information.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.550
PENG YING: I'll take
the next one.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.260
So how can I change the
order page to get the

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.760
customer on my site?

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.605
The guy in this one doesn't
really talk about the API or

00:11:22.605 --> 00:11:24.210
what part of the order flow.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:29.670
So I'll answer all of
the possibilities.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.285
First off, in Checkout, there's
[? no ?] automatically

00:11:32.285 --> 00:11:34.920
corrects everything.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.090
So in order to get the customer
back to your page,

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.070
the customer needs
to take action.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.790
If it's during the initial
checkout flow, where they're

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.886
still viewing the order on
Checkout, you could do find

00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:51.630
and edit [INAUDIBLE], and then
that'll create a link on the

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.160
checkout page that will allow
the user to go back to your

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.630
site to edit the items
in their cart.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:02.480
Once the user has completed the
purchase, you can define a

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.190
Continue Shopping URL, which
will define a link to direct

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:11.580
the customer back from the
receipt page to your site.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.320
But if you're only selling
digital goods, you can use the

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.420
In-App Payments API or Google
Wallet for Digital Goods,

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.596
where the entire flow takes
place on your site, and you

00:12:21.596 --> 00:12:22.785
won't have any of
these problems.

00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:23.120
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.620
Much, much easier.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.785
PENG YING: I hope
that answers.

00:12:25.785 --> 00:12:27.035
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes.

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:30.280
All right.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.110
There's another one
about pricing.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.922
Do you want to take it?

00:12:33.922 --> 00:12:35.040
PENG YING: MIHAI IONESCU:
Oh, yeah.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.060
So this one is actually
from Stack Overflow.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.210
And it's a little bit
un-technical for Stack

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.590
Overflow, but we answered
it anyway.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.940
In Google Wallet, I set the
price in US dollars, but I'm

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.760
selling digital goods, and
my customer might be

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.550
anywhere in the world.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.020
Is there any way you see what
Google Wallet will charge in

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.700
localized currency?

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.090
So this is kind of the opposite
concept of how Google

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.130
Wallet works.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:05.260
Instead of you setting a fixed
price as a merchant, and then

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.410
expecting Google Wallet to
translate it across various

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.070
currencies--

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.910
well, how it actually works is
that you set a fixed price in

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.100
that currency, and then we
translate it to US dollars, or

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.060
whatever your merchant account
is in, and then pay you out in

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.750
that amount.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.600
So it's the opposite.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.630
And what you should do is IP
geolocate your customer, then

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.080
define the market price of the
item in the geolocator

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.535
currency, and enable your
customer purchase that way.

00:13:32.535 --> 00:13:35.990
With that, instead of maybe
one day your customer gets

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.720
charged $0.05, and then the next
day your customer gets

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.300
charged $0.25, it's just a fixed
amount the entire time.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.680
And then that currency
conversion risk is

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.120
handled on your side.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.110
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.900
Let me take the next one.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.710
This is also Checkout related.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.190
Oh, that's quite a few of
Checkout questions.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.990
It says, I'm using the Checkout
notification XML API,

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.095
and Google seems to be
delivering notifications not

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:08.150
in the order I expected.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.945
For example, an order state
change notification will have

00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:14.930
a new financial order state of
charging, and then immediately

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.670
after one proceeding, it had
already said it would charge.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:24.430
So all the notifications
may come out of order.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.860
And especially for order
state changes.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.870
The only Checkout notification
that is guaranteed to arrive

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.392
in order, it's the new order
notification, which will

00:14:34.392 --> 00:14:35.360
arrive first.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.940
So you'll get that one, and then
you may get some order

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.702
state changes notification
in not the

00:14:41.702 --> 00:14:42.952
order you're expecting.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.120
Your solution sounds fine--

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.160
setting the state of the order
to the order state

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.070
notification with a high
serial number, it's OK.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.830
PENG YING: And I'll take
the last question.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.690
Is it possible to cancel a
subscription for a user

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.510
without issuing a refund?

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.500
So there was some confusion
about cancellations of

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.140
subscriptions and whether that
would automatically refund the

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.500
subscription amount or
the latest charge.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.450
And we want to clarify that.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.940
Cancelling a subscription--

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.810
well, all it does is
it prevents the

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.240
recurrences from occurring.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.370
So if there was an initial
amount tied to that

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.630
subscription initiation,
then you can

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.660
also refund that amount.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.290
But cancelling the subscription
won't refund the

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.930
subsequent orders.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.460
So if you want to refund each
of those subsequent

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.485
recurrences, you'll have to go
into those recurrences, and

00:15:37.485 --> 00:15:40.270
then cancel and refund those.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.130
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:41.990
Any more questions?

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.855
We got to the end.

00:15:42.855 --> 00:15:44.040
PENG YING: I think that's it.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.786
MIHAI IONESCU: That's it.

00:15:44.786 --> 00:15:46.570
Lots of Checkout questions.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:51.170
People are getting ready to sell
stuff for New Year and

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.490
Christmas, and all the
winter holidays.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.540
So we hope we make money!

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.520
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.170
So this, as we said earlier,
this is last

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.920
show for this year.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.270
And we will see everyone
back in 2013.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.420
We want to wish you
a happy New Year.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:07.910
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.785
Happy holidays.

00:16:08.785 --> 00:16:09.600
MIHAI IONESCU: Happy holidays.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.262
And we'll see you in 2013,

00:16:12.262 --> 00:16:13.050
PENG YING: See ya.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.300
MIHAI IONESCU: Bye.
