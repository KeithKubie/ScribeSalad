00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.240
You’ve probably heard people make comparisons between the United States in

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.980
States in the 1960s... "Get out of that pool!"

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.120
and the U.S. today. "Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!" "Black lives matter!

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.100
There’ve been street protests, a spotlight on policing and a national discussion about race, equality and equity.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.900
Today, more than ever, we see pundits and politicians using the legacy of the civil rights movement and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.640
and its icons as fodder to criticize social movements ... like Black Lives Matter. "That's

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
the whole message that I think Dr. King had to present, and I think he would be

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.460
appalled that we are elevating some lives above others.”

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.020
Jeffrey Lord: “Think of President Trump as the Martin Luther King of healthcare.”

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.640
Symone Sanders: “Oh, Jeffrey, Jeffrey.” What happens when people neuter the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.860
legacy of  the civil rights movement and then use

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.660
that sanitized version to critique
today's activism? . I’m Imaeyen. And today

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.829
AJ+ we’re exploring the true history of the civil rights era, and how

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.640
the people we lionize – like MLK, Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali –

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.600
were much bolder, riskier and threatening to the power dynamic

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170
than we’ve been taught.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.150
We’ve basically been getting a PG version of the civil rights movement. “The

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.600
men who organized the rally walked with springing steps toward the speaker stand.”

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.700
“They moved with good humor, laughter and song.” So much of the civil rights movement

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.900
looked more this: tense, violent and life-threatening.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.100
And the go-to face when we talk about this time is Martin Luther King Jr.’s.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.300
The reverend is arguably the movement’s most well-known leader. But

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.500
But the truth is that he was just one person in a movement with differing ideologies for achieving

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.770
racial justice and equity – goals that relied heavily on the work and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.100
and sacrifices of black women, whose contributions have been largely

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.060
overlooked. We’ll talk more about that a little later. For now, you should know

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.290
that Martin Luther King Jr. was much more than a symbol for nonviolence.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.640
And his efforts weren’t warmly received or supported by the nation’s majority, as

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.530
as Professor John Powell explains: “Dr. King, when he was alive, was extremely

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.970
unpopular. People were against most of his marches. Even the church was against

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.200
him. So he was going into very strong headwinds.” While today the majority of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.790
Americans say they believe the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a good thing, at

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.140
the time it didn’t have much support from the masses. A 1963 Gallup Poll

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.370
found 60% of Americans had an unfavorable view of Martin Luther King Jr.’s

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.510
March on Washington. That’s where he delivered his historic “I Have a Dream” speech.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.830
You know, the one we so often honor today and use to emphasize the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.519
the United States’ ideals. King’s speeches were way more radical than we choose to

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.190
remember. In fact, he was working on a sermon called

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.440
“Why America May Go to Hell” the day he died. And King’s low approval rating was

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.400
not only because he was so critical of the way society functions, but also that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.760
he was part of a larger movement, registering black voters and organizing

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.019
sit-ins at segregated restaurants. None of which were the “right” way to advocate

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.160
for these causes, according to critics. If that criticism sounds familiar to you,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.820
it’s because pundits have used the same critiques about the Black Lives

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.620
Matter movement. And sometimes they even invoke King’s memory to do the work.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.320
For example, Alex Jones’ program posted a segment called “MLK Supports Trump from the Grave.”

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.640
King’s legacy is so closely tied with politics that an important point

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.780
often gets misplaced in our collective memory of him: his critique of capitalism.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.340
In a letter to his wife, Coretta, he wrote,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.700
This was not isolated to one letter, either. King often spoke about how alleviating poverty

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.260
was important to the fight for justice. For example, in 1965 at Ebenezer Baptist Church in

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.620
Atlanta he said,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.900
But when we put his Washington “I Have a Dream” speech on repeat, it’s easy to

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.739
forget all the ways he fought against injustices on multiple fronts.

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.700
He was also against the Vietnam War and U.S. imperialism. He once said that the U.S. government

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.840
was the “greatest purveyor of violence in the world today” and compared the war in

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.910
Vietnam to the German concentration camps. “The Reverend Martin Luther King was a social

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.850
justice religious worker, a warrior for radical justice and inclusion. When people

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.780
say this is an extreme position, he would say it's OK to be extreme if you're extreme in favor

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.580
favor of love.” And let’s not forget the end to this story.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.750
Because Martin Luther King did actually
die for what he believed in.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.900
He threatened the status quo to the extent that he was assassinated.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.920
Another important figure in the civil rights movement, and one of the few recognized women,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.300
is Rosa Parks. She’s widely described in the media like this:  “Through her quiet elegance..."

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.210
“This quiet 42-year-old...” “Rosa Parks. An everyday American that changed the course of history.”

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:55.280
The Rosa Parks story is often told as if it were an … accident. That a coincidental chain of events –

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.240
her being tired after a long day of work, her fatigue leading unexpectedly to her arrest –

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.320
led to the desegregation of the bus system. This was no accident. She was not just a woman who was

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.410
simply weary and on her way home from work. She was not just a seamstress.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.520
“There's sort of a false image of a woman. She's quiet, diminutive, you know, she's a little

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.890
bit timid. That's not who she was. She was a fighter. She was fierce.”And guess what?

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.910
That historic photo of her on the bus is staged.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.920
Rumors were being spread of Parks being a Communist and a Mexican.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.780
Depicting her as a fragile, everyday woman was a way for organizers to

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.160
get the public to sympathize with her experience, since an outspoken black

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.620
activist would have been a harder pill to swallow. That’s all-star PR. Parks was an activist.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.940
She worked for the NAACP for years and investigated

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.710
investigated sexual assaults of black people by white men. Her bus protest was deliberate.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.640
It was part of an ongoing effort to desegregate the bus system. Not only was

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.840
Parks not the only person to refuse to move from her seat, it was also not the

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.370
the first time she had done so. The very same driver that had her arrested had kicked her off his bus before.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.780
off his bus before. And after that famous bus protest, she continued her political activism for decades.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.220
We’ve talked about faces synonymous with the civil rights movement.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.030
But there’s one man who some don’t recognize for his

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.680
dedication to equality and equity. Muhammad Ali literally gave up the best

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.460
best boxing years of his career, and what the nation remembers is a whitewashed

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.270
version of the world’s most influential athlete. “Muhammad Ali is remembered today,

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:38.320
I think, with his political teeth largely extracted. People speak about him in

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:45.010
terms of being this figure of reconciliation. Almost like a Buddha-type figure,

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:51.100
someone whose silent aura, people, particularly white people, feel

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.910
good about themselves. But the Ali that became revered in the latter years of his

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.360
life was a much different Ali than the one from his height.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.440
The younger Ali spoke openly, boldly, loudly about the experience of being a

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.580
black man in a racist society, about being a Muslim and about his strong beliefs

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.010
on injustices throughout the country.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.030
“Since we helped build America to be – 50 of the richest states in America,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.540
fought all the American wars to help maintain and uphold the government, why not should

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.140
we have some of the land where we can build and construct?” Quite simply, he made

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.320
lots of people, especially white people, really uncomfortable.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.160
He said he changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali to denounce

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.790
the oppression white Christian culture has had on black people. Like Martin Luther

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.440
King, he vehemently opposed the Vietnam War. He was sentenced to five years in

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.760
prison for saying no to the draft – a sentence that was later overturned. But he

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.880
lost his boxing license because of it.  “My conscience don’t let me go shoot my brother, or some

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:52.030
darker people, or some poor hungry people in the mud. Shoot them

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.830
them for what them for what? They never called me n*gger, they never lynched me, they never

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:03.040
robbed me of my nationality, raped, killed my mother and father.” Ali retired in

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.080
in 1981, but he really wasn't embraced by mainstream America until he lit the torch

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.720
at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games. At that point, he was an older man –

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.120
with Parkinson's disease and showing 
 symptoms.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:21.840
"The mainstream media and politicians like Bill Clinton and Orrin Hatch only embraced Muhammad Ali

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.680
lost the power of speech. And once he wasn't able to use the gift of gab to

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.560
decry U.S. empire, to speak out for Palestinian rights – which is something he

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.380
believed in very strongly – once he was unable to do that, then this incredibly

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.300
popular person was free for them to embrace. America found it easy to love Ali

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.440
once he was silenced. So what does that mean for the future of Colin Kaepernick?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.240
So why is it important to remember King was critical of capitalism, Parks was no ordinary seamstress and Ali

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.910
wasn’t beloved by the majority in his prime? Because by uplifting them as

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:05.680
sanitized icons, we’re able to ignore the great racial disparities that continue

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.810
to exist today. Understanding what these icons stood for helps contextualize the

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:15.040
the commitment many of our generation's leaders and movements are making today.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.140
“I think what the politicians and the elites actually figured out toward

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:25.000
the late '60s, early '70s, , is that we can coopt the civil rights movement. We can

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.550
embrace King but still maintain segregated schools, for example, segregated

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.730
neighborhoods. We can still maintain segregated boardrooms.”
