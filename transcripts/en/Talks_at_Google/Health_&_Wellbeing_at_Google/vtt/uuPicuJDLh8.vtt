[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.470
SPEAKER: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.380
We are very pleased
to have you here

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.240
for the Talks at Google series.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.260
Our topic today is Meditation
for Rewilding the Self

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.420
by Nirali Shah.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.960
Nirali, we are very
honored to have you here.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.170
Thank you for being with us.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.980
Just a little bit of
background on Nirali.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.050
Nirali Shah is an artist,
writer, social worker,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.100
and a meditation teacher.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.040
She teaches
mindfulness meditation

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.000
with an emphasis on mind-body
awareness and self-inquiry.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.440
She has spent thousands of hours
meditating in silent retreats.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.720
She's a certified
mindfulness facilitator

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.710
from UCLA's Mindfulness
Awareness Research Center.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.980
She lives in the Bay Area
and currently teaches

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.430
at nonprofits,
technology companies,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.680
academic institutions,
and spiritual communities

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.210
such as Spirit Rock and
Insight Meditation Center

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.800
in Redwood City.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.600
In the past, she
has served in one

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.700
of the largest slum
communities of Asia

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.470
for more than four years.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.860
And she is the founder of
Shvaas, a nonprofit platform

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.890
that has helped streamline
thousands of hours of volunteer

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.990
efforts to work on meaningful
social change projects.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.520
Assuming that a lot
of you are already

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.670
familiar with meditation,
and many of you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.240
have learned basic mindfulness
meditation practices,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.320
the talk today will touch
into some advanced aspects

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.050
of this practice.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.720
Just like me, I'm
sure you too are

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.210
very curious to know
what re-wilding means

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.260
and what it has to
do with meditation.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.958
So please join me in
welcoming Nirali Shah.

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.452
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.710
NIRALI SHAH: Thank you
all for being here.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.970
It is such a delight
to be together building

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.230
community in this way.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.110
I want to especially thank
Soneli for all her efforts

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.820
and her care in making
this event so beautiful

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.610
and smooth for all of us.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.300
And I want to thank Google
for creating this space

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.690
to have conversations
such as these

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.980
in a very corporate setting.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.240
And I really appreciate
that this kind of work

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.810
is coming more and more
into our mainstream lives.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.980
Also, I want to have a round
of applause for Google, lots

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.870
of Google employees
who have been very

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.540
active in the protests
that are going on

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.740
and are showing up at airports
and at large protests.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.410
And yeah, I want to
really cheer that.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.140
So I want to talk today about
re-wilding, about emotions.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.050
And in order to do that, I
want to take you back in time,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.200
into deep time, about 15 years
ago in the life of Nirali

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.270
when she was driving a white
Mazda on the freeway of Los

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.815
Angeles, going to work, driving
an hour each way, going to work

00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:22.380
to Malibu.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.470
I was working in advertising
and design at that point

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.680
and following the
roadmap, following

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.380
the checklist, the
blueprint of what

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.570
it means to have a good life.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.070
What am I supposed to do?

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.870
I'm supposed to
get a good degree.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.400
I'm supposed to get a good
job, make some good money.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.900
I'm supposed to have a
boyfriend or a partner

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.380
or a girlfriend, something.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.260
And I'm supposed to--

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.780
yeah, I'm supposed to buy
a house, get a mortgage,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.450
go for some exotic
vacations, get a car.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.930
And somewhere, I
think I was made

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.530
to believe that that very next
achievement or acquisition is

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.120
what would fulfill me and that
would give meaning to my life--

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.390
the next car or the next job
opportunity or the next title

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.940
or award.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.580
And that was perfectly fine.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.170
And I felt like I was
living a good life.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.790
I was doing pretty
well in that sense.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.530
But internally, I
vividly remember

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.170
something feeling really out
balance, like off kilter.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:54.490
And I started wondering what
was really going on for me.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.920
And it was very hard to even
ask those kind of questions

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.470
because the minute I start
asking those kind of questions,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.490
that starts creating some
disruption in my flow of life.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.650
And so here I am trying to
ask those questions, and at

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.420
the same time,
distracting myself

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.250
in a lot of work and things
to do and a busy schedule.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.530
And now when I look
back at that Nirali,

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.220
I can see that she
was struggling.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.460
She was really struggling.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.070
There was this kind
of a nervous energy

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.320
that she was trying to hide.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.230
There was this low level
radio frequency of anxiety

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.100
or static pretty
much all the time.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.030
There was the sense
of not feeling

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:54.040
completely safe and at ease in
my own skin, in my own body.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.560
And that was painful.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.760
There's this quote by
the writer Anne Lamott.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.640
She says, "My mind is
like a bad neighborhood.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.530
And I try not to
go there alone."

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.620
And that's kind of what
was going on there for me.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.040
And there was also this sense
of being lost and unsure,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.960
like this sense of
walking on eggshells

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.190
and not being fully sure of
what am I doing with my life.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.260
Or is there even a
meaning or a purpose?

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.870
And at some point,
I found meditation.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.060
And I started practicing.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.430
And in the practice of
meditation, the promise was--

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.930
at least as I assumed it--

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.470
that it would reduce stress.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.170
It would reduce my anxiety.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.880
It would make me feel more in
control of what's going on.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:59.110
And I was reading hundreds
of hours of scriptures,

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.890
Buddhist scriptures, or I
was reading Hindu scriptures.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:10.030
Or I would look into Sufism
or Tao or J. Krishnamurti.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.750
And I did a lot of retreats.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.340
So now, instead of
frequenting nightclubs,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.790
I was frequenting a lot
of meditation centers.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.690
And I did dozens and
dozens of retreats.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.320
And a lot of these
retreats when I started off

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.210
was in the SN Goenka
tradition, which a lot of you,

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.230
I think a few of you here
have done those, which

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.430
is these 10-day
retreats where you're

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.100
sitting for at least 10 hours
in cross-legged, in silence.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.280
And your last meal is
at 11:00 in the morning.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.800
And you're silent
throughout the entire time.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.810
And so I did a lot of those.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:55.840
And I thought that as I
do that, I would feel less

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.720
of an intensity of emotions.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.070
What happened was
kind of the opposite.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.720
The more I meditated,
I started feeling more.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.430
More stuff came up.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.310
And there's more emotions
coming up, strong emotions.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.880
And I was like, oh, my god, I'm
doing something really wrong

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.940
here.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.420
Maybe I'm not getting
this practice right.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.670
But I was like, you know what?

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.210
I'm going to keep meditating.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.000
I'm going to sit like a warrior.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.400
I'm going to let these
emotions pass through me.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.580
And I'm going to
become like the Buddha.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.210
The Buddha is like someone
who's unshakable, unmovable.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.480
No matter what emotions,
whatever happens,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.890
he's blissed out in these
exalted mental states.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.750
And I think I had
some misunderstanding

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.190
because I don't know if I was
really thinking of a Buddha

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.860
or a piece of furniture because
even a piece of furniture

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.020
is kind of unmovable
around emotions.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.200
But that was my sense
that I'm going to keep--

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.630
and maybe I need to work hard.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.220
Maybe I'm not performing enough.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.220
And so maybe I need to
meditate more harder.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.330
And so I did that.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.300
And what happened in this
journey of the last 10 or 15

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:15.460
years is that what has happened
has kind of surprised me.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.320
And what I want to do today
is share some of the insights,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.340
some of these turnings,
that have come in my life

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.220
and how they have shaped me.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:33.610
And also, I think they have
also clarified something very

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.650
beautiful and important for me.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.070
And these are things
that I have not

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.900
heard enough around meditation
in our popular meditation

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.070
circles.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:49.210
And so it feels
important to share these

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:54.370
because for me, these have
been ways in which I show up

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.000
to my practice and why
this practice feels

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.680
more immediate and honest
in my own experience.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.960
So I want to share my first
learning or insight with you.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.690
And that is around emotions.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.360
I thought that the
more I meditate,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.500
I will get rid of emotions,
of strong emotions.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.360
But what has happened is that
I feel ever more connected

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.707
to my emotional world.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:33.810
I remember going to a lot of
retreats back in India, as well

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.010
as here.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:40.280
One of those retreats
was at this ashram,

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.660
where you go into a room.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.140
And they actually lock
you from the outside.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:46.920
There's a door.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.590
There's a room with
an attached bathroom.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.500
And I was meditating there
for about eight days.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.850
And there's a small window.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.830
And they push in food through
that window a couple times

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.460
a day.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.180
And it was one of the most
beautiful and important

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.630
retreats of my life.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.680
There is no windows.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.380
There isn't even a fan.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.550
It gets really bare.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:17.040
And all you can do
is sit and go inside.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.460
And I remember all
these strong emotions

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.010
of fear coming up there.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.080
And it's so fascinating
to me because there

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.560
was no external
situations around fear.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.990
And I could see how
these emotions are deep

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.840
already sitting in my body.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.660
It's not like they are new.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.280
They have always been there.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.820
This fear has always been there.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.910
There was another retreat where
I experienced strong anger.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.084
This was a one-month
meditation retreat

00:11:52.084 --> 00:11:55.050
where you're supposed to
be in silence and sitting.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:01.170
And in that one-month retreat,
the strong emotion of anger,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.220
around the 12th or
13th day, showing up.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:11.790
And what was amazing was
that instead of seeing anger

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:16.100
as a problem, that this is
not the state of a Buddha,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.520
of a good meditator, I think
for me what was important

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.960
was to allow all of
that energy of anger

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.330
without feeling embroiled in it.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.980
And there was this capacity
because the mindfulness,

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.450
the sati, was so
strong that one could

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.750
allow these strong emotions
to show up without feeling

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.210
destabilized or overwhelmed.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.390
And what happens when you
really allow these emotions is

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.210
you start seeing that
actually, these emotions

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.540
are like messengers.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.160
When I sat with that
anger for three or four

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:56.940
days, strong anger, I could
see that that anger had a very

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.830
visceral charge in my body.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.990
And when you continue
experiencing it,

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.790
I could see that--

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.180
So there was a story
in all of that.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.720
But somehow, at some point, the
story was not that important.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.410
And the mind was not
spinning in the story.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.830
But somehow, there was
more awareness in the body.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.750
And when that anger
was arising, I

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.740
could feel the charge,
the energy of the anger.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:32.460
And what's amazing is I could
see that beneath anger is

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.620
a passion for justice.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.870
Anger has a different
quality than hate.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.810
It's not cold.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.740
It's kind of hot.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:47.170
And at another retreat, I could
see comparing mind showing up.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.640
And when you have comparing
mind and when you can really

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.190
allow that, instead of feeling
guilty or bad about yourself,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.440
really allow, receive that
as a gift, as a message,

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.550
you start seeing.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.400
For me, I could see wow,
beneath this comparing mind,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.750
there's a whole bunch of
self-loathing, self-hate.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.790
And how does that work?

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.250
So you start becoming
more and more curious.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.490
You investigate with
a lot of kindness.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.450
So instead of trying
to get rid of emotions,

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.540
I think in this practice
what I was learning was that

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:27.840
how can I meet these emotions
with an even greater intimacy

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.770
and compassion.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:35.610
And when we do that,
that is this capacity

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.870
to bring all parts of
ourselves to the practice.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.505
And to me, that's
a very powerful.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.360
The other piece
that's also something

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.110
I keep noticing is that by going
to more and more meditation

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.160
retreats, and also this piece
around spending time in nature,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:03.370
is that at some point,
my mind starts relaxing.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.820
So instead of feeling
this headiness

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.020
around constantly
spinning parts,

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:16.540
it almost feels like
the strings in my brain

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.380
are not being stressed or
stretched or pulled that hard.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.480
And there's a kind of
soothing relaxation

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.230
that starts happening.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.330
And then I can feel like more
and more energy is moving down

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.800
into the heart area.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.520
And my capacity to
feel is heightened.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:39.520
And that's really such an
amazing gift when you are not

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.080
spinning in thoughts or
stories, and your capacity

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.500
to feel emotions increases.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:55.270
And you get a much deeper
access to your emotional world.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.690
And sometimes, in that process,
strong emotions show up,

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.500
like shame, like fear.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.210
And in that process, the
other thing that I have seen

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:12.929
is how feelings are
marginalized in our communities.

00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:14.470
Because the more
and more I meditate,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.270
I can see that this
is not a solo journey.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.230
This is also as much
a relational journey.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.640
But the way we have built our
world, feelings and emotions,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.470
our sensory experiences,
intuition, all of this

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.980
is greatly marginalized
and almost even irrelevant

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.630
for a lot of people.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:40.120
And so I feel like how
do we create spaces where

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.310
this is actually at the center.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.040
Because when you study
like ancient or indigenous

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.310
communities, for a lot of
these communities, feelings,

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.650
intuition, all of
these qualities

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.215
were genuinely at the
center of their cultures.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.700
There's a quote that I
really like by Joanna Macy.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.950
She says, "The refusal to
feel takes a heavy toll.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.380
Not only is there
an impoverishment

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.079
of our emotional
and sensory life,

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.340
flowers are dimmer,
less fragrant.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.140
Our love is ecstatic.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.430
But the psychic numbing
also impedes our capacity

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.730
to process and respond
to information.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.270
The energy expended in
pushing down despair

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.760
is diverted from
more creative uses,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.190
depleting the resilience
and imagination needed

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.810
for fresh visions
and strategies."

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.140
That great Thai
master Ajahn Chah,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.020
he says that your practice
has not even started

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.330
if you haven't cried yet.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.110
And I could see
in these retreats,

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.935
crying happened quite a bit.

00:17:55.935 --> 00:17:57.630
And sometimes it
happened from a lot

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.090
of space of gratitude
and appreciation,

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.990
and sometimes, just the
heart breaking, just

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.220
really being in the midst of the
ocean of suffering and knowing

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.360
that that also is real.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.190
And I could also appreciate
the sacredness of tears

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.630
and how cleansing they are.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:23.520
But in our everyday world, if
I do that at Google, I mean,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.130
that would be pretty
much stigmatized.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.090
So I wonder how can
we also create spaces

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.285
where we can bring more
spaciousness for that too.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.430
So that was my first
insight around emotions.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.700
The second learning
that I wanted to share

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:51.250
was around control,
control versus chaos.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.850
So as I practiced
more, one thing

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.030
that showed up for me
that instead of gaining

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.690
greater control or
predictability in my life,

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:05.610
this practice moved me
closer to the center of chaos

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.830
and uncertainty.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.080
And it taught me
how to be with it.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.990
And that was very
radical because I

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.810
think we often feel like
oh, if I meditate more,

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.300
things will be more stable.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.160
But that's not
really what happens.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.460
But what does happen
is our capacity

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.510
to be with that instability
and that uncertainty greatly

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.830
increases.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.810
And so we enjoy it.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.670
We can receive that.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.010
We don't always enjoy it,
but we can receive that.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:43.930
As I started moving more and
more in the spiritual path,

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.440
a lot of concepts
started dropping away,

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.600
started scattering
like dust particles,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.270
a lot of ideas that
I had built. And I

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.550
could see all the
different ways in which I

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:59.440
had built my life that
was not authentic,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.930
that was not really coming from
this deeper longing inside me.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.320
And I could see the
violence that we

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:14.160
do to ourselves when we are too
afraid to be who we really are.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.350
There's this quote by Anais Nin.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.400
And she says, "The
day came when the risk

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.230
to remain tight in a bud was
more painful than the risk it

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.250
took to blossom."

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.410
I'll repeat that.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.040
"The day came when the risk
to remain tight in a bud

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.920
was more painful than the
risk it took to blossom."

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.620
After about six months into
this and these practices,

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.080
I went to India.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.930
And a few months after
that, I moved to India.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.920
And I was there for
six or seven years.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.270
And out of that time,
for about 4 1/2 years,

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.360
I worked with four
different nonprofits.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.930
And one of them was working
in a slum community.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.250
John was there.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.229
And Samir was there.

00:21:08.229 --> 00:21:09.770
There are actually
a few friends here

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:13.040
who worked with me
in those communities.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:21.040
And at one end, I was
in LA on my track,

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.610
the blueprint, the map.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:26.510
And here I was in the
midst of this uncertainty,

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.600
working in this community.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.210
And one of the
projects I was doing

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.500
was working with these women who
did rag picking for a living.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.070
And a lot of my days would be
going with this large gunny

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.160
bag on my shoulders
and walking the streets

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.490
for about a few
kilometers every day

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.290
and picking up
paper and plastic,

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.860
and putting my hands in perhaps
the worst garbage sometimes

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:56.000
that I could imagine
because I was learning

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.590
about the lives of these women.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:01.400
And I was working on livelihood,
health and nutrition,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.420
and micro-financing for them.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.140
And so it was really important
to experience their life

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.600
and learn from them.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.210
And a lot of times, my work,
I would be taking these women

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.090
to the hospital for checkups.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.430
And somehow, when
I look back, this

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:26.580
was completely not
making sense, even to me.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.970
Like, what is it that
I am really doing?

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.670
It was very confusing because
even the work in the nonprofit

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.990
was so random and chaotic.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.500
Even the organization
that I started,

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.680
everything was just
kind of happening.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.740
One of the projects that I
used to do is every few weeks,

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.780
I would cook a meal
for about 120 people.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.900
And I would pack these meals
in these leaf containers.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.460
And I would invite my friends,
and we would go to the streets.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.287
And we would offer these meals
to people who were homeless.

00:23:00.287 --> 00:23:01.620
And we would hang out with them.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.000
We would sit with them.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.770
We would connect with them.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:09.240
And sometimes, I
would find people

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:14.500
who were in extreme
physical conditions.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.780
This one time, there
was this man who

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.650
I met at the railway station.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:27.300
And he had been on the
floor, lying there,

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.170
for maybe four or five days.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.360
And he was covered in
his own urine and dirt.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.250
There were all these
flies all over him.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.950
And it didn't feel right to
just leave a meal and go away.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.190
And so I picked him up.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.890
And we took him to a hospital.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:50.310
And I was trying to take care
of him for about eight days.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.260
And unfortunately,
he passed away.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:57.340
He had a very extreme
form of tuberculosis.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.850
But all I knew in
that moment was

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:11.520
that it was important for me
to hold his life as sacred.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.090
And that was not logical.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:20.310
That was not a part of my plan.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:25.410
It wasn't-- and I could
not control his death.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.990
But somehow, being a
part of those experiences

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.140
has deeply shaped my
meditation practice.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:37.330
I cannot imagine how I could
be doing this practice without

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:41.470
going through those experiences
and realizing that my own

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:45.010
well-being is deeply tied
to the well-being of others.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.740
There's this poem by
Kabir, who is a Sufi saint.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.490
And he says that I
have locked my house,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.320
and I have burned it down.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.230
And I have walked to
the village square.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.670
And I'm waiting for you.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:10.670
If you too have the guts to
burn your house, come with me.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.790
And that's a very
provocative poem.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.340
He says "Scorch the house
to make a house arise, yogi.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.780
Protect it, and it's gone.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.660
I saw a miraculous sight, yogi--

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.340
a dead man eating up dying.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.710
The promise of a new house built
on the ashes of the old one

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:38.010
is a taste of your
authentic self.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.930
The promise of a new house built
on the ashes of the old one

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.120
is a taste of your
authentic self."

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.280
And one of my teachers
said that in one lifetime,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.010
you probably have to burn down
your house at least a half

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.780
a dozen times.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.000
And I think it's
metaphorical, of course.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.240
But what he's saying
is that there's

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:08.370
something around having
the courage to look

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.730
into all these
concepts and ideas

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.570
that we have built that are
not serving us in a deeper way.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.500
And how can live do more
immediately, more honestly,

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.540
with our immediate experience?

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.070
There's another poem.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.690
It's a Japanese poem.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.460
And they say, "The sky
now cracks and falls.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.230
The Earth cleaves open.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:40.460
In the heart of the fire
lies a hidden spring."

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.630
And this word "fire"
is really important

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:48.530
when we talk about re-wilding
the self because "in

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:53.190
the heart of the fire
lies a hidden spring."

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.020
This practice is not mechanical.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.410
It's not about going
through the motions

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.810
of the breath or the body.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:05.880
This practice is really
about this deep curiosity

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.010
investigation.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:13.000
And it's about meeting
that fire inside you

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.210
and even getting
excited by that fire,

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.815
getting nourished by that fire.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:29.500
My last learning is
that instead of becoming

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.580
calm, though silent,
well-behaved,

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.960
the practice of meditation
made me more expanded,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.600
awakening a fierce love,
and to some extent,

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.980
even threatening the status quo.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.315
The Buddha was a revolutionary.

00:27:47.315 --> 00:27:52.500
His fight of awakening
was one of rebellion,

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:59.920
a subversive path, subversive
against greed, against hatred,

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.665
against delusion.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.430
He thought that
we have to travel

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:12.500
against the norms of society,
against own self-centered

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.490
tendencies.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.660
In his own language,
he called this

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.690
the path of patisothagami,
which literally

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:28.380
means "going against the stream,
going against the stream."

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.010
And in that sense, meditation
is an act of resistance.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.880
It is an act of
uprooting ourselves

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.450
in some ways from the
collective culture.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.610
Because when we
are too embroiled

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.900
in the collective culture
and not investigating,

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:51.390
we are taking on a lot of
ideas, assumptions, pressures,

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:55.290
of what we ought to be doing.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.790
And I think in that
sense, it's really helpful

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:04.530
to go to these retreats
because then you

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.430
can have that spaciousness to
look at life at your own terms,

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.912
a very direct experience.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.920
When I started meditating
over the years, for me,

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.670
I think my understanding
of the different systems

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:25.420
of oppressions is becoming
more and more clear.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.830
I'm feeling more awake
to all the different ways

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.190
in which oppression works
internally and externally.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.340
Mindfulness is often
thought as a means

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.130
to stress reduction,
which is very great

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.530
and helpful and important.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.960
And I teach that too.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.010
But I think for me, it's
also very important to ask,

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.700
what is causing us stress?

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.400
A lot of what's happening
in our world right now,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.650
I would actually be
surprised if people are not

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.780
stressed and anxious.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.550
I mean, that would
be unimaginable.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.460
If the environmental
destruction,

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.640
the political
oppression, the racism--

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.210
a lot of things are going on.

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:11.820
And if we are not
feeling anxious,

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.680
that would be really surprising.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.730
And as a meditation teacher,
if I am prescribing behaviors

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.820
for calming and conformity
without bringing

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.360
this piece of social justice,
then I feel in some sense

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.445
I am encouraging a
spiritual bypass.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:38.280
Because I wonder what is then
the difference between me

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.590
and an inexperienced
psychiatrist

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:44.970
who's not doing a good job.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.480
What's the difference between
the psychiatrist who's simply

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.360
pushing more and more
drugs and more and more

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.500
palliatives on his
client, but not

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.930
really asking or questioning
the roots of what

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.920
is making that client go
through a difficult time?

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.990
What is causing psychosis?

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.300
What is causing trauma?

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.710
And so as a result, I think
it's really important for us

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:14.160
to look into all the
different ways oppression is

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.920
taking place in our societies.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.720
If the Buddha was alive
today, he would definitely

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.270
be doing a lot of
meditation and put

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.560
into a correctional facility--

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.300
[LAUGHING]

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.970
--because also what
we need to think about

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.310
is also what is normalcy.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.700
And what is normalcy in a world
which we are living today,

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.310
which is essentially
an industrial growth,

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.610
capitalist society
that we are living in?

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.820
And so what is normalcy?

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.130
I mean, because a
lot of things that we

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.760
see as normal are
actually quite extreme,

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.920
the ways in which
competition works,

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.040
the ways in which
politics works.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.170
It's really extreme.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.180
And so I feel it's
really important

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:06.070
to bring this piece of
different oppressions

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:11.410
into our conversation and really
ask ourselves, what am I doing?

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:16.590
Other than meditation, what am
I really doing in the world,

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.440
and doing for myself and others?

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.690
I might be a part of this
system of oppression.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:30.900
And so in that sense, meditation
is not a consumptive act.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:41.670
I feel that instead of calming
down and almost numbing down,

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:46.170
this practice of meditation has
made me more fiercely engaged.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.750
Instead of moving
into a retreat space,

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.315
it is moving me more and
more into a collective space.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:59.450
And I feel that if more and more
people are meditating this way,

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:04.750
I think a lot of these systems
of hierarchy and oppression

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:09.840
would disrupt and
dismantle in no time.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:16.620
Because meditation is not
an act of domestication.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:21.870
It is not exaggerated
politeness or obedience.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:25.470
Meditation is a subversive act.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.940
It is a revolutionary act.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:38.870
So I want to end with sharing
with you a few ways that

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.980
guide my life at this
point, after these 15 years.

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.590
I feel each one of
us is the custodian

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:55.340
of this wild and fierce love
for all of this existence.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.730
And we are fluid
space-time beings

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.760
interwoven through the
strands of our breath

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.940
through the juices
of our joys and tears

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:10.010
and our shared longing to care
for and heal our beloved Earth.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:17.870
Though we are conditioned to
act competitively, separate,

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.880
but at the same time,
if we can pierce

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.810
through that thin
membrane of delusion,

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.420
we expand into our
creative force,

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.810
into the vast
firmaments of wisdom,

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.570
into the stream of great
compassion within us.

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.460
This practice has brought
me more and more connected

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.290
to the Earth.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:45.070
I feel that instead
of transcending,

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:50.320
I feel more embodied in the
here and now than I was before.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:58.495
And also, I feel more
connected to the very core

00:34:58.495 --> 00:35:01.810
of our powerful Earth.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:06.220
And I also feel like
a lot of this practice

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.730
teaches me is that I am nature.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:14.230
And as I meditate, I
am returning to nature

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:19.030
what already belongs to nature
and that I have misappropriated

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:25.510
as I. And so this deeper
interconnectedness,

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:29.350
interwoveness, with the Earth
is becoming more and more

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.325
real in my life.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.110
I also have started noticing
all the different ways

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:46.260
in which this very wild,
primal energy inside us

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.060
was pushed down.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:53.760
I mean, I feel I was very
domesticated, very shut down.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.960
And this primal force inside
me was abandoned and ignored

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.150
and pushed away in some
corner of my psyche.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.860
And this practice of meditation
is bringing that energy alive.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.140
And that energy is
very deeply connected

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.740
to the energy of the Earth.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:16.650
So meditation does not have
to be an anesthetic act.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.725
It is ascetic act.

00:36:18.725 --> 00:36:20.070
[LAUGHING]

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.130
And I think I want to
leave you at the end

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.780
of this talk with one question.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.420
It's a line from the
poet Mary Oliver's poems.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.730
A lot of what I read
today, a lot of poems,

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.920
are coming from some beautiful
women writers and teachers.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.210
And when I was writing
this, I realized

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.820
that I'm somehow
tapping into the lineage

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.940
of these beautiful
women through history.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:52.530
So the line is,
"Tell me what you

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:59.940
plan to do with your one
wild and precious life."

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.490
Thank you so much.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:02.740
I appreciate you listening.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.610
We have a few minutes.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:14.260
So I'm happy if anyone
has any questions.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.830
AUDIENCE: So you said
that you were following

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.990
this plan, [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:24.180
And even though there was
this radio frequency constant,

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.560
you would push that back.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.570
What was it that motivated you?

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.580
Was it just a constant
thing, and you decided

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.790
that I need to do something?

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.769
Or was it something that
really shook you up,

00:37:32.769 --> 00:37:34.560
and that you decided
to take up meditation?

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.268
NIRALI SHAH: Hmm.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.700
From what I remember, it
was happening over time.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.150
So it wasn't like
one snap, like one

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:50.650
day even I realized that, OK,
I'm going to change things.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:53.920
But one thing that
I do realize is

00:37:53.920 --> 00:38:00.610
that at some level inside me, I
was asking this question around

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.760
is there any meaning,
or is there anything

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.950
sacred about life.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:10.240
Or was it just this mundane way
of living and getting things

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.840
done and getting a paycheck?

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.040
Is it all supposed to be
kind of flat like that?

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:23.800
And I personally
feel that there's

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:31.670
nothing more sad than
seeing life as meaningless

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.120
or not sacred.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.630
That would be a huge loss.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:39.030
And that didn't feel like
a way I wanted to live.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:43.440
And so I wanted to discover
if there is something.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.190
AUDIENCE: I think the
way you describe it,

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.648
I think I'm probably living a
really sad life because there

00:38:47.648 --> 00:38:49.860
are times when I
ask these questions.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.280
And there's also, I think--

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.970
at least I feel-- that there's
a pull that pulls you back.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.680
There is some excitement
about the mundane things

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.430
that we are doing.

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.520
But then why are you doing them?

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.610
You're enjoying them.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.730
But when you come back,
you realize oh, what

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.230
was the point of it all?

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:07.330
And so I was curious
because for me,

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.330
it's a constant back and forth.

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:11.760
Maybe I'm miserable both places.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.870
And maybe I'm enjoying
both the places.

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:16.900
So I was curious
that gradually, you

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.480
were able to go
further into meditation

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.160
and actually explore more.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.480
NIRALI SHAH: Yeah, and even
the mundane things, actually, I

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.980
can feel over the years,
they're becoming more radiant.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.480
They're shining with-- like the
simple act of making coffee,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.480
it feels like there's
something radiant and sacred

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.040
about that, and this act of
just watering the plants.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.340
And so there is some kind
of a deeper connection

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:51.100
or emotional connection
to mundane things.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.160
AUDIENCE: So meditation is--

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.930
all these things you talked
about are very positive things.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:02.200
But I've heard of
a lot of stories

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.630
about people who go
to these retreats,

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:09.940
and myself included, who have
a really hard time with it.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.090
And you don't often
hear about this.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.620
And so when that happened
to me, I was very surprised.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.580
And I was like,
what did I do wrong?

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.807
Why am I having a hard time?

00:40:22.807 --> 00:40:24.640
And I'm wondering, have
you ever experienced

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.660
something like that?

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.490
NIRALI SHAH: Oh,
yeah, I can deeply

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.980
resonate with some of
what you are saying.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.630
I don't know which
retreat you went to.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:37.780
But I can definitely
tell you that it is

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.840
a very, very skillful process.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.910
It's a very skillful practice.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:46.210
And over time, I
have seen that there

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:50.080
are times when I have driven
myself a bit too hard.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.180
And it has taken me some time
to recover and heal that.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.660
So absolutely.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.250
I think it really helps to have
a very skilled teacher, a very

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:07.540
experienced teacher, who you
can check in with very deeply

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:12.880
and who can understand you
very quickly also because there

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.410
isn't sometimes a lot of times
at these retreats to talk.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:22.060
But for me, it's also been--
if I could share one thing--

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.530
that as I meditated,
I started experiencing

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:31.340
some very beautiful
states of great beauty,

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:36.790
I mean, great expansion, a
great sense of connectedness,

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:43.780
of feeling really connected
to something much vaster.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.710
And a lot of times,
I would actually not

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:50.380
tell my teachers of this because
sometimes, some teachers, they

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.070
are not skilled, and
they don't have--

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.080
I mean, they can
reflect it back at you

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:01.640
in a way which might not
support you at that time.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.990
So it's very
important to go slow.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.740
And the last thing
also I can tell you

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:13.080
is that working with emotions
is not an easy practice.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.530
And any time you
meditate, you are

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.750
going to face strong emotions.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:21.130
And it's very important to
learn how you work with emotions

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:25.690
because if you go too much,
it can destabilize you.

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:28.960
And so there's a whole
somatic piece around this.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.480
And you don't want to get
overwhelmed, because if you do,

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.460
your nervous system
will go into a flight,

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.410
fight, or freeze response.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.540
And that can be hard.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.840
So for me, a lot
of my practices,

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.900
like really practicing delight.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.000
It's not all suffering
and hard work.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.860
A lot of this
meditation practice

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:52.960
is learning to take in
great, great delight.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:43:00.520
So much of the way we function,
when very difficult or painful

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.970
experiences come in, our
system is not ready to take it,

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:05.710
and we put it under the carpet.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:10.720
And at the same time, when very,
very pleasurable experiences

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.850
come, we do the same thing.

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:16.780
We put great pleasure
under the carpet,

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.440
because the mind, the
ego, wants to stay

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.980
in this lukewarm,
neutral territory.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:31.270
And it doesn't have the
capacity to take in.

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:36.130
And so over time, you start
building a greater capacity

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.870
to work with these emotions.

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:39.710
I don't know.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.050
Does that answer your question?

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:43.705
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:51.800
When you do overdo it, how
do you balance it back?

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.520
What's the best way
to balance yourself?

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.020
NIRALI SHAH: So I can
give you an example.

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.490
I was at a retreat.

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:04.330
And some deep
stuff, trauma stuff

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:08.470
came up for me from 15
years ago or something,

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:09.580
like really old stuff.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:14.030
And it was hard.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:17.050
And what I did is I
stopped meditating.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:17.860
I got up.

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.520
I went to my room.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.920
I took a nice shower.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.320
I wore some nice clothes.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.100
I went for a beautiful walk.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.220
I hung out with the deer.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.020
I looked at the flowers.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:34.270
I enjoyed a nice cup of tea,
really, really relaxing myself.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:37.540
And then after a few hours,
I went back on the cushion.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:41.170
And I had a lot more
capacity to be with that.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.390
And then again, I
would see, OK, this

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:45.020
is getting too intense for me.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.260
So now I'm going to take
in some more delight

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:52.630
because I don't want to
stretch my nervous system.

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:55.000
AUDIENCE: My question
is around meditation

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.440
as a personal practice
versus the rest of my life,

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:05.410
being connected to other
people like family and friends.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.800
So how do you
reconcile the rewiring

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.980
that's happening and you're
redefining your sense of self

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.920
and your priorities and
having all these paradigm

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:20.260
shifts with those that are
close to you who are not

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.760
on this journey
with you if you're

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.140
doing it as a personal thing?

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:28.160
Have you had
experiences where you

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.182
had to reconcile with
that in certain ways?

00:45:31.182 --> 00:45:33.140
How do you bring your
loved ones along with you

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.870
on the journey or whatever?

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.360
NIRALI SHAH: I can just
say to my own experience

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.830
is that at some point,
it was not easy.

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:46.850
At some point, at
the time, my parents

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:50.100
could not understand what
I'm doing with my life.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:55.190
And I feel like I had to just
go through that, at least

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:57.470
in my case, because I knew.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:00.350
I had a sense of
what I was doing.

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:02.360
It was not completely
clear at the time,

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.700
but there was still
a deep calling.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.040
And I knew that I had
to be true to that.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.730
And yeah, it was kind
of rocky at that time.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:18.270
And now, all these
years later, they

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:24.320
have deep respect and
love and gratitude for me

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.650
and for the path I have chosen.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.850
And they are
incredibly supportive.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:36.080
So I wish I could have taken
them with me at that time.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.080
But that was not happening.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.530
And I saw that also as
a part of my practice,

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:47.060
that how this is
shaping my truth

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.640
or my faith in this practice.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.960
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:56.630
You mentioned meditation
is a revolution.

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:01.310
Do you think there is
a way to get people

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.340
to be part of the revolution?

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:09.350
Or do you feel like we
should try to get people?

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.890
NIRALI SHAH: [LAUGHS] We should?

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:12.860
How do you mean that?

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.630
AUDIENCE: So should
we try to get people

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:16.040
to be part of the revolution?

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.360
Or should we let them be?

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.560
If they want to be
part of the revolution,

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.670
should we try to get them to?

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:34.110
So it's like should you
convince people to meditate,

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:35.340
to do like--

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.650
NIRALI SHAH: It's actually
a very meaningful question,

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:40.483
what are you asking.

00:47:40.483 --> 00:47:45.040
I can see the subtlety
in what you're asking.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.580
Because obviously,
you're not seeing

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.770
that we should try to
force people to meditate.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:50.330
I know you're not asking that.

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:52.160
So there's a nuance
to your question.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:03.010
I feel that there are two
ways in which meditation

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:05.120
seems to be happening.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:11.530
One is that it is my stress, my
problems, my anxiety, my life,

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:13.750
and I need to get
rid of all this

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.090
so that I can live
a better life.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:20.200
Maybe there's subconsciously
their ideas of I

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.440
could be higher or
superior or better

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.420
than others in the world.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.750
And that could be one
frame of how people

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.760
are approaching meditation.

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:36.940
And I think for me as a
teacher, it's important to offer

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:41.680
the second frame of how this
practice works because I

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.920
genuinely feel that this
practice cannot go too far

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:52.600
if it's just about "my," if
it's consumptive in nature.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:59.740
Because I feel that as we
practice more, these layers

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:05.260
or membranes of separation,
they start thinning out,

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:09.070
and we start experiencing
this powerful shared

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:12.250
humanity with each other.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.820
And for me, in that sense, this
practice is deeply relational.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.140
I offer retreats which are all
about relational mindfulness.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:25.030
And those are ways in which
we start becoming very, very

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:26.530
supportive to each other.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.830
So I think yeah, to
offer this other frame is

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.800
very important and meaningful.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:39.015
And then, of course,
it's their choice.

00:49:39.015 --> 00:49:40.380
Yeah.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.790
AUDIENCE: So most of the
tech world in Silicon Valley

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.720
is going like AI.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.250
And what you're talking
about is going--

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:49.000
more machine-like.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.810
And there'll be machine
inside of me, outside of me.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:54.070
And maybe I'll be a machine.

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:54.611
I don't know.

00:49:54.611 --> 00:49:56.290
A lot of stuff
going on like that,

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:59.320
and that's the quote-unquote
"future" that people

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.430
are really proud of.

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:06.550
And you talked about going back
to the wild and nature and back

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.800
to the Earth.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.720
How do you reconcile
those two things?

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.590
Because most of our society
is getting more and more

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:16.470
techno-enabled.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:19.420
NIRALI SHAH: I cannot
reconcile the two personally.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:22.397
And I say that standing
here at Google.

00:50:22.397 --> 00:50:23.680
[LAUGHS]

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.750
I personally feel-- at
least that's my sense--

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:31.570
is that over time,
as we are becoming

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:38.320
more AI and more
machine oriented,

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.590
I feel that there will be
communities and people who

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.570
will make a choice.

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.590
And there would be some
who would move more

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:50.920
towards the Earth and
some who would move more

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.870
towards machines.

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:54.460
I don't think machines are bad.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.080
I don't think technology is bad.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.460
It can be very helpful.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.230
I use a lot of technology.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:04.120
And there is a lot to be said
around appropriate technology.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:11.170
But I feel that technology
which can bring a lot of feeling

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:15.210
and emotion is very important.

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:20.110
So to answer your question, I
cannot fully reconcile the two

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:23.640
because I think the aspect
around feeling, energy,

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:29.450
emotion is very
real to my practice.

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:31.860
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
for someone starting out

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:35.670
in meditation practice
how you would recommend

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:39.180
starting, if you weren't to
just drop your career and life

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:40.945
and move off to an ashram.

00:51:40.945 --> 00:51:42.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:46.710
NIRALI SHAH: Yeah, I don't think
it's important to drop your--

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:49.710
I think it's completely,
perfectly possible

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:52.060
and great to--

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:55.680
maybe that's authentic
to your experience

00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:00.390
right now is to have a stable
job, have a stable family.

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:03.660
And that stability can be very
helpful to the practice too.

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:06.270
So it's very personal.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:07.920
How to start?

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.010
There are a few ways.

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:13.890
There's Insight Meditation
Center in Redwood City.

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:18.000
Gil Fronsdal is a
wonderful teacher.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.280
So they have regular sits.

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.182
Monday nights is a
good place to start,

00:52:23.182 --> 00:52:26.910
where there would be
sit and a Dharma talk.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:32.580
And I think there is SIY
here, Search Inside Yourself,

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:33.780
at Google.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.990
And they also offer
the introduction

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:40.540
to mindfulness
meditation practice.

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:44.190
And then if you
feel so inclined,

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:46.620
there are these ten-day
meditation retreats

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.990
by SN Goenka.

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:54.110
I personally recommend
Spirit Rock as well,

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.440
which is in Marin.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.000
And they have a lot of retreats.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.660
I would check out some
of those websites.

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:05.970
I want to really thank you for
your time and for being here.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:09.480
And it's really
very special to be

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:14.010
able to sit together
in this context

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:17.552
and share our lives
with each other.

00:53:17.552 --> 00:53:19.260
So thank you so much
for listening to me.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:20.238
Take care.

00:53:20.238 --> 00:53:22.194
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:29.950
SPEAKER: Thank you,
