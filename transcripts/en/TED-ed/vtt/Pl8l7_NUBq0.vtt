00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:07.402
So, I think in the future,

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:10.754
there's going to be a faster and faster

00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:12.653
pace of technology

00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:14.815
and how humans interact with technology

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.928
will really be a crucial thing.

00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:18.853
I think there's a certain rate

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:22.115
at which us humans can adapt to technology,

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:24.615
and there might be a niche for somebody

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:26.435
who can help us transition

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:28.272
to the different changes in technology,

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:32.248
so more like a personalized technologist,

00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:34.753
you know, assistant,

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:36.694
that can help us transition

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.461
from one technology to the other

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:41.183
as we pursue our own individual lifestyles.
