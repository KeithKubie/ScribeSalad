My name is Georgette
Dorn and I'm the Head

Library of Congress and I can say

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.310
that this library is
the home of Borges.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.610
He always said when he came to
visit us many times in the 60s,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.400
70s and 80s, "Esta es mi
casa" This is my home.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.850
So, it's a great pleasure to
welcome here his wonderful widow

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.690

Maria Kodama is the
collaborator wife

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.530
and soul of Borges in many ways.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.840 position:56%
She was the writer's collaborator of
many years and she's the [inaudible]

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.240
of the state of Borges, one would
say the guardian of the state.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.190
She was a professor of literature
at the University of Buenos Aires

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.510
and the translator of Borges,
"El libro de la almohada".

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.240

Thank you -- and the ambassador.

[ Applauses ]

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.360
&gt;&gt; Martin Lousteau:
Thank you Georgette

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.710
and good evening everyone
and welcome.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.180
Usually when ambassadors
are asked to speak

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.380
about a great fellow countryman,
we are given written pieces

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.910
that tell their deeds, their
personal characteristics

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.130
and sometimes our own
experiences regarding this people.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.140
I've done that in -- regarding
Borges in a recent seminar

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.850
that George W University organized.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.540 position:56%
And I'm very glad that I'm not going

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.010
to embarrass myself
by doing that tonight.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.390
The reason being that
today among us we have --

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.160
for this commemoration and homage
to one of the greatest writers

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.170
in world literature, we have the
person who knew Borges the most

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.260
and who knows his work the most.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.990
We are really honored and
I'm really pleased to be able

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.970
to introduce a writer,
translator, literature professor,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.920
the creator of the Jorge
Luis Borges foundation

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.590
and besides all that,
the writer's widow.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.160
So, Maria Kodama, welcome, thank
you very much for being here.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.280
Maria has dedicated her whole
life to spread Borges' legacy

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.670
around the world so I think that
the best thing that I can do is

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.540
to begin this presentation
by quoting Maria herself.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.770
When asked last month why Borges'
work was becoming increasingly

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.020
relevant, she replied, "Because
his work not only tells a story,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.940
but also underlies within
philosophy, religion

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.380 position:56%
and scientific curiosities and the
proof of this is that after he left,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.280
the fields of mathematics,
philosophy,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.310
neurosciences also became
interested in his work.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.600
This also happened to Jules Verne.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.660
In each century a person is
born, neither better nor worse

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.820
but who possesses the potential
to see what we don't see.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.370
And that person plants the
seed of fantastic literature

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.190
which is a reality today
as is space travel.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.960
Borges certainly saw what
other people could not

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.290
and he generously shared his
magical worlds letting us navigate

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.270
new dimensions."

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.250
This is true to such an extent
that critics were forced

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:17.260
to create a new word, a new logism,
"Borgesium", to capture the --

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.660
I wouldn't say words, but
the magical state of mind

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.000
that Borges invented and gave us.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.410
Maria with her tireless work not
only helps make this magic world

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.080 position:56%
remain alive but also for this world

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.010
to gain an ever increasing
number of followers.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.210
Recently Maria published,
"Homenaje a Borges" The book

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.220
that I think Saul has in his hand,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.830
where she compiled 20 lectures
she has given at universities

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.880
and institutions worldwide
during the last 30 years.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.680
This is a clear example of Maria's
work, also as Georgette said,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.480
we are really honored to be
celebrating this here today.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.440
Not only because Borges
claimed this to be his home,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.390
but also because it is a library,
and libraries are important,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.430
not only in Borges' life
but also in his work.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.710
And his stayed here at the US.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.360
The Library of Congress has
collaborated with the embassy

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.710
to present you this amazing array
of first edition books by Borges',

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.800
a documentary and some audios of
the Argentine writer that are part

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.010
of the library's collection.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.410
Now, as I said before, I'm so glad
I'm not going to speak anymore

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.010 position:56%
and to speak about Jorge Luis Borges
I give the floor to the person

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.190
who knew him the best and
who might really thank

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.760
for coming here as
our especial guest.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.690
Maria, thank you very much
for being here, it is an honor

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.500
and Saul, the floor is all yours.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.510
Thank you very much and enjoy.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:10.430
[ Applauses ]

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.450
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowki: Thank you Mr.
Ambassador, thank you Georgette.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.350
This is home for many of
us so it's good to be back.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.940
Before we start let me introduce
Melissa Gonzales Contreras

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.850
who is a PhD student at
the University of Maryland

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.950
and she will be summarizing
the comments

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:33.180
that Maria Kodama will
make, in response to some

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.570 position:56%
of the questions that I've prepared.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.120
Empiezo, ¿qué era
para nosotros el arte?

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.150 position:56%
El texto que cierra tu homenaje a
Borges quizá me sirva para trazar un

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.740
itinerario, teniéndolo
siempre presente,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.370
¿cuál es la primera imagen que
se te aparece al decir, "Borges"?

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.690
I'll translate.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.890
In this book that the
ambassador mentioned,

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.490
"Homenaje a Borges"
Maria Kodama has a text

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.370
that is called, "What
was art for us?"

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.740
And that's the final
text that closes the book

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.490
that I think might
serves us as an itinerary

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.260
for tonight's conversation.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:24.600
So, having Borges always in
mind, present, the question is,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.980
"What is the first image that
comes to mind to Maria Kodama just

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.210
by simply saying Borges?"

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.300
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: I don't know.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:41.700
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
Será que lo prendemos.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.000
Permiso.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.740
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Excuse I
understand English [inaudible]

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:57.370
but I don't speak it properly,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:03.420
the next one I'm going
to answer in Spanish.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:10.110
And you can ask me in English OK?

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.900 position:56%
[Inaudible] realmente es como decían
en España [inaudible] es decir,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:27.380
la primera aproximación que yo tuve
a Borges sin saber que era Borges,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:37.150 position:56%
fue una lectura que le hizo una
profesora que debía enseñarle inglés

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:46.340
y evidentemente no le enseñó pero
yo me divertía muchísimo con ella

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:57.990 position:56%
porque me hacía un resumen de lo que
ella estaba leyendo que eran textos

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.050
para adultos por supuesto.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.430
Y decía en español [inaudible] y
seguía ella con su lectura y lo más

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.730
interesante que una vez me leyó
[inaudible] Borges [Inaudible] era

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.070
una mujer de la que él había
estado enamorado [inaudible].

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.370
Y para una creatura de
cinco años, [inaudible];

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.010
me llenó porque decía él que ella
-- él le ofrecía a ella su fracaso,

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.300
su soledad [inaudible]
el hambre de mi corazón.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:18.900
Para una creatura de cinco años
el hambre del corazón era lo que

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.200
es [inaudible].

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.960
Yo tenía cinco años y
bueno, era realista.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.520
Entonces ella le contestó que
el hambre del corazón era amor y

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.820
que [inaudible].

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.060
Y esa esa fue la primera vez, la
segunda vez cuando [inaudible],

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:45.570
yo tendría 10 años y cayó
en mis manos una revista.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.680
Esa revista seguramente
era [inaudible].

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.920
Entonces yo empecé a leer,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:58.800
"Nadie los vio desembarcar
en la unánime noche",

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.510
y yo dije, ¿qué es esto?

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:08.800
Lo he leído hasta el final
sin entender una palabra,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:20.630
pero hasta el día de hoy si
tuviéramos que quemar la obra de

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.500
todos los escritores
salvando solo una,

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.360
esa es la única que yo salvaría.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.170
Y es muy interesante porque muchos
[inaudible] de los años [inaudible]

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:43.360
que publicaron y me dieron
para que yo hiciera el prólogo,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:51.590
un libro de entrevistas que
[inaudible] Campo había hecho a

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.890
Borges [inaudible] fotografías.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:12:00.300 position:56%
Entonces llegó el momento en el que
yo [inaudible] atentamente tenía que

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:07.090
hacer el prólogo y en un
momento ella le dice, "Borges,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:16.370 position:56%
acá hay una casa que tiene un jardín
a la izquierda y una escalera a la

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:21.490
derecha", y Borges
contestó, "Si es esa,

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:27.790
es la casa de la calle [inaudible]
donde yo en una semana escribí

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.710
"Las ruinas circulares".

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:35.200 position:56%
Durante esa semana yo trabajaba con
[inaudible] pero lo único que quería

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.830
era [inaudible] esa casa para
escribir ese cuento porque nunca,

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:45.650 position:56%
ni antes ni después pude escribir un
cuento con la intensidad con que yo

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:46.950
escribí ese cuento.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.040
Es decir que esa intensidad
[inaudible] chica de 10 años que no

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.110 position:56%
entendió nada, pero que hasta el día
de hoy quedó atrapada con ese cuento

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.410
y que sería el único que
yo salvaría [inaudible].

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.290
Y es un fascinante, es fascinante
y lamenté tanto que Borges ya no

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.060
estuviera porque a él le hubiera
encantado porque yo le decía,

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.740
¿Qué le gusto de ese cuento?,
No sé, una intensidad una cosa,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.040
pero él nunca me dijo eso.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.710 position:56%
Pero se lo dijo en esa entrevista
Victorio Campo cuando Victorio Campo

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.010
le describía la foto.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.310
[inaudible] es fascinante.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.610
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: ¿Y esa es
la primera imagen que te viene a

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.910
la mente?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.210
¿Es ese cuento?

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.510
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Es ese cuento, sí.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.810
Es ese cuento.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.600
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Yes, good luck.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.090
[ Laughter ]

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.990
This is just going
to be a summary, OK?

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:28.940
&gt;&gt; Melissa: OK, the first memory
is not really an image but it's a,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.740
"de oídas", yes, [inaudible].

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:38.540
The first time was a teacher
who taught her to speak English,

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.430
the teacher would read the
- whatever she was reading

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:47.820
at that time to her and one day
she read two poems by Borges and --

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.720
that was dedicated
to a man and a woman.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.870
She was five years old by the time.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.710
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Not
the woman but the --

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.550
&gt;&gt; Melissa: No, no.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:05.030
In the poems Borges offered
his solitude to this woman

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.750
and his hunger of heart,
"hambre de corazón".

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:14.400
So, Mrs. Kodama being a 5
year-old girl felt intrigued

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.730
by this description and asked what
it meant, her teacher responded,

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.710
"That's love, one day
you'll understand".

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:28.270
The second time was when she was
10 years old reading, revista Azul,

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:33.280
she read a text by Borges
and according to her,

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:39.290 position:56%
she didn't understand it either and
in an interview with Victorio Campo,

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:45.160
Borges mentioned a where he
wrote, "Las Ruinas Circulares",

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.150
and he mentioned that he just
wanted to return to that house

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.340
because that house
allowed him to write

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.330
with intensity that short story.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:03.590
And this is what captured Mrs.
Kodama from Borges, his intensity.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.890
&gt;&gt; Good job.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.190
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Thank you.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:13.090
Indeed. So, well, all right.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:18.640
The several stories in which Borges
since you said that -- can I --

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.530
¿Te lo pregunto en
Inglés o en castellano?

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.900
¿De una vez?

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.200
¿Sí?

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.500
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Si
no entiendo te digo.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.800
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Bueno.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.070 position:56%
In a number of stories, there is a
certain motive that comes up that --

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.390
and he also does it
in Tadeo Isidor Cruz,

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.740
La biografía de Tadeo Isidor
Cruz; that there is a moment

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.290
in a man's life I imagine
in woman's life too

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.900
that one will forever
know who he or she is.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.510
So, the question is, what do you
think was that moment for Borges?

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:54.310
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Well, I cannot say
what was that moment for Borges,

00:15:54.310 --> 00:16:08.500
but I can say what was that the
moment for Borges life for mine.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.860
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Good,
that was the second question.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:22.770
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: [Inaudible]
and then once we had to go

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:35.100 position:56%
to Santiago de Chile to receive the
Doctorado Honoris Causa [inaudible].

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:40.700
Then [inaudible] and I said Borges
[inaudible] and he said, "Oh,

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:46.650
no nos hagamos ilusiones",
and he [inaudible] to speak

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:57.060
to the person [inaudible] when
he was talking to someone,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:07.320
then I suddenly he gave me
[inaudible] he was in silence

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:14.830
and then he said, "thank
you, I appreciate [inaudible]

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.610
but there are two things that
[inaudible] cannot stand,

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.080
sobornar o dejarse sobornar.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.620
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: To bribe or
to allow yourself to be bribed.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.410
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Then after
[inaudible] my duty is,

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:39.890
and I'm going to go to Chile, and
then I said to Borges [inaudible]

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.350
and he said, "¿Usted diría eso?

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.650
[Inaudible] no."

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:58.090
Then he took me in his arms
and said OK, is better this way

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.080
because I became the icon of
the Nobel prize [inaudible]

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.840
who could never [inaudible].

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.720
In this way, no.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.510
So, so beautifully,
because you know,

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:24.030 position:56%
nothing can change his
principles, nothing can change that.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.790
And I admire that.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.090
[Inaudible].

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.390
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Thank you.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:38.140
You got an excellent
English teacher by the way.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.440
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: No, no.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.550
Did you understand?

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.850
Yes? [Crosstalk].

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:52.590
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: I
remember one time he also said

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.260
that he's been a candidate
for so long

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.860
that people probably forgot
the he already got it.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.380
That's why he's no
longer a candidate.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.680
And --

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.290
In this same book, there is a text

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.440
that is called, "¿Qué
es el tiempo?"

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.620
And you begin with a quote
from Saint Agustin that says,

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.390
"¿Qué es pues el tiempo?

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.060
Si nadie me lo pide, lo sé.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.660
Si quiero explicárselo a
quién me lo pide, no lo sé.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.330
What is time?

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:33.780
If nobody will ask me what
it is, I know what it is.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.390
But if somebody is going
to ask me to explain it,

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.680
I do not know what time is."

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.980
The question would then be,
"What was the time with Borges?

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.430
And what has it been
for you since 1986?

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.730
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: As with Borges?

00:19:50.730 --> 00:20:00.510
From 1986 and continue, because --

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:12.080
[ Inaudible ]

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:20.110
And for me on working with
[inaudible] and more physically

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:26.230
with you, but there is [inaudible].

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.850
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: That's
what you always say.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.150
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Yeah, that's it.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.900
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: In one of
those essays you also wrote,

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.990
"Creo que nadie puede ser mero
espectador de un proceso de

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:46.870
creación, sobre todo de alguien que
como Borges emanaba una fuerza tan

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.880
especial para la que uno
se sentía arrastrada."

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.870
And in one of these
essays Maria Kodama says

00:20:54.870 --> 00:21:00.340
that nobody can be just a
spectator in the creative process,

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:06.430 position:56%
particularly in Borges' case because
there was such a strong power

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.530
that was emanating
from it that one felt

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.830
that was being carried away by it.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.180
My question is, "Is there some
sort of text that you remember

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.620
in particular that carried
you away more than others,

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.540
besides the Circle of Ruines.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.840
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Why?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:32.430
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Besides the
circle of Circle of Ruines.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.020
Let me remember.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.320
Maybe La Biblioteca [inaudible].

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.440
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Maybe
the [inaudible] again.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.690
Bueno la Biblioteca de Babel,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:54.280
supongo que es por esa idea
[inaudible] de que todas las cosas

00:21:54.280 --> 00:22:01.310
de alguna manera vuelven.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:09.770
De en realidad nadie entiende
lo que está sucediendo.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:13.170
[Inaudible], que es un
poco [inaudible] ¿no?

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:17.100
Así que sería así Biblioteca
de Babel, la circularidad,

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.950
la imposibilidad de la
comprensión y [inaudible].

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.280
Que no sabía [inaudible]
¿qué tiene?

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.580
[Inaudible] ¿Quién está?

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:43.320 position:56%
Digamos ordenándose [inaudible]
entonces muy interesante [inaudible]

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:58.900
de la comprensión de [inaudible]
pensaba que sabe que iba a morir y

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.270
de pronto comprender
que no importa eso,

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:15.720
él está más allá de todo eso y es
como si él es mismo esa eternidad

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.390
[inaudible] y eso se lo
rebela la figura del tigre,

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:26.700
el tigre que está dando vueltas
alrededor de [inaudible].

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:39.220
Entonces esa referencia [inaudible]
comprender eso le fascina a él.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:45.840
Nosotros tuvimos una experiencia
muy especial en el desierto.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.860
[Inaudible].

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:55.000
[inaudible] nunca tuve
vacaciones, y según mis amigos,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.710
esas eran vacaciones masoquitas.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:07.050 position:56%
Yo soy muy amiga de [inaudible] él
me ayudó a que yo fuera en una carpa

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:18.780
con los familiares de su secretario
y yo recuerdo que comía arena y

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.790
todo, no me importa, al
desierto con una carpa.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:28.190
Y una [inaudible] yo recuerdo
y no puedo explicar cómo pero

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.270
intelectualmente sabe, uno,
no es nada, no es cierto?

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:40.050
[inaudible] emocionalmente
también, sabe que uno no es anda,

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:44.700
pero en ese momento, en ese lugar,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:25:00.330
sentí el otro punto que yo
no sabía que existía en mí,

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.170
que "no soy nada".

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:20.260 position:56%
Y eso para mí fue una revelación que
cambió la manera de ver muchísimas

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:25.440
cosas de mi propia
vida, [inaudible].

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Estos botoncitos.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.040
Ahí vamos.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.950
&gt;&gt; Melissa: The two types
that she refered to is,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.750
"La Biblioteca de Babel" And,

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:43.050
"El immortal" From la Biblioteca
de Babel, she likes the idea of --

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:47.660
that everything -- I'm sorry.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.140
That no one understands what
happens, the circularity.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:59.710
That they don't know who is
in charge of the library.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:09.790
And from, "El Immortal" The idea
of comprehension at the present

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:17.530
that he knows that he will die
and that it doesn't matter.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:29.400
And the idea of the eternity
and it's the figure of the tiger

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.110
that reveals this idea to him.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.700
So, that the wisdom
in comprehending this,

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.200
and she has this fascination
with the desert.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.630
In one trip to the desert
she realized she had

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.770
that same realization, that she
came to realize that she does --

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.140
she is no one, sorry,
I want to say that.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.900
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Esto lo
vamos a dejar prendido porque --

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.930
[inaudible] of course is
in, "Las Ruinas Circulares"

00:26:55.930 --> 00:27:00.050
And therefore we can sort of
blend in with "El Inmortal".

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.350
But then he was dying.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.390
Let me ask you something else.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:09.030
He probably dictated
a lot of text to you.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:16.060
The question is did he
tell you in advance,

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:25.980
"I'm going to dictate a poem, a
short story, I'm going to do this

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:34.950
or that", can you tell us a little
bit how he arrived from the moment

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:41.830
that he began to dictate to the
final version, knowing free will

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:47.290
that it was not the final version
because he always corrected.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:53.220
The next one, the next
one and so on.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.440
So, how did he start?

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.740
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: [inaudible]
he starts from [inaudible]

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:09.710
and then he think in the morning if
that is going to be useful or not,

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:15.540
if it's not going to be useful,
OK [inaudible] and if it is going

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.580
to be useful [inaudible] a poem
or a [inaudible] in his mind,

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:27.400
he begun to dictate or the poem
or the [inaudible] interesting

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:36.480 position:56%
because in the foundation I have a
photo I think is the [inaudible] I'm

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.720
not sure [inaudible] Borges
is with the head like this,

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:51.790
and he's [inaudible] and that's
the way he begun to dictate.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:29:02.590
It was like being blind,
is not sufficient for him

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:09.860
to go inside himself and go out
with a poem, with the [inaudible].

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:18.150
For me that's the image of
the beginning of the creation,

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.430
that's why I have a
photo [inaudible].

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.930
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: I
saw it, is spectacular.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:28.310
You mentioned that there was only
one poem that he never touched

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:32.520
because Kafka dictated
that poem to him.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.820
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Yes, yes.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.120
It was very, very funny
because he was always correcting

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.420
and correcting, all the
[inaudible] and then I was amazed

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.720
because a one poem he never
corrected [inaudible] and he said,

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.020
[inaudible] "No I can't, I have
to wait [inaudible] and then,

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.320
when Kafka corrects the
poem I'm going to correct,

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.620
it's not my poem, it's
Kafka's poem."

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.920
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: That's funny
because at one point he talks about

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.220
"Una letrina llamada Kafka"
Although he spells it differently.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.520
Borges used to talk
about the music in poems,

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.820
the sense and sounds of poetry.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.120
What kind of music did
you listen with him?

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.420
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Well, [inaudible]

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.720
because Borges said he was
[inaudible] sordo musical.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.020
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
A musical deafness?

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.070
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Deafness,
yes musical deafness.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.780
But it's strange because he like
for example [inaudible] and also

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.610
for example [inaudible] cannot
here the music [inaudible].

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:09.140 position:56%
And also he loved for example tangos
de la guardia vieja, because he said

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:16.420
that that kind of tangos are
[inaudible] essence of tangos.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:22.410
[Inaudible] he doesn't love Gardel,
because he said that Gardel did

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.310
with the tango something
sentimental [inaudible].

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:30.100
[Inaudible] and he doesn't like
[inaudible] also the Milonga

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.820
because that reminded
him [inaudible]-

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.200
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
He wrote quite a few.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Yes, yes of course.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.060
He wrote [inaudible] you know it?

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.010
[Inaudible], tangos y
milongas, [inaudible] de tango

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:47.240
of the guardia vieja, [inaudible]
when he was a little boy.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.540
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: First stage.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:56.880
How was the Buenos Aires
that you shared with him?

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.880
What kind of Buenos Aires did
you work [inaudible] with him?

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.180
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: [Inaudible]

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.150
and usually the [inaudible] very
much [inaudible] because he said

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:08.980
that was the savage's [inaudible],

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.720
and then [inaudible]
basement and [inaudible].

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.780
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
¿El viejo Palermo?

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.390
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Yes,
yes, el viejo Palermo.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:23.670
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: You
travelled a lot with him.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.400
One of the results is, "The Atlas".

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:32.640
Can you tell us a little
bit about that?

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.670
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: [Inaudible]
-- very interesting.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:42.380
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Don't
tell the funny stories yet,

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.610
I have them for later.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.910
Please wait.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:50.210
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: No, we
enjoyed, we did a lot of travels,

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.680
[inaudible] the states
that [inaudible].

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.900
In Argentina because [inaudible] we
travelled a lot inside the states.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:03.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: He also said
Americans are sort of strange people

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:09.410
who say, "hi", to each other.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.840
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: [Inaudible] and
that's for him [inaudible] I mean,

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.470
it can [inaudible] that's.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.640
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Let's go
to one of the fun stories.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:25.300
I've heard it but I think it's
worth for the people to hear it.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:36.060
And -- there was a time when you
created names for each other.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:38.670
You were Rica y Javier
Ottawa [phonetic].

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.840
How did those names come about?

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.070
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: It was [Inaudible]
from [inaudible] and a short story

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.190 position:56%
that was [inaudible] present for me.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.930
[Inaudible] and that's
why I would [inaudible].

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:55.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: So, you came up
with those two names for yourselves?

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.340
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Yes,
sometimes [inaudible] different

00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.640
names [inaudible].

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.940
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: For example?

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:10.630
Those are the two published, tell
us something that is not published.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:11.930
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: No, no, no.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:16.010
I don't know if I [inaudible].

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:26.450
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: We will
not repeat it, go ahead.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:31.050
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: [Inaudible] for
example, one of the names was,

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:39.560
once an English journalist
[inaudible] I would call him

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.860
Fernando Pérez.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:49.070
And then sometimes, he send
someone to ask to me [inaudible]

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:56.150
because he was tired, that
means we had to run out,

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:04.240
because he thought he was tired.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:11.710
And then he said [inaudible],
"no no no,

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:19.920
I called you because [inaudible]"
say that when he saw us coming

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:30.020 position:56%
into the room, immediately he
thought we were [inaudible] in honor

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.750
to that journalist [inaudible].

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:35.630
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: OK,
not to be repeated.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Not to be repeated.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.890
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
Borges said to you once,

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:46.870
"Su padre la educó para mi"
Your father educated you for me.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:54.270
And I was thinking of that
in the context of the trip

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:59.240 position:56%
that you did with a hot air balloon.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.680
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Ah
yes, that's wonderful.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:07.520
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Can you
tell us about that trip?

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.170
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Yes, I was
[inaudible] looking something

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:18.560
for a friend of mine who
asked me if I can [inaudible].

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:24.050 position:56%
Then suddenly I saw the balloons,
[inaudible] immediately will happen,

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:31.730
don't fill these papers, we have to
go [inaudible] trip in the balloon.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:38.530
At one moment [inaudible]
impossible to make the trip

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:42.060
because [inaudible] married
[inaudible] for the wedding

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:50.990
and then we talked to another
one and [inaudible] and we went.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:57.470
But we had to go very
very early in the morning,

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:03.940
because of course air balloon
is on fire, and then all night,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.490
he had the the canastita,
[inaudible] the basket is going

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:14.940 position:56%
to be in [inaudible] or in plástico,
and I said, "Borges, I don't know"

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.850
and he said anyway is canasta, no?

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:24.330
Plástico o [inaudible] and when
we arrived, the man said to us,

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:30.760
of course [inaudible]
the balloon and then,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:38.740 position:56%
when the balloon descends we have
to una caja [inaudible] and we land.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:46.540
And one bottle to drink
for the safety trip.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:55.530
And then it was very funnybecause
the man said [inaudible] he can't

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:59.370
here because [inaudible]
the balloon, [inaudible]

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:02.320
but it's dangerous [inaudible] .

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:10.320
When I was young, I
montar a caballo, montar -

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.170
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
You still ride a horse

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:19.610
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Yes, ride
the horse, it's not easy --

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:26.390
it's not difficult,
[inaudible] you can hit me

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:32.790
and he said [inaudible] listen, we
[inaudible] no matter what you say,

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:41.640
he's going to [inaudible] you take
care of him and the other person

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:51.770
who is going with us also and
[inaudible] for me, to me.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:57.190
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: But not for
Borges, you didn't sign for him?

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:02.240
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: No no,
I signed for myself,

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:10.150
the reason [inaudible] OK you
take care of him, I sign for you,

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:26.750
that myself I am going to try
to do the things by myself,

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:46.150
that you are not responsible
if something happens to me,

00:38:46.150 --> 00:39:14.750
because you have to take
care of him, not of me.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:40:10.560
[Inaudible].

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.100
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: How
long was [inaudible].

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:22.480
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: I can't remember,
maybe [inaudible] I can't remember.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.420
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: That's
a good age [inaudible].

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:34.320
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: He enjoyed a lot,
and then we go out with the balloon

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:43.580 position:56%
and he was so happy, very very happy
[inaudible] amazing, amazing, yes,

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:54.020
he said, "but this sir

when he can embrace

between the patas [inaudible]
and ther name was Rosy.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.420
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: I
hadn't heard that one.

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.830
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: I'm going
to show you the photo.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.880
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
Great, the foundation?

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:26.120
Good. What are the words that
you associate with Borges?

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.770
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: The
words that I associate --

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.190
[inaudible] No matter what.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.490
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Everything.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:36.510
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: OK,
[inaudible] freedom, happiness --

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.860
Loyalty.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.460
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
What was the first one?

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.640
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: I can't remember,
you don't remember -- [crosstalk].

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: You said freedom?

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.680
Happiness?

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.160
And loyalty.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.820
In that order?

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:11.090
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Yes, I suppose
[inaudible], I'm not sure.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:22.480
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Tell us
about the trip to the pyramids.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.980
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: The trip to the
pyramids [inaudible] silbó and then

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:34.620
from las piramides salieron unos
[inaudible] y entonces yo le dije,

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:41.260
bueno, mis amigos tienen razón,
esta gente no parece muy confiable,

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:50.420
a uno le falta una oreja
[inaudible] no, no es maravilloso,

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:56.330
la venida aquí esto es maravilloso.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:43:04.870 position:56%
Entonces el [inaudible], el chofer
dijo "bueno, llamadlos [inaudible]",

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:10.790
Borges se sienta, se agarra del
cuello de ellos y ellos empiezan

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:12.090
a correr.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:18.760
Entonces yo pensaba que adentro de
las pirámides [inaudible] y yo le

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.880
decía, "Borges, [inaudible]
Borges, cuidado con la cabeza,

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:32.770 position:56%
cuidado con la cabeza" Y los
egipcios decían, "Cabiza [phonetic],

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:38.870 position:56%
cabiza" y reían como locos sujetando
[inaudible] me mira y me dice,

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:42.000
"Maria, no digas cabeza, cabeza,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:51.010 position:56%
debe ser una palabra obscena por la
forma en que ellos [inaudible] yo la

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:56.780
repito enseguida, no digas
cabeza" Entonces ellos decían

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.610
"Cabiza" entonces yo decía,

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:10.880
quién sabe lo que quiere decir en
árabe y ellos entienden en lugar de

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.180
cabeza, "cabiza" [inaudible].

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:18.430
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: ¿Hay alguien
que sepa árabe y sepa lo que

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.340
dice Cabiza?

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.890
No, habrá que buscarlo.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:28.930
&gt;&gt; Melissa: I'm going to
see if I start to check

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:31.880
in the word that she said.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.640
There were homeless people
that came out of the pyramid,

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.150
one was missing an
ear and then the --

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:46.560
they carried Borges into the
pyramid, but they were running

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.410
and Mrs. Kodama was afraid that
once they entered the pyramids,

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:54.060
and since it was dark he
was going to get hurt.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.710
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: As he was
being carried along by them.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.010
&gt;&gt; Melissa: Yes, yes.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:03.090
And she kept repeating, "La
cabeza, la cabeza, you head."

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.640
And the men that were
carrying Borges laughed

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.080
and repeated, "Cabiza, cabiza."

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.330
And so, Borges asked
her not to say cabeza

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.910
because he thought it
meant something in Arabic

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:22.060
and they were pronouncing, "Cabiza"
and it was probably and insult.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.360
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: An obscene word.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.660
&gt;&gt; Melissa: An obscene word, yes.

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.340
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: I've
got a couple more questions

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.460
and then we open it to the public.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:40.900 position:56%
One of them is, he knew a lot of
languages, some of them self-taught.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:47.370
Someone asked me, did he
ever learn in braille?

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:48.670
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: No [crosstalk].

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:49.970
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Why?

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:51.270
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Because
[inaudible].

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:57.200
Because [inaudible] his mother
[inaudible] and then he said,

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.460
"é les perezoso", entonces --

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.400
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
Which is obviously one

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.050
of the things he has [inaudible].

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:15.940
You put together a collection
books, like a library.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.150
You and Borges.

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.880
The collection of select
books, I wonder how you went

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.880
up on selecting the books that
you published in that library.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.580
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: The books
that he loved, [inaudible] --

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.410
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Just
the ones that he loved.

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:39.850
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Yes, just
the books that he loved.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:41.510
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: And
the question that --

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:46.160
and with this I'll stop -- maybe.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.440
Can you imagine yourself
doing anything else

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.860
in your life had you not met
Borges, what would you have done?

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.580
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: It's
really interesting

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.480
because [inaudible] my
professor [inaudible]

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:09.550 position:56%
at that moment [inaudible] said
[inaudible] extend el ligamento y no

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:13.530
puedo caminar bien,
pero adoro bailar.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.830
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: She likes

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:19.360
to dance except there
is a little problem.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.000
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Ligamento,
OK, y luego Borges said,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.130
"en mi familia no ha habido
[inaudible]" pero, me dice,

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:27.050
"Si usted quiere, puede hacerlo."

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:32.110
Ahora yo le voy a explicar
algo, siempre lo explico.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.770
[Inaudible] entonces me dijo,

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:39.120
"Si usted va a la calle [inaudible]
después no puede entra por

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:47.880
[inaudible] se va a sentir muy mal,
en cambio, [inaudible], estudiar,

00:47:47.880 --> 00:48:02.720 position:56%
usted aprende fácilmente, lo que uno
le va a enseñar y eso no tiene fin,

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:08.170
no me dijo que podía.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.340
[Inaudible] lo mismo no?

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.740
Entonces me dijo las
cosas por la mitad,

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:23.010
entonces decidí no entrar en
Colón sino seguir estudiando.

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.310
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Le hiciste caso.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:32.450
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Sí, no me
di cuenta que le hacía caso,

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:36.830
yo creía que lo hacía yo.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:41.480
[Laughter] porque no
me dijo toda la verdad.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:53.500
&gt;&gt; Melissa: So, Borges said to her,
"There's no dancers in my family,

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.970 position:56%
but [crosstalk] yes, fine I'm sorry.

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:02.660
But, he told her, "If you decide
to dance, you'll be able to do it

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.580
for a while but after that
you won't be able too.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:11.330
And on the other hand if you
study and if you want to teach,

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:15.800 position:56%
that's something you can continue on
doing and so, she decided not to go

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.350
to el Teatro Colón,
and continue studying.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:21.650
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: And teach.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:25.050
Which is boundless, we
don't have to retire.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.210
Even if some people want us to.

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:30.870
Right? And.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:40.400
Before I turn it over,
one more question.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.130
Borges said many times
that he's an agnostic,

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:49.730 position:56%
but at the same time he talked about
mystical experiences that he had.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:51.030
What happened there?

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:55.040
How did he blend those
two positions?

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.610
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: [Inaudible]
agnostic.

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.570
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Just in case.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:00.870
Go ahead.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.200
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Just in case?

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:13.410
OK, but he said that he has
these mystic experiences

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.330
when he wrote at night [inaudible].

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:27.700
One was in el Barrio Sur, en
un atardecer, en un anochecer,

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:31.980
él sintió que estaba
fuera del tiempo,

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:44.150 position:56%
entonces esto lo impresionó mucho y
esa es la experiencia que sintió así

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:51.260
que era no normal o lógico.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:57.830
En fin, en la obra de él hay
muchísimas citas a la Biblia,

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:05.520
pero eso era por el lado
de su abuela inglesa,

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:13.990
él me decía que en esa época para
los católicos estaba prohibido leer

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:17.070
la Biblia por temer a
la mala interpretación -

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:18.370
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Hacían bien.

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:23.340
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: En cambio los
protestantes hasta el día de hoy

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:30.870
tienen las Biblias [inaudible] y su
abuela sabía [inaudible] entonces

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:42.360
eso le quedó muy fuertemente unido
a su parte digamos intelecutal,

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.180
y la prueba es que a lo largo de
su obra hay muchísimas [inaudible]

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.160
Biblia, Jesucristo, no desde el
punto de vista de la creencia total

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.460
pero si --

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.760
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Búsqueda
de coherencia [inaudible].

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:57.620
&gt;&gt; Melissa: One of those mystic
experience was during a walk

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.950
at night in Barrio Sur.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:07.110
He felt that he was out of
time and that impressed him,

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:10.530
he felt something that
wasn't normal, wasn't logical

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:12.940
as if it were another dimension.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:20.500
In his work there are a lot
of references from the Bible

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:25.950
and this comes from his
English grandmother.

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:28.950
She knew parts of the
Bible by memory

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:37.540 position:56%
and this influenced his intellectual
life, not from a point of view

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:44.170
of him believing in religion.

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:45.470
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Did he
always think [inaudible] is his

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:46.770
best [inaudible]?

00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:49.510
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: No, he
changed his [inaudible] --

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:51.910
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Do you have
any other one besides [inaudible]

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:54.180
that he considered his
best or his favorite?

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.310
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: No, I can't
remember the name [inaudible]

00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:57.900
but sometimes he said

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:02.770
that [inaudible] Le gustaba mucho y
también el que escribió a su abuelo

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:10.340 position:56%
[inaudible] a su abuelo que
[inaudible] cinco años y él lo cuidó

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:15.800
en su delirio y muere
en una batalla,

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:27.800
entonces es tristísimo porque él
dice que él tenía cinco años cuando

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:43.980
su abuelo murió y le decían que se
había ido d eviaje y entonces él

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:50.890
caminaba por la casa tratando
de encontrar a su abuelo,

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:57.900
era una cosa muy triste, sí.

00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Melissa: So, besides [inaudible],

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:06.120
another poem that he mentioned a
lot was, "El otro Tigre" and one

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:10.540
that he wrote for his
grandfather who died in battle,

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.220
Borges was five years old when
his grandfather passed away.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.250
And he was told that
he have gone on a trip.

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:19.720
So Borges, as a child used to look

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.870
for his grandfather not
knowing that he had passed.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:24.170
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: OK.

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:26.550
Open to the public, questions.

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:37.070
Somebody will bring you a mic.

00:54:49.850 --> 00:55:01.430
&gt;&gt; Gracias, pregunto en castellano
y después traduzco si quieren.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:02.730
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Sí.

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:13.100
&gt;&gt; Me interesa mucho lo que dijo
acerca de la libertad y la lealtad

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:18.680
como dos de las palabras
que [inaudible] en Borges,

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:24.760 position:56%
porque creo que [inaudible] a cierta
obediencia incondicional a cierta

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:30.200
proximidad la constante y
la libertad por otra parte,

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.100
una suerte de partida
o de separación.

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:41.160
Yo no creo que las dos sean
contradictorias en absoluto,

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.270
y se pueden conjugar bien,

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:49.490
y creo que [inaudible] me interesa
saber qué era la lealtad para

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:54.440
ustedes, y la libertad
y cómo se combinaban.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:58.110
And in English, basically I think

00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:04.960
that traditionally freedom
implies a certain kind

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:15.740
of unconditional proximity and
loyalty and freedom are kind

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:24.020
of distance or departure [phonetic]
how did you and Borges minded

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:28.750
to in order to achieve that
happiness that you described?

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:40.190
What was loyalty for you
and what was freedom for you

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:45.630 position:56%
and why were they not contradictory.

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:58.990
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Bueno, yo creo que
no son contrditorios la libertad y

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.560
la lealtad, ¿cierto?

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:13.160
Porque la libertad [inaudible] y la
lealtad es la [inaudible] me gute o

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:28.310
no me guste, OK [inaudubke] y la
lealtad es digamos la [inaudible] a

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:34.470
través de la cual nosotros,
digamos, estamos interiormente,

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:40.130
cómo puedo decir, no privados pero
sí tenemos que tener la conciencia

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:43.850
de que no podemos digamos
[inaudible],

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:47.060
es decir tenemos que ser
fieles a nuestras ideas,

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:54.850
a nuestros ideales de vida.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:58:04.590
Yo creo que esos son los términos
que no se contradicen sino que

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:09.740
[inaudible] a mi forma
de pensar se unen,

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.110
se completan, no sé si te contesté.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:13.410
Gracias.

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.230
&gt;&gt; Melissa: [Inaudible] and
freedom contradict each other,

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:38.930
and were the liberty is not
freedom, Rather is not libertinaje?

00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:42.400
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: OK,
we have translators here,

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:49.380
how do you say libertinaje?

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:58.610
[Inaudible] it's not -- it doesn't
exist in the Spanglish language,

00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:08.690
we don't practice it so, let's
proceed [inaudible] right.

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:13.810
It was better the other way.

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:19.810
&gt;&gt; Melissa: With respect to the
loyalty, that conscience of not --

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:27.020
not going against someone
else's ideals and she feels

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:38.410
that they complement each other
rather than contradicting.

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:40.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Another question?

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.540
Over there.

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:42.840
&gt;&gt; Gracias.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:49.290
Voy la hago en castellano
la pregunta,

00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:54.650
con respecto a esa experiencia
de Borges, de modernidad,

00:59:54.650 --> 01:00:00.950 position:56%
de esa experiencia espiritual que
mencionaste que había ocurrido en el

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:07.960
sur, y luego inmediatamente se me
ocurrió asociarlo [inaudible] no sé

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.540
si es que exista alguna conexión.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.490
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Bueno
posiblemente sí exista ¿no?

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:17.440
Posiblemente esa experiencia
[inaudible] ese cuento, y no sé,

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.030
no puedo decirlo con seguridad,

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:26.210
pero no es [inaudible] ya que
esa experiencia es realmente una

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:28.680
experiencia mística, ¿no?

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:39.640
De alguna manera puede llegar a
ver así todas las cosas en punto.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:49.780
Y es muy divertido porque él me
contaba que ese cuento se le reveló

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.210
[inaudible] caleidoscopio,

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:57.820
estaba jugando con un
caleidoscopio [inaudible].

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.160
&gt;&gt; A todos nos pasa lo mismo.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.460
[Laughter]

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.440
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Yeah,
[inaudible] go for it.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.870
¿Me permites un tantito esto?

01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:17.500
&gt;&gt; Melissa: It's possible
that that mystical experience

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.470
of Borges could have
shaped [inaudible],

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:26.850
but she doesn't know for sure.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.920
Because they are both,
could be both,

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.830
[inaudible] mystic experiences,
but that story came to Borges,

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:39.740
the short story [inaudible] while
playing with the kaleidoscope.

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:45.630
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: You
didn't mention that one time

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:55.120
where he was interviewed
by a Spanish journalist

01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:07.510
who got very upset with him because
Borges mentions the exact location

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:16.220
of where the Aleph is and
someone had told the journalist

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:28.110
that he had made it up and
got very angry and left him

01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:29.440
and said, "vale, vale, vale".

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.370
We have a question over there.

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:33.570
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] en español.

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:52.800
Cómo era Borges en día a día
considerando la cambiante y

01:02:52.800 --> 01:03:05.230
constante actividad o la
política Argentina, era pasional,

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:15.060
lo tomaba a veces con humor,
se enganchaba terriblemente,

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.830
digamos se preocupaba
mucho, o digamos,

01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:28.360
los cambios políticos en Argentina
que fueron muchísimos toda su vida,

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:35.380
lo preocupaba mucho y de alguna
manera lo quería expresar en los

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.680
libros, ¿no?

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.070
I can translate it
[inaudible] the life of Borges,

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:45.510
in relation with Argentinian
political situation [inaudible]

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:50.020
probably in all his life
changed a lot, that continuous

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:55.110
to change every day, but I want to
ask how was his humor with that,

01:03:55.110 --> 01:04:06.750
how was his relation with that,
if he was very anxious with that,

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:17.180
or not, or if he was very
passionned [inaudible] politics

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:19.240
of Argentina, how he feel?

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.540
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Mira, I think

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:24.790
that [inaudible] the different
political situations [inaudible]

01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:30.400
and he was always very clear
and [inaudible] someone

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.870
who said [inaudible] for him
of course because [inaudible]

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:36.910
in his mind, but, he
was very I think,

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:41.220
very clear [inaudible] dictatorship
and that's why he was free

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:47.390
and a free person cannot
undertand that kind

01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:52.780
of [inaudible] time
[inaudible] about that, yes.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.110
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
One final question.

01:04:55.110 --> 01:05:05.220
&gt;&gt; Yo tenía un comentario
muy rápido que es que

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:10.790
"cabiza" quiere decir
"lío" en árabe.

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:13.530
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: Thank
you, thank you.

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:19.010
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: That sort
of makes sense considering

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:23.200
that they were carrying
him on his arms,

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.840
that makes a lot of
sense, thank you.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:34.070
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] de corazón
[inaudible] cuán quisquilloso era

01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:36.510
Borges para la comida,
qué cosas él no comía,

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:37.950
qué cosas si le gustaba bastante,

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.920
que no [inaudible] que siempre
quería comer o [inaudible].

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.670
So, in English, keeping with the
[inaudible] how picky was Borges

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:45.050
in regards of food,
what would he not touch,

01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:46.350
what would he really
like to eat, or drink.

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:47.650
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: That is
definitely a Cuban question.

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:48.950
[Inaudible].

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:50.250
&gt;&gt; Maria Kodama: He loved arroz
con manteca y queso, and cheese.

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.550
[inaudible] always
[inaudible] whose name was Maxim

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:52.850
that was [inaudible] near Florida,
in Buenso Aires, and then we went

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:54.150
to [inaudible] invited us to a
restaurant in [inaudible], he said,

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:55.450
OK, the man began drink this
wine, and Borges drink, he said,

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:56.750 position:56%
"I don't drink wine" then the man
began to explain the food, and the -

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:58.050
and then, the chef, the restaurant
[inaudible] was [inaudible] Borges

01:05:58.050 --> 01:05:59.350
said, "OK, I want to eat
arroz con manteca y queso",

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:00.650
then the man said --
Borges, we are in Maxims --

01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:01.950
and he said - this is
a sucursal of Maxim

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:03.250
in Buenos Aires [inaudible] is the
best restaurant de [inaudible] OK,

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.550
I want to know how is the taste

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:05.850
of my favourite dish
arroz con manteca y queso

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:07.150 position:56%
in the best restaurant in the world.

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:08.450
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: On that
note, we thank Maria Kodama

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:09.750
for sharing these memories with us

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:11.050
and to be continuing
until another time.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.350
