00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.343
- [David] Hello grammarians, hello Rosie!

00:00:01.343 --> 00:00:02.194
- [Rosie] Hi David!

00:00:02.194 --> 00:00:05.451
- [David] So, You've
caught me mid-scribble

00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:07.635
in the greatest challenge of my career.

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:11.635
Will I be able to write
the word ono-mato-poeia?

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.045
- [Rosie] You can do it.

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:15.878
- [David] Did I get it?

00:00:15.878 --> 00:00:16.711
- [Rosie] You did it.

00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:17.761
- [David] Yes!

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.109
This is one of my least
favorite words to spell

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.867
but one of my favorite
things to talk about.

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:23.700
Because what we're talking about today is

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.548
alliteration, assonance,

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:26.965
and onomatopoeia.

00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:32.092
And these are all words that are related

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:34.342
to the way language sounds.

00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:38.966
But let's begin with alliteration.

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.725
Rosie, what is alliteration?

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:45.101
- [Rosie] Alliteration
is when a series of words

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:47.934
all start with the same consonant.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.030
- [David] So what's a
good example of that?

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.547
- [Rosie] Robert Park
swam swiftly, surely,

00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:57.108
and straight ahead.

00:00:57.108 --> 00:00:59.413
- [David] So you can see that
all these pink words here,

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:03.580
swam, swiftly, surely, straight
ahead, all begin with "S."

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.857
And so this is why we
call this alliteration

00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:09.164
because "S" is a consonant and all

00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:13.612
of these things share a
similar consonant sound.

00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:16.790
Now I want to contrast
that with assonance,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.599
which is what, Rosie?

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.849
- [Rosie] Assonance is
when a series of words

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:24.316
all start with the same vowel.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:26.733
Althea abolished all anguish.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.040
- [David] So you can
see, all of these words

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.868
in the sentence in the
same vowel neighborhood.

00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:36.719
- [Rosie] Right.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.802
- [David] But my favorite
of all is onomatopoeia,

00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:48.873
which comes from Greek, and
it basically means, like,

00:01:48.873 --> 00:01:52.873
onom, onomat, means a
name resulting from doing.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.948
So really, this is, this word just means

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:03.312
sounds like what it does.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:06.759
So any, really anything
that you would conceive of

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.414
as a sound effect, like a word that comes

00:02:10.414 --> 00:02:12.621
from a sound effect.

00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:16.075
So, the bees buzzed, for example.

00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:17.310
Like, what is buzzed?

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.441
Well, it's the sound that a bee makes.

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:20.675
It's what it does.

00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:24.465
But that word is derived
from the buzz sound.

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:27.098
But that's not the only
example of onomatopoeia.

00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:30.306
We've compiled here a list.
What have we got, Rosie?

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:33.419
- [Rosie] Okay, we've got splat.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.292
That's kind of the sound of
something hitting pavement.

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:38.605
- [David] Splat.

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:39.676
- [Rosie] Yep.

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:43.798
We've got clang, which
is like the clanging

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:45.250
of a bell.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.417
We've got bang, which sounds
like something exploding.

00:02:50.473 --> 00:02:53.640
Whoosh, which sounds like air or wind.

00:02:56.562 --> 00:02:57.567
Beep.

00:02:57.567 --> 00:02:58.400
- [David] Yeah.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.894
- [Rosie] Beep sounds like a beeping.

00:03:00.894 --> 00:03:01.921
(laughs)

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:03.604
- [David] Like that is
literally, so if you, if you are

00:03:03.604 --> 00:03:07.521
trying to summon up the
actual sound of a thing

00:03:10.453 --> 00:03:13.996
and transcribe it and use
it as a noun or a verb,

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:16.035
you're using onomatopoeia.

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:18.753
I know it's a terrifying
looking word, right?

00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:21.126
Like, no one word should have
this many vowels in front

00:03:21.126 --> 00:03:21.959
of the other.

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.167
I get it, I get it.

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:26.057
I'm, I'm terrified of spelling this word,

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:28.938
but I managed to do it,
apparently, and now you know

00:03:28.938 --> 00:03:31.735
what it means, and that should take away

00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:36.011
some of its scariness and
impart to you some of its power.

00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.110
Because here at Khan Academy, we want you

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.002
to have the power to harness language,

00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:43.626
and specifically, today,
to harness these three

00:03:43.626 --> 00:03:46.294
different language styles.

00:03:46.294 --> 00:03:48.385
So, alliteration, repeating
the same consonant

00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:49.415
a bunch of times in a row,

00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:53.449
so swimming, swiftly,
surely, and straight ahead.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.562
- [Rosie] Assonance, where
you repeat the same vowel,

00:03:56.562 --> 00:03:58.864
like abolished all anguish.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:02.327
- [David] And onomatopoeia,
where you make a word

00:04:02.327 --> 00:04:04.883
that sounds like what
the word's effect is.

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:08.800
So the bees buzzed, the
pudding cup went splat,

00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:14.770
the boxing bell fell to
the floor with a clang,

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.376
the firework went off with
a bang, a flight of bats

00:04:19.376 --> 00:04:22.361
whooshed past my head, and the robot,

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.028
the little baby robot
beeped at me, insistently.

00:04:26.028 --> 00:04:26.861
- [Rosie] I like those.

00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:29.736
- [David] How can a robot be a baby?

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.087
- [Rosie] I think it's
just the size, right?

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:32.012
- [David] Okay, sure.

00:04:32.012 --> 00:04:32.845
- [Rosie] Not the age.

00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:34.816
- [David] Okay, sure,
yeah that's legitimate.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.404
So okay, I guess the
question is now you know

00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:38.237
what these things are, but Rosie,

00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:40.822
why would a person want
to use these techniques

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.248
in language, whether written or spoken?

00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:44.440
- [Rosie] That's a great question.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.622
Writers can use some of these techniques

00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:48.872
to basically use the sound.

00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:52.861
To get across a pattern.

00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:56.131
- [David] Um-hum.

00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:58.061
- [Rosie] Like if your going to use words

00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:00.446
that all sound the same at the beginning,

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:03.536
with a bunch of "Ss" that kind of,

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.676
could potentially build some
momentum to your sentence.

00:05:05.676 --> 00:05:09.172
Like, it kind of makes the
reader sit up and pay attention,

00:05:09.172 --> 00:05:12.549
too, like oh, this is
an interesting pattern.

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:14.877
So that could be one reason
why a writer might use,

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:17.386
for example, alliteration.

00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:19.707
- [David] Yeah, so it's a
way to express a pattern

00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:21.353
and to build on what you were saying,

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:24.687
you can also, it's just
a good attention grabber,

00:05:24.687 --> 00:05:27.442
and it's also useful for it's own sake,

00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:31.442
just as a technique for
writing prose or poetry.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.096
Like, it's something,
it's a useful property

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:38.679
of language to be able
to sometimes access.

00:05:40.284 --> 00:05:44.104
- [Rosie] Right, and a good
example with onomatopoeia,

00:05:44.104 --> 00:05:47.687
ono-mato-poeia, is
you're really capturing,

00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:55.727
you're really capturing
the sound, so the reader

00:05:55.727 --> 00:05:58.362
is really able to be
emersed in the experience

00:05:58.362 --> 00:05:59.553
even more fully.

00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:03.952
You can hear the sounds
that are happening.

00:06:03.952 --> 00:06:05.931
The buzzing of the bees, or, yeah.

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.232
It just puts you even more in the story

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:09.997
that the writer's telling.

00:06:09.997 --> 00:06:12.671
- [David] That's why you
would want to learn how to use

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:16.749
assonance, alliteration, and onomatopoeia.

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:17.860
You can learn anything.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.100
David out.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.756
- [Rosie] Rosie out.
