then we'll get give a brief look of
behind the scene in UX research so let's

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
behind the scene in UX research so let's
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.320
behind the scene in UX research so let's
start what is accessibility

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330
start what is accessibility
 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.600
start what is accessibility
accessibility is about created is about

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
accessibility is about created is about
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.550
accessibility is about created is about
creating products that are usable by

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
creating products that are usable by
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.039
creating products that are usable by
everyone including people with

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
everyone including people with
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.370
everyone including people with
disabilities such as motor impairment or

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
disabilities such as motor impairment or
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.859
disabilities such as motor impairment or
visual impairment but I'd like to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
visual impairment but I'd like to
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.510
visual impairment but I'd like to
rephrase this definition as slightly

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
rephrase this definition as slightly
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.780
rephrase this definition as slightly
different and I would say that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790
different and I would say that
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.270
different and I would say that
accessibility is about challenging the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
accessibility is about challenging the
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.980
accessibility is about challenging the
assumptions we make about our users for

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990
assumptions we make about our users for
 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.410
assumptions we make about our users for
example can the user see the device or

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
example can the user see the device or
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.679
example can the user see the device or
distinguish between colors can he or she

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
distinguish between colors can he or she
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.690
distinguish between colors can he or she
touched the device or hear back the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
touched the device or hear back the
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670
touched the device or hear back the
sound that the device is producing and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
sound that the device is producing and
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.170
sound that the device is producing and
can the user speak back to the device

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180
can the user speak back to the device
 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.889
can the user speak back to the device
now this is not a small number 20% of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
now this is not a small number 20% of
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.499
now this is not a small number 20% of
the US population will have some sort of

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
the US population will have some sort of
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.060
the US population will have some sort of
a disability during the lifetime

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
a disability during the lifetime
 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.319
a disability during the lifetime
according to the u s-- s census but it's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
according to the u s-- s census but it's
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.560
according to the u s-- s census but it's
not only that challenging the assumption

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
not only that challenging the assumption
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.630
not only that challenging the assumption
get benefit all the users why because

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
get benefit all the users why because
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.069
get benefit all the users why because

now the first accessibility service we

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859
now the first accessibility service we
 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.690
now the first accessibility service we
have on the device today is talkback

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700
have on the device today is talkback
 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.610

vision impairment or blind and it's

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549
vision impairment or blind and it's
 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.119
vision impairment or blind and it's
basically a screen reader now the user

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129
basically a screen reader now the user
 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.610
basically a screen reader now the user
can interact with the device using touch

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620
can interact with the device using touch
 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.729
can interact with the device using touch
gesture and content is presented and

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739
gesture and content is presented and
 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.449
gesture and content is presented and
content is spoken to the user through

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459
content is spoken to the user through
 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.659
content is spoken to the user through
text-to-speech the second accessibility

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669
text-to-speech the second accessibility
 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.140
text-to-speech the second accessibility
service is Braille back so can we switch

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150
service is Braille back so can we switch
 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.150
service is Braille back so can we switch
to the demo so belbek is similar to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
to the demo so belbek is similar to
 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.550
to the demo so belbek is similar to
talkback just in this case the user can

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560
talkback just in this case the user can
 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.500
talkback just in this case the user can
interact with something which is called

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510
interact with something which is called
 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.409
interact with something which is called
a Braille refreshable display the user

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419
a Braille refreshable display the user
 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:14.780
a Braille refreshable display the user
can type through these keys or interact

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790
can type through these keys or interact
 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.629
can type through these keys or interact
with this joystick and then the content

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639
with this joystick and then the content
 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.050
with this joystick and then the content
is presented using well in those Braille

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060
is presented using well in those Braille
 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.390
is presented using well in those Braille
cells with the dots raising and lowering

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400
cells with the dots raising and lowering
 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.450

the next service

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
the next service
 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.170
the next service
is switch access switch access is

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180
is switch access switch access is
 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.510
is switch access switch access is
targeted for motor inferred user who

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520
targeted for motor inferred user who
 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.850
targeted for motor inferred user who
have trouble interacting with the touch

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860
have trouble interacting with the touch
 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.300
have trouble interacting with the touch
display in this case we have something

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310
display in this case we have something
 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.939
display in this case we have something
which is called adaptive switch this

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949
which is called adaptive switch this
 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.670
which is called adaptive switch this
adaptive switch has two buttons and the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680
adaptive switch has two buttons and the
 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.760
adaptive switch has two buttons and the
user can configure one button is next

this important for accessibility let's

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:37.750
this important for accessibility let's
 

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.300
this important for accessibility let's
take a look at switch access an

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:39.310
take a look at switch access an
 

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.460
take a look at switch access an
accessibility service that does not

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:41.470
accessibility service that does not
 

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.280
accessibility service that does not
assume that you can touch the screen

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:43.290
assume that you can touch the screen
 

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.770
assume that you can touch the screen
rather it lets use a switch or a set of

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:46.780
rather it lets use a switch or a set of
 

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.750
rather it lets use a switch or a set of
switches to move highlight across

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760
switches to move highlight across
 

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.240
switches to move highlight across
actionable views and select the

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.250
actionable views and select the
 

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.210
actionable views and select the
currently highlighted view now this

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:54.220
currently highlighted view now this
 

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.340
currently highlighted view now this

supports complex gestures things like

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:09.400
supports complex gestures things like
 

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.610
supports complex gestures things like
zooming in and out and having the

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:11.620
zooming in and out and having the
 

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.910
zooming in and out and having the
visible area so with this new gesture

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:14.920
visible area so with this new gesture

dispatch API we can add points canny to

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:17.410
dispatch API we can add points canny to
 

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.770
dispatch API we can add points canny to
switch access and that lets us perform

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:19.780
switch access and that lets us perform
 

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.380
switch access and that lets us perform
these complex gestures so let's take a

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:22.390
these complex gestures so let's take a
 

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.250
these complex gestures so let's take a
look at how we can use one switch to

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:50.210
 

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.660
yeah it's hard to to calibrate the

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:52.670
yeah it's hard to to calibrate the
 

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.550
yeah it's hard to to calibrate the
overall stage is shaky and it's hard to

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560
overall stage is shaky and it's hard to
 

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.190
overall stage is shaky and it's hard to
do but this is what these demo is all

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:57.200
do but this is what these demo is all
 

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.750
do but this is what these demo is all
about so in general after we move the

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:01.760
about so in general after we move the
 

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.480
about so in general after we move the
mouse cursor we can also like lock the

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:04.490
mouse cursor we can also like lock the
 

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:19.810
mouse cursor we can also like lock the
sensor this is by looking right

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:19.820
 

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.720
yeah

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:22.730
 

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:30.330
yeah sure Trigon just go to candy crush

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:30.340
 

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.230
yeah sorry

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240
yeah sorry
 

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.800
yeah sorry
so in general these memories involve a

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:35.810
so in general these memories involve a
 

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.340
so in general these memories involve a
mouse cursor using the device it's a

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:39.350
mouse cursor using the device it's a
 

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.750
mouse cursor using the device it's a
little bit hard to do it on stage

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760
little bit hard to do it on stage
 

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.220
little bit hard to do it on stage
because they all should stage is a

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:42.230
because they all should stage is a
 

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:58.900
because they all should stage is a
little bit shaky that's right

00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:58.910
 

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:05.420
and

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:05.430
 

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.140
so the thing is basically you can do

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:09.150
so the thing is basically you can do
 

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.120
so the thing is basically you can do
everything using a typewriter on the

00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:56.029
 

00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:58.669
now if we take a step back here we

00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679
now if we take a step back here we
 

00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:00.859
now if we take a step back here we
realize that Andy's experience is not

how that you can use a touchscreen so

00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:10.349
how that you can use a touchscreen so
 

00:21:10.349 --> 00:21:12.079
how that you can use a touchscreen so
this can range from people with

00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:12.089
this can range from people with
 

00:21:12.089 --> 00:21:14.539
this can range from people with
essential tremor like Andy to people who

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:14.549
essential tremor like Andy to people who
 

00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:17.060
essential tremor like Andy to people who
have Parkinson's amputees people with

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:17.070
have Parkinson's amputees people with
 

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.159
have Parkinson's amputees people with
arthritis even people with spinal cord

00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:19.169
arthritis even people with spinal cord
 

00:21:19.169 --> 00:21:20.859

injuries just to name a few

00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:20.869
injuries just to name a few
 

00:21:20.869 --> 00:21:23.359
injuries just to name a few
now in addition to that there's many

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:23.369
now in addition to that there's many
 

00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:24.950
now in addition to that there's many
more people who have what we call a

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960
more people who have what we call a
 

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.629
more people who have what we call a
situational disability like Maya

00:21:26.629 --> 00:21:26.639
situational disability like Maya
 

00:21:26.639 --> 00:21:28.369
situational disability like Maya
mentioned before this could be a

00:21:28.369 --> 00:21:28.379
mentioned before this could be a
 

00:21:28.379 --> 00:21:30.469
mentioned before this could be a
temporary impairment that affects their

00:21:30.469 --> 00:21:30.479
temporary impairment that affects their
 

00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:32.329
temporary impairment that affects their
use of a touchscreen something like a

00:21:32.329 --> 00:21:32.339
use of a touchscreen something like a
 

00:21:32.339 --> 00:21:34.489
use of a touchscreen something like a
broken hand or wrist or maybe their

00:21:34.489 --> 00:21:34.499
broken hand or wrist or maybe their
 

00:21:34.499 --> 00:21:37.489
broken hand or wrist or maybe their
hands are occupied a common use case we

00:21:37.489 --> 00:21:37.499
hands are occupied a common use case we
 

00:21:37.499 --> 00:21:39.049
hands are occupied a common use case we
actually here is that someone might be

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059
actually here is that someone might be
 

00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:40.849
actually here is that someone might be
cooking and they their hands are dirty

00:21:40.849 --> 00:21:40.859
cooking and they their hands are dirty
 

00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:42.139
cooking and they their hands are dirty
they don't want use their hands and

00:21:42.139 --> 00:21:42.149
they don't want use their hands and
 

00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:44.119
they don't want use their hands and
they'd love to be able to still control

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:44.129
they'd love to be able to still control
 

00:21:44.129 --> 00:21:48.649
they'd love to be able to still control
their device so this is really the

00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:48.659
their device so this is really the
 

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:51.049
their device so this is really the
motivation we have for voice access and

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059
motivation we have for voice access and
 

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:53.450
motivation we have for voice access and
our goal with voice access is to provide

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460
our goal with voice access is to provide
 

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.269
our goal with voice access is to provide
someone this complete control of their

00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279
someone this complete control of their
 

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:59.409
someone this complete control of their
device through use of their voice alone

00:21:59.409 --> 00:21:59.419
device through use of their voice alone

gonna go into accessibility settings and

00:24:08.259 --> 00:24:08.269
gonna go into accessibility settings and
 

00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:10.779
gonna go into accessibility settings and
enable large text so it's a little

00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:10.789
enable large text so it's a little
 

00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:12.060
enable large text so it's a little
easier for those people and

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:12.070
easier for those people and
 

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.620
easier for those people and

go home alright there we go

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:50.980
go home alright there we go
 

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.700
go home alright there we go
so that's voice access in action so what

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:53.710
so that's voice access in action so what
 

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:54.840
so that's voice access in action so what
actually happened right there

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:54.850
actually happened right there
 

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.940
actually happened right there
so you may notice that there's this

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:56.950
so you may notice that there's this
 

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.130
so you may notice that there's this
persistent blue button that appears on

00:24:59.130 --> 00:24:59.140
persistent blue button that appears on
 

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.140
persistent blue button that appears on
the top right of the screen and so

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.150
the top right of the screen and so
 

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.820
the top right of the screen and so
that's a voice access activation button

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:02.830
that's a voice access activation button
 

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.710
that's a voice access activation button
so from any screen you just press that

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720
so from any screen you just press that
 

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.420
so from any screen you just press that
button and then voice access starts

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:06.430
button and then voice access starts
 

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.630
button and then voice access starts
listening and then from there you can

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640
listening and then from there you can
 

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.000
listening and then from there you can
issue commands to globally navigate the

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.010
issue commands to globally navigate the
 

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.190
issue commands to globally navigate the
device interact with individual elements

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200
device interact with individual elements
 

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.170
device interact with individual elements
on the screen and basically control your

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:16.180
on the screen and basically control your
 

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.110
on the screen and basically control your
device entirely by voice so what I did

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120
device entirely by voice so what I did
 

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.600
device entirely by voice so what I did
there was I opened the Settings app by

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:21.610
there was I opened the Settings app by
 

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:22.800
there was I opened the Settings app by
saying open settings

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:22.810
saying open settings
 

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.990
saying open settings
I said scroll to the bottom to actually

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000
I said scroll to the bottom to actually
 

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.570
I said scroll to the bottom to actually
scroll the screen down as if I were

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:27.580
scroll the screen down as if I were
 

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.270
scroll the screen down as if I were
performing a traditional tap gesture

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:29.280
performing a traditional tap gesture
 

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.670
performing a traditional tap gesture
then I said tap accessibility to tap the

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:32.680
then I said tap accessibility to tap the
 

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.470
then I said tap accessibility to tap the
corresponding button on the screen that

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480
corresponding button on the screen that
 

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.570
corresponding button on the screen that
was labeled with the text accessibility

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:36.580
was labeled with the text accessibility
 

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.970
was labeled with the text accessibility
and then I did the exact same thing to

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:38.980
and then I did the exact same thing to
 

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.820
and then I did the exact same thing to
press the switch label large text so

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:41.830
press the switch label large text so
 

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.350
press the switch label large text so
this actually uses the same

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360
this actually uses the same
 

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.480
this actually uses the same
accessibility api's that underlie the

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:45.490
accessibility api's that underlie the
 

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.700
accessibility api's that underlie the
other accessibility services that we've

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:47.710
other accessibility services that we've
 

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:48.540
other accessibility services that we've
seen so far

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:48.550
seen so far
 

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.180
seen so far
like talkback or switch access so as

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:51.190
like talkback or switch access so as
 

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.860
like talkback or switch access so as
long as you follow accessibility

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:52.870
long as you follow accessibility
 

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.320
long as you follow accessibility
development best practices your app

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:55.330
development best practices your app
 

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.000
development best practices your app
should actually work with voice access

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.010
should actually work with voice access
 

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.090
should actually work with voice access
right out-of-the-box so with that let's

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.100
right out-of-the-box so with that let's
 

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.620
right out-of-the-box so with that let's

what we found was a lot of bugs so we
dress those bugs we made the product

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640
dress those bugs we made the product
 

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.060
dress those bugs we made the product
better we iterated it until we got to

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.070
better we iterated it until we got to
 

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.220
better we iterated it until we got to
the point that we felt the product is so

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:02.230
the point that we felt the product is so
 

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.260
the point that we felt the product is so
stable now that we can actually put it

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:04.270
stable now that we can actually put it
 

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.930
stable now that we can actually put it
in front of real users and that's what

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:06.940
in front of real users and that's what
 

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:07.410
in front of real users and that's what
we did

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:07.420
we did
 

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.380
we did
we ran usability studies usability

in front of them you can see exactly

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.050
in front of them you can see exactly
 

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.420
in front of them you can see exactly
what they're doing and they're running

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:27.430
what they're doing and they're running
 

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.240
what they're doing and they're running
through a couple of tasks with you and

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:29.250
through a couple of tasks with you and
 

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.890
through a couple of tasks with you and
you see the limitations of the product

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:31.900
you see the limitations of the product
 

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.690
you see the limitations of the product
you see where it's failing but you also

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:33.700
you see where it's failing but you also
 

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.640
you see where it's failing but you also
see where people are especially lighted

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:35.650
see where people are especially lighted
 

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.880

and what you see actually here in the

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:38.890
and what you see actually here in the
 

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.310
and what you see actually here in the
picture is one of our labs it's designed

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.320
picture is one of our labs it's designed
 

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.860
picture is one of our labs it's designed
to be very comfortable and welcoming to

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:43.870
to be very comfortable and welcoming to
 

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.110
to be very comfortable and welcoming to
our users and at the same time it has

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.120
our users and at the same time it has
 

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.040
our users and at the same time it has
cameras to capture audio and video so

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:50.050
cameras to capture audio and video so
 

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.720
cameras to capture audio and video so
afterwards we can actually go back into

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:51.730
afterwards we can actually go back into
 

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.540
afterwards we can actually go back into
the data analyze and see exactly how we

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:54.550
the data analyze and see exactly how we
 

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.960
the data analyze and see exactly how we
can improve the product usability

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:57.970
can improve the product usability
 

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.670
can improve the product usability
studies are great but they have their

00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680
studies are great but they have their
 

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.320
studies are great but they have their
limitations and I think the biggest

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:01.330
limitations and I think the biggest
 

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.450
limitations and I think the biggest
limitation is that it's a very short

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:03.460
limitation is that it's a very short
 

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.100
limitation is that it's a very short
period of time that your user is

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:05.110
period of time that your user is
 

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.590
period of time that your user is
interacting with a product and it's in a

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:07.600
interacting with a product and it's in a
 

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.510
interacting with a product and it's in a
lab environment so it's not the real

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520
lab environment so it's not the real
 

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.250
lab environment so it's not the real
life so we went one step further and

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260
life so we went one step further and
 

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.190
life so we went one step further and
conducted diary studies diary studies as

about the usage so what did we do

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240
about the usage so what did we do
 

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.440
about the usage so what did we do
we sent voice access home with the users

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:28.450
we sent voice access home with the users
 

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.840
we sent voice access home with the users
on their personal devices installed and

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:30.850
on their personal devices installed and
 

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.150
on their personal devices installed and
they could use it in whichever context I

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160
they could use it in whichever context I
 

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.730

once you had two premises was that they

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480
once you had two premises was that they
 

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.090
once you had two premises was that they
would report back about the experience

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:39.100
would report back about the experience
 

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.460
would report back about the experience
so you can do that over the phone you

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:41.470
so you can do that over the phone you
 

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.890
so you can do that over the phone you
can have them read emails or just fill

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:43.900
can have them read emails or just fill
 

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.930

in a quick survey and in the end of the

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:45.940
in a quick survey and in the end of the
 

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.280
in a quick survey and in the end of the
study they would come back into the

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:47.290
study they would come back into the
 

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.590
study they would come back into the
office with us and give us a report how

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:49.600

what they didn't like what we learned
 

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.960
what they didn't like what we learned
from that process is that for one voice

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:57.970
from that process is that for one voice
 

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.480
from that process is that for one voice
access really needs to be polished and

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:00.490

we didn't start off on that I have a few

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:08.140
we didn't start off on that I have a few
 

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.720
we didn't start off on that I have a few
more examples on that in a minute for

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:09.730
more examples on that in a minute for

on the go you need a really easy way to

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920
on the go you need a really easy way to
 

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.400
on the go you need a really easy way to
activate and deactivate it because

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:17.410
activate and deactivate it because
 

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.350
activate and deactivate it because
otherwise it's too much hassle for the

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:19.360
otherwise it's too much hassle for the
 

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.380
otherwise it's too much hassle for the
user to actually dive into the software

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:22.390
user to actually dive into the software
 

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:24.630

and then again when you don't want it to

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640
and then again when you don't want it to
 

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.390

you the
examples that I just mentioned the first

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:30.970
examples that I just mentioned the first
 

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.259
examples that I just mentioned the first
one that I would like to talk about is

00:37:33.259 --> 00:37:33.269
one that I would like to talk about is
 

00:37:33.269 --> 00:37:36.569
one that I would like to talk about is
how we improve the contextual help you

00:37:36.569 --> 00:37:36.579
how we improve the contextual help you

see on the left-hand side the before and
 

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:40.200
see on the left-hand side the before and
on the right-hand side you see the after

on the right-hand side you see the after
 

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.529
on the right-hand side you see the after
so what is that on the left-hand side we

00:37:43.529 --> 00:37:43.539
so what is that on the left-hand side we
 

00:37:43.539 --> 00:37:45.089
so what is that on the left-hand side we
see a long list of all the voice

00:37:45.089 --> 00:37:45.099
see a long list of all the voice
 

00:37:45.099 --> 00:37:47.579
see a long list of all the voice
commands that we are offering everyone

00:37:47.579 --> 00:37:47.589

who's using or developing on voice based
software knows that the biggest

00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:52.119
software knows that the biggest
 

00:37:52.119 --> 00:37:54.089
software knows that the biggest
challenge is how can you actually teach

00:37:54.089 --> 00:37:54.099
challenge is how can you actually teach
 

00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:56.999
challenge is how can you actually teach
your user what they can say and how can

00:37:56.999 --> 00:37:57.009
your user what they can say and how can
 

00:37:57.009 --> 00:37:59.400
your user what they can say and how can
they remember that so it is essential

00:37:59.400 --> 00:37:59.410
they remember that so it is essential
 

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.410
they remember that so it is essential
that we're offering a place where the

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:01.420
that we're offering a place where the
 

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.930
that we're offering a place where the
user can go back and check again what

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:03.940
user can go back and check again what

they can say in order to get to a
 

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.339
they can say in order to get to a
specific result we thought it makes

00:38:08.339 --> 00:38:08.349
specific result we thought it makes
 

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:10.170
specific result we thought it makes
sense to just offer one long list

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:10.180
sense to just offer one long list
 

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.420
sense to just offer one long list
everything in one place people will find

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:12.430
everything in one place people will find

usability studies we found that this is

00:38:17.249 --> 00:38:17.259
usability studies we found that this is
 

00:38:17.259 --> 00:38:20.279
usability studies we found that this is
actually not the case people get lost

00:38:20.279 --> 00:38:20.289
actually not the case people get lost
 

00:38:20.289 --> 00:38:22.380
actually not the case people get lost
along the long list they even forgot

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:22.390
along the long list they even forgot
 

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.180
along the long list they even forgot
what they were looking for because they

what they were looking for because they
 

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.740
what they were looking for because they
were so overwhelmed by all the stuff

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:25.750
were so overwhelmed by all the stuff
 

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.109
were so overwhelmed by all the stuff
that we offer in there and also the way

for them so what did we do if you see on

00:38:36.539 --> 00:38:36.549
for them so what did we do if you see on
 

00:38:36.549 --> 00:38:38.160

we based we have categories now so we

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:40.930
we based we have categories now so we
 

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.990
we based we have categories now so we
have basics of navigation gestures and

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000
have basics of navigation gestures and
 

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.200
have basics of navigation gestures and
text editing and with those the users

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:46.210
text editing and with those the users
 

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.450

that the user actually gets specific
examples of the voice action that they

00:38:56.819 --> 00:38:56.829
examples of the voice action that they
 

00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:59.819
examples of the voice action that they
can take and by doing so we actually had

00:38:59.819 --> 00:38:59.829
can take and by doing so we actually had
 

00:38:59.829 --> 00:39:01.499
can take and by doing so we actually had
much better results that users were able

00:39:01.499 --> 00:39:01.509
much better results that users were able
 

00:39:01.509 --> 00:39:04.349
much better results that users were able
to find what they were saying and also

00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359
to find what they were saying and also
 

00:39:04.359 --> 00:39:06.299
to find what they were saying and also
for remembering later on where to find

00:39:06.299 --> 00:39:06.309
for remembering later on where to find
 

00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:09.359

I'd like to show you is our tutorial
 

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.670
I'd like to show you is our tutorial
again having a really good tutorial is

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:14.680
again having a really good tutorial is
 

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.470
again having a really good tutorial is
crucial especially if people have not

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480
crucial especially if people have not
 

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.900

to navigate the interface we wanted to

00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:21.819
to navigate the interface we wanted to
 

00:39:21.819 --> 00:39:24.749
to navigate the interface we wanted to
make it as real as possible so we took a

00:39:24.749 --> 00:39:24.759
make it as real as possible so we took a
 

00:39:24.759 --> 00:39:26.400
make it as real as possible so we took a
screenshot of the interface and

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:26.410
screenshot of the interface and
 

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.309
screenshot of the interface and
explained it to the users what we didn't

00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319
explained it to the users what we didn't
 

00:39:29.319 --> 00:39:32.309
explained it to the users what we didn't
expect was that users would want to

00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:32.319
expect was that users would want to
 

00:39:32.319 --> 00:39:34.079
expect was that users would want to
interact with this screenshot and

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:34.089
interact with this screenshot and
 

00:39:34.089 --> 00:39:35.400
interact with this screenshot and
wouldn't distinguish between a

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:35.410
wouldn't distinguish between a
 

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:39.809
wouldn't distinguish between a
screenshot versus the real product so we

00:39:39.809 --> 00:39:39.819
screenshot versus the real product so we
 

00:39:39.819 --> 00:39:41.370
screenshot versus the real product so we
took that learning back

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:41.380
took that learning back
 

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.200
took that learning back
and we designed the experience as you

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:43.210
and we designed the experience as you
 

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.650

explaining the functionality so this is
how to use the numbers what God had

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:51.340
how to use the numbers what God had
 

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.810
how to use the numbers what God had
demoed before and we did have numbers

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:54.820
demoed before and we did have numbers
 

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.330
demoed before and we did have numbers
now on the screen but those are real so

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:57.340
now on the screen but those are real so
 

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.830
now on the screen but those are real so
you can interact with them so the user

00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:58.840
you can interact with them so the user
 

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.570
you can interact with them so the user
is learning about it immediately and

might not meet everybody's expectations

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:57.210
might not meet everybody's expectations
 

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:59.670
might not meet everybody's expectations
so based on these questions then you'll

00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680
so based on these questions then you'll
 

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.920
so based on these questions then you'll
identify tasks that will help you answer

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:01.930
identify tasks that will help you answer
 

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.350
identify tasks that will help you answer
these questions so for example if a

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:04.360
these questions so for example if a
 

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.650
these questions so for example if a
question was our usual users able to on

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:07.660
question was our usual users able to on
 

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.770
question was our usual users able to on

boil it down to these four key steps

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:34.370
boil it down to these four key steps
 

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.460
boil it down to these four key steps

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:36.470
asking the users to perform the tests
 

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.230
asking the users to perform the tests
and then taking a step back and just

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240
and then taking a step back and just
 

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.780
and then taking a step back and just
observing them seeing what are they

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:40.790
observing them seeing what are they
 

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.820

spots are they using a keyboard what
keyboard shortcuts are they using and

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:48.320
keyboard shortcuts are they using and
 

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.080
keyboard shortcuts are they using and
that leads to the next point which is

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:50.090
that leads to the next point which is
 

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.600
that leads to the next point which is
