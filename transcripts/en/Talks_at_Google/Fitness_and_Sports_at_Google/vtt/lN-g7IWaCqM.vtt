00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:17.520
MIKE ABRAMS: All right.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.950
Thanks, everyone,
for being here.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.990
For those of you who don't know
me, my name is Mike Abrams.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.490
I'm going to be
moderating today.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.770
We've got three
wonderful guests here.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.667
So to my right, we have
the driver of the 98 car.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:29.750
You're going to be starting
in the third position.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.720
The defending champion
of the Indy 500 driving

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.080
for Andretti Autosport,
Alexander Rossi.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:42.800
Next to Alex, we have the
driver of the number four car,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.750
starting in the 26th position.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.850
This is your fourth Indy 500.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.976
Driving for AJ Foyt, Conor Daly.

00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:51.772
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:55.985
And last, but not least, I
could do the introduction,

00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:57.720
but I think you
can do it better.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.800
I know you have a historic
way of introducing yourself.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.650

Host of the Snake Pit.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.817
MIKE ABRAMS: MCing the
Snake Pit this year.

00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:15.150
So let's start with an easy one.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.930
There's a lot of people
here that probably are less

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.200
familiar with the Indy 500.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380
So for all three of
you, what's the 500 mean

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.070
to you and the month of May
in Indianapolis, in general?

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.900
CONOR DALY: I'll go first.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.150
Well, the 500, for
me, is my home race.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.840
Born and raised in Indy, so
I love it for that reason.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.990
It's always been sort of the
Super Bowl, the World Series,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.320
everything combined, for me.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530
It's just the biggest
thing that we have.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.990
And it's a month
long, so it's awesome.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.950
I love it.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.960
Would mean the most to win
that for me, as for any driver,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.370
I think.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.040
But yeah, just an amazing event.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.810
And if you haven't
been, for sure,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.190
I'd say give it
a chance some day

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.420
because it will surprise you.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.390
MIKE ABRAMS: Alex,
what about you?

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.720
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Yeah.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.760
Like Conor said, I mean,
it's the biggest, not only

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.620
race in the world, but
biggest single-day sporting

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.786
event in the world, as well.

00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:06.310
So it's a pretty
special experience

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.236
and as a racing driver, it's
one of the three main events

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:11.110
that you want to win.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.020
So a lot of effort goes
into it from all of us,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.530
from all of the teams,
and it all comes to a head

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.510
here in a couple of days.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.655
MIKE ABRAMS: Now, Ric,
will this be your first 500

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:22.780
or have you been before?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.321
RIC FLAIR: This will
be my first 500,

00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:28.180
but actually, Indianapolis
is where I was--

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.180
my first WrestleMania,
WrestleMania VIII,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.290
against Randy Savage.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.260
So I've always been a fan of
Indy and Peyton and Larry Bird.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.790
And it's a great sport city.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.707
And it's not that I
couldn't have gone, I just--

00:02:43.707 --> 00:02:45.290
probably, my schedule
didn't allow it.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.790
But I'm really
looking forward to it

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.990
and when I heard my-- when this
opportunity became available,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.330
I just said, god,
please figure me in.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.790
And then I've had a great time
today with these gentlemen.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.040
And they're the
most courageous--

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.980
they are the most
courageous athletes alive.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.580
And no, I'm not going for a
ride with Marco Andretti, OK?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.580
Sorry.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.130
Don't even suggest it, please.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.620
CONOR DALY: You
got to do it, man.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.805
You got to do it.

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:11.919
RIC FLAIR: Nada, nada.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.960
I'll have a heart attack
and he'll have one, too.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.760
That'd be all we need.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.720
Where's the needs?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.455
Upside down.

00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:20.950
MIKE ABRAMS: Conor,
you mentioned

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.991
you're an Indiana native.

00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:25.360
So what's the entire month
of May like in Indiana

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.980
from before you were
a driver to now,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.170
as you are racing in the 500?

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.330
CONOR DALY: It's always
our biggest thing.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.410
Even downtown Indianapolis, they
put all the drivers' last names

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.240
on street signs all
around the city.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.026
So it's one of those things
where there's billboards

00:03:40.026 --> 00:03:41.650
everywhere, there
are signs everywhere.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.700
It's our biggest
event by a long way.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.220
You know, even when
we had the Super Bowl,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.880
the Indy 500 still just
blows it out of the water,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.580
just for sheer
magnitude and the amount

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.660
of people that are there.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.368
Just even over the
weekend in qualifying,

00:03:57.368 --> 00:03:59.950
last weekend in qualifying,
thousands of people there.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.290
We have Carb Day
coming up on Friday.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.400
100,000 people there.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.640
Race day, obviously, over
300,000, 350,000 people there.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.200
So it's just massive.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.680
And the city really embraces
it, which is really cool.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.990
And it makes us feel
special, as well.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.860
MIKE ABRAMS: So Alex, I know
you were a big football fan.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.140
What got you into
racing at a young age?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.020
ALEXANDER ROSSI: My father.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.720
He was just a motor sports fan.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.600
He went to races with his father
and when I was 10 years old,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.950
he took me to Las
Vegas for reasons

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.800
that most people
don't go to Las Vegas.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.040
But it was to do a
three-day go-cart school.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.710
And it was supposed to be a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.510
And I fell in love
with the sport

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.350
and started racing go karts
and here we are at Google.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.542
So right on.

00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:54.000
MIKE ABRAMS: And Conor, your
dad was a professional driver.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.666
So was there ever any
doubt in your mind

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:57.921
that you were going to
go into race driving?

00:04:57.921 --> 00:04:58.920
CONOR DALY: I guess not.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.740
Yeah, he was-- he did
some stuff in race cars

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.390
and then moved to Indiana.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.890
And then--

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.740
ALEXANDER ROSSI: What did he do?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.031
CONOR DALY: He just circulated.

00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.180
He circulated for many times.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.760
And he met my mom when he
came to do the Indy 500

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.610
and he never left.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.320
So that was-- and then I came
to be and then he stopped racing

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.020
and, sadly, I got
into it and I think

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.610
he was forced to
stay in it himself.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.791
So it's just a
family thing for us.

00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:23.290
We love it.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.210
He loves it still.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.440
I love it.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.772
Very lucky to be doing it.

00:05:26.772 --> 00:05:28.230
I mean, there's
not a lot of people

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.710
who can really, really live
their dream and, you know,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.172
that's what I'm
doing, so it's cool.

00:05:35.172 --> 00:05:36.630
MIKE ABRAMS: And
Ric, you're widely

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.060
regarded as the greatest
professional wrestler

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.110
of all time.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.200

RIC FLAIR: I'm glad you
didn't say, one of, OK?

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.140
MIKE ABRAMS: The,
the, the greatest.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.580
RIC FLAIR: I'm just kidding.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.330
MIKE ABRAMS: You know,
what's exciting you

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.020
most about being part of
the festivities of the 500?

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.680
RIC FLAIR: Well,
I was just going

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.680
to ask these guys because
I'm thinking about it.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.220
When we have WrestleMania,
you know, the 500

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.140
is our WrestleMania.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.450
And we bring--

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.020
I know, when we go to--

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.640
we just came out of Orlando and
we brought, like, $50 million

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.660
worth of money, maybe $60
million, into the community.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.840
And I'm just thinking to
myself, how much money

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.472
comes along with the race?

00:06:20.472 --> 00:06:22.680
And I'm not talking about
prize money for the driver.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.950
I'm talking about the economy.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.864
I'm sure every
hotel is sold out.

00:06:26.864 --> 00:06:28.530
I better find out
where I'm staying now.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.140
And it's not going
to be the courtyard.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.710
Don't do courtyards or taxis.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.800
But I'm just thinking, my god,
it's got to be overwhelming.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.730
And Indianapolis is such
a great city, my god.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.580
Great bars, great night
life, nice people.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.594
Indiana is a good state, period.

CONOR DALY: Thank you.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.490
Appreciate that.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.740
RIC FLAIR: No, it's the truth.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.315
CONOR DALY: I like it, too.

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:57.690
RIC FLAIR: We got to work on
the Indiana basketball team.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.690
CONOR DALY: Yeah, we do.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.230
We do.

the football team's

00:07:02.323 --> 00:07:04.830
not great, either, is it?

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.952
Let's be honest.

00:07:06.952 --> 00:07:07.910

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.849

doesn't feel good, does it?

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.040

about last year's race,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.790
the 100th running.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.200
It was a historic race.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.520
Conor, can you speak to what
leading up to the 100th running

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.720
was like, and all the hype
around this monumental race?

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.270
CONOR DALY: Well, it was
cool, that's for sure.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.910
And I guess he enjoyed
it a little bit more

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.510
than the rest of us.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.490
But yeah, I mean, the 100th
was cool to be a part of that.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.100
I mean, there's not
many events that

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.660
are in their 100th
running, so it

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.870
was really cool to just
be a part of history,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.927
start the next 100 years.

00:07:47.927 --> 00:07:50.010
You know, obviously now,
this year with the 101st.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.690
So incredible what the
city did, as he was saying.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.370
The state of Indiana,
you know, it's

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.520
huge for Indiana, the economy,
the people, everything.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.290
So it was awesome for us.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.960
We sold it out, which is--

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.460
I mean, that's a lot of people.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.480
So it was really cool.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.190
And then a young American
gentleman was the winner,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.200
so that helped for just America.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.140
And that was good.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.570
So I liked that.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.599
I mean, I had a horrible
time, but that doesn't matter.

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.890
MIKE ABRAMS: Well, Alex,
let's talk about your victory.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.830
You won using a fairly
bold fuel strategy.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.296
What was going through your
mind, went into the decision,

00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:29.670
knowing that you
were running out

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.005
of fuel in the last few laps?

00:08:32.005 --> 00:08:33.630
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
Well, we really didn't

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:38.610
have a choice because
of some scenarios

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.140
that happened during the race.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.570
We had to go off
sequence to everyone else

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.450
and it put us in
a position to be

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.849
in some pretty severe
fuel-saving at the end,

00:08:48.849 --> 00:08:51.390
to the point where I actually
ran out of fuel on the last lap

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.950
and the engine was off and
I coasted across the line.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.550
So I don't necessarily want to
have to go through that again

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.730
because it was pretty chaotic
for everyone involved.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.970
But when you're
in the car, you're

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.704
just focused on the
job you need to do

00:09:04.704 --> 00:09:06.120
and you take it
one lap at a time.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.280
I mean, everyone in their
respective professions,

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.650
when you get involved in
something, it's kind of--

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.280
it's a subconscious
thing that happens.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.230
So it's the same thing
for us and you just

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.356
try and execute and maximize
everything that you have.

00:09:19.356 --> 00:09:20.980
MIKE ABRAMS: And as
defending champion,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.430
you've gotten to do some
pretty cool experiences,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.490
shooting at an intermission
at a Blackhawks game,

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:26.490
throwing out the first--

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.450
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
It's not that cool.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.990
MIKE ABRAMS: Throwing out the
first pitch of the Cubs game.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.900
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
Also not that cool.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.025
MIKE ABRAMS: What's been
your favorite thing you've

00:09:33.025 --> 00:09:35.240
done as defending champion,
non-racing related?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.296
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
Well, this, obviously.

00:09:38.296 --> 00:09:40.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.260
I mean, you think about Google
as like this one page of stuff.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
You don't think of it as
this entire city block,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.810
so it's pretty cool to be
here and it's pretty awesome.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.540
CONOR DALY: I just think of
"The Internship," the movie.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.700
That's my favorite movie.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.512
I love it.

00:09:53.512 --> 00:09:54.720
ALEXANDER ROSSI: He's-- yeah.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:01.220
Anyway, for me, the highlight
was the SBs in June.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.930
And it was because I got to--

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.000
I mean, I got to meet Cam
Newton, LeBron, Kobe, I mean,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.600
sports idols and icons, right?

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.090
Which is pretty spectacular.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.590
And to share an
evening with them,

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.500
honoring their kind of
success over the year

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.540
was pretty special.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.370
RIC FLAIR: Are you a LeBron man?

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.760
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Oh, yeah.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.400
RIC FLAIR: All right, man.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:20.899
Me, too.

00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:22.680
ALEXANDER ROSSI: He's
the king, isn't he?

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.471
RIC FLAIR: I had to
tell the commissioner--

00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:26.030
I had to give him
the heads-up, man.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.170
How he's not the
MVP over and over.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.910
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Last game
wasn't great, though, for him,

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:29.409
was it?

00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:30.080
18 points.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.746
RIC FLAIR: Yeah.

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:31.357
But that's OK.

00:10:31.357 --> 00:10:32.190
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.320
ALEXANDER ROSSI: We'll
be all right, yeah.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.520
RIC FLAIR: I wouldn't
want to be there tonight.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.380
I mean, I wanted to be, but--

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.030
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
You're here with us.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.690
RIC FLAIR: --thing about that,
I can't go to LeBron tonight

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:39.648
because I'm here today.

00:10:39.648 --> 00:10:42.590
Can't make the flight, so.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.436
But I'm glad to be here.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:45.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.280
I want to be on the
good side of Google.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.490
God only knows they've
exhausted me a couple times.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.460
I just Googled you.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.190
OK, really?

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.731
That's nice.

00:10:55.731 --> 00:10:56.730
Does that really happen?

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.540
No.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.470
CONOR DALY: Allegedly.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.444
RIC FLAIR: Yeah.

00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:03.860
MIKE ABRAMS: So
let's change gears

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.909
to talk about the Snake Pit.

00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:07.450
Conor, being the
Indiana native, I'll

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.574
let you-- for everyone
that's not familiar with it,

00:11:09.574 --> 00:11:11.720
can you kind of give an
explanation of what it is

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.070
and how it's evolved
the last few years.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.170
CONOR DALY: Absolutely.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.780
The Snake Pit was big
in the '70s, I believe.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.910
I wasn't alive at
that time, but they

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.790
used to, like, burn couches and
have crazy stuff go on there.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.140
Obviously, a drinking festival.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.340
But there was also the Indy
500 going on at the same time.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.030
And it sort of went away-ish.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.010
I think people discovered--

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.620
to be more civilized.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.780
But then, now, we're
bringing it back, obviously,

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:47.310
because it's all about a
good EDM rave these days.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.080
And so now, the last
few years, we've

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.960
had incredible electronic music
artists playing from 8:00 AM

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.020
to 3:00 PM in the afternoon.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.030
It's like our own music
festival inside of turn three.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.074
We fit 30,000, 40,000
people inside of turn three

00:12:06.074 --> 00:12:07.490
and there's still
a race going on.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.280
And there's still
239,000 permanent seats

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.860
sold out for the race.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.570
And a lot of people
don't even know

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.140
that there's a race going on
if they're in the Snake Pit

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:23.000
because, obviously,
they're upside-down wasted,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.270
but it's a great time,
from what I've heard.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:25.590
RIC FLAIR: Hate that, hate that.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:26.860
CONOR DALY: Yeah, right?

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.664
And Ric's going to
be there and he's

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:30.080
going to be hooting
and hollering.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.575
And--

00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:32.520
ALEXANDER ROSSI: But you'll
be there, as well, won't you?

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.350
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.400
Ric's going to be the MC.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.500
I'm going to be there
for 28 minutes, I think,

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.700
and that's all I can do.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.570
From like, 9:45 to
about 10:15-ish.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.430
But I love that music.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.340
We've got Zed, Marshmallow,
RL Grime, Adventure Club,

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.500
and Action Bronson
playing this year.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.710
So that should be
a decent lineup.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.880
And yeah, it's
changed massively,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.840
but it's really cool.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.100
I mean, it's an
actual music festival,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.340
which is something we don't
have in Indiana at all.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.980
But going on right in the center
of the massive race, as well.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.030
So it's incredible and I think
Ric's going to really enjoy it.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.270
He's going to be the
leader of it all.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.100
We need a good leader
in the Snake Pit.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.060
RIC FLAIR: I'm
certainly going to try.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.900
Woo.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.812
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:15.812 --> 00:13:18.020
But I'm looking forward to--
because I didn't realize

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.519
that both these gentlemen are
single and they live together.

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:25.460
If my fiance will let me,
I'm going to the after party.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.430
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Can
we clarify the live--

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.390
yeah.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.140
RIC FLAIR: Well, you
guys share a mansion.

00:13:33.026 --> 00:13:33.650
CONOR DALY: No.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.483
ALEXANDER ROSSI: No.

00:13:34.483 --> 00:13:35.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.630
CONOR DALY: If I mansion
is-- how many square footage

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.690
is that?

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.440
17?

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.400
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
He rents a room.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.024
CONOR DALY: I rent
a room at his house.

00:13:42.024 --> 00:13:43.010
RIC FLAIR: OK.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:43.550
CONOR DALY: That's what I do.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.260
RIC FLAIR: What I was saying--

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.593
CONOR DALY: But I'm single
and I'm ready to party, yeah.

00:13:46.593 --> 00:13:47.750
RIC FLAIR: I wanted--

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.497
are you married?

00:13:48.497 --> 00:13:49.330
ALEXANDER ROSSI: No.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.918
RIC FLAIR: Oh, I
didn't think so.

00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:55.070
I want to go to the after party.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:55.772
Are you kidding?

00:13:55.772 --> 00:13:56.480
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.570
Well, hey, the plan is for
you to recruit for the after

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.679
party in the Snake Pit.

00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:01.970
RIC FLAIR: Well, I can do that.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.610
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.110
My man.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.332
RIC FLAIR: [WHISTLES] Hey, you.

00:14:06.332 --> 00:14:09.158
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:09.158 --> 00:14:10.370
CONOR DALY: There we go.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.840
Now the after party is
going to be really good.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.215
RIC FLAIR: Give me some keys
and I'll just pass them out.

00:14:14.215 --> 00:14:15.388
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:17.461
CONOR DALY: 15, yeah.

00:14:17.461 --> 00:14:18.500
15 room keys.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.958
RIC FLAIR: I'll
cover you, brother.

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.240
Don't worry about that.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.596
I know how to throw a party.

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:25.970
MIKE ABRAMS: So Ric, you are
hosting the Snake Pit party.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.967
Do you have anything
special planned for it?

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.300
RIC FLAIR: No, I'm just excited.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.780
I didn't realize--
never having gone,

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.420
I didn't even know
what the Snake Pit was.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.870
I'm just a big fan of
the Indianapolis race.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.946
I'm from NASCAR Country,
but to me, it's just totally

00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:42.820
two different things.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.410
And like I said, our
NASCAR guys are--

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.960
they drive fast and
hard, too, but there's

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.100
a lot more protection.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.130
You know, especially
since Dale got killed,

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.460
they got the helmets and
they're locked in pretty good.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.960
But these guys, man, 230 miles
an hour in an open cockpit.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.250
I mean, jeez.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:08.680
I've been in an F-16
and I didn't like that.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.450
But it's amazing.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.460
I'm just really
looking forward to it

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.310
and enjoying the experience.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.760
And my fiance-- you forgot Keith
Urban is going to be there.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.860
She is flipped already.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.049
Yes, I'm going to get
you backstage, OK?

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:25.840
CONOR DALY: It's a
party the whole weekend.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.520
Keith Urban's there Saturday.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.205
RIC FLAIR: Yeah.

00:15:29.205 --> 00:15:30.580
MIKE ABRAMS: So
Alex and Conor, I

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.470
know you guys are going
230 miles an hour,

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.886
but do you feel a
different energy

00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:37.122
when you come around turn
three and fly by that party?

00:15:37.122 --> 00:15:38.080
CONOR DALY: Absolutely.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.070
It smells a little
different, but yeah.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.370
No, don't you remember that?

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.710
ALEXANDER ROSSI: What
energy do you have coming--

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.130
CONOR DALY: I love it.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.004
I just-- because I know
what's going on there

00:15:47.004 --> 00:15:48.170
and I'm excited about it.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.860
You guys might think
differently, but I love it.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.725
I love it.

00:15:53.725 --> 00:15:55.180
You can't really see it.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.860
You can see-- it's hard to--

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.200
when we're racing,
we don't see anything

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.180
except for what's going
on around us, obviously.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.920
That sounded terrible.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.880
But it's on the pace
lap, when you leave

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.114
the grid for the first lap.

00:16:08.114 --> 00:16:09.530
That's when you--
and you're going

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.170
just-- we're doing 100 miles
an hour as our pace car speed.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.930
And we're just like-- but
100 is really slow for us,

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:18.462
so we're inching along
and you see the people.

00:16:18.462 --> 00:16:20.170
I think that's the
most incredible thing.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.786
You just see this entire
facility just full.

00:16:23.786 --> 00:16:24.910
I mean, what did you think?

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.930
That That was your first
one, so was that surprising?

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.140
Did you like that?

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.056
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Yeah.

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.000
CONOR DALY: Yeah, see?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.660
It was awesome.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.180
MIKE ABRAMS: And Conor, you
made a surprise visit last year

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.430
in full suit and helmet--

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.760
CONOR DALY: Yes.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.093
MIKE ABRAMS: --to the Snake Pit.

00:16:40.093 --> 00:16:40.870
CONOR DALY: I did.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.000
MIKE ABRAMS: How was that and
were you the only person fully

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.080
clothed at that point?

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.830
CONOR DALY: Yes.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.660
I had three layers
of fireproof clothing

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:52.150
on at an 80-degree event,
rave, crazy day party.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.820
I went up into the
crowd and people started

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.780
spraying me with cheap beer.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.400
And I was covered in
Bush Light by the time

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.280
I got back to my strategy
meeting for the race.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.460
But it was awesome.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.069
It was so cool.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.130
And I will be there again
and I might wear a poncho

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.520
this time though.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.260
It's frowned upon to show
up to a motor race smelling

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.270
of alcohol, I think.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:18.216 --> 00:17:21.190
But it was a great time.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.646
MIKE ABRAMS: So let's switch
gears to this year's race.

00:17:23.646 --> 00:17:25.520
Let's talk a little bit
about qualifications.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.190
You guys had some
challenging weather

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.260
limiting the opportunities.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.620
Alex, you had a pretty rough day
one by having to sit in the car

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.537
while they cleaned up
the track after a wreck.

00:17:34.537 --> 00:17:36.703
What goes through your mind
as you're sitting there,

00:17:36.703 --> 00:17:38.110
I think, unknown
what's going on,

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:42.495
and you only have one
attempt on that day?

00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:44.620
ALEXANDER ROSSI: The main
thing is just making sure

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.840
that Sebastian was OK.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.132
And that's where all
your attention goes,

00:17:50.132 --> 00:17:52.590
so you don't really care about
anything else at that point.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.240
Because all of us
are competitors,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.870
but very close at the same time.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.340
So it was a really
big hit and when

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.740
you see that, you
don't really quite know

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.060
what the immediate outcome is.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.670
So once you find out
he's OK, then you

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.620
just go through your
routine, your process,

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.409
and you go out and do
what you need to do.

00:18:11.409 --> 00:18:13.700
MIKE ABRAMS: Day two, you
guys had some better weather,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.658
but you still didn't have
as much practice time

00:18:15.658 --> 00:18:16.930
as you probably wanted.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.060
How do you guys make
adjustments on the fly

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.760
with really, again,
one attempt to qualify

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.960
with limited practice?

00:18:25.435 --> 00:18:26.810
CONOR DALY: It's
really difficult

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.830
because to go out
there and really push

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.970
these cars at the limit--

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.510
I mean, he was going a little
quicker than I was at 231.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.840
But we qualified at 226.5
and that still felt--

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.740
that was a really
difficult run for me

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.620
because we haven't really
been able to get our car very

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.220
comfortable the whole time.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.560
And when you're doing that
speed, you feel everything.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.840
You feel everything in the car.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.270
If you have one moment, you
end up in bad shape really,

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.440
really quickly.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.199
So it's challenging, but in the
end, it's qualifying for Indy

00:19:01.199 --> 00:19:02.740
and you know, for
four laps, you have

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.990
to go out there and
eliminate every emotion,

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.410
every thought other than
doing the best four laps

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.650
that you can because
it is very important.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.990
The race is obviously
what we all care about,

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.920
but qualifying is also--

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.120
the further up the grid
you start, the better.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.052
But it's one of those
things that, in the end,

00:19:23.052 --> 00:19:24.260
the race is all that matters.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.789
But qualifying, I think
just from a history

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:28.330
standpoint at the
Indy 500, is always

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:29.997
very cool and very important.

00:19:29.997 --> 00:19:32.330
MIKE ABRAMS: So speaking a
little bit about the history,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.120
you guys both drive for
teams with Indy 500 legends.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.490
Conor, you with AJ, and then
Alex, you with the Andrettis.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.740
What's it like, as
they help you prepare,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.250
to have that much history
and that much knowledge

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.270
on your team?

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.970
And then what's it also like
just having a famous boss,

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.304
celebrities around the track?

00:19:51.304 --> 00:19:52.220
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Yeah.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.550
Driving for Michael is
a pretty huge privilege

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.550
and I was very fortunate,
as a rookie last year,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.210
to come in and have that
amount of depth and knowledge

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:02.320
to rely upon.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.600
And not only did I
have Michael and Mario,

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.220
but my car was actually a
part of another team, which

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.100
was owned by another
driver named Bryan Herta.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.760
And they merged with Andretti
and so I had Brian, as well.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.970
And that's just a wealth of
information and knowledge

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.940
to sponge off of them.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.730
And they're very successful
and, you know, my teammates,

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.300
as well.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.758
Marco Andretti and
Ryan Hunter-Reay

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:29.410
are hugely successful at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:33.550
So I had a lot of very
helpful people around me

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.420
and it was great.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.770
And Michael is a very,
very cool guy to work for.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.900
CONOR DALY: And AJ is just
an old school American hero.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.290
He's still shouting and cursing
and wishing he was still

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.880
in the car at 82 years old.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.340
But he's awesome.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.470
He's still passionate about it.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.590
He still wants to win, even
though he's not in the car.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.450
But we're trying
our best for him

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.480
because it'd be cool to get
him back to victory lane.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.784
Because he's just a badass
dude, so that's awesome.

00:21:05.784 --> 00:21:08.200
MIKE ABRAMS: So there's a lot
of ways to win the Indy 500,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.791
also a lot of ways to lose it.

00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:11.540
And I think, for the
novice fans out here,

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.660
there's probably not a
true understanding of all

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.450
the technology, to teammates,
to everything in between that

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.560
goes into winning.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.035
What goes into having a good
winning strategy for the 500?

00:21:22.035 --> 00:21:23.660
CONOR DALY: Fuel
strategy, right, Alex?

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.364
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.270
ALEXANDER ROSSI: That's
one of the ways, yeah.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.830
I mean, a lot.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.580
Let's take Andretti
Autosport for example.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.420
There's 200 people that
work on the program.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.180
So it's a very big operation.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.810
You have everything from your
normal day-to-day mechanics,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.430
engineers, to sim engineers to
guys who are in the wind tunnel

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.210
and shaker rig.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.840
And it's a big program
to run race cars.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.740
And as much as it appears
to be an individual sport,

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.590
with the drivers getting
most of the attention,

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.040
it's probably one of the biggest
teams sports in the world

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.115
because you can--

00:22:02.115 --> 00:22:04.490
it doesn't matter how good of
a race car driver you are--

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.230
and Conor can probably
talk to this a little bit.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.770
But if you don't have
the equipment to win,

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.422
there's nothing you
can do about it.

00:22:12.422 --> 00:22:15.490
CONOR DALY: Yeah, it's tough.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.280
The strategy is to win
any way you can, right?

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.830
So there's multiple
ways to do it.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.790
Some obviously, he has 200
people on their team working.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.830
We have about 25
on our two cars.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.160
So it's a little different.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.275
But they're still-- we
all still go out and race

00:22:32.275 --> 00:22:36.160
and compete against each
other at a very high level.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.780
But it's a challenging sport.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.200
There are a lot of
really incredible talents

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.910
that we race against and
a lot of really good teams

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.100
with a lot of really
good, smart engineers.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.860
So it's tough no matter what,
but that's why we do it.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.812
That's why we compete.

00:22:52.812 --> 00:22:54.520
MIKE ABRAMS: Since we
are here at Google,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.290
talk to us a little
bit about the data

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.248
that you guys accumulate
during practice rounds

00:22:58.248 --> 00:23:00.370
and the engineers that
help you to formulate

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.640
your strategy on race day.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.960
CONOR DALY: Data is everything.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.120
We have sensors on
every part of the car.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.400
It's streaming live
to the pit stands

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.950
so our engineers can look at it.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.450
It's very important
for us, as well,

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.240
especially at the Indy
500 because everything

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.140
is so crucial.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.410
The thousandth of every--
you know, every degree,

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.130
every temperature of
the tire, every sensor,

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.700
all the arrow data that we
see, supremely important.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:34.400
So we rely on technology
a lot and it's

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.890
one of those things
that is always evolving.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.620
So it's cool to
see the next level

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.837
of what we get every year.

00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:43.670
ALEXANDER ROSSI: The
hardest thing, I think,

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.190
is correlating real-life
data to sim data.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.200
Because the speedway
is all about finding

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.690
the balance between downforce
and drag and how much grip

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:57.690
you want to take away
from the car to go quicker

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.150
in a straight line.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.090
There's a lot of different
aerodynamic builds

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.120
that you can have with
different packages of components

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.260
and parts.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.700
And wind tunnel and sim data
often gives you a direction,

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.980
but there's quite a few
times where it's wrong,

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.771
and so you're trying
to spend a lot of time

00:24:13.771 --> 00:24:15.460
correlating it back to reality.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.010
And that's where a lot of the
differences are made, I think,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.230
at Indianapolis,
specifically, among teams.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:28.270
You're measuring that with
everything from load cells

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.390
to pitot tubes to strain gauges.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.880
It's a lot of very,
very involved things

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.880
that is fascinating
to be a part of

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.207
and cool to work with every day.

00:24:39.207 --> 00:24:41.040
MIKE ABRAMS: So the
million-dollar question,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.272
how are the cars running
for the 101st running?

00:24:44.272 --> 00:24:45.230
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Sweet.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.420
I'm pretty happy.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.610
CONOR DALY: Less
than ideal, but I

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.121
got a positive outlook on life,
so the glass is half full,

00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:53.620
guys.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.646
It's going to be a great time.

00:24:55.646 --> 00:24:56.770
We're coming from the back.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.061
It's going to be a great story.

00:24:58.061 --> 00:24:59.061
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:59.254 --> 00:25:00.670
And that's what
I'm excited about.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.340
Ric's going to be there in
victory lane with the milk

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.067
and we're going to
have a great time.

00:25:05.067 --> 00:25:06.400
So yeah, I'm excited about that.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.070
You going to drink the
milk with me if we win?

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.156
RIC FLAIR: Yeah.

00:25:08.156 --> 00:25:09.940
And I'm going to
kiss the bricks, too.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.590
CONOR DALY: Oh, yeah.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.920
Absolutely.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.750
RIC FLAIR: I'll
be doing all that.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.458
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:25:12.458 --> 00:25:13.417
I love it.

00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:15.250
MIKE ABRAMS: And Ric,
you have a "30 for 30"

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.060
coming out this year.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:16.430
RIC FLAIR: Yes.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:17.971
MIKE ABRAMS: Is
there anything that's

00:25:17.971 --> 00:25:19.307
going to surprise people?

00:25:19.307 --> 00:25:20.890
RIC FLAIR: I'm worried
a lot of people

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.431
are going to think
that it's fantasy.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.140
I've led a pretty
interesting life,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.820
as you can google and see.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.320
But yeah, I'm real
excited about it.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.150
It's going to be almost
two hours, I think.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.700
It comes out September
8, so I'm excited.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.756
It's been two years
in the making.

00:25:38.756 --> 00:25:43.770
There's a lot of people involved
in it, so I'm excited about it.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.070
You know, there's
obviously-- it discusses

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.040
some ups and lows, which
everybody, unfortunately,

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.379
experiences in life.

00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:52.920
You're too young to have ever
experienced anything like that.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.580
But you know, there's good
things and bad things.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.596
But I think, for
the most part, I'm

00:25:57.596 --> 00:25:59.720
excited because I'm the
first wrestler they've ever

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.040
done anything like that with.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.430
And everybody I know--

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.290
I'm very close to
Evander Holyfield.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:09.040
Anybody that's done a "30 for
30" has raised their incomes

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.331
dream major on the weekends for
speaking engagements and stuff

00:26:14.331 --> 00:26:14.830
like that.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.480
So bring it, baby.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.321
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.580
Yeah, I got four ex-wives.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.650
I'm the only guy
allowed to pay alimony

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.070
to three women at one time.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.570
Yep.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.030
And I'm still humping, guys.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.320
By that, I meant humping
the road, working.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.170
Working, I meant.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.050
Excuse me.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.710
Yeah, excuse me.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.469
So yeah.

00:26:38.469 --> 00:26:39.760
CONOR DALY: My hero right here.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.270
RIC FLAIR: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:41.770
Yeah.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.752
I'm really--

00:26:43.752 --> 00:26:45.210
MIKE ABRAMS: So on
that note, we're

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.876
going to open up the
audience questions.

00:26:46.876 --> 00:26:49.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.060
There is a mic over here and
while people are lining up

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.500
for questions, I had a couple of
fun ones that we wanted to ask.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.286
So for Alex and Conor,
if you were a wrestler,

00:26:59.286 --> 00:27:00.660
what would your
wrestling name be

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.410
and what would
your go-to move be?

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:05.620
CONOR DALY: Randy Cool.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.850
I think that's what my name--

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.890
that's actually my name.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.510
My engineer gave
it to me last year.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.510
MIKE ABRAMS: Randy Cool?

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:14.159
CONOR DALY: Because
it's my name just with--

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:15.200
what is that, an anagram?

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.220
Is that where your different
letters, or you can create

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.040
words?

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:19.260
I don't know.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:19.630
I didn't go to college.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:20.560
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Don't
use words you don't know.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.077
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:27:22.077 --> 00:27:22.660
I didn't get--

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.390
RIC FLAIR: Well, for now
on, you're Randy Cool to me

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:24.790
for sure.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.900
I like-- that's a cool name.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.150
CONOR DALY: There you go, see?

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.702
RIC FLAIR: Hey, Randy Cool.

00:27:28.702 --> 00:27:30.550
Hey, sweetheart,
come meet Randy Cool.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:30.640
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Are you
saying Ric Flair is not

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.557
your real name?

00:27:31.557 --> 00:27:32.390
CONOR DALY: Oh, man.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:33.265
RIC FLAIR: Ric Flair?

00:27:33.265 --> 00:27:34.484
It's not my real name.

00:27:34.484 --> 00:27:35.650
I never changed it, legally.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.233
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Who
would've thought?

00:27:37.233 --> 00:27:39.820
RIC FLAIR: But
you call me Slick.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.680
My friends call me "Nay-tch."

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.510
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.210
Nature boy right here.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.650
MIKE ABRAMS: And Ric,
for Alex and Conor,

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.660
can you do one of your
patented hype videos

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.569
for them for the
101st running so they

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:54.110
have something to think about
right when they get in the car?

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.640
RIC FLAIR: Oh, yeah.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.210
Hey, boys.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.990
Hype for Alexander
Rossi and Conor Daly.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.900
This Sunday, the
Indianapolis 500, man.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.900
We'll be limousine riding,
we'll be jet flying,

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.790
we'll be kiss stealing,
we'll be wheel and dealing

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.070
and you guys will be going 200
miles an hour on the track.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:15.445
And I'll be going, woo!

00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:16.882
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:16.882 --> 00:28:20.970
And to the winner go the
spoils and then Them the event,

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:24.750
damn race is over, we are going
to party with these gentlemen

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:29.130
right here, Alexander and
Conor, all night long.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.030
Woo!

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.950
Don't be afraid to live
the legend, ladies.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.432
Woo!

00:28:33.432 --> 00:28:36.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:39.944 --> 00:28:41.610
And if you win the
race, on of you guys,

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.570
you guys are buying a drink.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.830
CONOR DALY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.096
RIC FLAIR: I'm not picking
up the tab that night.

00:28:46.096 --> 00:28:47.220
CONOR DALY: I am motivated.

00:28:51.594 --> 00:28:52.566
That was amazing.

00:28:52.566 --> 00:28:53.052
RIC FLAIR: Thank you.

00:28:53.052 --> 00:28:53.538
AUDIENCE: Thanks
so much, you guys,

00:28:53.538 --> 00:28:54.996
for coming out and
speaking to us.

00:28:54.996 --> 00:28:55.968
Really appreciate it.

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:57.920
Very cool experience.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.450
So my dad is a huge car
fan and also actually got

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.940
to spend some time with
some of the pro wrestlers

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.610
back in the down circuit
doing some philanthropic work

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.800
and had nothing but great
things to say about them.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.880
So I grew up spending some
time watching cars go round

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.230
and wrestling, as well.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.420
I just want to know,
what's the experience

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.640
like being able not only
to live out your dream,

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.790
but also continue to see
your sports evolve and get

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:22.510
a new fanbase?

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.760
And where do you see the
general health of both sports

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.259
right now?

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.580
RIC FLAIR: Well, first
of all, I think it's--

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.410
what I'm happy
about is that I've

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.635
been able, through four
decades, to track what I call

00:29:38.635 --> 00:29:42.370
a cross-demographic
appeal, where now,

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.940
I'm actually making friends
that are in the IndyCar drivers

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.050
that I've never had an
opportunity to do before.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.430
And the baseball players,
I interact with them a lot.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:55.330
And Sergio Brown, who was
the Colts, put me on the map

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.330
with the "keeping the
alligators "down thing.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.490
So I've just had a lot
of fun and it's just

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.396
another experience for me.

00:30:02.396 --> 00:30:03.770
The state of
wrestling right now,

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.970
it's different than
what I did for a living.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.280
But my daughter is
in it, she loves it.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.129
And WWE is a fabulous
place to work.

00:30:14.129 --> 00:30:16.420
The kids-- they work hard,
but they make a lot of money

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.410
and they put a lot more
time and consideration

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.060
into their well-being.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.500
The health, the
concussion stuff,

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.970
and that now because
of all the injuries.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.200
It's choreographed, but
it's a rough physical sport.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.200
And we had five guys with broken
necks in the last three years.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.890
So it's tough, but
to me, it wouldn't

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:40.780
be nearly as tough
as driving a car

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.360
to 220 or 230 miles an hour.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.930
I just think-- I don't get that.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.430
But I'm honored that I'm in
the presence of two guys that

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:50.310
do that for a living.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:54.760
And spending the whole day
with Conor, which I have,

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.380
he thrives on it.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.110
So it's nice to wake
up and be that excited.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.140
I was very excited about
wrestling every day, too.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:07.610
But I wasn't driving 220 miles
an hour to get to the building.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.750
CONOR DALY: Yeah, we drove
a little slower to get here.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:16.570
I obviously love doing what I
do, so very lucky to do that.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:18.670
As for the health
of our sport, I

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.890
think it needs some
help still, obviously.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:25.330
We had-- after the split and
when we got reunited back

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.750
in '08, '09, I always said
it would probably be 10 years

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.210
before we'd really start
to pick up traction again,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:37.240
as one open-wheel racing series,
which next year would be 10

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.560
years since the split.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.390
So I think we got
a lot of momentum

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.520
last year through
the 100th running.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.350
I think we've had
really great racing.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.010
Our product is not the problem.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.240
It's just a lot of
things to try and get it

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.400
onto people's televisions,
you know what I mean?

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.860
TV ratings are king
right now, so that's

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.660
very important for us.

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.090
But I think this
year, as well, we

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.840
have Fernando Alonso
competing in the Indy

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:03.090
500, which is massive for
the sport, in general.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.300
And our races just
keep getting better.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.160
We have some incredible races
and I think that's good for us.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.190
We're just-- I think
we're on the up and up.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.960
We're technically the
only form of racing

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.866
that's actually going
in an upward trend

00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:17.740
when it comes to ratings
and stuff like that,

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.004
so that's nice.

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:22.170
RIC FLAIR: Do you think
that Ashley Judd will ask me

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:23.690
for my autograph?

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:25.620
CONOR DALY: Oh, she's
not around anymore.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.540
ALEXANDER ROSSI: She's
definitely not around.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:26.840
CONOR DALY: She got divorced.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.620
RIC FLAIR: I'm not going then.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.280
She got divorced?

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:28.790
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.390
RIC FLAIR: Did she really?

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:30.230
CONOR DALY: She's not
with Dario anymore.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.813
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
She's single, though.

00:32:31.813 --> 00:32:32.766
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:32:32.766 --> 00:32:33.890
She might be there, though.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:34.890
RIC FLAIR: Just kidding.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:41.510
I stood next to Brooke
Shields one night at the Ritz

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:44.402
here in New York, and
I'm a big fan, right?

00:32:44.402 --> 00:32:45.860
I was this close
to her, like this.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.061
Close as you and I are
for an hour, right?

00:32:48.061 --> 00:32:49.810
And she never looked
at me one time, never

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:50.730
said nothing, right?

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:51.410
CONOR DALY: That's the worst.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:52.730
RIC FLAIR: So the
guy goes to me--

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:53.500
that's with the
company-- he goes,

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.560
maybe she doesn't
watch wrestling.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.580
I said, watch wrestling?

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.360
I'm Ric Flair.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.680
What the hell?

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.900
And she still hasn't
said hi to me yet.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.650
CONOR DALY: That's the
way most girls do--

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:02.920
RIC FLAIR: I know.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.520
CONOR DALY: --with me, too.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.920
RIC FLAIR: She just ignored me.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.212
Kept turning her back to me.

00:33:06.212 --> 00:33:06.920
CONOR DALY: Same.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.600
That happens all the time.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.290
Meanwhile, our boy there from--

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.930
all the guys love me,
but Brooke, not so much.

00:33:19.885 --> 00:33:21.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you
all for being here.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.150
My question is for Ric Flair.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.490
What was your favorite
match that you were

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.527
in at Madison Square Garden?

00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:29.360
RIC FLAIR: Gosh, you
want to know something?

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.700
I tell people this.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.200
I was never--

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.790
I'm from the south, right?

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:39.530
And I really enjoyed,
obviously, working for WWE.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:43.340
But I don't think I
was ever a big card.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.980
Does that make sense?

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.230
First of all, I was older
when I got to wrestle

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:49.574
a little more frequently.

00:33:49.574 --> 00:33:50.990
But probably the
best match I ever

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.421
had was back in the '90s
when I wrestled Hulk

00:33:55.421 --> 00:33:56.420
for the first time that.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:00.560
It was like, man, we call
him the Golden Goose.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.660
I have only wrestled a
few people in my life

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.440
that were over with
the public like Hulk.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.909
And you know, he was selling
vitamins and drinking milk

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:14.460
and I was chasing women and
drinking beer, you know?

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.550
It's magic.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:18.210
The perfect bad guy and
the perfect good guy.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.175
But man, wherever we went,
we sold out everywhere.

00:34:21.175 --> 00:34:21.800
It was amazing.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.334
All over the world.

00:34:24.334 --> 00:34:26.000
I wrestled him in
Tokyo and we sold out.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.510
So it's been a great experience.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:30.980
He's a phenomenal guy.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.440
He's been through
a lot, personally.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.460
Not just, as we
know with one issue,

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.909
but health-wise, he's
had seven back operations

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.070
and he's in a lot of pain.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.960
So I talk to him all the time.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.339
He's doing much better.

00:34:47.339 --> 00:34:49.130
He's in good shape,
financially, and I just

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.320
wish the best for him.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.008
Wrestling him in the Garden
was something special.

00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:53.841
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:57.300
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.790
I'm an Indiana native, too.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:59.540
CONOR DALY: Sweet.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.081
AUDIENCE: I'm glad
you guys came out.

00:35:01.081 --> 00:35:02.120
Yeah.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:07.114
So first, I had the original Ric
Flair doll, the action figure.

00:35:07.114 --> 00:35:09.530
He's the only one that ever
beat Optimus Prime in a fight.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:10.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:11.750
RIC FLAIR: What did he say?

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.530
CONOR DALY: You
were the only one

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.110
to beat Optimus
Prime in a fight--

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:15.070
RIC FLAIR: Oh, yeah.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.236
CONOR DALY: --with the doll.

00:35:16.236 --> 00:35:23.960
AUDIENCE: But just given the
change of how media is, do you

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.140
have anything you would offer
these guys from the days

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.830
pre-internet, when you
got famous before YouTube,

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.337
to propel them, advice-wise?

00:35:33.337 --> 00:35:34.670
RIC FLAIR: These gentlemen here?

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.094
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:36.094 --> 00:35:38.510
RIC FLAIR: Well, first of all,
I think it's just in their,

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.843
the little bit that I know them.

00:35:39.843 --> 00:35:44.420
But they're obviously raised
by great parents and I

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.820
don't think that they are--

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:51.980
they're never going to be put
into situations where I failed.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.400
I could have never--

00:35:54.400 --> 00:36:00.410
if this was the '80s, I wouldn't
be allowed on the street,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:01.900
much less--

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.550
we pretty much did what we
wanted back then, you know?

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:06.950
Anything I said on TV,
I was pretty much doing.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.704
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:08.704 --> 00:36:10.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:11.030
Yeah.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.230
See you at the Marriott tonight,
18 to 28, no boyfriends,

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.193
no husbands, come on.

00:36:16.193 --> 00:36:18.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.070
Kind of like you're
gonna do in the race, OK?

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.340
I'll handle the after-party.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.631
CONOR DALY: Oh, gee, I hope so.

00:36:23.631 --> 00:36:24.180
Wow.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.550
RIC FLAIR: But no, it
just would have killed me.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.230
I'm on a very short
leash with my fiance.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.960
You notice she's right here.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.410
I'm not allowed out of sight.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.262
Come here.

00:36:39.262 --> 00:36:40.174
[WHISTLES]

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:43.230
And why did you ask
her if she was married?

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.148
I don't know I asked
her, it's just normal.

00:36:45.148 --> 00:36:46.144
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.310
Not going to happen again.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.000
AUDIENCE: I have a
couple of questions.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.265
For Alexander first, I know
you have Formula 1 Experience

00:36:59.265 --> 00:37:02.126
and I'm just curious to know
how you think that that played

00:37:02.126 --> 00:37:04.417
into your victory last year,
if you learned anything

00:37:04.417 --> 00:37:05.500
that you brought with you.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.682
And the other is, I'm curious to
get your takes on Team Penske's

00:37:08.682 --> 00:37:11.675
performance over the weekend
because it's wasn't fabulous.

00:37:11.675 --> 00:37:12.560
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Look
who's paying attention.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.060
Right on.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.180
All right.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:20.630
So first question is,
Formula 1 is the pinnacle

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.867
of motor sports in Europe.

00:37:22.867 --> 00:37:24.950
IndyCar is the pinnacle
of motor sports in the US.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:29.210
And I think that any of the top
drivers in either championship

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.970
that go to the other
will be successful

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.310
because to win in
IndyCar, you have

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:39.290
to have an innate level of skill
and talent and competitiveness.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.220
Same in Formula 1.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.170
So there's a lot of--

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:45.380
I think that any of the guys
can drive either of the cars.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.110
There's actually
not much crossover,

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.890
in terms of technique, but
just the general understanding

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:54.170
of how to extract
performance from a car

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.930
will remain the same no
matter what you drive,

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.050
whether it's a
Honda Civic in town

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.930
or a Formula 1 car
and an IndyCar.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.020
So I think that it wasn't
necessarily just Formula 1

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.590
experience, it was just
motor sports experience

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.470
that gave me that opportunity.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:14.900
And then, in terms of
Penske, my engineer actually

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.820
used to work for Ed
Carpenter Racing, who

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.750
was the only Chevy that
was really competitive.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.680
And he looks at their aero
configuration and is just like,

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.580
they're completely wrong.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.110
Not even remotely
close to being correct.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.350
So it's very interesting
because they obviously

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.230
have a huge amount of resources
and have been very successful

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.950
there and have all the time in
the wind tunnel that they need.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.560
But it was kind of what
I touched on earlier.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.390
Their correlation
to real-life data

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.430
clearly isn't
matching up very well

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.830
and they literally are
just taking away downforce

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:48.887
to add drag, and it's just
the last thing you want to do,

00:38:48.887 --> 00:38:50.720
which is why we seem
them out of the top 20.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.330
So it's very strange, but
I'm not complaining about it

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:56.030
because it's five less cars
that I have to race against.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:57.110
And yeah.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.292
CONOR DALY: Well,
we'll see on Sunday.

00:38:59.292 --> 00:39:00.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.390
I don't drive for
Team Penske, clearly,

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:06.770
but what he's saying when
it comes to aerodynamics

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.270
is it really is interesting.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:11.420
Because the Chevrolet package
is struggling, for sure.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.040
But you wouldn't expect
Penske to be struggling.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.850
And then, as he said, the
Ed Carpenter racing cars

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:18.040
nearly had the pull.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.180
I mean, they won
[INAUDIBLE] second.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.317
And that blows my mind,
as well, because we were--

00:39:22.317 --> 00:39:23.900
ALEXANDER ROSSI: We
have consistently.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.770
CONOR DALY: We were running--

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:26.030
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Like
Joseph was last year.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.380
CONOR DALY: I know that,
which was incredible.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.380
And we were running, literally,
almost exactly the same topside

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.320
downforce as they
were, but we were going

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.660
like four mile an hour slower.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:38.100
So they're doing something
really good, the Carpenter

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:38.600
cars.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.510
And then Roger, I
think, is probably

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:45.230
frustrated with their
whole program right now.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.290
But I mean, it's Penske, so
it's the Indy 500 and Penske.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:50.120
No matter where
they start, they're

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.187
going to be probably up at
the front, at some point,

00:39:53.187 --> 00:39:54.020
I would have to say.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.895
At least one or two of
them, without a doubt.

00:39:55.895 --> 00:39:56.150
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Yeah.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.410
I mean, Will was quick.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:58.190
CONOR DALY: Will was fast, yeah.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.020
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Right.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.080
CONOR DALY: But
even like, I think--

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.850
I mean Joseph, obviously,
qualified second last year,

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:03.890
so he knows what he's
doing around there.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.620
And Helio is going
for four, as usual,

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.200
so we'll see what happens.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:09.900
He's brave, too.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.450
He's been running
the two-tire ramps.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.350
I don't know if
you've been watching.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.390
But yeah, there's
some pieces on our car

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.139
that can make the car
handling very, very sketchy,

00:40:17.139 --> 00:40:18.680
but it'll go fast
in a straight line.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.650
And Helio's been
the master of those.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.260
He hasn't crashed
yet, so that's good.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.830
AUDIENCE: Once again,
thanks a lot for all three

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:29.580
of you coming out.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.170
Really appreciate it.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.270
I was curious, as
drivers, how much

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:35.040
of the technology
of the car do you

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.860
need to be aware of in
order to race competitively?

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.720
And then, related
to that, how much

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.220
does it change year to year?

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.050
How much is the
technology evolving?

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.780
How quickly is it evolving?

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:51.370
CONOR DALY: Well, I guess,
we stay within a certain set

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:52.210
of regulations.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:57.010
So I think the technology
level, we kind of have--

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.680
we use we use things for
different year periods,

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.860
whether it's three years
with a certain type of ECU

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.060
or something before we get--

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.707
I think next year, we
all get better ECU.

00:41:06.707 --> 00:41:08.290
Whenever the new
engine comes, we just

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:10.270
get the next level of
ECU and stuff like that.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:14.980
So the technology, it
depends on how much money

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.060
you have to spend.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.965
There's always more--
the more money,

00:41:17.965 --> 00:41:20.090
the more things you can
do, or the more development

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:20.590
you can do.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:23.290
And the more-- simulation is
obviously massive right now,

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:24.172
as Alex said.

00:41:24.172 --> 00:41:25.630
That's one of the
things that teams

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.270
are using a lot
because of the fact

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:31.210
that it costs you know
$30,000 to $35,000, $40,000

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:33.820
to do a test day with
your actual race car.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.970
Doesn't cost that much to
just jump in a simulator

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.690
to do some testing.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.810
And if you can get
accurate data from that,

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:44.410
then it sort of eliminates
the cost of real-life testing,

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:47.710
although for us, real-life
testing is way better.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.740
But yeah, it's an
ever-changing game.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.650
And for us, there's always
new things to learn,

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:55.450
I think more so in
Formula One, there's

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.085
always a lot more new things.

00:41:57.085 --> 00:41:59.210
But they also have half a
billion dollars to spend.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:01.580
And we're on, like, $8
million budgets for the year.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.830
So it's one of those things
that's a little different.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.400
But your team has a lot
more technology than mine,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.949
so I don't know if you
have anything to add.

00:42:09.949 --> 00:42:11.490
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
Oh, hi, you're here.

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:14.181
Hi.

00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:16.180
The driver understanding
of it is very important

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:21.130
because say, for example, you
have a car that you're not

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.790
happy with the entry of it.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:25.540
The engineer will be
like, OK, well, these

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.335
are the three or four things
that we can do to solve that.

00:42:28.335 --> 00:42:30.460
But like everything, there's
a knock-on effect that

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.350
will go on if you change that.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.920
So you need to understand
what each thing will do

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.530
and how it'll change the
behavior of the car and the way

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.200
that you're driving it so
that you choose the thing that

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.167
will improve the most what
your problem is but take away

00:42:44.167 --> 00:42:45.500
the least amount somewhere else.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.120
So having an understanding
of the broad scope

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.460
of the engineering side
of the car is important.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.850
But in terms of the actual
engineering decisions,

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.120
there's people with Master's
degrees in vehicle dynamics

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.315
and engineering that are
probably more qualified.

00:43:01.315 --> 00:43:04.590
But to have a full
global understanding,

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.827
at least the basics,
is very important.

00:43:09.749 --> 00:43:12.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks again
to all of you for coming.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:16.360
It's really great to be in
the presence of greatness.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.650
My question is about
the process of mastery.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.510
personal growth and becoming
better at what you do.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:28.360
We, the public, get a lot of
focus on the best in any field.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.720
The best showmen in
wrestling or the best race

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.940
finishers in racing.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.750
I'm curious to know about,
what does it take to get there?

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:40.990
What was it like not being the
greatest wrestler of all time

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:43.590
and working your
way towards that?

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.450
Is it a focus on showmanship,
are there major difficulties

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:48.520
along the way?

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.930
RIC FLAIR: Well, that's easy.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:51.790
I actually talk
about this a lot when

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:55.090
I'm doing some
motivational speaking.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:58.440
First of all, you have
to love what you do.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:03.550
And you have to believe
in yourself if you

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:04.780
want to sell the character.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:09.040
For me, like I said earlier,
anything I said on TV,

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.960
I was actually doing it.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.119
Probably not the best
advice for anybody

00:44:14.119 --> 00:44:15.660
because we're doing
different things,

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:20.465
but work ethic, belief in
yourself, self-confidence

00:44:20.465 --> 00:44:21.280
is huge.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.840
I'm sure it is for these guys.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.050
You have to have
tremendous self-confidence.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.810
But work ethic and the
time they put into it.

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:32.170
We can sit up here and make
light of things and all that,

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.750
but these guys are getting
ready for something that's huge

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:37.500
and they're driving
that car, like I said,

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.910
at 230 miles an hour.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:43.430
And that's something
I can't even fathom,

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.457
and I'm not making light of it.

00:44:45.457 --> 00:44:47.540
It's just something I don't
even want to go into--

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:51.120
they have a test car where
they'll take you on it.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.350
I didn't want to do it.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.100
Don't make a joke
about that to anybody.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:57.600
But--

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.224
ALEXANDER ROSSI: You
already signed up.

00:44:59.224 --> 00:45:00.385
I just did it online.

00:45:00.385 --> 00:45:02.360
RIC FLAIR: It's just
work ethic, dedication,

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.816
and belief in whatever
you're trying to achieve.

00:45:06.816 --> 00:45:08.440
You have to really
like it and want it.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:14.080
Even at 25 years
of age, Conor had

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.660
to want to do this
for a long time.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.100
And this is his third race.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:18.712
Is that right?

00:45:18.712 --> 00:45:19.920
CONOR DALY: Fourth one, yeah.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.830
RIC FLAIR: Fourth at Indy?

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:21.330
Yeah.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.280
So I mean it's huge.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.250
That's my take on it.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.680
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.970
I would say I'm definitely
no master of motor sport

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.170
or anywhere near that yet.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.480
But it does take a lot of--

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:41.380
I started when I was 10 and I,
from basically age 10 to 14,

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.030
you realize--

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:44.770
racing go karts, only go karts.

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:46.750
But it's like,
traveling every weekend,

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:50.050
doing a lot of different stuff.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.960
My dad raced, as well,
so he knew what it took.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.010
And it took everything.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.410
It takes your entire life.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:46:02.500
I missed 70 days of school
a year in high school.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.200
And I showed up to my
high school graduation

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.130
and people had no idea that
I still went to the school.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.750
But it's just--

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.580
I didn't-- I never
went to a prom,

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.612
didn't go to any of that stuff.

00:46:14.612 --> 00:46:17.710
All I cared about was racing
and my dad, every week made,

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:19.420
sure to tell me,
are you sure you

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.890
want to do this
because this will

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:23.350
take every part of your life?

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:24.430
And it's true.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:27.670
I graduated high school,
moved to London when I was 18.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.150
I lived with a friend
of mine's stepdad.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:31.540
I didn't have
friends over there.

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.150
All it was was race
track, back home.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.860
Simulator, race
track all the time.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.830
And that was through
all my college years.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:44.890
I got back to America at
age 21, 22, or 22, really.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:45.390
Yeah.

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:46.270
It just takes everything.

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:47.936
There's a lot-- I
missed out on college.

00:46:47.936 --> 00:46:49.340
I don't know what that's like.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.730
I see that, from the
internet, it looks cool.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:56.120
But I mean, I guess it's one
of those things that people--

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.600
RIC FLAIR: I was
there for a year.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.100
CONOR DALY: Was it fun?

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.266
RIC FLAIR: I don't remember.

00:47:01.266 --> 00:47:02.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.370
CONOR DALY: See?

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:04.440
Yeah, well you have
to give up a lot.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.590
RIC FLAIR: I was having fun.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:06.423
CONOR DALY: Exactly.

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:09.688
RIC FLAIR: Had a hard time
finding where the class was.

00:47:09.688 --> 00:47:11.260
But I was there.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.100
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.030
That's the thing.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.760
How much are you willing to
give up to succeed at something?

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.480
And that's, I think,
when it comes down to it,

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.980
how much time are you willing to
dedicate to this goal of being

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.160
a paid racing driver?

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.730
Which was something that isn't
really that common these days.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:30.457
So yeah.

00:47:30.457 --> 00:47:31.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:32.706
MIKE ABRAMS: We
probably have time

00:47:32.706 --> 00:47:34.390
for two more quick questions.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:36.880
AUDIENCE: So I know that
regulations are incredibly

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.850
important to your sport because,
unlike say, most other sports,

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:41.890
which are just constrained
by the performance

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.570
potential of the
human body, there's

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.880
essentially no limit whatsoever
on what technology can achieve.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.500
So I was wondering if you were
the regulatory board, just

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.259
the two of you, and you were
able to set new standards

00:47:53.259 --> 00:47:55.300
and new changes and
regulations for future years,

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.010
what would you change and why?

00:47:59.495 --> 00:48:00.870
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
For me, it would

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:04.410
be about improving
the racing product.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:08.470
And the way to do that is,
because these cars generate

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:11.160
so much downforce,
the problem with that

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.900
is when you're
following another car

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:17.620
and you don't have all of the
air being completely attached

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:21.070
as you drive through it, there's
a pretty big knock-on effect

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.630
to the following car.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.610
Because all of the
aero is, obviously,

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.690
about low and high pressure
sensitivities and areas

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.040
and how the air
goes over the wings

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.660
and then reattaches,
creating pressure.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:36.490
So there's a huge
amount of downforce

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.380
that comes from
the top of the car

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.480
and not so much that
comes from the bottom.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.330
And the reasons for
that is because of fear

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:45.610
of cars going too quickly.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.430
Because there was a period
of time in motor sports

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:51.730
where there was blown diffusers
and there was actually

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.400
fans underneath the cars that
were sucking the cars down

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.120
and the speeds were just getting
a little bit out of control.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.600
But because safety
has developed so far

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.350
from when this existed
in the mid to late '90s,

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:08.520
there's less of a need
to reduce the speeds

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.370
as much as they have now.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:13.240
And so for me, it would
be all about putting

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.694
much of the downforce
and aerodynamic potential

00:49:15.694 --> 00:49:17.860
on the bottom of the car
so that when you're driving

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.710
you're not affected by the car
in front, which means better

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.620
racing, more entertainment,
and something for the fans

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.230
to get even more excited about.

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:28.480
And actually, with all credit
to the rising IndyCar series,

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.900
they are doing that,
and next year cars

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.330
are doing exactly
what I just explained

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:36.100
with the new
aerodynamic packages

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.610
and it's very exciting
to be a part of.

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:40.730
And IndyCar is one of
the few championships

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:43.960
I feel is really on the cutting
edge of improving the racing

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.767
product and having a
forward-thinking vision of what

00:49:46.767 --> 00:49:48.850
they want the sport to be,
instead of solely being

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:52.677
in a reactionary position like
other racing championships.

00:49:52.677 --> 00:49:54.010
CONOR DALY: Yeah, I think this--

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:55.450
I mean, that's true.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.480
Downforce from the floor will
improve the racing, for sure,

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.884
on short ovals for us.

00:50:00.884 --> 00:50:02.800
I think a lot more
horsepower will be awesome.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.160
I mean, race cars,
mid-'90s, 1,000 horsepower.

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.980
We only have 650,
700 on a good day.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.570
And you know, that's a lot.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:11.810
MIKE ABRAMS: That's
because you drive a Chevy.

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:12.230
CONOR DALY: Yeah, I know.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:13.063
I was fixing to say.

00:50:13.063 --> 00:50:14.710
We have 650, they have 700.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:18.730
But it's one of those things
that I think we need more--

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:22.480
I know everyone loves eco
fuels and all that stuff,

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.980
but like I would
really like to see

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:28.540
like another V12 engine blowing
your ears off and laying

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:32.297
tire tracks out of every
corner with 1,200 horse--

00:50:32.297 --> 00:50:33.880
I mean, I think that
would be awesome.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.900
MIKE ABRAMS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:35.630
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.430
Because I mean-- yeah,
2.2 liter V6 engines

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:43.090
aren't that exciting
to me, in all honesty.

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:47.170
I hope-- I think we're
on the way to also being

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:50.960
eco-ish, but improving
horsepower, as well.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.760
So hopefully--

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.579
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Eco-ish,
the new gold standard of--

00:50:54.579 --> 00:50:56.620
CONOR DALY: Yeah, they're
going to paint it green

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.805
and then say--

00:50:58.805 --> 00:51:00.430
ALEXANDER ROSSI: So
I'm from California

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:02.475
and he's from Indiana,
if you didn't know.

00:51:02.475 --> 00:51:02.975
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:02.975 --> 00:51:05.110
CONOR DALY: Yeah, sorry.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.600
More horsepower, more floor
downforce, and let's go.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.610
That's all we need.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:10.000
MIKE ABRAMS: Got time
for one quick question.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.390
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.889
Quick one.

00:51:10.889 --> 00:51:12.580
So I'm a big motorcycle guy.

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.746
I'm from Atlanta, so there's
a lot more open space.

00:51:14.746 --> 00:51:16.370
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
Atlanta, check it out.

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.995
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:16.995 --> 00:51:18.447
So I get super excited.

00:51:18.447 --> 00:51:20.530
I feel like a general
badass when I'm going, like,

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.430
130 miles an hour, right?

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:27.360
How do you guys translate going
from miles an hour on race day

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.045
to driving around, putzing
at 50 miles an hour,

00:51:30.045 --> 00:51:31.420
and not getting
speeding tickets?

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.132
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Well, my Honda
Pilot only does, like, 80,

00:51:34.132 --> 00:51:35.215
so I don't have a problem.

00:51:35.215 --> 00:51:36.850
It does 0 to 60 in five minutes.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:38.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:39.059 --> 00:51:39.850
It's great, though.

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:42.580
Because it drives
itself, which is awesome.

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:45.230
It's like Tesla and Honda
pilots which do that.

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:49.480
Other than that, it's such a
different environment that--

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.120
he actually drives
slower than I do.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.140
CONOR DALY: Yeah, I do.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.880
But I hate the road.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:58.799
I just hate the general
public on the road.

00:51:58.799 --> 00:51:59.840
It's just so infuriating.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.760
ALEXANDER ROSSI: But when I have
to go on a road trip with him,

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.630
I have to add like--

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:04.157
I normally subtract 25, 30
minutes from Google Maps.

00:52:04.157 --> 00:52:05.490
CONOR DALY: I'm a rule follower.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:06.850
ALEXANDER ROSSI: His is
exactly what the Google

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:07.650
Maps says it's going to be.

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:08.320
CONOR DALY: No, that's not true.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.070
ALEXANDER ROSSI: And
you're just like, well.

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:10.670
CONOR DALY: Not true at all.

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:12.640
But I am a rule follower.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.610
ALEXANDER ROSSI: Have you
ever gotten a speeding ticket?

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:14.070
CONOR DALY: Yeah.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:14.370
Five.

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:14.740
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
I've gotten none.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:15.739
CONOR DALY: Six of them.

00:52:15.739 --> 00:52:18.280
ALEXANDER ROSSI: So maybe
you should start speeding.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.961
CONOR DALY: How does that work?

00:52:19.961 --> 00:52:20.460
Jeez.

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.300
Driving on the road,
very different,

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:29.260
obviously, unless you're
in some form of super car,

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.560
which we do not own,
either of us, yet.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.620
I have big plans in my
life, guys, don't worry.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:40.050
But if I was driving a
Lamborghini everyday, or--

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:41.650
man, I don't know
about the laws.

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:44.890
They would be-- yeah.

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:45.460
It's tough.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.180
Either way, I just
hate driving slow.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.969
My foot is just always annoyed.

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:53.760
Wouldn't you agree?

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.850
You just--

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:55.683
ALEXANDER ROSSI: No.

00:52:55.683 --> 00:52:57.820
CONOR DALY: Like, we
can't go 60 miles an hour.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.770
That's not even a thing.

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:01.730
I have never gone
60 miles an hour,

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.460
I don't think, ever, on a road
that has a 55 mile an hour

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.740
speed limit.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.049
Have you?

00:53:07.049 --> 00:53:08.590
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
What are you saying?

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:09.830
CONOR DALY: If it's 55--

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:10.520
ALEXANDER ROSSI:
In a school zone,

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.280
you should definitely
not be doing 60.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.630
CONOR DALY: No,
no, of course not.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:15.130
48.

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:17.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:22.080
All I'm saying is speed
limit plus 30 is normal,

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:26.200
I think unless there
are children around.

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:26.950
What do you think?

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:28.634
How do you drive, Ric?

00:53:28.634 --> 00:53:30.280
RIC FLAIR: Actually,
I'm much better.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.910
I got put in jail
one time because I

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:37.249
had 86 moving violations
over a five-year period.

00:53:37.249 --> 00:53:38.290
CONOR DALY: That's a lot.

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:39.248
RIC FLAIR: And I went--

00:53:39.248 --> 00:53:40.184
ALEXANDER ROSSI: 86?

00:53:40.184 --> 00:53:40.850
RIC FLAIR: Yeah.

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:41.350
86.

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:43.930
Well, because in
the old days, prior

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:49.200
to the reciprocal agreement
with states, in South Carolina,

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.460
as an example, I'd
get four tickets

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.100
driving on the Charleston.

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.312
All you did was give $20,
turn it over, throw it,

00:53:55.312 --> 00:53:56.666
and I keep going.

00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:58.290
And you could drink
back then in a car.

00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:59.200
CONOR DALY: Oh, jeez.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.210
RIC FLAIR: It's changed a lot.

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:03.850
But anyway, I finally got
busted because I got two

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:06.340
going 80 in one day
in North Carolina

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.667
and I had to go to court.

00:54:07.667 --> 00:54:09.250
And the judge sentenced
me to 30 days,

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.570
called me a habitual speeder.

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:13.330
I went downstairs for
about an hour, man,

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:15.190
and I didn't like that.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:17.680
Locked up for the night, right?

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.890
But then I went to Superior
Court and the guy laughed at it

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.500
and fined me $25.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.170
But it slowed me down.

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:26.770
I never thought
of it, but, hell,

00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:28.210
I had three drivers licenses--

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.160
Minnesota, Florida,
and North Carolina.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.480
Just every time one of went
down, pulled out the other one.

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:37.052 --> 00:54:39.382
Oh, I knew a lot about driving.

00:54:39.382 --> 00:54:40.840
CONOR DALY: That's
why he's a hero.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.030
RIC FLAIR: But I've
slowed down now.

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:45.150
Trust me.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:46.690
I certainly don't
drink and drive.

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:47.830
I'm going to go--
that's the only thing I

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:49.030
haven't done wrong.

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:51.085
No DUIs.

00:54:51.085 --> 00:54:52.210
That's not going to change.

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:55.210
If I have a beer, I get a ride.

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:56.120
That's all I need.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.980
That would be all over Google.

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.135
Ric Flair, DUI.

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.029
No, thank you.

00:55:06.029 --> 00:55:08.320
MIKE ABRAMS: Well, gentlemen,
thank you for being here.

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:12.910
The Indianapolis 500 will
air on ABC on Sunday, May 28,

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:14.769
at noon eastern.

00:55:14.769 --> 00:55:16.810
The car will be here for
about the next half hour

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:18.351
if you want to take
pictures with it.

00:55:18.351 --> 00:55:19.406
You cannot get in it.

00:55:19.406 --> 00:55:20.530
And please don't sit on it.

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:23.730
But you can take
pictures around it.

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:24.750
Thanks, guys.

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:25.140
CONOR DALY: Thank you, guys.

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:25.605
RIC FLAIR: Thank you.

00:55:25.605 --> 00:55:27.000
CONOR DALY: I appreciate it.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.583
RIC FLAIR: Thanks
for all the respect.

00:55:28.583 --> 00:55:31.710
[APPLAUSE]
