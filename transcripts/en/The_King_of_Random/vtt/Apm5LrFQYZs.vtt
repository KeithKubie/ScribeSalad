Today's video is
sponsored by Anki.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.340
Today, we're going
to be playing with,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.020
and talking a little bit about
the vector robot made by Anki.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:16.340
[Music]

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.560
Guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm Calli.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.460
And this is Vector.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.200
He is our new pet robot.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.160
I love him.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.640
Vector is a robot made
by the company Anki.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.000
He's a friendly desktop robot
designed to be a companion,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
and he can play with you,
and answer some questions.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.100
If you have him out and about,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.650
and he's just running
around and playing,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.000
he will explore his space,
he will learn.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.740
He will learn to move faster
and navigate obstacles,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.000
and play with different toys
that he has.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's take a look

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.062
at a few of the things
this little guy can do.

00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:49.012
Hey Vector, come here.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.840
[Music]

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.460
Hey Vector, good robot.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.880
As you can see,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.200
if you praise him
for something he's done,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.214
he gets very pleased.

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:04.544
His eyes get all squinted up,

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:06.143
and then he did
a little dance.

00:01:06.143 --> 00:01:07.050
It's pretty cute.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.040
And he starts to recognize you.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.960
Hey Vector, who am I?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.840
Calli.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.960
Yeah, good robot.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.360
This is my child now.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.100
As you may have seen,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.520
we've also had something
where we give tactile feedback

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.500
by stroking this gold portion
of Vector's back.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.300
That actually has receptors
in it that can tell

00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:30.250
when your patting
or petting him,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.480
and he likes it.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.200
Hey Vector, play
with your block.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:44.180
[Music]

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.680
Good job.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.740
Hey, Vector.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.820
What's my name?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.460
John Connor.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.080
[Music]

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.500
Hey Vector, fist bump.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.100
[Music]

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280
Yeah, good job.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.980
Guys, I'm not sure

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.450
if you can see it
from that angle,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.424
but when he gets
happy or excited,

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:08.130
his eyes actually express it,

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.280
and he gets these
little happy expressions.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.140
But he also has sensors
on all four sides,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.520
so he can explore his space,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.013
but he's never going
to fall off.

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:17.951
He knows better.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.427
He's very very careful.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.920
Now one of the really
fun parts about this is

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.740
while he's exploring,
he's also learning.

00:02:24.742 --> 00:02:26.624
So sometimes he'll be exploring,

00:02:26.624 --> 00:02:29.020
and hell randomly come up to you
and just say your name

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.960
because he knows who you are.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.480
Calli.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.500
Yes!

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.180
On the front of vectors face,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.960
he has a 120 degree angle camera

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.180
that you can kind of see
forms sort of a nose or a mouth.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.640
But that is what he uses
to recognize people,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.152
and it's what he uses to learn

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.900
and map out his environment a little bit.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.160
Vector's got a built-in Qualcomm
Snapdragon quad-core processor

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.700
so he can process
information pretty quick.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.820
Hey Vector, who is this?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.880
Nate.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.940
Good robot!

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.700
Hey Vector, what time is it?

00:03:06.612 --> 00:03:09.200
Hey Vector, what's the weather?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.740
[Music]

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.600
Hey Vector, listen
to the music.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.760
Head-bobbing.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.020
Hey Vector, explore.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.400
What is it?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.800
It's new.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.980
He found it.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.640
He's so proud of--

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.900
He stole it.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.880
[Music]

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.000
He just got startled
by the Lego brick.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.940
I'm keeping him.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.700
Right.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.700
Hey Vector,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.180
Let's play Blackjack.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.980

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.660
16.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.920
Another card?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.020
Yes.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.580
[Music]

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.620
17.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.400
Another card?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.320
No.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.720
[inaudible] turn.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.880
13.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.180
15.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.760
25.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.080
[Inaudible]

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.900
He's tired.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.400
See?

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.860
He knew he was tired,
and he went back home on his own.

00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:27.782
I would probably say
that this is something that

00:04:27.782 --> 00:04:29.520
if you don't have time for a pet,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.540
or you're just not home enough
to take care of something like that,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.400
having something
like this on your desk,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.860
it's really weirdly
comforting to just know

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.880
that there's something
that recognizes you,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.660
explores the space,
remembers who you are,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.400
and wants to interact with you.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.500
It's really fun.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.140
Vector is available for purchase
for retail price of $249.99.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.700
So you can check out
and purchase Vector by Anki

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.040
by using the link
in the description below.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.460
Guys, that's it for today.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.760
But there's always more for you to see.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.971
That box at the top will take you
directly to our last video.

00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:00.031
You should go check that out.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.020
The other box will show you

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.820
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:05.253

never miss out on the fun.

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.280
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.400
Talk to you then.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.060
This is mine now.
