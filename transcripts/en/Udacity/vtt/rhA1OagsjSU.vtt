00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.300
What answers did you come up with David?

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.980
&gt;&gt; So for the first one,
if we put A up on D,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.360
we haven't accomplished any of the goals
that we hadn't already accomplished.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.480
So our difference is still 3.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.611
Similarly, for putting D on A,
our difference is also still 3,

00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:15.910
because then we haven't
accomplished anything new.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.370
However, if we put D down on the table,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.180
we've accomplished one of the goals
we hadn't accomplished before.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.340
So there, our difference is 2.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.580
&gt;&gt; Good, David.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.399
So, in each state, David is comparing
the state with the goal state,

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.620
and finding differences between them.
