PAULO COELHO &gt;&gt; Hello, YouTube. This is Paulo
Coelho. By the way, I also printed the same

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.559
question in my blog, PauloCoel-PauloCOelhoblog.com,
and using YouTube, of course.

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.930
Ah-having said that-ah-I think that we are
seeing this meltdown, but I see this meltdown

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:27.080
for good. I think that what is happening now
is-we're forcing back to ethics. We lost track-not

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.860
we-I mean, I don't want to generalize-but
the system lost track of ethics. Meaning be

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.410
careful with your neighbor, think twice before
you act-ah-in self-benefit. So again of the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:50.460
day of the meltdown is showing that-ah-a world
without ethics does not work. We can wait

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.920
and then when we reach the bottom, we will
be able to reconstruct from the ruins of this

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:07.140
system a new system. Ah-a new system that
is much more-ah-ah-open to the human heart

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.439
instead of ______ an-and-and turning all this
around of money, money and greed.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.179
Have a wonderful day.
