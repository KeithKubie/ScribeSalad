00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:18.110
If you're living in Mesopotamia in 3000 BCE,
how do you buy things?

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.060
There are no cards, no ATMs no cash of any
kind… bartering was a valuable part of any

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.340
exchange, until the invention of international
trade, and then money.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.420
Money has been made of grains, shells, livestock,
beads, and finally precious metals.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.539
The problem is, when we translate the value
of something inherently valuable -- like a

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:43.590
cow, or a sack of grain -- to something with
no value, like a metal or a piece of paper,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.540
people will try to fraudulently jump on the
value bandwagon; we call this counterfeiting

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.620
-- and it was so prevalent in Civil War-era
America, the Secret Service was created to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.000
combat it at the time, one-third of all US
currency was likely fake.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.850
Today, it's FAR less.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.269
Currency is in a constant state of cold war
with counterfeiters, so science was recruited

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.060
to help stem the fraud.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.760
In 1739, Benjamin Franklin's printing firm
created nature prints on colonial bank notes

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.070
to distinguish them from fakes.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.010
Impressions were made on the notes using actual
leaves and the process was so innovative it

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.680
wasn't fully understood until centuries later!

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.250
Today, our money has dozens of little security
additions to verify the bills are real.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.280
Firstly, the money isn't regular paper!

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.090
If someone handed you a perfect reproduction
on printer paper, you'd KNOW instantly it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.090
was fake.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.880
The "paper" we use for money is 75 percent
discarded chunks of blue jeans and 25 percent

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.240
linen; it's called rag paper and it's how
you can wash our money and it comes out just

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.240
fine.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.950
The Euro is made with 100 percent cotton.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.530
Some other countries don't use paper at all,
like Australia who have used polymer money

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.920
since 1988.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.420
That pen you sometimes see at the store that
they use to mark the bill with?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.500
That's an iodine pen.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.590
The iodine reacts with tree cellulose differently
causing a chemical reaction and color change;

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.680
instantly revealing the fakes.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.090
Outside of the paper, the inks are steeped
in tech.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.709
For example, some Euro notes have europium
ink.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.909
Europium is highly phosphorescent, so, under
blacklight the europium ions absorb UV light

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:26.100
and re-release it in the area of ​​the
red, green or blue depending on the chemistry

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.720
used -- which is a secret.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.019
U.S. notes, have phosphorescent ink too which
is how vending machines spot fakes -- plus,

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.859
photocopiers won't print them because of a
special reflective ink which allegedly triggers

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.440
a halt in the machine.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.499
On top of that some of the lines on American
money are actually tiny words, there's a watermark

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:50.010
which can't be scrubbed off, a strip inside
the note, AND little red and blue hairs embedded

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.010
in the paper.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.849
All these are classic money tech, but unfortunately
not everyone looks close enough at their money

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.180
to really scan these features…

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.959
Unfortunately for counterfeiters, a study
in ACS Nano from last year caught the eye

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.389
of someone at the Treasury Department.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.749
The study explored a longhorn beetle that
can shift from gold to red as the humidity

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:10.749
changes.

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:15.639
Inspired by the tiny scales on this beetle,
the researchers designed a bleach-resistant

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:21.010
photonic crystal ink that can change from
green to yellow or red when exposed to ethanol

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.010
vapor.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.419
Breathe on it, and mesoporous silica nanoparticles
in the ink absorb minute amounts of humidity,

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.840
thickening them, and refracting different
colors.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.419
Imagine if the green trees around the Lincoln
Memorial could turn the reds and yellows of

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.419
autumn.

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.409
Even with all the tech counterfeiting is still
going on.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:47.879
60 percent of the 88.7 million dollars seized
in 2013 by the Secret Service was printed

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.730
using at-home inkjet or laser printers.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.030
In fact, the first "affordable" laser printer
debuted in 1992, and in 1996, the U.S. Treasury

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.029
committed to the first major redesign of paper
money in almost 70 years.

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.029
Coincidence?

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:02.029
I think not!

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.480
Today, money is redesigned about every seven
years… except the poor Washington… he's

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.629
not been updated since '63[10].

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:07.629
It's about time.

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.609
At least we're getting a woman on our money,
finally!

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.519
The thing is, the United States isn't always
fighting Alice and her inkjet, sometimes countries

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.150
like North Korea create superbills that can
trick even the best detectors!

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:39.300
