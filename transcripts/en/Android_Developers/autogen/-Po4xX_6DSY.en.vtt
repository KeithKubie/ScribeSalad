00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.760
 Hello everyone! My name is Bruce Kerr-Peterson. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.270
 I am the head of the AdWords platform in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Russia. 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.630
 In fact, my team and I have worked with many people here. 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.500
 But the collaborative project is through AdWords. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.079
 Get users and run engagement campaigns 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.690
 All of this is related to paid advertising 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.570
 I believe that everyone must be full of expectations. 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.390
 Let me explain to you first, this lecture is not long. 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.360
 I will talk about the following topics 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.710
 Including how to maximize the product's appeal to users through different channels. 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.260
 Retention rate and lifetime value 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.650
 And data analysis and management 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.154
 We have conducted a short survey of some users. 

00:00:40.154 --> 00:00:41.570
 In the investigation, we asked these users 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.570
 Which ads can drive them to download apps 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.330
 As expected, 50% of users 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.160
 Is because the search app is attracted to download the app. 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.030
 Second is attracted by the middle two 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.410
 Basically a campaign running through AdMob and mobile site channels 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.400
 Display network 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.922
 Finally, video ads served through channels like YouTube. 

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:05.880
 As we all know, video has always been a kind of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.796
 Campaigns that help increase brand awareness 

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:09.420
 We hope to change this in the future. 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.310
 If it goes well 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.000
 We will launch several new versions by the end of this year. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.160
 Let's cut into the topic below. 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.500
 Ability to launch search ads on Play 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.160
 We feel very happy 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.680
 Although it was not long before it was launched, we have already seen fruitful results. 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.780
 Not only increased user traffic but also reduced installation costs 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.010
 User quality is even better 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.940
 In addition, the campaign is fairly simple to set up. 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.720
 You only need to enter the AdWords interface 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.585
 Create a search campaign and set a few keywords 

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:37.960
 If you don't know which keywords to use 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.810
 You can also use the keyword suggestion tool 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.400
 Then run the Conversion Optimizer 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.870
 Conversion Optimizer will choose for you 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.770
 Target optimization per installation cost 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.490
 Your ads will then show on both Google.com and Play Store. 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.592
 Drive users to install products advertised in your ads 

00:01:54.592 --> 00:01:56.175
 This campaign structure is very simple 

00:01:56.175 --> 00:02:00.290
 The effect is very good 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.150
 One of our main channels 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.640
 Is getting users through AdMob and mobile websites. 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.500
 We know that the effect of this method has been good 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.669
 These two channels do bring 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.540
 Very large user visits and extensive coverage 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.360
 And the setup process is equally simple 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.170
 Just upload a few text ads. 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.130
 We recommend using video 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.770
 Video interstitial ads have a much higher conversion rate 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.570
 Target web random ads and take advantage of Conversion Optimizer 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.700
 Find your ideal user for your target cost per install 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.610
 Finally, YouTube 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.480
 As I mentioned in the previous slides 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.340
 YouTube has always been a channel that helps increase brand awareness. 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.800
 But we also found 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.630
 Users with high levels of engagement can bring amazing results 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.380
 After we launch the Conversion Optimizer at the end of this year, 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.070
 We should be able to be on YouTube 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.510
 Adjust user acquisition methods based on target cost per install 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.950
 To confirm that the user meets the eligibility criteria before the user downloads your app. 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.930
 If you have to advertise on each channel separately 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.490
 We recommend using this standard campaign structure and settings 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.650
 In order to be able to maximize 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.300
 Play the role of each channel 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.450
 Our specific recommendation is, first of all, make sure that the measurement method is set up properly. 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.720
 Whether measured by the AdWords SDK 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.020
 Still measured by third-party tracking 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.490
 Then start using the two main ad networks in our channel. 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.780
 Which is the Display Network and the Search Network. 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.050
 These two ad networks have been in the past few months 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.870
 Very good performance 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.590
 We firmly believe that their effect will be very good 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.950
 So we recommend running both campaigns first. 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.480
 You can add more keywords in the second week after getting initial results. 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.530
 To optimize your search campaigns 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.270
 When the two campaigns are ready and ready to serve 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.017
 You can experiment with a YouTube campaign. 

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.600
 Try to gradually expand coverage 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.430
 Use a similar list at the beginning 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.410
 To make sure you don’t deviate from the original target 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.400
 We know that traditional effect marketing 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.850
 Focus on optimizing each channel separately 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.170
 Ensure the best results for every channel 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.535
 For some companies, this method is correct. 

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:56.410
 But for most other companies 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.620
 It takes a lot of time and the execution is quite difficult 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.720
 So the launch of the universal campaign 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.180
 I feel very happy 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.030
 And it will be fully launched today. 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.760
 We will hold a press conference later this afternoon. 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.640
 As Miles said, with this campaign 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.640
 You can go through a simple campaign process 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.120
 Target all of the different ad networks 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.760
 This is the specific campaign process at a glance, very simple 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.200
 Mainly divided into three steps 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.110
 First, you need to upload a few lines of text. 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.900
 There are some different changes in the text. 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.220
 Then add the video and some images 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.140
 You can enter your location, language, budget 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.244
 And target per installation costs 

00:04:34.244 --> 00:04:36.660
 Finally, you only need to enable this campaign. 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.630
 Then the campaign can serve in all of Google’s channels. 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.200
 And target app install inventory. 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.386
 This is the actual display of the interface. 

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.760
 On the left side, you can see 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.380
 4 different text versions 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.110
 This conversion optimization tool can 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.290
 Optimize and choose the best text version 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.660
 You can enter a YouTube URL and the system will embed your YouTube video directly 

00:04:58.892 --> 00:05:00.350
 On the right side, you can see 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.300
 Google Play will automatically import 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.530
 Your app icon and image 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.740
 Therefore, it is obviously very important to optimize these contents. 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.820
 When you enable these campaigns, it’s easy. 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.810
 Because the system automatically optimizes your ads, bids 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.010
 Banner assignments and targeting criteria 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.140
 Our goal is to get the maximum installs at the target cost per install. 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.830
 This feature shows excellent results from the beginning of the Beta test. 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.019
 We are very happy to introduce this feature today. 

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:31.060
 In terms of user acquisition 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.132
 This feature is expected to make you a lot easier 

00:05:34.132 --> 00:05:35.840
 As I said before 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.714
 It's all based on data and data analysis. 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.890
 You can use some of the solutions provided by Google. 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.410
 For example, integrate with the AdWords SDK to track and measure conversions. 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.700
 Analyze data to measure an app activity 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.200
 Or choose to work with a third party like many people here. 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.870
 If you work with a third party, please let us know because we track the company with most third parties 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.465
 Have a close relationship 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.680
 Why do we have to measure it? 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.850
 Of course because this is a paid advertisement 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.860
 You must ensure your average life cycle value 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.910
 Above average install cost 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.660
 We know that there are 1/6 users. 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.160
 Will not shop in the app 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.360
 In addition, 80% of users after installing the app 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.130
 Used only once 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.080
 So you have to understand the lifecycle value of your app. 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.360
 Then get users through the channel at a lower cost. 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.229
 In this way, the profitability of the application can be achieved. 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:34.770
 Life cycle value 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.270
 Here is a very simple example 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.170
 But from the perspective of advertising channels 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.170
 We need to understand 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.120
 What practical value can users bring to you? 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.970
 Let's look at a basic case. 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.960
 Take a user who has been using for more than one year as an example 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.430
 We can see that a user will average on your app. 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.324
 Spend $5 to buy goods 

00:06:56.324 --> 00:06:57.740
 If you have a physical store 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.690
 They may spend an extra five dollars a year. 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.180
 Shopping at your physical store 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.030
 And we know that these users will pass reviews, ratings, and messaging apps. 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.660
 Promote your app to others 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.480
 So word of mouth will bring sales increase 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.090
 On average, a user will bring you $11 in revenue within a year. 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.589
 Therefore, the cost of acquiring the user cannot exceed this amount. 

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:20.130
 Your return on investment will only show positive values. 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.640
 In determining that we are willing to pay 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.440
 After getting the cost of a user 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.800
 We must understand how to maximize life cycle value 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.675
 And enhance the product's appeal to users 

00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:36.830
 Today the remote control does not seem to be very sensitive 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.000
 We also surveyed another group of users. 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.130
 To understand why these users like to use the app. 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.510
 And what important business activities they will use for the app. 

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.100
 Everyone can see here, in the entire channel 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.310
 Users like to use the app for a variety of different activities 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.780
 Viewing other people's reviews 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.680
 Until the channel terminal 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.040
 Old customer feedback 

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.660
 If you communicate with users 

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.600
 And how to view analytical data, etc. 

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.250
 Understand what activities users have done within your app 

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.920
 Then you can create an interactive campaign. 

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.360
 Engage users in the most engaging events in the channel section 

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.250
 There are currently two ways to create an interactive campaign. 

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.990
 The easiest way to do this is to create a list automatically. 

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.860
 Just leave your Google Play account 

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.280
 Connect to your AdWords account 

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.490
 This way, you will see many lists that are automatically generated by the system. 

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.138
 Convenient for remarketing with specific information 

00:08:31.138 --> 00:08:33.179
 If you want to judge whether your product is profitable 

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.820
 This is the easiest and easiest way to do it. 

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.740
 If you successfully complete this work 

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.350
 Then you can use the custom list. 

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.370
 You can import lists through Google Analytics or you can use lists from other servers or third-party integrations. 

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.120
 Create a list 

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.990
 And understand your users’ situation 

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.770
 The final step is to tailor the information to these users. 

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.970
 I have provided three examples of information tailored to the user. 

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.220
 If you want to engage users to interact with your app 

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.610
 First need to provide to all users 

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.140
 Content that can only be accessed or interacted with in the app 

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.540
 The second type of information is for 

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.266
 Abandon and stop users who use your app 

00:09:16.266 --> 00:09:17.640
 You want to regain the hearts of these users 

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.332
 The best way is 

00:09:19.332 --> 00:09:21.540
 Let users know that new features are available in your app 

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.540
 Use these features if they re-engage with your app 

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.500
 Finally, that is, what we usually see, users start to buy goods. 

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.080
 And added these items to the shopping cart but eventually gave up the shopping cart. 

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.327
 You can specifically target these users 

00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:35.910
 Provide it 

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.889
 Only for discounts used on the day 

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:39.180
 To attract these users to complete the purchase process 

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.730
 You can see that we introduced two points today. 

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.060
 The first is to launch a search ad on Play, although it’s not long before it’s launched, but it’s very good. 

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.830
 In addition, we’re launching a generic campaign today. 

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.460
 This campaign is expected to streamline your user acquisition process 

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.232
 Make it easier for you 

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:01.190
 If you want to discuss this information with me, please let me know. 

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.049
 I am always waiting 

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:03.340
 Wish you be happy 

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.300
 thank you all! 

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.200
 [applause] 

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.650
