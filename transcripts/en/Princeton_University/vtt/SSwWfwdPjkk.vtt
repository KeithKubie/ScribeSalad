BRAD ORTEGA: What
we're doing today

00:00:01.788 --> 00:00:05.790
is trying to make a menu
that you might see in 2050.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.039
The team came up
with three things

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.110
that we think we can
squash into the time frame

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.810
that we think everybody
is going to enjoy.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.520
The first thing we
addressed is livestock.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.670
And we have three examples
here that we're going

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.410
to cook for everybody to taste.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.070
The first one, this is a
regular grain-fed beef.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.960
The next thing is our
department's hamburger.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.970
This is a crafted,
blended burger.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.790
The beauty of this
is it's 30% mushroom.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.600
So we're using all that much
less water, all that much less

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.650
grain to feed the product.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.140
The third product we
have is very interesting.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.630
This is an Impossible burger.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.836
It was designed in a lab.

00:00:40.836 --> 00:00:42.210
The great thing
about this burger

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.120
is it has a 0% cow in it.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.600
I think it's mostly potato
protein, soy protein.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.040
It looks like a hamburger.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.150
It feels like one.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.110
You get the smell.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.310
You get the sizzle.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.330
It's a very, very cool product.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.540
The other thing we
came up with, seaweed.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.400
It's nutrient dense.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.960
No land to grow it.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.670
You don't need any pesticides.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.990
No fertilizer.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.830
It works as a side.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.390
It works mixed with
other vegetables.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330
I think we hit all
the marks with this.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.190
And the third item we're going
to pull out, it's crickets.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.600
Uses very little land.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.860
Very little water.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.460
Seems to be a pretty sustainable
item loaded with protein,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.140
loaded with calcium.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.470
I took some of this flour
and made a real basic brownie

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.990
recipe.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.073
A couple of them have some
whole crickets in them.

00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:27.420
A couple of them just
are made with the powder.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780
I felt if I made
these brownies, I'd

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.545
get a lot more takers today.

00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:36.000
And the cricket
itself is very bland.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.475
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:39.465
SUBJECT 1: It's good.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:40.455
SUBJECT 2: It is good.

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:42.440
It's like nuts.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.460
SMITHA HANEEF: Princeton
is about generating

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.800
pure knowledge and new
knowledge in the context of now

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.210
and into the future.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.270
And through the courses
that are being offered,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.390
students are exposed
enough to make decisions

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.850
for themselves and
in the societies

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.480
that they will be contributing
to in the next decade or two

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.995
decades.

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:05.370
NICOLE KALHORN:
And I was kind of

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.000
excited to try the
Impossible burger because I

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.490
heard a lot of hype about it.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.400
It's definitely
different texture wise.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.520
But it was kind of cool that
it actually did taste like meat

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.800
and it was so juicy.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.779
Still a little bit of
intimidation from bugs.

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.320
But I think if I
got more used to it,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.540
or if I didn't actually see
the bug that I was eating

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.040
like in the cricket
flour, then it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.220
was a lot easier
to eat the brownie

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.730
that didn't have like a cricket
head sticking out of it.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.350
I think it's
definitely a huge step.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.120
It's a really creative
step too actually.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.786
And I think that's
sort of what we need.

00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:34.260
I don't think we need
necessarily more crazy,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.640
super-niche technologies.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.800
But it could just be
people trying new things

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.350
and being willing
to take more risks

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.160
and push past the concept
of eating a cricket.
