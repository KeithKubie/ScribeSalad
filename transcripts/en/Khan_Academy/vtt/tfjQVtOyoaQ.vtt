00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.660
You can ride your bike
1/5 of a mile per minute.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.910
If it takes you
3 and 1/3 minutes

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.890
to get to your friend's
house, how many miles

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.020
away does your friend live?

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.845
And this here is pictures
of these guys on bicycles.

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:16.720
It's pretty clear they're
not riding to work,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.845
or some of these guys aren't
even riding a bicycle.

00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:20.490
But let's focus on the question.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.120
So you can ride your bike
1/5 of a mile per minute.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.200
And you're going to
do this for 3 and 1/3

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.611
minutes-- times 3 and 1/3.

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:31.110
So we really have
to figure out, how

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.260
do we multiply 1/5
times 3 and 1/3?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.630
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.310
You could literally view a 3 and
1/3 as this is the same thing

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.730
as 1/5 times 3 plus 1/3.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.920
That's exactly
what 3 and 1/3 is.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.350
And then we can just apply
the distributive property.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.106
This would be 1/5
times 3-- I'm going

00:01:00.106 --> 00:01:06.770
to keep the colors the
same-- plus 1/5 times 1/3.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.860
And this is going to
be equal to-- well,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.440
we could rewrite 1/5
times 3 as 1/5 times 3/1.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.550
That's what 3 really is if
we wrote it as a fraction.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.210
And then, of course, we're going
to have plus 1/5 times 1/3.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.082
And let's just think about
what each of these evaluate to.

00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:35.540
Here you multiplied
the numerators,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.040
and you multiplied
the denominators.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.070
So this is going to be equal
to 1 times 3 over 5 times 1.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.426
And this business
right over here

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:46.550
is going to be-- and
remember, order of operations.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.030
We want to do our
multiplication first.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.500
So this is going to be 1
times 1 over 5 times 3.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:05.387
And so that's going to be
equal to 3/5 plus 1/15.

00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:07.220
And now we have different
denominators here.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.520
But lucky for us,
3/5, if we multiplied

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.390
the numerator and
the denominator by 3,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.940
we're going to get
a denominator of 15.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.490
And so that's equal to 9/15
plus 1/15, which equals 10/15.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.380
And if you divide the numerator
and the denominator both by 5,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.750
you're going to get 2/3.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.956
So your friend lives 2/3
miles away from your house.

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:32.330
Well, that's kind
of interesting.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.770
And this was kind of
a long way to do it.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.410
Let's think about if there's
a simpler way to do it.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.570
So this is the same
thing as 1/5 times--

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.930
and I'm just going to write
3 and 1/3 as a mixed number.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.890
So it's 1/5 times 3 and 1/3 can
be rewritten as 9/3-- sorry,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.680
I'm going to rewrite 3 and
1/3 as an improper fraction.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.150
So this is the
same thing as 9/3--

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.795
that's 3-- plus 1/3, which is
the same thing as 1/5-- well, I

00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:03.370
switched colors
arbitrarily-- which

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.710
is the same thing-- I'm still
on the same color-- as 1/5

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.180
times 9/3 plus 1/3 is 10/3.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.950
And now we can just
multiply the numerator

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.700
and multiply the denominator--
or multiply the numerators.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.010
So this is 1 times
10-- I'm trying

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.010
to stay good with the
color coding-- over 5 times

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:37.820
3, which is exactly equal
to what we just got.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.410
1 times 10 is equal to 10.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.312
5 times 3 is 15.

00:03:42.312 --> 00:03:46.790
10/15, we already established,
is the same thing as 2/3.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.020
So your friend lives 2/3
of a mile away from you.
