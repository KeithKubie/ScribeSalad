00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:01.866
(mouse clicking)

00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.033
(beeping)

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.700
- For Chambers, and I know
we wish we could clone him

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.165
and bring him up to northern California.

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:19.937
We have tried over the
years, but it has not worked.

00:00:19.937 --> 00:00:23.290
And we're gonna move into, into my world,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.440
into the adult world, to
hear about some of the health

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.700
issues for adults with
cerebral palsy, Dr. Chambers.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.533
- Thank you.

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:36.763
So, is this on?

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.340
So, one of my other areas
of interest, actually,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.070
the other thing I do, half of my practice

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.903
is sports medicine.

00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:48.430
So it's kind of a strange
thing, but I take care

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.270
of adults with cerebral
palsy and all disabilities

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.380
and I've been doing that
since the early nineties.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.970
And one of the things I'm most proud about

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.640
in the cerebral palsy
academy is I got them to,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.640
I got us to change our
mission statement to include

00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:09.408
the lifespan, because there
was no scientific organization

00:01:09.408 --> 00:01:14.408
that even studied problems
with adults with cerebral palsy

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.320
or other developmental disabilities.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.120
So, I'm gonna just talk about
transitions in health care

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.860
and just using cerebral palsy as a model

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.200
because any other disorder
could work in this,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.440
and you already have my disclosures,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.790
so I won't go through that.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.240
So, we all know the problem
and particularly in this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.948
room I don't have to go
through, but you know

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:37.950
up until the age of 16
in some places care,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.730
pediatric care stops
at 16 and in California

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.827
it stops at 21.

00:01:42.827 --> 00:01:45.943
Our kids get the best care
they could possibly get.

00:01:45.943 --> 00:01:48.510
We have the best pediatricians,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.690
developmental pediatricians, neurologists.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.690
Our CSS system in California is fantastic,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.130
and then, and we have
great Shriner's systems.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.190
We have great children's
regional hospitals.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.397
I mean, things are fantastic,
and then you turn 21

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:07.208
and you just drop off the
cliff and we all know that

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:08.513
that's the problem.

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:11.440
(laughing)

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.512
I have an amen from this corner.

00:02:13.512 --> 00:02:18.512
So, once again I told you I'd
have a little hint of this,

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.010
that I thought that we're
taught that cerebral palsy is

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.690
a non progressive brain
disorder and I have seen enough

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.130
changes in my adult population
that I'm not quite sure

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.083
that that's true.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.080
I've seen people develop
Parkinson's like symptoms

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.542
when they're in their twenties.

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:39.060
I've seen MRI changes in the brain

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.830
but people have,
neurologists have told me,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.400
well, that's just
because they have changes

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.894
in the circulation of
the cerebral spinal fluid

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:50.360
and that's why it looks bad.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.040
But there are actually some changes.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.140
So I'm not quite sure that that's true,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.190
because remember all the people
that made these definitions

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.370
are pediatricians, and
they don't follow them

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.580
into adulthood and don't
know what's going on.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.480
So I mean, the last time I
found a really good thing

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.360
on the round table of
aging and cerebral palsy

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.761
was a long time ago.

00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.229
But they brought up
the same problems that,

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.870
we haven't solved any of these, and we're,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.960
and so I think there's nothing new in this

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.440
about exercise.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.237
We talked about some
women's issues yesterday,

00:03:20.237 --> 00:03:23.181
how we provide the quality of care.

00:03:23.181 --> 00:03:25.113
Nutrition's a huge problem.

00:03:25.113 --> 00:03:29.540
Many of my adult patients
are either undernourished

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.206
or overnourished.

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:35.900
We have medical conditions
that are, that we all have,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.240
heart disease, hypertension,
that just get worse with age

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.290
that we just ascribe to
people having cerebral palsy.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.930
Communication becomes
harder as you get older

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.690
if your parents aren't there
to help interpret for you

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.950
or if you're living in a
group home or some other

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.050
living situation where
people can't understand what

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.890
you're talking about.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.380
The psycho social aspects
of aging that we all have,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.820
and then, and then economics.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.020
We'll talk about some of these.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.960
So, there are many more
people with chronic conditions

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.280
that are living past the age of 18.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.113
We all know that.

00:04:10.113 --> 00:04:11.380
There's no surprise.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.120
As I told you earlier,
there are more adults

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.100
with cerebral palsy
than there are children.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.640
I try to make this argument
to the dean of my medical

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.473
school all the time.

00:04:18.473 --> 00:04:19.373
He goes, well,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.770
but the answer that the
department of medicine told me,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.400
but aren't they all on Medicaid?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.120
And I go, well, yeah.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.000
Well, we don't wanna see them, so,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.410
and that's exactly what happens.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.070
And so, we have all of
these patients that are now

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.670
living, you know, things like
people with muscular dystrophy

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.503
didn't use to live.

00:04:38.503 --> 00:04:41.940
We have much better care,
and now we have adults

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.995
with muscular dystrophy we
don't know what to do with.

00:04:43.995 --> 00:04:47.331
And, you know, if we look
at the life expectancy

00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:52.295
of able bodied North Americans, you know,

00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:54.963
in 1900 it was 47 years old.

00:04:57.248 --> 00:04:59.400
In '95, it's 76 years old,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.990
and there's, you know, so if you're 65,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.140
if you were age 65 in 1995 you
have 17 more years to live.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.974
It's a lot, it's a lot more than that now.

00:05:09.974 --> 00:05:12.490
I can't believe I didn't
change that slide.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.242
But life expectancy in Down Syndrome

00:05:15.242 --> 00:05:20.242
if you were born in 1929 your
average life was nine years,

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.480
because of the heart disease, mainly.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.400
That was how long people lived,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.190
and if you were born
in 1989 it's 56 years.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.190
So I still get calls from
cardiologists who are,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.750
adult cardiologists, friends of mine,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.200
who have a person with Down
Syndrome show up in their office

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.700
and they go, I have never seen
a person with Down Syndrome.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.770
I don't even know what's going on.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:45.780
But you guys saved him.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.090
I mean, our cardio
thoracic surgeon saved him.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.680
You guys saved him, and
what am I supposed to do?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.996
And I go wow, it sounds
like you have a problem.

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:53.640
(audience laughing)

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.660
But that is, but it is a
problem because we don't know,

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.610
there's a lot of things
that we just don't know

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.440
the natural history of,
and as we do more and more

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.140
keeping children alive
we don't know what to do.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.140
I just took care of a child
who was cured, truly cured,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.090
of Tay Sachs disease.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.206
They have no, the enzymes are
completely back, stem cells,

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:17.100
completely neurologically devastated,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.960
and I have no idea what
to do for this kid.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.221
I mean, there's no natural history.

00:06:20.221 --> 00:06:23.330
His hips are dislocated
and it was becoming painful

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.050
and it put them back in, but I don't know

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.560
what they're gonna, how
they're gonna do this,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.520
and then every one of
these genetic problems that

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.150
we have no idea what
the natural history is

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.548
is gonna be a challenge for us.

00:06:33.548 --> 00:06:37.600
And so, one of the big,
if you're just looking

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.840
at cerebral palsy in general the big

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.940
determinant of how long they're gonna live

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.170
often depends on whether they have

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.730
a seizure disorder or not.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.950
So, it may be because they aspirate

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.690
or because that means
there's a more severe CP,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.220
but if you don't have a
seizure disorder it seems like

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.360
your life expectancy is
probably 10 to 15 years longer.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.250
But no one's exactly sure what that is.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.400
So the mean now is about 60 years old.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.220
So we have a long time,
40 years, of kids who have

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.370
no real, oh, kids, I
guess they're kids now.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.580
They're younger than I am.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.300
But that are, we have
people that are living 'til

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.790
they're 60 and that have
no care during that time,

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.150
or very poor care, and
that's where the problem

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.470
with the access to medical care.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.707
So, and I think some of the problem is

00:07:23.707 --> 00:07:26.150
the way we train our physicians.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.320
We train the people who take
care of the primary care

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.190
problems as pediatricians or internists

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.480
and then there's family
practitioners who are supposed

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.100
to span that gap and there
are now med peds people

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.850
that do that, but almost
all the med peds people

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.700
that I talk to don't get into this

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.980
to take care of people with disabilities.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.090
There's other, they have
other interests than that

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.330
including our university at UCSD.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.940
And so, and this really, I
was kind of joking around

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.740
with our dean about what our dean said

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.700
but it's totally true.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.250
The reimbursement for this is so poor

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.790
and I can't, I really can't
blame a internal medicine

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.850
doctor who has no
training in cerebral palsy

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.380
or developmental disabilities
and having someone

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.950
in a wheelchair with 20 medical problems

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.410
and problems with cerebral
palsy come into their office

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.040
for the $19 that they get for that

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.140
and it's really, I can't blame anybody.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.989
But it's a shame on our
society, not a shame on them,

00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:28.050
and you know you get a
six dollar for a return

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.081
visit with MediCal.

00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:31.000
I don't know if you know that,
how well you get reimbursed

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.950
as a doctor, and then the
problem with the durable

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.229
medical equipment.

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:36.470
How do we get it?

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.656
And I think someone mentioned
it in the CCS talk is

00:08:39.656 --> 00:08:43.310
when they're in CCS they're taken care of.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.887
They get, you get the
equipment that's all,

00:08:45.887 --> 00:08:48.230
but once you're out of
that you're in Medicaid

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.140
and it's tough to get the equipment.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.173
Transportation becomes a
bigger problem as (laughs)

00:08:55.173 --> 00:08:59.110
I get a lot of--
(audience laughing)

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.890
I guess that's a no kidding, huh?

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.720
And it really is true.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.060
You probably don't appreciate that,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.070
but people that have jobs in California,

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.810
at least in San Diego, I
can't, maybe I can't speak

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.810
for California, you have
to call the bus every day.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.327
You have to say, you need
to pick me up tomorrow

00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:20.030
some time between eight
and 12 or something,

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.394
whenever they say they're gonna show up.

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:25.030
Or you may not get a ride at all, yeah.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.710
So that's exactly right,
and so transportation

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.860
is a real problem, and then
access to doctor's offices

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.693
is really bad.

00:09:32.693 --> 00:09:36.270
My son sees a psychiatrist
who is totally embarrassed

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.090
that he doesn't have access to his place.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.610
So he comes to the house for house calls.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.660
There's not many psychiatrists
that do house calls

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.730
but then I pay him cash so
he probably doesn't like,

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.620
there's--
(audience laughing)

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.270
It's probably a different reason.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.080
And that comes to access
to mental health care.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.400
So as I told you a little bit
earlier in my adult clinic

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.810
I have a very high incidence
of mental health issues

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.984
that are totally unaddressed.

00:09:58.984 --> 00:10:02.370
I have a hard time getting
people to see them,

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.540
to see people with
problems, and then there's

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.030
communication issues and
some of the things we talked

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.540
about yesterday with the sexuality issues

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.943
and gender issues are also, have problems.

00:10:15.943 --> 00:10:18.880
There's the social stigma
of mental illness on top

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.795
of having mental illness,
there's that problem,

00:10:21.795 --> 00:10:24.374
and then problems with
compliance with medication,

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:27.610
which is true of all people
that have bipolar disorder

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.410
for example or depression.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.370
You know, the medication side
effects are really terrible.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.370
So my son has bipolar disorder
and some of the side effects

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.650
of the medications are dystonia
tardive dyskinesia, right?

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.900
So you've already got that,
let's make that worse.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.640
So that's not so good.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.323
And then the quality, once again,

00:10:47.323 --> 00:10:50.780
we just don't have physicians
that know what they're doing.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.260
We talked about dental
care access yesterday

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.260
and I've had two patients
die of dental abscesses.

00:10:59.717 --> 00:11:02.751
So I've taken care of
them their entire life.

00:11:02.751 --> 00:11:04.880
They get an abscess they aspirate

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.859
and they get a multi bacteria,
multi microbial bacterial

00:11:08.859 --> 00:11:11.903
infection that can't be taken
care of with antibiotics,

00:11:11.903 --> 00:11:14.567
just 'cause no one brushes their teeth.

00:11:14.567 --> 00:11:19.156
In San Diego, I've actually
talked to our regional center.

00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:22.210
It's okay in group homes if
they don't brush their teeth,

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.630
they just stick the stuff in
their mouth like Listerine

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.537
or something and that's
all they have to do.

00:11:26.537 --> 00:11:29.080
But we all know that
that doesn't do anything

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.760
and but that's what they have to do now.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.872
And once again, most
of our medical care is

00:11:33.872 --> 00:11:36.520
accessed through the emergency room.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.510
So the general health
issues are, you know,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.620
here's the dental, the dental stuff,

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.680
and this is where it came down to.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.290
So they don't get their dental hygiene.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.600
When their parents are around they do,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.470
but once they get into a
different living situation

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.173
they may not get even on a
weekly basis their teeth cleaned.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.300
Exercise, something
that we all need to do.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.695
It's important for aging
and how many adults

00:12:00.695 --> 00:12:04.763
with disabilities do we
have do aerobic exercise?

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.010
None, right?

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.600
I mean, it's really
hard to do it and it's,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.796
and even the people at GMFCS, you know,

00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:14.410
if you're at GMFCS three you get plenty

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.890
of aerobic exercise, 'cause you're using,

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.630
you're using your walker and stuff,

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.100
but the people that are,
you know, as you get older

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.379
and you have a sedentary
job like many of us do

00:12:23.379 --> 00:12:25.370
you sit around, you're not, the last thing

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.340
after you're totally
exhausted from walking around

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.140
on crutches is to come home
and do some of the exercises

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.450
and with it we don't even
really have any guidelines.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.370
We talked about this
yesterday and I think this is,

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.733
there's no reason to bring this up.

00:12:37.733 --> 00:12:41.020
I do know that in my
adult clinic I'm the one

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.450
that sets up all of theses appointments.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.181
I'm a pediatric orthopedic surgeon.

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:46.830
I mean, you gotta, this is,
(audience laughing)

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:47.980
this is really bad.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.520
So, I set up the PAP smears
and I set up the breast,

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.980
you know, the mammograms,
and have discussions

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.640
with menopause with my older patients.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.540
So, I'm the wrong person, no, no, no,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.820
I'm the wrong person to be doing that.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.090
There's no clapping there.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.110
There's something wrong with that.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.837
You don't want that.

00:13:08.837 --> 00:13:12.023
And we talked about nutrition,
overweight and underweight,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.466
and one of the most common
causes of death in adults

00:13:17.466 --> 00:13:20.563
with cerebral palsy is
aspiration and choking.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.960
And you lose, people do lose function.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.941
They have the pseudobulbar palsy.

00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:28.380
Any medication that they
take, if you have reflux

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.510
from being overweight or
just as you get, you know,

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.510
those of us, you get
older, you get reflux.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.760
It could actually be a life
threatening problem in adults

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.710
and especially if you're
fed in a nursing home

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.817
where people are just chewing,
putting stuff in your mouth.

00:13:40.817 --> 00:13:43.950
It doesn't really matter if
you're swallowing it or not,

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.830
and once again, if you
have no teeth, your teeth

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.319
are all rotten, your nutrition gets worse.

00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:53.726
And so, as you get older,
as all of us get older,

00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:58.580
our lungs become less
strong and so that alters

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.090
your speech patterns and
so it's more difficult

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.350
to understand.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.094
And then everything that
adults have as you get older

00:14:07.094 --> 00:14:11.455
people with cerebral palsy
who are people get as well,

00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:14.976
and so, and these are all these problems.

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:18.020
But things are just,
people just miss these,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.690
and osteopenia, we had
a little bit bit of,

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.267
somebody mentioned some things
about fragility fractures.

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:25.810
You know, they are a little
bit higher but not as much

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.400
as I thought they would be.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.358
I don't take care, I
would say I see as many

00:14:30.358 --> 00:14:33.040
fragility fractures in
children as I see in adults.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.899
So I'm not, I don't think
it's that huge of a problem,

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:39.116
mainly because a lot of
times if you're spastic

00:14:39.116 --> 00:14:41.840
even though you're not
standing your bones aren't

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.510
particularly that bad, which
is a little bit of a surprise.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.260
Substance abuse is a
problem with our patients,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.390
with our adult patients.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.670
I'll have to say it's a little bit worse

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.160
since January first.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.413
I have a lot of people showing
up stoned to my clinic.

00:14:58.413 --> 00:15:01.313
(audience laughing)

00:15:01.313 --> 00:15:03.327
But that's just my nurses.

00:15:03.327 --> 00:15:06.327
(audience laughing)

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.540
So, no, but this is
becoming a little bit more

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.405
of a problem.

00:15:14.405 --> 00:15:17.941
But some of the, some
of the, so once again,

00:15:17.941 --> 00:15:19.970
don't miss those.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.640
Things that do get worse over
time and I've seen this are

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.040
seizure disorders get
worse as you get older.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.230
We have early onset dementia
and I think that's either,

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.022
there's a talk coming out, yeah.

00:15:34.022 --> 00:15:38.340
So there's early onset dementia
and early onset Alzheimer's

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.760
in people with cerebral palsy.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.480
I've seen, I'm telling you
I've seen some patients

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.890
with early Parkinson's
disorder, which actually

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.590
have been treated well
with deep brain stimulation

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.250
which also helped their
dystonia a little bit,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.600
but dystonia gets worse throughout life.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.826
Once again, these problems are worse

00:15:55.826 --> 00:15:58.320
in adults with cerebral palsy

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.310
and the vision problems are, once again,

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.670
I told you, remember, the vision problems

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.110
because of field cuts.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.840
Those field cuts can progress through life

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.650
and people lose their vision
and then it's often difficult,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.900
who knows, if you haven't
monitored it throughout

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.160
their life you don't really
know if that's just part

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.543
of aging or you know just
the normal loss of eyesight.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.450
And then I see, you see
more reflux and more dental

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.073
problems as people get older.

00:16:22.295 --> 00:16:25.340
Like all of us we have declining mobility

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.670
and it's magnified in
people with cerebral palsy.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.890
That GMFCS those curves
that I showed you, you know,

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.080
about the, I don't know if you noticed.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.750
They had three ages.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:40.750
One was six to 12, 12 to 18,
and then the 19 through 23

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.470
and that's as far as they've gone out.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.140
You, actually people lose function.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.705
So you from a three to a four, a four,

00:16:47.705 --> 00:16:51.310
rarely a four to a five, but
you go from a two to a three

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.320
meaning you're using,
you're just using AFOs.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.320
The next thing you do,
you're using a walker

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.750
and then that group can
drop down as they get older

00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.960
into wheelchairs.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.900
I think we all know that.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.160
You've seen it happen.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.550
Probably even your older
teenagers where that happens,

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.660
because it's more convenient.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.270
It takes so much energy
and life to get through

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.040
but then there's having
a wheelchair is not

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.400
the easiest thing in the world.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.830
But we all have decreased
endurance as we get older

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.111
and that's a problem.

00:17:16.111 --> 00:17:20.380
The other thing that I see
in people that didn't even

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.530
really have problems before
is that you start having

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.660
early arthritis and because
your joints don't go through

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.970
a full range of motion,
whether it's your hip

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.480
or your knee or your ankle
these things break down fast.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.154
So if you take your
knee and just go through

00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:36.650
a range of motion like this, just going,

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.810
that's all you're,
that's all you're doing,

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.810
though at that area of
your knee wears down

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.740
and it's particularly
the patella femoral joint

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.410
and so we have some
real problems, you know,

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.497
in 30 and 40 year olds
having arthritis that

00:17:48.497 --> 00:17:52.020
I see in 60 year olds, you
know, we see in 60 year olds

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.420
typically developing people.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.630
And the spine gets worse, too.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.540
A lot of back pain.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.174
I would say most of my
adult clinic is pain

00:18:00.174 --> 00:18:03.470
and that's what we're seeing
and trying to figure out

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.723
why that is and is there any
role for orthopedic surgery?

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.670
We don't really know.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.740
So the other, the other
problem is if you have

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.330
athetoid CP which is actually
less than a, you know,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.846
that was very common back
in the fifties and sixties

00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:24.290
before we realized about
hyperbilirubinemia.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.700
A lot of adults had this
choreoathetosis movement

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.026
with normal mentation.

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:33.470
And you'd see people walking
down the road, you know,

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.875
and having a hard time talk,
but when you talk to them

00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:39.800
there was no other problem,
and when they sat down

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.240
and weren't moving around
they didn't have problems.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.500
But this, the constant
movement of your neck

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.500
either with athetosis or
with dystonia for example

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:55.400
can cause spurs that I
have a patient that one

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.880
of the bone spurs cut
the spinal cord in half

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.420
and people watched this guy
get worse and worse and worse

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.010
and said oh, he's got CP.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.613
And so, his spinal cord
was cut in half at C seven.

00:19:05.558 --> 00:19:09.413
And so, these are, and so you get these

00:19:09.413 --> 00:19:12.880
and you also can get ruptured
discs that people miss

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.870
and that's what, this is from the motion.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.090
And also, as we all get
older, our muscles waste.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.040
It's sarcopenia.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.530
Sorry, you're all wasting away right here,

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.850
and that's why we have to lift weights

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.790
and that's an important
part of, it's not just

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.220
for orthopedic surgeons, okay?

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.530
Just remember that.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.020
You have to lift weights.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.710
And the other thing
that we see is many more

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.739
skin breakdowns, skin ulcers.

00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:41.150
Once again as you get old,
or when you're young you can

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.983
do a lot of things.

00:19:41.983 --> 00:19:45.530
You sit in the same
position and you can't move

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.290
your body around you get
skin breakdown pretty easily

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.120
and you think of, you
know, you can think of your

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.420
90 year old grandparents
who, you know, when they hit

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.060
the wall or something
their skin just flakes off

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.663
and it happens sooner in
people with cerebral palsy

00:19:57.663 --> 00:20:00.140
because they're always
sitting in the same position.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.747
And so we see a lot of that.

00:20:01.747 --> 00:20:06.210
And so here's someone that
came to me and had a lot

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.104
of, I guess that light,
I don't know how to turn

00:20:08.104 --> 00:20:08.937
that light down.

00:20:08.937 --> 00:20:11.670
I don't know if you can
see it but he was having

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.560
swallowing problems.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.670
First of all, he had a
spinal cord stimulator

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.460
which was supposed to help his spasticity.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.526
Obviously nobody does that
anymore, but that was the idea.

00:20:19.526 --> 00:20:22.370
But he couldn't swallow and
he had a swallowing test

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.220
and they said everything was negative,

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.610
and I don't know if you
can see right here but his

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.030
vertebral bodies are twice
as wide as the other ones.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.620
It's right there and I actually
looked at the swallowing

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.360
study and it goes right
there and it goes bloop

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.220
and comes right back out.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.740
So, that was a very simple
solution, well, surgery,

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.870
but it was a simple solution
and that we just had

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.340
to take those spurs off and
he was able to swallow right

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.130
away and he actually gained
10 pounds and so it was

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.610
a really, but you just
have to look for it,

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.410
and that's the question.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.180
So as I said, chronic pain
is the biggest problem that

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.898
I have and so there's the
botulinum toxins, oral medication,

00:20:57.898 --> 00:21:02.360
and I forgot to add it on
there but I really do think

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.360
there's a role in the
cannabinoids, marijuana.

00:21:08.114 --> 00:21:10.020
(audience laughing)

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.220
But, but, you know, the CBD
thing I think there's gonna be,

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.678
you know, it doesn't
have to be the THC part

00:21:16.678 --> 00:21:21.675
where you get high but maybe
impair your, yeah (laughs).

00:21:21.675 --> 00:21:23.104
Sounds good, huh?

00:21:23.104 --> 00:21:25.340
(audience laughing)

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.970
But also, but so, I
think there's gonna be,

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.253
I think, I hope that we'll be
able to study this some day.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.829
All things must end.

00:21:32.829 --> 00:21:35.400
Pain medications are a real problem,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.590
especially with the opioid overuse.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.040
Probably the biggest problem.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.943
I've rarely seen adults
that are opiod dependent.

00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:51.300
It certainly could be possible
but the biggest problems

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.780
that the realize right
away is constipation.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.670
They already have constipation
and that's the last

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.772
thing they wanna add to their life.

00:21:57.772 --> 00:22:01.399
All these other things,
massage, chiropractic,

00:22:01.399 --> 00:22:02.890
healing touch.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.700
My wife's a healing touch practitioner.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.870
I think those are all really important.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.490
My wife comes to all of my CP clinics

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.160
particularly my adult clinics.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.513
They love seeing her
and they hate seeing me.

00:22:11.513 --> 00:22:13.929
(audience laughing)

00:22:13.929 --> 00:22:16.911
And doing wheelchair
modifications for pain

00:22:16.911 --> 00:22:20.490
is really important for
the therapist to take,

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.050
to look at.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:22.920
You change.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.608
I mean, we all know they
change through adolescence

00:22:25.608 --> 00:22:27.810
just 'cause of their
growing, but as you get older

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.353
your weight changes either up or down.

00:22:30.353 --> 00:22:33.350
If you have a little
scoliosis and it curves just

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.960
a little bit more and
you don't need surgery

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.540
but you have to change
your chair and once again

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.550
those skin issues and I
would say I was doing so much

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.520
of this that I hired a
physiatrist just to do my adult,

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.760
do my adult care and it
really is, that's fantastic.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.040
So she spends a lot of time,
frequent changing of positions.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.020
The psycho social issues,
we talked about that.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.730
75% of adults even the
GMFCS three and above

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:04.730
are independent in ADLs,
but then that means

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.235
that more aren't.

00:23:06.235 --> 00:23:09.957
30% still live at home with their parents.

00:23:09.957 --> 00:23:14.957
I saw a 67 year old whose 87
year old mother brought him in.

00:23:15.095 --> 00:23:18.453
That's not good for any
of those two people.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.860
Once again, high incidence of depression,

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.220
low self esteem, and I talked
about these depressive things.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.060
So transition from home
to community, we have to,

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.940
you know, as doctors
and providers, you know,

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.620
what's available for people?

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.270
You know, do they stay at home?

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.270
Do they move into residential facilities?

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.840
What are the community based
programs that are available?

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.360
And unfortunately, in our
place we've actually looked

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.193
at all of them.

00:23:44.193 --> 00:23:47.080
They're on our website, but
they're not easy to find.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.980
All these programs are not out there.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.790
Even us looking for them and
knowing where to look for it

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.200
they're hard to find.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.890
Do they go into an
intermediate care facility,

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.751
which we hope would be the
worst place that they could go.

00:23:57.751 --> 00:24:01.870
Community homes, there are
some great community homes

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.936
and there are some really
bad community homes.

00:24:03.936 --> 00:24:07.390
You know, after watching
that ACLU thing yesterday

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:12.150
I was thinking of how some of
things are just rife for that.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.726
Supported living, I think
this is a really good option.

00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:20.020
Independent living, my son's
actually in supported living.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.200
So he has, we bought a house for him

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.990
and then he has people coming
in to care for him 24 hours

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.420
a day and you know we see him
four times a week but we don't

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.420
have to do the care, which you don't want

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.540
your parents to be doing that.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.990
There are some people who
can live independently

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.580
and sometimes to have the people come by

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.060
and just checking on them
and seeing how they're doing.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.608
The transition from school
to work, you know, as we,

00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:46.020
the public schools, once
again, they're just like us.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.210
Once you're done, you're done, sorry.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.813
We do have programs that go up to 21.

00:24:50.813 --> 00:24:53.520
In San Diego it's called
the Trace program.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.470
I don't know, do you have
that here in, same thing?

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.620
Okay, and so I think those are
really good for transition.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.290
College, we have the young woman who went,

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.840
got her masters, and those
are all, those are options.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.080
So obviously much more
complex and we help support

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.646
many patients in San
Diego who go to college.

00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:17.348
We talk to their counselors
and we provide all their,

00:25:17.348 --> 00:25:21.050
they're not IEPs or but
they're, they're similar to that

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.622
for the colleges.

00:25:22.622 --> 00:25:26.290
Vocational training, it
seems like we used to do

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.123
a lot of this.

00:25:27.123 --> 00:25:29.300
It seems like there's less of this now,

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.550
but I think that's the thing we can go.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.495
We talked about the unemployment rate.

00:25:33.495 --> 00:25:36.540
Most people receive government stipends.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.970
That's at risk right now as
you've seen some of the bills

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.143
before Congress.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.324
We gotta pay for those tax cuts

00:25:44.324 --> 00:25:47.020
and that's where it's gonna come from.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.793
I was just in Louisiana last week.

00:25:48.793 --> 00:25:52.379
I guess I could be
political in San Francisco.

00:25:52.379 --> 00:25:54.700
I was just in Louisiana last week

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.616
and they, you know, they like
Kansas cut all their taxes

00:25:57.616 --> 00:26:00.450
and the very first thing
they cut was all the services

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.160
for disabled children and adults.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.880
It was on the front
page of the paper there,

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.930
just the day before yesterday, so, and,

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.230
so that's where we're,
that's where we're headed.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.690
So, getting jobs are really important

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.130
and we're involved in that
and helping people get jobs.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.110
We work through the regional
center as much as we can

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.630
but there's, you know, just
regular competitive employment

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.589
like we all have, supported
employment where there may be

00:26:25.589 --> 00:26:28.570
someone coming to help someone go to work,

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.380
giving a job coach, and
these are, there's very few

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.003
of these left, these day
programs and sheltered workshops.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.120
In some way that's positive,
and in some ways it's negative

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.920
and some of the positive
ways it gets, it forces

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.640
the individual with the
disability to be in the community.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.640
It forces our, well, it
encourages our people that have,

00:26:52.482 --> 00:26:55.710
that are employers to have
people with disabilities

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.870
but that doesn't always work.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.780
But the sheltered workshops
were just another way

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.600
to isolate and segregate our
people with disabilities.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.490
And so I don't really
have a thought about that

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.056
but I know we're seeing fewer of them.

00:27:09.056 --> 00:27:12.760
And so the transition from
adult, pediatric to adult

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.400
health care, a lot of it
has to do with insurance.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.420
So, the whole the Medicare act
was set up, Medicare MediCal

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.310
CMS type thing, was set
up to have this dichotomy

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.300
at age 18 or 21 and so that was set up

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.200
in the sixties, and that's the problem.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.130
So why don't we have CCS for life?

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.630
And why, where does that come from?

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.070
We give them just the best care at all.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.481
It's the same money, same
trunk of money comes from

00:27:39.481 --> 00:27:41.480
the, you know, the state.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.830
One goes to Medicaid
instead of going to CCS

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.880
and why not keep that great program going

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.675
and I've talked to our legislator.

00:27:47.675 --> 00:27:50.080
You know, the one thing
about term limits is

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.532
your legislators don't know
anything about anything.

00:27:52.532 --> 00:27:53.740
Right?
(audience laughing)

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.930
I mean they, you know,
it's just, it's terrible.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:58.170
But I'm not, I don't know
if that's right or not.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.370
But they don't know anything.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:00.994
They don't even know what CCS is.

00:28:00.994 --> 00:28:03.570
So, once again, the mental health issues

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.230
are a real problem as far
as how do we get anybody

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.823
to take care of those patients.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.610
We want our adults to have
real choices in all aspects

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.790
of life, have, provide functional skills,

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.029
not just what you've
learned in high school.

00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:24.029
These are actually from
adults with cerebral palsy,

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.960
what they want.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.640
You want to have an interaction
with a variety of people.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.450
You want to be just in generic services.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.500
You don't have your own
special little place to go.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.670
You wanna, don't go,
you wanna go to the YMCA

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.980
or the JCC across the street.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.397
You know, have access
to community resources,

00:28:40.397 --> 00:28:43.360
a range of community environments not just

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.120
the one place where you get to go.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.760
You wanna live in a typical neighborhood

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.276
not in a little isolated place.

00:28:49.276 --> 00:28:52.080
Doing what we all do, you
have to have something to do

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.450
every day, and if you
don't you don't survive.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:56.960
It's one of the reasons that people retire

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.871
and if they don't have anything
they don't last very long.

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:02.546
You wanna have non
adversarial interactions

00:29:02.546 --> 00:29:05.020
instead of having to fight
for everything that you have

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:10.020
in your life, have
friends, and that brings up

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.460
these issues, and we
talked about sexuality

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.210
and self esteem yesterday.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.510
I took a lot of these slides out.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.703
And we talked about the
competency yesterday

00:29:18.703 --> 00:29:22.995
about how that's a civil
right that can be taken away

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:25.479
and why they don't take it seriously.

00:29:25.479 --> 00:29:28.030
Now I might have disagreed
a little bit with the,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.770
I'm forgetting her name, it was so great.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.590
Anyways, oh, not the public defender.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.570
I wasn't there for that one.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.644
The person from the ACLU, Susan.

00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:41.644
Anyway, she said that it's
hard to get your rights back.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.940
Well every three years
my son, we have to take,

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.590
my son has a lawyer and
we have to take a lawyer

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.680
and we go to court.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.720
It's not messing around stuff.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.780
So it's obviously very
expensive, 'cause I have to pay

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.016
for both lawyers, but--

00:29:55.016 --> 00:29:56.600
(audience laughing)

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.520
But we still have to go to court

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.350
and have the discussion.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.330
Has anything changed?

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:04.190
And so, I think our judges
in San Diego take it

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.730
very seriously 'cause they
realize you're taking away

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.290
people's civil rights.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:13.290
So, our population with
disabilities is growing rapidly.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.960
We know little about the
natural history of these

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.247
disabilities and I'm kind of guilty.

00:30:19.247 --> 00:30:22.150
The only people that come
to my clinic are people

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.350
that have a problem.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.783
So I don't know what my denominator is.

00:30:25.783 --> 00:30:26.750
I know what my numerator is.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.970
It's 5100 patients, but I don't
know what my denominator is

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.210
and so they, those other
people may be doing great

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.000
or they just can't get in to see us

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.606
and so I don't know what
the natural history is.

00:30:36.606 --> 00:30:38.720
So we need to do research and there's no,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.765
I can guarantee you, there's
no money, I've tried,

00:30:40.765 --> 00:30:41.695
in this area.

00:30:41.695 --> 00:30:44.450
We need to educate our medical students

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.170
and other health care
providers in adult care, amen,

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:52.360
another amen, and that
needs, that could start now.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.800
There's no reason why that
can't be done right now.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.498
It's kind of crazy, and
then our, we have to have

00:30:58.498 --> 00:31:01.602
you know a health maintenance organization

00:31:01.602 --> 00:31:05.231
other than just a way for money to be put.

00:31:05.231 --> 00:31:08.170
This is a perfect position for an HMO,

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.620
whether it's a state run HMO or whatever,

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.100
and I know we have that
opportunity but I guarantee,

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:17.430
the people, there was a thing
that people with Medicaid

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.520
had to be in an HMO and I lost
about a half of my patients

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.590
whose parents call me every
day going there's no one

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.010
in this HMO that knows how to take care

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.750
of someone with disability,
and you probably

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.670
have run into that too.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.240
So I see them for free,
but there's not many other

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.090
people that can do that.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:36.700
And so what are the solutions?

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.230
And Clarissa, I don't
know if she's here today,

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.470
'cause I don't usually
give this talk to you all,

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.180
because I stole her stuff.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.420
You're supposed to hide
where you steal stuff from

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.170
but I stole it from her
from this conference

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.960
when I came a couple
years ago, and her thing,

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.908
this ITOP, improving
transitional outcomes,

00:31:55.908 --> 00:31:59.480
is, you know, provider
competency, access to quality

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.430
health care, patient
support, quality assurance

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.210
and oversight, public
engagement and support,

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.740
and you can see it's very
similar to what she did

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.093
in the adapt, was it adapt?

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.390
Aspire, aspire yesterday, to, you know,

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.313
for children and families with autism.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.000
So how we, we need to train
and mentor these people.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.380
It's hard to find mentors
'cause there's not many around

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.990
that know anything about it
and the use of electronic

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.490
health records so they can
be transferred from place

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.412
to place I think is really important.

00:32:32.412 --> 00:32:35.774
It's the bane of my existence,
electronic health records.

00:32:35.774 --> 00:32:39.830
I hate it, but it's great,
when they're done well.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:43.180
It's just an extra two hours
at the end of every one

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:48.180
of my days, and then the
barriers whether it's exam rooms

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.630
or how families, how people
get access to information

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:53.220
and longer appointment times.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.850
That was brought up this morning,

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:59.056
and then, and provide, and
have specialized doctors,

00:32:59.056 --> 00:33:02.540
specialists who will be
able to see these people.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.424
So, how do we get this information out?

00:33:06.424 --> 00:33:09.640
Well, the computer is great
but many people can't,

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.774
many people with CP either
don't have access to a computer,

00:33:12.774 --> 00:33:14.510
they don't have high speed internet.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.590
You know, going to the library,
certainly not the easiest

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.120
thing in the world to get
to to get this information,

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.095
and so I think that's
gonna, that's a real,

00:33:21.095 --> 00:33:23.394
that's a barrier for people.

00:33:23.394 --> 00:33:26.629
We talked a little bit
about the language barrier,

00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:29.370
not having all these
information in Spanish.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.910
Half my patients are Spanish speakers,

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.610
so it's really hard now to do that.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:37.270
How do we get the, how do
you reimburse the doctors

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.527
and the health facilities so they'll be,

00:33:39.527 --> 00:33:41.060
wanna take care of this?

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.984
How do we change our transportation?

00:33:43.984 --> 00:33:48.790
You know, the clinicians,
those, there's, I'm lucky.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.610
I have residents and fellows
and nurse practitioners

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:52.620
and PAs and all those.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.176
I have tons of help.

00:33:54.176 --> 00:33:56.540
But most people are by themselves.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.140
There are many, many primary care doctors

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.150
that are by themselves,
and you can't expect them

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.986
to see someone, you know,
if you see five patients

00:34:02.986 --> 00:34:07.986
with disabilities and you make $29 a visit

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.820
that's not a very good day.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.814
It doesn't even turn on the lights.

00:34:11.814 --> 00:34:15.190
And then, can we provide health
care in natural settings?

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:18.650
Can we have ways to have
mobile vans to go around?

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.634
And I think those are all possibilities.

00:34:20.634 --> 00:34:24.210
Education for our patients
and their families

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:25.963
and people who are caring for them.

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:29.990
Who, who makes, who helps make decisions?

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:32.890
This is gonna be, this is
a real, a real question

00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:37.040
and I think this is something
Clarissa has looked at.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.893
How do we teach our caregivers?

00:34:38.893 --> 00:34:41.990
I mean, my son has 12 caregivers.

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:46.010
They make the minimum wage and you know

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.350
I'm trusting, that's a lot of trust.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.132
That's why we're over there
four or five times a week.

00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:54.580
But most people don't
have advocates like we are

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.600
and then when we die who's gonna be there?

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.570
I mean, I'm assuming,
I'm hoping I'm not gonna

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:00.893
outlive my son.

00:35:00.893 --> 00:35:05.060
My son's gonna outlive
me, and then coming up

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.520
with a health care plan for every person

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.900
and that's very, very
similar to what road block

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.400
that Clarissa talked about yesterday.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.400
I mean road map, not road block.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.554
We do have road blocks, but a road map.

00:35:17.554 --> 00:35:19.890
And then just the quality
assurance to make sure

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:21.813
we're doing good things for people.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:26.430
And then, you know,
educating the public on that

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.940
this is a real problem and
once again we're all gonna

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.190
be disabled at some point,
and so when people are going,

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.182
well, what do I care about
someone with a wheelchair?

00:35:34.182 --> 00:35:37.170
Well, you might be in one
someday, or what do I care,

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.510
and it's also the thing that you've seen.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.080
So when I was, you know,
just starting out all the,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.730
in pediatric orthopedics
all the parents came

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.570
in those umbrella strollers, right?

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:48.930
And now they've got those SUV double wides

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.330
with DVD players built in them
and all that kind of stuff.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.663
So that's because we have curb cuts, so.

00:35:55.663 --> 00:35:59.576
So, we wanna develop a shared
vision of responsibility

00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:04.576
that we're champions and
then this is where our,

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.100
one of our responsibilities
and we're the only people

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.870
that can do this is to
educate our lawmakers

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.300
and having done that some time it's,

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.086
it's kind of interesting.

00:36:14.086 --> 00:36:18.400
It's fun and you learn
a lot, but you realize

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.040
if you don't have a checkbook with you

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.860
no one wants to talk to
you, and I did learn that.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.860
That was quite a, it's kind of cool to be

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.530
in the halls of Congress
'cause you see it on TV

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:32.780
all the time but realize
that you're nothing.

00:36:34.059 --> 00:36:37.620
And then look at the
different, different models

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.190
and this is where the real
problem is is, you know,

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.072
we educate primary care specialists

00:36:42.072 --> 00:36:44.700
and it's not gonna be
pediatricians 'cause pediatricians

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.970
don't wanna take care of 60 year olds.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.423
That's why they're pediatricians.

00:36:47.423 --> 00:36:52.000
The family practitioners
possibly, but they,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.220
I haven't found them to
be a very interested group

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.793
in this area.

00:36:56.793 --> 00:36:59.930
I'm getting ready to
hire a med peds person

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.620
but I'm having a hard time finding one

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.150
that is interested in
it because once again

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.810
you don't get paid very much to do this,

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.907
this really complex work, and it's really,

00:37:07.907 --> 00:37:09.616
and it's hard stuff.

00:37:09.616 --> 00:37:12.630
Universities should be
able to take this on.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:16.240
They have residents and
fellows and it'd be a great way

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:20.070
but and once, my
university at UCSD does not

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.740
want to see more than 7% Medicaid.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.964
That's their goal, and
I don't know what to say

00:37:25.964 --> 00:37:27.800
and that's just, that's
just the way it is.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.220
So, that's why I see all these patients.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.010
We need to get some lifespan physicians

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.550
and I think that's possibly coming

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.540
and I think as we start doing things in

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.700
our CP academy and some
of our schools that

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.820
this might happen.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.402
You know, it's interesting
in Europe, the way that,

00:37:45.402 --> 00:37:49.290
at least in orthopedics, when
they take care of a child,

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.050
say that, a hip problem.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:53.790
So an orthopedic surgeon
will take care of the newborn

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:57.320
hip with DDH and will also
put the total joint in.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.200
They take care of it
through the whole lifespan

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.600
and we don't even do that
in the United States.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.973
We stop, the same thing.

00:38:01.973 --> 00:38:05.090
We have adult and pediatric providers.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:09.590
And so, as you transition
through life, these are my last,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:10.980
I'm back to cartoon, so now I can

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.664
understand what's going on.

00:38:12.664 --> 00:38:13.770
(audience laughing)

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.894
So, you know, when you
bring your child home from

00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:19.920
the hospital you've got these
things they're worried about.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.290
You have all the agencies.

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:22.990
You have CC, and all
these, CCS, what does all

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.880
this stuff mean?

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.190
MediCal, all these things.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.410
You have all these, people
are talking about PDAs

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.900
and necrotizing enterocolitis
and all these words

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.525
you've never heard of.

00:38:33.525 --> 00:38:35.530
Your family's thrown into an upheaval.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.870
You have other children and
then you have financial,

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.040
you know, financial
problems on top of that.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.841
You have to buy a van, you
have to buy these things

00:38:42.841 --> 00:38:45.360
and then as they get older
you have to worry about

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.392
what they do for leisure.

00:38:46.392 --> 00:38:49.035
You have to do this IEP for, I mean,

00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:50.550
this is technology.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:54.652
So buying those iPads, no
one's paying for those.

00:38:54.652 --> 00:38:59.652
Getting the, your big van
to get people somewhere.

00:39:00.895 --> 00:39:04.482
Education, I had to do an
IAP every year for my son,

00:39:04.482 --> 00:39:07.060
or I mean I had to, I had to
threaten to sue the school

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.000
district every year 'til he
graduated from high school.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.110
I mean, I mean, seriously.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.680
I mean, I just bring in
the law and I drop it down.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.870
I go, I know how to read the law,

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.870
and I got to go, it's the same
principle, same everything.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.270
So think of parents that aren't

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.920
sophisticated how hard that is.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.470
And then, I'm not saying
I'm sophisticated,

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.810
but I know how to read the law, and then,

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.930
and then social interactions,
how do your kids

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.290
have to, how do you
get them to have be out

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.123
with their friends?

00:39:31.123 --> 00:39:33.483
I mean, that's, you
know, it's really hard.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.000
Then, you know, when I talked about jobs,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.070
everybody wants to have a job.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.040
Everybody wants to some self worth

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.040
and then we start talking about self care

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.840
and self advocacy and
I'm really proud my son

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.850
has really gotten into that.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.397
He advocates for himself all the time

00:39:47.397 --> 00:39:49.070
and we say you should do this, he said no,

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:49.988
and that's good.

00:39:49.988 --> 00:39:51.650
(audience laughing)

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:52.656
Where do you live?

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:55.931
Where do you live, and we
talked about that just now.

00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:58.780
Conservatorship, we've talked about it.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.460
That's come up several
times and this group

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.000
certainly understands it more than most.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.330
But then we get in it to
adults and we just talked

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:10.343
about the problems with
medical care for adults.

00:40:11.867 --> 00:40:14.170
We're all getting older,
parents are getting older.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.890
It's hard to take care of your kids

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.970
and especially as they, you
know, my son weighs 120 pounds

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.320
and I, my wife's a lot stronger than I am,

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.500
but she lifts him all the
time, but it's really hard,

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.630
and then I have a lot of
patients now who are retired.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.420
So they've had a job.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.059
They retired age 55.

00:40:31.059 --> 00:40:34.380
They worked in the postal
service for example.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.440
All their friends are gone.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.170
Their whole social thing is gone

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.710
and they're very depressed.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.299
It's a very tough time for these people

00:40:41.299 --> 00:40:43.766
and so the last slide and finally

00:40:43.766 --> 00:40:45.933
this is why you're all here.

00:40:45.933 --> 00:40:47.450
This is why I'm here.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.590
This is why we do these things
and we're all these people

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:54.170
here that are holding
up this giant triangle

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:57.050
of all the things that happen
for people with disabilities

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.850
and look at what's the
smallest part on this thing,

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.270
is medical up there.

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:03.960
This is the most important thing.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.790
All these other things are
the most important things.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.270
So thank you very much for inviting me

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.351
and we're gonna have a little--

00:41:09.351 --> 00:41:10.930
(audience applauding)

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:11.763
Thanks.
