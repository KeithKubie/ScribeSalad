&gt;&gt; Robert Casper:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.990
I'm Rob Casper, the
head of the Poetry

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.660
and Literature Center here
at the Library of Congress,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.560
and I want to welcome you
tonight for our panel discussion

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.890
on Poets on Criticism.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.910
Before we begin, let me
mention a bit about the Poetry

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.970
and Literature Center here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.140
We are the home of the U.S.
Poet Laureate and we put

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.260
on literary readings, lectures,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.440
and panels of all sorts
throughout the year.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.800
If you'd like to find out
more about events like this,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.360
you can add your name
to the email list

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.660
which is right outside
in the foyer.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:55.060
You can also check out our
website, www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.370
And now let me tell you
about tonight's event.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.120
And before I begin my formal
introduction to tonight's event,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.780
I would like to let you know
that I know it will go well

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.790
because we were all
together beforehand,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.260
and these three talked me
into breaking open the bottle

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.460
of [inaudible] wine which
has been sitting on my desk

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.790
for over five years [laughter].

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.590
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: Only a sip.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.220
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: A sip or two.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.590
The Library of Congress
is a proud partner

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.920
with the Bagley Wright
Lecture Series,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.740
and over the past four years
we've featured six contemporary

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.650
American poets in the series,
including Srikanth Reddy

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.320
who began his lectureship
by talking about

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.510
"The Unsignificant"
in September of 2015.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.070
Srikanth and Maureen also
participated in a pair

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.520
of events I moderated
about a decade ago called

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.550
"Critical Contexts Roundtable
on Contemporary American Poetry"

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.100
at Harvard University
Library's Woodberry Poetry Room.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.010
If the Critical Contexts
Roundtables

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.920
and the Bagley Wright Series
offered audiences an opportunity

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.870
to focus on contemporary
poetry and poetry criticism,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.690
tonight's event takes a broad,
though complementary, view.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.060
Together we will explore the
tradition of poets as critics,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.670
talk about the necessity of poet
critics in arguing for poetry

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.480
to both specialized
and general audiences,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.280
and discuss the challenges
poetry

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.790
and poetry criticism faces,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.920
and how poet critics may
best arrest those challenges.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.600
We will also leave time
at the end of the event

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.140
for you to ask questions.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.490
I should note thought that
this event is being videotaped

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.650
and by participating in the Q&amp;A
Session you give us permission

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.100
to feature you in the webcast.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.640
To begin, I have asked each
of our three participants

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.940
to please [inaudible]

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.100
and informally introduce a past
poet critic who inspired them.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.000
And I would like to begin
with Matthew Zapruder.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.670
You can read about Matthew as
well as Maureen and Srikanth

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.680
in your print program, and
they should be your chairs.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.750
All three are among our
finest poets and critics.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.010
Additionally, as the
Founding Director

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.130
of the Bagley Wright Lecture
Series Matthew has made,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.550
I would argue, an
essential contribution

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.090
to American letters.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.510
Please join me in welcoming him.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.060
[ Applause ]

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.360
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Hi, everybody.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.660
Thanks for coming.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.960
Can you hear me?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.560
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: So I'm
just going to talk briefly.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.860
First of all, thank
you, Rob and Anne.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.260
Thank you to the Library of
Congress on behalf of all of us

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.090
and also the Bagley Wright
Lecture Series which is named

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.370
after the publisher
of Wave Books,

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.850
where I'm also an
editor, is Charlie Wright.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.490
And his father was
named Bagley Wright

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.280
and he was an art
collector/philanthropist

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.580
from the Pacific Northwest.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.650
And after he passed away, this
series was named after him,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.710
and it's -- was to --
basically what came

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.940
about because I was
doing a separate project.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.900
I was writing a book
about reading poetry,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.220
how to read poetry and
why to read poetry.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.520
It's called <i>Why Poetry </i>.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.410
And in the process of doing
so I was a lot of criticism

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.080
about poetry, trying to sort of
get familiar with the literature

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.220
of what had happened before
-- as far back as I could go.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.220
And I noticed right away
that -- a couple of things.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.580
First of all, that a lot

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.140
of the most lasting written
contributions to the history

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.200
of poetry criticism were
actually written by poets,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.750
although there are
exceptions, of course.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.440
And the second thing
I noticed is that many

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.110
of them were originally
delivered as lectures

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.510
in front of general audiences.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.530
And this interested me greatly,
and I started to think about why

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.500
that might be when it was about
what happened when a poet stood

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.420
up in front of a group
of people and tried

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.680
to articulate something
about poetry in a setting,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.970
in a live setting, in front
of like actual human beings,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.070
as opposed to writing
something at one's desk.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.420
And, yeah.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.900
So I started thinking about
this, and eventually ended

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.140
up talking with the published
of Wave Books, Charlie Wright,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.070
about establishing this
lecture series to support poets

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.600
in doing, you know,
in creating new works

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.850
of lasting literary merit
that originated in lectures,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.270
speaking in front
of an audience.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.430
So that's what that Bagley
Wright Lecture Series is.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.730
And we can talk more about
that if you want, but.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.220
So Rob asked me to, each of
us, to talk a little bit about,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.060
you know, a poet critic
who we, who influenced us,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.360
who mattered to us, of whatever.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.410
And I have, of course,
a long list.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.460
But the first name that came
to mind, and I'm just going

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.020
to quickly mention three.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.010
Well, the first name that came
to mind was Wallace Stevens.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:09.540
His work in the <i>Necessary
Angel </i>, which is a collection

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.470
of is essays, all of those
are actually, I believe,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.840
originally lectures,
public lectures.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.080
And there's one in particular,
<i>The Noble Writer and the Sound</i>

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.940
<i>of Words </i>, in which he
talks about a concept called

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.130
"the pressure of the
real," which I think all

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.940
of us should be quite
familiar with, which is the --

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.390
and he wrote, he gave this
lecture right on the eve

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.650
of the United States entry
into World War II, and he talks

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.280
about how the pressure of the
real is so immense upon us,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.190
and that the only way that we
can push back against it is

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.140
through a kind of
violence of the imagination

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.440
which takes place in poetry.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.540
It's sort of an aggressive
pushing back

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.270
against this constant inflow
of news and information

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.080
and this overwhelming kind
of like thing that's coming

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.470
at us which, you know,
is laughable that --

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.420
you know, the proportion
that he had to deal

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.770
with versus what we
have to deal with.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.070
So anyway.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.370
So that's, so that,
that's one person.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.660
And just -- I'll quickly touch
on two others before I turn it

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.830
over to Maureen and Srikanth.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.720
Another's huge influence
was Lorca.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.560
His "Theory and Function of the
Duende" and also "Imagination

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.110
and Inspiration Evasion"
and other lectures,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.490
those were originally
public lectures

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.550
that he gave multiple
times, both in Spain

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.580
and in the United
States and elsewhere.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.580
And those lectures were
so important to me.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.000
The concept of the duendes
is such an important concept

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.920
for American poets and in fact
is the title of one of the books

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.070
of our current Poet
Laureate, Tracy K. Smith.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.540
And so that's -- he's a poet
and a lecturer and a critic

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.810
who I spent, who I
like think about a lot.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.690
And the third is actually
someone more recently

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.270
who I've gotten to know,
the work of Audre Lorde.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.820
Many of her critical statements
were also originally given

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.790
as lectures, and I would just
recommend one which is called

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.260
"Poetry is Not a Luxury," that
was delivered as a talk in front

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.930
of a feminist symposium.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.590
And it's just this
perfect short talk

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.020
about why poems are a necessity.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.960
It's from a particularly
feminist perspective

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.450
so it's kind of odd to
read it as like a dude.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.750
But it still --

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.050
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: No, it isn't.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.350
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: --
has -- well, it felt odd,

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.130
it felt odd to me to read it,
but it was -- but it's also --

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.100
it contains a lot
of deeper wisdom

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.400
for anyone about the culture.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.130
So, anyway, those are --
that's not one, but three.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.720
Sorry. But it's -- so I'll
turn it over to Maureen

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.200
and she can [inaudible].

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.870
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: I
would in a way echo some

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.530
of what Matthew has already
brought to the table.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.330
And also I want to thank Rob
and the Library of Congress

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.960
for hosting us, and also
Matthew for his imagination

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.160
which sounds right for the whole
Bagley Wright Lecture Series,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.700
and for this kind
of conversation.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.340
So it's a great honor
to be invited.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.190
And I'll probably
follow Matthew as well.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.600
It was hard to pick one.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.940
But just throwing out a few
names and works that came

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.550
to mind given Rob's prompt.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:17.120
And I spent a lot of time in
earlier periods of poetries

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.610
in English, particularly
the British Romantic Period,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.310
and poets in that moment
have meant a lot to me,

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.410
particular Percy, Shelley, and
Keats have mattered a lot to me.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.430
When I was starting to
read poetry seriously

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.380
and also had some
fabulous teachers --

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.120
all of them were critics,
or most of them were critics

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.140
as well -- they put in my
purview some amazing books

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.210
and anthologies, and I'm a
big believer in anthologies

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.450
as gateways to all
kinds of things.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.600
They certainly were
for me fascinating.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.800
You know, how does one even
begin to think about her?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.370
How do people even
talk about this stuff?

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.580
And some gateway
anthologies for me,

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.780
introduced by the recently
deceased poet and critic

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.950
and memoirist, William
Corbett, who was based

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.700
in Boston 30 years, and moved to
Brooklyn about five years ago.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.630
Wonderful poet and critic.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.410
And he had us read a landmark
1960 anthology called --

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.390
what was it called -- <i>The
New American Poetry </i>.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.590
And then it got retitled
<i>The Post-Moderns </i>.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.080
And it was a landmark
publication that included a lot

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.860
of the folks who are
now known in a kind

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.930
of experimental wing
in American poetry.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.330
Everybody from Ginsberg to
Frank O'Hara to Denise Lovertov,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.270
to all kinds of great people.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.470
And also anthologized were some

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:41.500
of the critical statements
including Charles Olson

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:47.660
who some people say invented the
term "Post-Modernism" by a poet

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.030
and not by what, a journalist
or a kind of Marxist theorist?

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.580
But they were just
really interesting

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.010
and also user-friendly to walk
into an anthology and have, say,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.470
500 to 1000 words by a poet
and what he or she was up to

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.700
and how he or she
thought about their work.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.730
So that in a way is a
kind of umbrella space

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.500
through which I encountered,
say, an essay I know matters

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.520
to Rob, Frank O'Hara's
"Personism," which is very funny

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.320
and very short and full of
little aphorisms including,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.620
you know, basically --

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.920
if you can call somebody
up on the phone,

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.220
call them up on the phone.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.520
Don't make them a
poem, you know.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.820
It's actually kind of love.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.360
I'm botching the
elegance of his language.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:38.780
But as I was reading around
over time I found myself more

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.170
and more interested in the way
poets thought about their art

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:47.990
in the context of social life
and democracy and the pressure

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.320
of the real and how does one
make a space for thinking

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.100
and feeling that isn't
always squashed in advanced?

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.640
And for me poetry is one space

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.650
that has held that
openness for me.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.590
And what I found more and
more was that those kinds

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.550
of questions pressed
themselves historically first,

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.190
I would argue, on poets
in the late 18th century

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.340
when the [inaudible] kind
of moment of the onslaught

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.470
of industrialization
and mechanization.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:25.330
So a poet who I think
really got this and wrote

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.030
about an interesting --
interestingly was Percy Shelley.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:33.370
And there's a movie come out
called <i>Peterloo </i>which is

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:39.330
about a massacre in 1819 in
England of government troops

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.230
against labor demonstrators.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.260
But in the trailer, should you
come across it, there are --

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.310
I don't know the
term for this --

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.120
the little words that
flash [inaudible] --

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.250
yeah [inaudible], thank you.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.260
They quote Shelley and
one of the quotes is

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.180
"Ye are many; they
are few," yeah.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.000
And so Shelley was
trying to think hard

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.390
about [inaudible] -- exactly.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.210
He was trying to think
hard about poetry,

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.640
creativity, and democracy.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.030
And so his essay, "The Spirit,"
not "The Spirit of the Age" --

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:13.810
"A Defence of Poetry"
is a wonderful essay,

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.730
itself part of a genealogy
going back to Philip Sidney.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.030
"Defence Isn't Poetry."

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.330
Matthew has just written --

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.630
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Right, right.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.930
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: -- one
might say a brilliant defence

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.230
of poetry --

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.530
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Right.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.830
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane:
-- in his book.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.840
And Shelley's essay, it's
very high-flying, you know?

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.970
It's very -- he doesn't
give you readings of poems.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:36.110
It's sort of -- it literally
begins with something like

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.820
"From the birth of the
world and the youth of man,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.990
human beings have danced
and sun and created."

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.380
I mean -- so he has this
anthropological notion

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.630
of what humans as a species do.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.350
And that we are a
created species.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.760
And that poetry is a
subset of our creativity.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.060
And how does one
think about changes

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.200
in poetry over millennia.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.020
But I think it's an
extremely beautiful essay

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.780
and it's an essay written
under the pressure of the real.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.740
It's quite an abstract essay.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.770
And that's -- as a
counter to that level

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:11.380
of abstraction I have always
like some of Ezra Pound's essays

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.870
which are -- for some
people, you know, like ach,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.750
Ezra Pound put them
in the trash bin.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.050
We can have that conversation.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.340
He had some really
wonderful earlier essays --

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.940
do's and don'ts of reading.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.880
An essay called "A
Retrospect" where he's talking

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.010
about the new poetry that should
be alive to the conditions

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.740
of modern life, not riddled
with abstractions, not composed,

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.170
as he said, "in the
secrets of a metronome,"

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.910
that it should have a more
musical phrase behind it.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.220
So I think he's funny
and he's savage

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.690
and he also gives
you actual meat.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.300
He gives you some actual poems.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.820
And he says, "This is terrible,"
"This is Good," right?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.660
So that's a different
way of thinking

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.680
about criticism, the evaluative.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.190
And Ed Pound is really willing
to evaluate and, you know,

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.340
what we would say now in a
Facebook, you know, Like/Unlike,

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.370
right, which I do think
is a massive degradation

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.480
of "Critical Horizons."

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.260
We could talk about that.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.820
And I would second
everybody Matthew mentioned

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:20.510
as people important and
formative, and I would maybe,

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.860
if I wanted to mix, too,
an interesting writer

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:29.910
like Anne Carson whose works
toggle between critical prose,

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.730
translation, quote
original work.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.490
She herself is a classicist
so she's bringing to bear,

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:41.470
you know, a long history
from 5th century BCE Athens

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.030
and what counted as poetry then,

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:47.530
including tragedy,
to our own moment.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.000
And so the idea that
criticism can live

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.570
in many different spaces --
on websites, in newspapers,

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:05.410
in surprising essays,
and in poetry as well.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.100
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: And well,
and glad as [inaudible]

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.010
that you mentioned
Anne Carson [laughter].

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.890
But first I --

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.310
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: We
didn't check in advance

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.610
or anything [laughter].

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.910
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Yeah.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.210
Too much fault with the wine.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.280
But thank you all for coming

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:25.080
to what's possibly the least
sexy title for a panel --

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.380
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: It's true.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.680
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy:
-- imaginable.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.700
But, it actually
a really, I think,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.140
deeply compelling question
facing us right now.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.810
And, you know, I thought
it was kind of interesting

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:43.170
that you guys didn't talk
about the kind of poet critics

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:47.950
who fall under the least sexiest
possible version of poet critics

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:54.460
which is the kind of
like/don't like arbiters

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:59.840
that I automatically think of
when I think of poet and critic.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.410
So, you know, I didn't
have a axe to grind

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.160
with Randall Jarrell, but that
would be an example of someone

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.280
who is kind position -- who
positioned themselves as a kind

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.160
of gatekeeper of
what was admitted

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.260
into verse culture
and what wasn't.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.170
And I think that that's
an activity that kind

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:25.860
of continues today for
better and for worse.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:36.260
I think there are reasons why
the poetry world kind of needs,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:41.510
or feels the need for
that kind of, you know,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.850
that kind of activity, right?

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:51.260
But Anne Carson came to mind as
I was thinking about this topic

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.110
as a contemporary writer because
in a way you wouldn't normally

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.560
think of her as a poet critic

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.980
because there's very little
published reviews or criticisms,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.250
a criticism that she does.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.460
But her poetry is
deeply involved

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.980
in a kind of critical activity.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.470
And in some ways, you could
kind of actually think of it as,

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.710
not criticism, but critique.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:20.700
I mean you can get --

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:27.340
glean moments of
criticism in her poetic work

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:33.380
where she does office
readings of other writers

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:38.990
like Emily Bronte or even
not just other writers,

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.710
but visual artists like Gordon
Moddicklark [assumed spelling]

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.280
or Francis Bacon or philosophers

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:52.330
where she examines [inaudible]
micro-script in his notebooks.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:57.730
And, of course, her
classical kind of knowledge.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:01.620
But there's also a way in which
I think she does something

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.340
that you could call
kind of poetic criticism

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.640
where she shows us

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.940
that criticism isn't
what we thought it was,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.800
or critical thought isn't
what we thought it was.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.500
And that seems to me like it
had the most valuable thing

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:22.540
that a poet can bring to kind
of the public sphere in a way,

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:27.130
aside from the production
of art, right?

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:33.230
But I also think that what
Carson and probably other poets

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:37.430
of the tradition can
show us is that kind

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.810
of poetry itself is a
deeply critical art.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.420
It's an art that kind of has a
critique kind of built into it

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.630
in a kind of imminent
kind of way.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.860
And I think that's probably why
we're so touchy about poetry

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.350
and why even in the
pedagogical context,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.880
when a student writes a
poem, a certain kind of poem,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.090
people can feel riled up by it,
offended by it, impinged upon

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:11.060
by it I think because every
act of writing a poem is a kind

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:16.930
of critical act that refers
back to the history of the art,

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.890
right, or the horizon
possibilities

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.020
of the art in the passing.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:27.650
So I think one way of thinking
about what the critic is --

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.410
one thing we're not
talking about so far,

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.680
and I think I'm glad that
we're not, is we not talking

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.000
about critic poets
which is a kind of,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.770
a kind of genre of
discourse now.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:47.980
But I think poet critics in
a way is almost a redundancy

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.170
in an interesting way because
I think every real poet is kind

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:56.650
of doing critique whenever
they put pen to paper.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:02.060
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: But I'd like
to just flip that assertion

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.580
around and say what

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.670
about cultural commentators
or journalists --

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.970
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Yeah.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.020
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: -- or scholars
who are writing criticism.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.360
What might critics who
are practicing poets

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.450
who identify first and
foremost or begin by identifying

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.370
as poets bring -- what might
they bring to the table

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.900
in their criticism that
you don't see happening

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.070
with other kinds of critics?

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.780
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: So
I don't find much value

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.830
in it actually, you know.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:39.500
I used to write reviews, and I
very occasionally do sometimes

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.630
when there's a book that I
admire and am thrilled by,

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:51.240
and I think that's really
useful activity like --

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.780
so you wrote a review of a
book by Anne Boyer a while back

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:01.550
that made me look up that book.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.740
And I love that book.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:08.320
And so that was a
valuable, you know, thing.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.090
But I didn't know
if you find this.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.190
But when I write reviews
I shut off a whole part

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.480
of my imagination and
I'm writing a kind of --

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.620
a product that is designed
to kind of popularize,

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.570
introduce kind of
work to an audience.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.790
But I don't feel like I'm
actually engaging in kind

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:36.330
of creative critique or,
you know, a kind of activity

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.580
that I feel really
deeply fulfilling.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.150
I mean, do you feel that way or?

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.060
I know you write a lot
of criticism and -- yeah.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.030
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: I mean
I guess I would feel --

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.550
I would say first, yes.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:53.570
And secondly I guess
the quote, you know,

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.330
"house of criticism"
has many mansions --

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.630
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:58.930
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: -- you know?

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.220
And I feel like for a lot
of people -- I don't know.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.740
I mean, you know, you're --

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.590
both of you are so engaged
with various publics.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:10.570
I feel like you would be like
living barometers of this.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.160
But I do feel --
my experience is

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.270
that there might be,
say, public streams.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:22.970
Maybe there is a minute on
public radio or, you know,

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.190
maybe there are some -- there
are all kinds of venues,

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.340
right, for popular poetry.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.850
But say you wanted to know
what are the young poets

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.150
in America doing these days?

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.920
How would you find out about it?

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.420
And that's -- and one this is
maybe go to the web, right?

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.720
All of that's changed.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.690
The media ecology has totally
changed and there's some,

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.540
you know, fascinating
things that are

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.440
on web-based critical organs.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.790
And I have written a lot of --

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:54.050
at a certain point I wrote more
reviews and partly it was --

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:58.020
I'm a friend to the
art of describing.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.140
I think actually there's a
ton of media for criticism

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.330
in the universe, and while
there's less and less criticism,

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.540
there's less and less space
to devoted -- I don't know --

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.470
for example, if one tracks, say,

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.040
the <i>New York Times </i>and
how they allocate space,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.110
one would have noticed a
real contraction and --

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.740
that they even still have
a book review is unusual.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.060
All these book reviews
have kind of collapsed.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.480
So where does criticism
happen in our culture?

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.780
And what is it for?

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.190
And when I was thinking about
this about 10 years ago,

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.610
when I think I first
met Srikanth --

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.980
actually, it was art
historians who were helpful

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.320
in getting me think about this.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.360
And this one guy -- I might
be butchering his name --

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.660
David Joselit.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.920
He said, "I think of there
being four kinds of criticism."

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.780
And I might not remember this.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.450
There's the exploratory,
the paradigm marking

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.740
like these are the kinds
of things, the mnemonic

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.530
to remember this
is a kind of thing.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.950
And I can't remember
what the third is,

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.610
which tells you something.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.240
And another art historian,
Rosalind Krauss,

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.870
said she always thought the
business of a critic was

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.250
to scan the horizon
for blips of the new.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.520
And that's, you know,
I'm always --

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.860
I don't feel like that's
my vocation in life.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.630
I'm really happy
that there are people

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:13.990
in the world who do it, however.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:17.860
I learn things from
critics who are willing

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.800
to do the work we
might associate

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.100
with journalism, right?

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.400
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Right.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.700
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: Like
here's a new poet --

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.600
or here's a new work
by a poet from Chile.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.940
And here's a new
work by, you know.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.760
And so I think that that's
actually extremely important

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.500
and that's been a bit
strangulated by a number

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:42.330
of factors in our life right
now, partly speed and pressure.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:46.090
And I think that that kind of --
inasmuch as a lot of, frankly,

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.200
a lot of journalistic criticism
I see is just an extension

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.640
of blurbing and I
think it's really weak.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.670
And so I feel like, for me,

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.810
a test of things is
can somebody actually,

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.830
accurately describe something
even if they hate it?

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.010
And this is what
I say to students.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.370
It's like Haslett
has this great thing

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:09.030
about how it's really
important to be a good hater.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.650
And so I'm super uninterested
in the like/unlike paradigm

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.510
as the end of a conversation.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.600
It might be a starter
conversation.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.070
There are tons of things I love.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.740
There are some things
I'm like eh.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.470
There are other things
I despise.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.050
But I feel if I'm right, if
I'm teaching, or if I'm writing

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.890
for other people, I feel
like part of my job is

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.310
to accurately describe it.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.870
And, of course, one
can describe things

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.170
in a bunch of different ways.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.490
One can say this
person is writing

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.790
about this kind of subject.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.360
They're writing in
this kind of key.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.340
The poets and writers who seem
to matter to her are these.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:44.100
And I think that's really
important pedagogical work.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.350
And it's also -- this is
how I have found things.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.120
I'm mean I'm so thrilled,
you know,

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.600
that actually somebody
read that review.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.900
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: They
read it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.200
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane:
But it is interesting.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.820
It was a case -- I actually
backed off writing reviews

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.230
because I felt I did not want
to be the village explainer.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.090
And I feel that's a temptation.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.140
It's like 1600 words
of stuff for people

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.860
who are not interested
in poetry.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.820
Yet I found myself
endlessly galvanized

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.450
by people who do this well.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.990
And whether it's about
chemistry, whether it's

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.680
about poetry, whether
it's about, you know,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.050
crisper in new gene
sequencing, it's like people

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.680
who are passionate and
good writers, you know,

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.500
one wants people to have
the space to do that.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:31.180
And so I'm always very admiring
if people take up that gauntlet

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.640
and -- but actually
describe something well.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.790
First I'm going to
let be a novice at it.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.750
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: But I don
want to follow up and ask,

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.860
do you think that
the poetry criticism

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.560
that you feel moves
beyond simple blurbing,

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.840
that seems engaging and
inspiring, exciting,

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.110
is it written more often
than not by other poets

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.590
than by critics or
cultural commentators

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.940
or people outside
of the poetry world?

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.470
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: I think
that's a Venn diagram you've

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.840
just drawn in the air.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.130
I mean, one thing I would say --

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:05.010
I agree that there is
something definitely

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:08.620
like the insider's
traction with things

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.640
that poet critics can bring
to the table and do and --

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.640
but, frankly, I was
trying to think of people

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.340
in younger generations who
are critics who are not poets.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.740
And I think that's
actually a big problem.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.920
I think there's a lot of
insidery, party [inaudible] --

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.430
I'm being obviously
completely nonpolitical.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.440
But, you know, I think
actually it would be good

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.300
if there were some more critics
who weren't tolerance, you know?

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.720
And I think it's -- and yet --

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:39.750
and there are for complicated
reasons in the U.K. There are.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.430
And that's an interesting thing.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:46.720
And it's party about how
things get segmented.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.230
And like -- I mean,
most people who are

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.880
in a certain track will
read a novel in the course

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.520
of three to five years.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.140
But I don't know if
you've encountered,

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.650
you know, poetry phobia, right?

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.950
It's a very common thing.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.380
It's a really common thing.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.680
Maybe some of you
are poetry-phobes.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.980
But you're here, you know.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:10.420
And I kind of feel, well,
how can one -- and this --

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.140
how can one -- and it's
a complicated question.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.970
How can one mediate
between those

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.690
who have made it their
vocation and those

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.990
who are passionate readers

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.130
and not only passionate
reader-writers?

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.810
So I would say yes.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.530
I think there's something very
special that poet critics bring

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.020
to the table, and it's very
striking that one can name --

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.620
you know, whether it's
someone like Randall Gerard.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.860
But I think it's
very telling that,

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.320
if you talk about quote
mainstream critics who are

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.220
over 80 -- Helen Vendler who
just retired from Harvard,

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.510
and Marjorie Perloff who
retired from Stanford?

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.810
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.110
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: And
they were not poets.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.410
And they were --

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:52.710
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Harold Blue.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.010
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: Harold Blue.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.310
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Yes.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.610
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: And it's very
interesting to think of that.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.160
There was a whole
tranche of people --

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.460
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Yeah.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.080
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: -- who
wrote on poetry and, you know,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.120
and one might agree or
disagree with their approaches

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.310
and whom they championed, but
there was a sense of describing,

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.970
at least in Perloff's
and Vendler's case --

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.090
they were interested in
fine-grained describing.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:15.150
So this is just more a
sociological observation than --

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:16.680
and it's just sort
of interesting.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.400
I sort of -- I'm always so
cheerful when I find somebody

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.880
who doesn't identify as a poet

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.700
and actually wants
to write something.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.000
It's like, oh, great.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.490
It's not just, you
know, everybody already

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.130
on the team, you know?

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.880
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Well, Matthew,
Maureen brought up the issue

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.260
of writing to a general
audience to kind of --

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.920
the village explainer.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.140
Maybe you could talk about
why poetry is [laughter] --

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.110
how you try to reach
a big old village.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.510
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
And the village idiot.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.100
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.990
Yeah. I wrote -- yeah,
well I mean, I'm just kind

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.610
of getting -- processing
a lot of what's been said.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.490
I mean, I don't, first
of all, really --

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.970
it's so funny that
this conversation kind

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:05.310
of veered off into, or became
about like sort of a more

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.900
like critics who write
about poetry, you know,

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.300
for -- which is interesting.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.660
I just even didn't think about.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.570
I just kind of have
given up on that.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.870
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: Yeah.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.170
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Like
I don't, I don't really --

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.470
to put much stock in that.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.210
I just don't -- I
don't know that --

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.510
I kind of think when it comes

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:26.260
to contemporary poetry you all
are more optimistic than I am,

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:31.480
that people can explain a book
or demonstrate a book in a venue

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.280
that would make people
want to read it.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.580
That's great.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.880
I hope that's true.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.420
But I sort of more think
that poets are better

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.810
at just reading their poems
and having people kind of --

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.110
I mean, I'm a big believer

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.540
that if you just let
me read poems somewhere

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.530
that that will -- that they'll
find their audience and that,

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.490
maybe that goes to what
you had said, Chico,

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.810
about being like
poems being kind

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.730
of their own criticism in a way.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:02.710
I'm so interested though in
what I guess what poets can say

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:06.170
when they try to talk about
poetry in a larger sense

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:09.060
or in a historical context
or try to position it

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.500
in relation to other activities.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.830
And the book that I
wrote was really designed

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.530
to address what you
mentioned as poetry-phobia.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:22.590
Like this kind of idea that
poems are somehow alien

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.270
to everyday experience or can't
be understood or aren't written

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.860
in regular language
or all this kind

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.850
of bullshit that's
like not true.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:31.130
And so I wanted to try
to just write a book

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.460
that took directly,
took on those issues.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.170
And in that sense, yeah,
it's criticism for sure.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.930
But it's sort of
more like a kind

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:43.320
of like autobiographical
polemic, I guess I would say.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.990
But not really, but not
really criticism in terms

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.590
of like trying to evaluate
what's good and what's bad.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.280
I never really found
that much use in that.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.610
I mean I'll just
say it for myself.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:58.010
Like early-on in my career as
a poet, I was writing reviews,

00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:59.310
which was interesting.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.260
And I wrote a bunch of reviews.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.300
I'm in small magazines
or in verse magazine.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.850
I wrote [inaudible] essays.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.150
And then I was asked
to write these reviews

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.710
for <i>Harvard Review </i>.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.530
And they sent me some books.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.130
And I hated them.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:15.480
And I wrote these negative
reviews, and that was it.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.130
I never wrote another review
after that because I just felt

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.070
like this is just not
the position I want to be

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.660
in in relation to
the art that I make.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.300
I don't feel like
being the person

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.660
who just scolds everybody
for doing a bad job.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.870
I do it privately all the time
[laughter], but I don't --

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.370
publicly it just felt bad.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.450
It felt like I was
killing my own works.

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.460
So I don't know.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.250
I haven't actually really
given that much thought

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.220
to what it would be
to write a review

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.060
in the <i>New York Times
Magazine </i>, you know,

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.560
or the <i>Book View </i>or whatever.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.690
I'm like I'd -- I guess I
just don't think about that.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.540
I think more in terms
of this kind of --

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.060
you know, you brought up
Shelley's "Defence of Poetry"

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.720
and it contains that
famous remark that

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.240
"Poets are the unacknowledged
legislators of the world."

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.600
But before that he has
this amazing description

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.390
where he says that
"Poets are the hierophants

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.220
of an unapprehended
future holding up" --

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.520
he describes poets as holding
up these giants mirrors

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.110
to futurity, and the shadows
of futurity, futurity,

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.140
are cast upon these mirrors.

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.110
That's what comes right before
that famous remark right

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.410
at the end of the essay.

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:21.490
And I've gotten more
out of that thought --

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:22.790
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: Definitely.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.090
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: --

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.390
that idea that poets sort
of are instinctively --

00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:28.270
are like mirrors of the future
in their poems, and that --

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:31.850
than I have out of any --
you know Marjorie Perloff

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.470
or Helen Vendler book.

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:36.690
Might not have read
many of them, you know.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:41.270
So I just -- that's where I
go when I want to get back

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.330
into touch with poetry other

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.980
than the poetry itself
[inaudible].

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.310
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: It's kind of
like the violence from within

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:51.630
versus the violence
from without.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:56.390
But it's -- we're in a situation
where it's like criticism

00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:58.970
from within or the
criticism from without,

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:04.010
though I'm talking about, you
know, poets writing criticism

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.950
versus civilians
writing criticism.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:14.580
And in a way I think that the
most exciting critical activity

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:20.560
happens from within that kind
of poetic position, right?

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:28.960
So when poets are imagining the
possibilities within poetry,

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.380
right, which quite
often happens just

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.360
within the poem itself, right?

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.760
So, actually, I think Stevens
actually does this [inaudible]

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:42.580
with every book, yeah, with
every poem in a way at his best.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:51.050
And when -- and I don't want
to like beat up say people

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:54.140
who don't write poetry should
not write criticism, right,

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.410
but that was one
funny incident was --

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:58.940
I was flying over
here where I --

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.240
you know, the only time I
read <i>The New Yorker </i>is

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.090
on the airplane, and
there was a review of --

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:09.720
or there was a piece about "The
Aeneid" and recent translations

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.280
of "The Aeneid" and
the reviewer,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.680
I think it was Daniel Mendelsohn
-- I'm not sure who it was --

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:23.570
wrote a very smart, thoughtful
piece about "The Aeneid" and put

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:25.760
out all kinds of interesting
things like, for example,

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.880
the 911 memorial has a quotation
from "The Aeneid" that actually

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.590
in some ways seems to be
sympathetic towards kind

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:36.310
of insurgent kind of the
subject position rather

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:41.140
than the empire's positionality.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:47.750
But it was utterly
unconvincing as a argument

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:51.040
for why anyone should read
"The Aeneid," you know.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.110
I read the piece and I felt
like, yeah, but, I don't want

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.560
to read that poem
again, you know?

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.200
It seemed like there was no
actual, critical activity

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.320
that talked about the ways that

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.660
"The Aeneid" [inaudible] a
failure of the imagination,

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.850
right, in the ways that "The
Aeneid" is a deeply imitative

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:17.920
and unoriginal and
kind of slavish

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.380
in all kinds of ways, right?

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.740
I mean, I'm sounding like very
anti-Virgil, but [laughter] --

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.330
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Double here.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.630
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.660
I see people walking
out [laughter].

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:37.500
But, you know, it felt like
a poetic response to me.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.930
It might actually
think about like, well,

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:44.720
how do you actually talk about
the fact that Virgil also read,

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.850
writes "The Shield of
Achilles," but it isn't better

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:51.200
than the original "Shield
of Achilles," you know,

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.830
or that you know, the narrative
is very much modelled on,

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.450
you know, the -- on Homer.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.140
I feel like a poet writing

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.730
about it would have actually
grappled with that, right?

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:07.110
And that's the kind of like
being on the inside of the art

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:11.920
that -- I think actually like
Vendler and Pearl Austin Bloom,

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.570
they have amazing taste.

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.580
And one thing I kept that amazes
me about them is that I feel

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.830
like I could always
write about Paul poets.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.220
I mean, I love the
poets who they love.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.230
So I guess there is a way
of getting inside the poems

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:33.150
without writing them, but it's
hard to imagine how that goes.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.070
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Let
me take a different tack

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.580
with the conversation.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.470
I'm wondering about what
it means to have the three

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:41.580
of you here talking about
the role of poet critics,

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.580
promoting poetry at the
Library of Congress,

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.820
the home of the U.S. Poet
Laureate, across the street

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.910
from the Capitol and the
Supreme Court as an institution

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.840
that represents something in
American life, represents a sort

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.160
of storehouse of
knowledge and creativity.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:00.430
How do you think poets now and
going forward can best ensure

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.660
that not only other poets

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:06.260
but a larger audience sees
the great value or poetry,

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:11.230
understands how it can
matter to their lives even

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.340
when those critics
might be talking

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.960
about something difficult or
somewhat off-putting, you know,

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.870
the kind of thing that we hear
about all the time when people,

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.970
[inaudible], the poetry
that you were talking about?

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.020
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: You
want to take that one?

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.360
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: I
mean, you know, I think --

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.490
I mean we have an example
of somebody addressing

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:36.510
that in the current
Poet Laureate, right?

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.670
Thinking about going
to rural communities,

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:40.970
if I'm understanding, some

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:47.770
of what Tracy K. Smith's
mandate as Poet Laureate is.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.060
And also reinstalling that --

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.350
what is it, the <i>NPR
Poetry Minute </i>?

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.720
So the sense of something being
part of the fabric of every day

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.460
that might come over
the airwaves and --

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.100
you know, it's like in Vermont,
there's the <i>Garden Report </i>,

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.060
and then there could also be
the <i>Poetry Minute </i>, right?

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:12.330
So those are some ways that seem
to me open and refresh our ears.

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:15.960
And it doesn't mean that,
you know, we might respond

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.190
or resonate with
everything we hear.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:23.210
I mean, on the question of
kind of the civic and the kind

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:30.030
of public things I was thinking
about, because you had --

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.990
there was a question of
the kind of Americanness

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.540
of this question or not.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.020
And I was thinking about
Whitman and I was thinking

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.740
about he has wonderful,
amazing [inaudible],

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.660
whether it's [inaudible] <i>Leaves</i>

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.820
<i>of Grass </i>or <i>Democratic
Vistas </i>which is a dark

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:50.720
and timely thing to read, and --
but there's an interesting thing

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.160
that seems sort of baked into
American literary culture,

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.640
arguably, that the criticism,

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.960
as it were came before
distinctively American poetry --

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.360
we could fight about
this all night.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.980
But if one thinks
that Emerson wrote,

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.460
I think it was actually <i>The
Poet </i>and published in 1844,

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.630
where he's calling for,
and he says, you know,

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:16.160
"our hog-rollers, our butchers,
our, as he said then, Negroes,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.540
our Indians, our Kentucky,
our Mississippi, they have

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.190
yet to find their poet.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:24.030
The vast plains of this
great country, our cities,

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.330
have yet to find their poet."

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:29.380
And there's sort of protest
against English norms

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.060
and English miles of
poetry and English meters

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.880
and English pastoral,
and English themes.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.010
And arguably, Whitman certainly
thought he answered that call.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.740
And he sent his book
to Emerson for a blurb,

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.510
and Emerson gave
him one, you know.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.850
"Well, I salute you at the
beginning of a great career.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.820
I greet you at the
beginning of a great career."

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.720
So I think there's something --

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:55.290
it's kind of an interesting
opportunity and a challenge,

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:58.400
maybe a burden, that
this sense of --

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.750
and certainly Whitman
took on that question

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.990
of a national poetry and a
national poet, and a poet --

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.900
the great poem of these states.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:11.470
What were the poems
adequate to these states?

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:16.000
Another person I was thinking
about in these matters,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.380
and it really, I think,
speaks to both Srikanth

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.600
and Matthew's point,
William Carlos Williams' book

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.020
in <i>The American Grain </i>is such
an interesting, deeply weird,

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.850
weird weird prose meditation
on the history of America

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.300
through figures like Eric the
Red, the Norwegian explorer,

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:37.150
and Abraham Lincoln figured as
an old granny, and, you know,

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.070
all of these sort of
American icon figures.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.730
And he's trying to
imagine a counter-America,

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.640
a counter-America that
is made out of Spanish

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.440
and French explorers, and
African Americans and Indians,

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.340
and is not all about puritans,

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.140
which was an important
intervention

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.470
to be making in the 1920s.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:59.310
And all this leads me to a
very living poet, John Keene,

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.830
kind of amazing poet and
writer and translator.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.210
Just won a MacArthur.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:05.350
And he has a book, an essay.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:07.680
It's called <i>Translating Poetry,</i>

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.370
<i>Translating Blackness </i>where
he's calling for a poetry

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:15.300
of the America's that
was more interlingual

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.960
so that we would have a much,

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:24.090
as well as activating the
diasporic black traditions

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:25.390
in the Americas.

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:29.650
And he's asking for more
translations of poets of color,

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.110
for centuries was
written in, say,

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.340
Portuguese, Spanish, French.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.540
So I just diverted completely
away from Rob's question.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.290
But I think this is not
a complete divergence

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:45.850
because I think part of the
question is, imagine communities

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:52.880
and the place poetry might
have in reminding us,

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.450
expanding our notions of that,
re-anchoring, making debatable.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:01.600
Part of me, I have to say,
also has a slight recoil

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:05.120
from this question because --
or the terms of this question

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.290
because I also think there
is a very important place

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:12.700
for the quiet, the private, the
unassimilable, the non-clubable,

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.910
the noncommunal, the
nonsocial, the pre-political,

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:19.770
the ontological, and so I
don't think it's an accident

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.540
that a lot of the genealogies
in U.S. poetry would say, well,

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.450
there's Dickenson and
there's Whitman, you know.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:28.550
And there's -- and in a way
it's too tidy, you know,

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.480
but it does tell us something

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.720
about their poetries,
the communities.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.050
There are also many languages

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:40.180
in this country and
that possibility.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:44.300
I felt so excited when people
have introduced me to things

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.370
or people who are
active translators

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:49.550
and who offer other
ways of reading

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:54.750
when I can discover
them, so [inaudible].

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.770
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Well, just
when you were mentioning Emerson

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:02.940
and Whitman, it would be -- so
I was kind of weirdly arguing

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.870
against anyone except
poets writing about poetry

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:09.510
which doesn't make any
sense because, actually,

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.810
I think [inaudible]
quick to hear

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:13.650
like philosophers
write about poetry.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:19.160
And that doesn't happen
that much now and, you know.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.460
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane:
In France it does.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.760
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy:
Heidegger or, you know,

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.540
we need maybe more conceptual
thinking about poetry

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.150
than we have right now.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:31.280
Whereas right now, I think much
of the poetry criticism is kind

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.770
of about popularizing or poetry
appreciation, which, you know,

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.590
is an important activity.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:39.960
But I think that there's a
dimension that's missing now.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.260
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Well,
I have a completely --

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.560
I mean, to be honest,
when you're sitting

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.250
up here listening, I mean,
I, as a writer of poetry --

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:49.990
I mean, I have a completely
contradictory set of opinions,

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.610
which is, on the one hand,
I totally resent the idea

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.010
that my work should
be intermediated

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.830
in any way by a critic.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:59.780
Like I don't care
about what critics have

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.080
to say about poetry.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.790
I've never read a
single review of my work

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.760
that I found illuminating
to me in any way.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.590
I don't learn anything
from them.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.620
I don't really [inaudible]
anymore.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:12.920
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy:
Have there been many?

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.220
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Hardly any [laughter],

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.520
which is the [inaudible].

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.300
But -- and I don't
-- I resent it.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.740
I resent the idea that
somebody should be in-between me

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.910
and human beings, you know?

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.070
On the other hand, I crave
somebody saying something

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:29.220
interesting and having
them -- you know, the --

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.320
not just about my work,
but about anybody's work

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:35.400
that would be of use to me or
like help me change as a writer

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.920
and learn something or whatever.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.000
And I don't really
see very much of that

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.570
around contemporary
culture right now.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.070
I don't know why that is.

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:46.580
I think part of it is just
because there aren't a lot

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.760
of venues, [inaudible] venues
in the support for critics.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.510
I think it's tough to make a --

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:53.300
if it were ever possible to
make a living as a critic,

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.180
it's pretty tough now,
and most people, you know,

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.190
need to be academics or
have some other kind of job.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:01.900
So just the -- but, you know,
often my students' papers

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.970
or writings about other poets
are super interesting to me,

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:07.770
actually, because like that's
the time that they just sort

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:09.870
of write from their own
perspective or whatever.

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:13.470
But, yeah, I mean I don't --
I -- but as like a, you know,

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.440
as a kind of practicer of the
art, practitioner of the art,

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:20.270
like I don't -- I want to
believe that I can make my work,

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:23.010
and directly, and it can
directly connect with people,

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.380
and it doesn't need
someone to explain it.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.100
That almost feels like that
would be kind of failure to me,

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.570
like if it needed to be
explained by some big brain,

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:34.760
by Marjorie Perloff [inaudible]
oh, that's why it's good.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.940
That feels like a little too --

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.350
that feels like maybe I would
have not done a good job

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:41.650
as a poet.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.040
But like on the other
hand, I don't want to sound

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.340
like I'm anti-intellectual
or like that I'm like think

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.760
that all approaches should
just be like, you know,

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.150
directly appendable
or something.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:53.080
I mean, so I don't, I don't,
I don't have to [inaudible].

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.260
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Maybe the
problem is the term explainer

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:02.390
as opposed to a helper, as you
said, or advocate, or champion,

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:04.000
that in a way the
role of the critic,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.570
especially a poet critic, is
to say, I understand this.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.510
I understand what it
means to write this.

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:13.430
I want you to understand it,
too, not just intellectually,

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:16.970
philosophically,
historically, but emotionally.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.270
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Can I --

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:19.570
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: Like you
just wrote a book on this --

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.870
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:22.170
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: I'm pretty --

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:23.470
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:24.770
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Yes, you're right.

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:26.070
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: I
don't think any of us --

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.370
I mean I completely agree.

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:28.670
There's only [laughter]
thinking about things

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:32.110
from a reader's perspective from
like, you know, in a way like,

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.450
oh, I would love to hear --

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:35.840
I was just asking before
we finally sat down,

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.350
like what people are
reading and what they like --

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:38.650
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:39.950
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: -- right?

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.250
And so that could be a kind
of higher order thing rather

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:45.440
than -- I completely agree
with you, Matthew, that this --

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.430
that burden that this is
a difficult thing that has

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:50.510
to have professional explainers
is just the worst, right?

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:54.650
But there is something
about, you know,

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:57.090
which your own book
demonstrates, which is,

00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:00.140
you know, what it is when
somebody who is just, you know,

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.440
passionate and incisive

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.990
and knowledgeable inside things
can share that with others.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:05.290
I think that's very different

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:09.540
from a gatekeeping
function or a, you know --

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.840
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Right.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.490
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: -- seal
of approval and now you have

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.700
to subscribe to this
interpretation of this poem --

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.000
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Right.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.300
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: -- to --
got to go to the cocktail party

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.600
and have something to say about.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.900
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.200
Well, Rob, you asked
like earlier, Plan B,

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.500
you asked like what is missing?

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.010
I think you have something
like, you know, what is missing

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:25.640
from critics who
don't write poetry?

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.940
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper:
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.240
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
But was that -- was --

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.540
and it's [inaudible]
love is what's missing.

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:33.370
I mean, oh, it's love poetry
and they write from a position

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:37.800
of love which can often curdle
into like total disgust.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.300
And I think what's one
thing that is missing

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.560
from contemporary American
criticism right now,

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.770
poetry criticism right now, is
that we live in an environment

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:50.920
where it's dangerous to
critique things, certain things.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.580
And I think that there's a
fundamental just giant yawning

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.120
absence in the writing
about poetry right now.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.090
I think that it would be
-- it's not, I don't think,

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.900
for instance I could -- okay,

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.360
I can pick somebody
whose work I happen

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.040
to personally love,
Terrance Hayes.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.500
He's a wonderful poet.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.470
His last -- most recent
book is fantastic.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.940
I think of -- I can't imagine
somebody writing a negative

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:15.740
review of that book,
being published

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.810
in a major American
publication right now.

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:20.770
I think it would be risky to the
person who wrote it, frankly,

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.210
because it would be
aesthetically, you know,

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:25.440
like consider -- they
would be considered like --

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.650
what's it called --
you know, reprobate

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:28.950
or conservative or something.

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:33.190
So I think it's hard to write
about art right now in general.

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:35.310
So I think that's also
something that's going on.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:37.040
So I think it's easier to be --

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.050
and you know, there's a lot can
be said from a positive point

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.210
of view and from a position
of love or whatever.

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.920
But that's -- I think that
poets are sort of -- can --

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.980
you know, I'm thinking about
we have this competition.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:50.200
There's a great piece,
[inaudible], I really recommend

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.570
for its sheer bitterness,
which is published

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.190
in 1960 by Robert Bly.

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:57.570
It's called "A Wrong
Turning in American Poetry."

00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:59.360
And it's just absolutely
vicious.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.790
I mean it goes through like
all the major American poets

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:04.740
[inaudible] dismantles
them in the most

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.270
like exciting way [laughter].

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:09.010
It's like I long for
an essay like that now.

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:10.310
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: Yeah.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:11.610
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: It would
be amazing to read somebody's --

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:12.910
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: William
Luggen doesn't do it for you?

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:14.210
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: No.

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:15.510
It's not really the same
because it's too limited.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:16.810
He's like -- he's so --

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:18.490
he's just like a bitch
about everything, you now?

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:19.820
It's like he's not -- he's not

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.120
like [inaudible],
you know [inaudible].

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.050
It doesn't come from this like
-- Bly writes from this like --

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:26.180
from deep love, you
know, like this.

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:28.640
He's so pissed because
like a pair

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.160
of [inaudible] let him down.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.460
That's different, you know.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.360
And I'd say, I just wish
somebody would write that.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.910
No. I mean I'm not dumb enough
to do it, but I'm [laughter].

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.350
Maybe somebody else
on the stage is.

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:39.650
But, anyway, he asked me.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:41.570
They're like love is the thing.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.980
And so like when I wrote
my book, like I was just --

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:47.920
it was out of love for
the art and it was --

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.340
I wasn't, you know,
I was like, yeah,

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.640
I'm going to try
to explain things.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.590
But secretly my agenda was
to -- you know, that's --

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:55.830
unexplain everything and
get to the end of the book

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:58.720
and have it be like about how
it is a fundamentally private

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.020
experience and there's a limit

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.180
to what can be said
about it, but yeah.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:06.440
I don't know where my point
was there, but [laughter].

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.510
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: I'm going to
see if you have questions --

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:11.070
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:12.370
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: He
has a lot of the questions.

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:14.510
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: I have a lot
of questions, but I feel like,

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:18.870
you know, I want you
to ask questions.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:23.410
So [inaudible] with the mic.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:27.870
Who would like to
ask a question?

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:29.170
Please.

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:31.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you for
your [inaudible].

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:37.060
I wondered what you
all thought about --

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.780
you had said that nation

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:44.240
and Stephanie Burke
writing an anthology

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:51.420
for having published a poem
[inaudible] and, you know,

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:54.270
there's been history
for [inaudible].

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:58.280
You use phrases that
[inaudible] you use the language

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.580
of his core [inaudible]
like women.

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.880
Isn't that okay?

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.420
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: I think
that might be a kind

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.730
of tangential question to
the role of public critics

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:15.720
because though Steven Burke
actually now [inaudible] served

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.850
on the panel that I had, the
group context panel I had

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:23.790
with Maureen McLane,
she was doing

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:25.830
that in her role as editor.

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.850
And it wasn't much
of a critical --

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:29.230
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: But that
is a kind of criticism though.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:30.530
I mean, you're trying to --

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:31.830
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: It is.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.130
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: --
bail us out of the question,

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:34.430
but we're going to
bail us back in.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:35.730
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: Yeah.

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
That's is a kind of crazy.

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:38.630
Anything is a kind of criticism
and -- but just to be fair,

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:43.680
the note of apology was actually
written by both Stephanie Bird

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.980
and [inaudible] who
are both the editors

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.480
at the <i>Nation Magazine </i>.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.300
And the poet's name
is Anders Carlson.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:52.550
We -- and he wrote a kind of
bad poem basically about --

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:54.600
from surfing the point of
view of a homeless person.

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.400
And the real problem with
the poem is it was kind

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.700
of a bad poem, actually.

00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.180
It wasn't -- it was
sort of a dumb poem.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:04.030
I mean the motivation
might also be problematic.

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:05.550
I can't really speak to that,

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:09.070
but I suppose I could imagine
some kind of platonic world,

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:11.140
somebody writing a good poem
from that point of view.

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:15.220
But it was sort of a stupid poem
that was not very well thought

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.110
through in my opinion,
having read the poem.

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:19.620
And it was just like -- I
think that was a lot of --

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:20.920
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Sure.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.220
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Had it been better,

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:23.520
maybe the conversation might
have been more interesting.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.160
But it was just not -- it
was shallow is my point.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.350
It was like it was -- it
didn't really actually sound

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:32.280
like a person in that
position talking, first of all.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.200
And second of all,
the point of making

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:37.380
that a poem altogether
seemed kind of --

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.300
like what was the
point of doing that?

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:43.180
Like why just sort of -- that
didn't even seem like a --

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.290
like I won't say appropriate,
because that makes sense, too.

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:46.590
Ethical, I just mentioned.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.010
But just useful thing
to do as a poem.

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:51.400
And so I didn't really get --
I thought they did a bad job

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.700
by picking that poem,

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.390
and I thought they should have
stuck behind their choice.

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:57.520
I thought they threw
the poem under the bus

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.820
and they shouldn't have done

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.120
that because once
you pick something,

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.420
you should stand behind it.

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.870
It's not right to throw a
young poet under the bus.

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:05.800
And I'm friends with
both those people,

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.110
but I didn't like what they did.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:09.660
And -- but I also
thought the poem was bad.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.690
So I thought the whole
thing was a mess.

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:12.990
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Sure.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:14.290
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane:
I mean, I think --

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:15.590
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
That's what I think.

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:16.890
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: -- I
think, you know, you know,

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:18.950
Matthew just very
economically laid out a lot

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:20.250
of my thought processes.

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:25.240
And I do think, too -- and,
again, this may be pivoting away

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.330
from the premises
of your question,

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:31.810
but I do think this was also
something about the temporality

00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:33.770
of reading and what those
kind of Twitter outcry.

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:37.620
And I think that
there's a sense --

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.060
I think that was an apology
written under enormous pressure.

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:45.440
And that is the situation
we are in now.

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:49.210
We're in a situation of
reactivity all the time.

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:54.120
And so the space to have
a conversation about --

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:58.730
and these things are
unavoidable and necessary,

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.700
whether you're talking
appropriation, ventriloquism,

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.280
varieties of American
vernacular English,

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.070
who speaks, who gets to speak.

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:07.680
I was quite taken aback,

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.580
and I thought it was
not helpful comment --

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.260
Roxanne Gaye, a write
whom I enormously admire,

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.830
you know [inaudible]
stay in your lane,

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.770
and I'm like, wow, you know?

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:17.070
So I didn't feel like --

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:20.300
you know, all of us are having
inner cops activated a lot,

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.880
and that's pretty depressing.

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.990
But it's also is
sort of where we are.

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:28.180
And so I can't help but feel --

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:31.090
it partly seemed to me like
this glorious horrible symptom

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:32.960
of a lot of things.

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.750

does one call it?

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:39.090

24-hour news cycle, but --

&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Spin cycle.

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:43.170
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: --
spin cycle was so intense.

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.970
One could understand why they
did write such an apology,

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.200
but I also thought it was
milquetoasty and weird.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.840
And I do feel -- I think very
much that editing and curating

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.200
and organizing lecture series
is a form of criticism.

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.750
That's -- and that's why
anthologies are so important,

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.470
and syllabi, and all that.

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:01.770
So --

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:03.070
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Jump in?

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:04.370
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Yeah, but I
think that the difference is

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:07.980
that the apology was not --
I think that as a critic,

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.870
you can write as
strong defense of a poem

00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:11.820
and then you can
change your mind, right?

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.860
As an editor, you
publish a poem --

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.160
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Right.

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.800
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: -- and then
to kind of retract it is to --

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.180
I think it goes against the
role one takes on as an editor

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.930
and pushing forward work
that you believe in.

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:25.410
So I understood why
they had to do it.

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:26.850
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Can I
just say one quick thing,

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:29.110
which is that it's depressing
that the amount of time

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:32.590
and energy that was devoted to
the discussion of this, at best,

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:37.290
mediocre poem, was compared
to all the other work

00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.220
that has been published
recently.

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.550
It was absurd.

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:42.760
And it was depressing as a poet
to watch this because it --

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.170
just people just cannot
stop talking about this

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:47.440
because they love to
watch poets misbehave.

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.830

do anything

about what you saw.

interesting topic of discussion,

it became, you know,

that creates in some instances.

had this sort of sidecar

00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:00.940
with them talking about how
they function and their uses,

hundred years come out.

00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:20.880

now we see the emergence

of what's called [inaudible].

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:25.160
And I guess my question
is twofold,

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:34.100
which is do you see social
media as a form of communication

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.460
that does exist outside
of the reach of criticism?

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:44.710

you handle something

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:18.010
And I sort of feel like --

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:20.600
I tend to think of not
poetry, but poetries.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.600
And I think that there
are lots of different ways

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:29.200
that people encounter poems
people write for platforms,

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.700
people write for
communities, people write

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.690

and genealogies.

be fellow poets.

Some of them might be
thinking with Homer.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:43.770
Some of them might be
thinking with James Skylar.

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:46.300
Some of them might
be the interface

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.820

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:49.210
Some of the -- and
I sort of feel

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:52.530
like I could have a sociological
response to that which is,

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:58.610
you know, mass culture creates
new niches for communication.

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:04.940
Okay. So I just sort of
feel like more power to you.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.830
And I also feel, you
know, the question --

01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:10.960
it's a very interesting
question, too, about,

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.500
as you said, like sidecars
going with older media forms

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.230
and that there's just
probably starting

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:20.260
to be a more robust kind of
sociological conversation

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.750
or [inaudible] aesthetic
conversation

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.750
about what is the
logic of Twitter?

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:25.600
Are people like tweeting
entire novels?

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.550
Or the question of
restricted form.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:31.310
Does the 140 character
tweet actually lend itself

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:33.770
to a possible striking form?

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:36.950
So I'm kind of -- I kind of --

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.950
this is a thing that I don't get
my knickers in a twist about.

01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:44.390
And partly -- this is a thing
where I find consolation in --

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:48.750
or, if not consolation, maybe
provisional balance in thinking

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:54.770
about broadside culture or
tradition, and Bali culture,

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:59.530
and population poets of the 19th
century who somebody like, say,

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:02.090
Emerson or Hawthorne, would have
to spend like, uhh, you know,

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:03.390
put them in the trash bin.

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:07.400
But there are many ways
to live in and with verse.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.290
And not all poetry is verse,
not all verse is poetry.

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:12.350
So I'm kind of pivoting
away from your question.

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:16.800
But I just -- I feel like
there's a kind of Venn diagram

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.230
of intersection and there's like
a slim intersection between some

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:22.530
of these things and
some other matters.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:27.780
I also encounter some very good
critical discussions sometimes

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:30.910

feel it like, it rots my brain.

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:32.310
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Yeah,
that was my question.

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:36.430
Is social media offering a new
kind of venue for criticism,

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:37.730
new ways to think
about criticism?

01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:41.430
Or does it just feel like it
likes/dislikes predominating?

on social media [laughter],

so I'm not very qualified
to answer.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:50.770
But maybe that qualifies me
to imagine its possibilities

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:55.370
in a more utopian or dystopian
kind of way as a non-user.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:03:00.070
And, you know, I can imagine
that one problem of -- no.

01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:02.810
You can imagine like Walt
Whitman saying Facebook is the

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:05.180
greatest poem on end, you know,

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:08.400
that there's all these
immense possibilities,

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.700
right, in the [inaudible].

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:15.340
You know, I can imagine that
the 140-character tweet is

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:21.740
as compelling formally as
the haiku form or, you know,

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.750
or has potentialities within
it that are as compelling

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.830
as any other formal constraint.

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:32.240
But I think that the thing
that I would wonder about, and,

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.190
again, I'm not qualified
to comment on it

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:36.290
because I just have too much
of an addictive personality

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:38.220
to ever go on social media,

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:43.830
is that I think popularity
can leave a metric of value.

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:45.130
And it seems that --

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:46.430
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
What [laughter]?

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:51.500

but are there like actual kinds

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:57.320
of communities and
opportunities or potentialities

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:03.880
within social media for more
kind of sophisticated ways

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.500
of thinking about what
literary value might be

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.900
within that formal practice.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.200
I don't know.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.500
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Yeah.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.800
First of all, tweets
are now 280 [laughter].

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.100
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: Yeah, right.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.640
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: That's
talking about odd thing about,

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.150
and I'm sure other people in
this room have noticed this,

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:24.760
but is that -- so tweets,
when they were 140 characters,

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.880
that's also the same
number of words, syllable --

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.530
that would be the exact word
in syllabic kind of a sonnet --

&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Uh-huh.

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.130
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: -- right?

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:35.700
So the 10 iambic pentameter
sonnet would be 10 beats,

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.000
14 [inaudible] and [inaudible],

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.850
that seems like a totally
irrelevant coincidence,

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:43.010
but I just thought
I'd point it out.

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:45.310
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: One
more question right here.

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:51.390
&gt;&gt; I just found that in
reading criticism by poets,

01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:58.070
that one of the exciting
things [inaudible] was not the

01:04:58.070 --> 01:05:01.370
descriptive value of
the role that they play,

01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:03.500
but the prospective role.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.510
I think [inaudible]
one by [inaudible]

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:10.580
but also [inaudible] Stevens
writing very [inaudible] the

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.140
[inaudible] about
like the poet of --

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.280
sorry, the poem of
Al [inaudible].

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.700
And then he starts talking
about well, what is the poem

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.170
of [inaudible], for instance.

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:25.520
And as someone who likes also to
write poetry, I find that type

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.860
of praise that I
read a criticism

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.830
by poets really inspiring
and useful.

01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:34.490
And I wonder if you
find it the same way.

01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:38.070
Are you inspired by
criticism of that sort?

01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:43.930
And do you see a role for this
sort of perspective criticism

01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:46.180
when a poet turns to prose

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.950
to describe the thing
they can't quite achieve

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:51.250
in their own heart [inaudible]?

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.130
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane: You question
reminds me of Matthew's,

01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:59.690
you know, very beautiful opening
up of Shelly's defensive poetry

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:03.300
which ends with this whole
question of poetry and futurity.

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.630
And that whole thing
about, what is it?

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:07.730
Poet to the higher offense
of an unapprehended --

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Mm-hmm.

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:10.330
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane:
-- inspiration.

01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:11.630
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
Inspiration.

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:12.930
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane:
And it's all about --

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:14.230
it's like what is
not yet apprehended?

01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:15.530
What is not yet legislated?

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:16.830
What might yet happen?

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:20.130
And that's also a key
in Emerson, you know?

01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:23.270
It's like the Poem of America
does not yet, you know?

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:24.700
And it's a call for.

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.230
And so people talk
about a kind of --

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:31.070
this is why a manifesto
[inaudible] very dogmatic

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:34.000
and they can feel like you're
being amputated, you know?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.180
But it is so wonderful when
one encounters something

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.350
that feels enabling
or inspiring.

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:43.500
And I definitely feel that,

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.740
in a certain key,
Shelley is like that.

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:50.220
Or if you read some of
Anne Carson's essays,

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.220
they open up doors or
open up some possibilities

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.330
that one might not
have thought of.

01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:59.560
And that might be the most
-- you have that sense that,

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.690
you know, you would expand
your own either thinking

01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:04.240
or writing or reading practice.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.440
I mean that seems to me the real
gift of these kinds of essays,

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.010
books, et cetera, when they
actually can resonate that way.

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:15.370
&gt;&gt; Srikanth Reddy: Yeah.

01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:17.390
I think that's a great question
to end on in a lot of ways.

01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:19.400
I think that kind of --

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:27.140
and prospective would be in some
ways like my ideal for what kind

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:33.080
of criticism would do, right,
rather then proscriptive.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.630
And I don't know that -- I mean,

01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:39.970
I think we can have
more of that.

01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:44.560
But that would require also --
that requires thinking outside

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:49.470
of the 250-word review or,
you know, the different kinds

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:51.860
of media outlets for criticism.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:56.250
And this is why things
like the lecture are a form

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:59.540
for thinking possibilities
for poetry.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:03.420
And I think that, you know,
that's what the poet critic

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.490
in some ways, you know,
would [inaudible].

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:07.210
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: I mean,

01:08:07.210 --> 01:08:09.110
when poets write
criticism they use words

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:14.020
like higher fats [laughter]
or luxury or nobility --

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.520
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane:
Negative capability.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.900
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: -- or
duende, negative capability

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:19.560
which was in a letter

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.770
that [inaudible]
wrote to his brothers.

01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:25.630
That's -- and they write those
words because they are poets

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:29.370
and they can't help but
ultimately be preoccupied

01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:31.960
with the texture and
possibilities of language

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.970
and probably words
that they're --

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:35.660
that they have an
instinct apply,

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:37.170
but they're not totally sure.

01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:41.080
And a lot of the criticism
about poets is kind of a --

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:44.560
often is a sort of exploration
of the use or association

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.190
of a certain word
with importance.

01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:52.170
And a kind of instinctive
choice that's then justified

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:54.280
in the course of the
essay or the lecture.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.250
And that's just not
how academics

01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:59.760
and generally write criticism.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.800
I mean, you know, it's --

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.280
they have a different way
of approaching the work.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.790
It's just -- and so
that's probably why I

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:09.330
like poetry written, but
criticism [inaudible] better

01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:13.510
because it operates in a kind
of way that poems operate, too.

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:17.000
It comes out of the love of, not
just the poetry like some kind

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.380
of weird abstract thing, but out
of a love of language and words.

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:23.990
And those are the most
memorable moments to me.

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:25.680
And I think they've had
a profound influence

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.860
on our thinking about
poetry, actually.

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:31.990
I mean this -- you brought up
Coleridge, but Wordsworth's,

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:34.870
you know, "Introduction
to the Lyrical Ballads"

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:39.940
in 1799 is the single most
important poetic statement

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.660
that was made for a long time.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:45.730
It's deeply influenced even
today our ideas about --

01:09:45.730 --> 01:09:49.310
and if you read that, you see
general ideas about poetry

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:50.610
and what people think.

01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:51.960
And it's -- these
are, these are --

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.140
this is meaningful work
in terms of the practice

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.730
and understanding
of poetry, so, yeah.

01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.240
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: On that
note you should go back

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.540
and read your Coleridge.

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:02.270
You should also consider books

01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:04.480
by all three of our
poet critics.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.550
They're very different
kinds of books engaging

01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.100
with the art critically.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.870
And I encourage you to
get all three of them.

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:13.640
Two other things I want to
tell you before I let you go.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.230
This is a busy, exciting
week here at the Library

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:17.550
of Congress for Literature.

01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:21.080
Tomorrow, Halloween, also
marks the 200th anniversary

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.240
of Mary Shelley's
<i>Frankenstein </i>.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.540
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Nice.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.020
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: We're going
to have an epic all-day reading

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:29.010
of the novel in the Main
Reading room, the perfect place

01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:30.850
to be spooked out by some sort

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:33.590
of hybrid humanoid
form [laughter].

01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:36.460
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: If you
haven't been already [laughter].

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.760
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: That
will be [inaudible]

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.630
on the Library's
social media account,

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:42.420
so you should definitely tune
in if you can't make it there.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.990
But we'd also love to
see you this Friday.

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:48.650
If you want to know
what's happening

01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:49.950
with your [inaudible] poetry,

01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:52.090
the Library of Congress
if your place to go.

01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:54.270
You should come to the Whittall
Pavilion across the street

01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:55.620
in the Jefferson
Building at noon

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.380
and you can find out about it.

01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:00.020
Of course you can sign
up on our sign-up sheet.

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.730
We'll send you information
about it.

01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:03.030
Thanks so much for
coming out tonight.

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:04.330
Get some books.

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:05.630
Get them signed.

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:06.930
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder:
And thanks a lot.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.230
&gt;&gt; Maureen McLane:
Thank you, Bob.

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Zapruder: Thank you.

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:15.030
[ Applause ]
