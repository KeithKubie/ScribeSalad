00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.409
Delighted to be here this evening and what I'd like to do is tell you almost a little history lesson

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.460
because it goes way back in my career in terms of where we got started with eyes

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.229
And then progresses through another sense noses and then as

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.830
my research evolved we got into

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.800
Measuring biology instead of instead of mimicking it. So here's the outline first, we're going to talk about

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.729
mimicking biology and we're going to talk about measuring biology and

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.988
with respect to mimicking I've collected a lot of

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.109
things with biology that really are features of biological systems

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.859
that if you're trying to mimic it these are some of the features that you'd like to mimic and

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.550
You know you can kind of read this and go through it but you know there's there's a lot of things in here or some

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.550
of these are big words but you know information-rich

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.629
Self-organizing noisy you know these are things that we tend to not think about when we design

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:06.610
Technologies

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.089
Because we want to take noise out of the system but the brain uses noise all the time

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.159
As sort of a set point the heart has intrinsic noise built into it

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.399
what I'd like to do is is focus really on two senses this evening eyes first and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.360
this is the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.089
Compound eye of a very small fly you can see what are called the pixelation and the compound eye of an insect

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.239
operates very differently from the eyes that we have we have

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.879
Refractive optics we have a lens these are more like CCD cameras more like CMOS cameras the the things that exist in your mobile phone

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.689
Because what they do is each of these little

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.149
Simple eyes in this compound eye picks up just a little

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:03.569
Part of the full image and then the brain reconstructs that in the insect so it's not as if it's seeing

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.569
Something as we? See it sees

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.449
Pixelated images and the technological analogs of this this is a scanning electron

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.899
Have a very high magnification image of the camera that's in your iPhone and each of these is a little

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.150
detector that picks up just part of the image but there's so many of these that when it projects back to us the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.500
resolution in our eyes is not good enough to see the pixelation and the image that has actually been captured this is a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.250
Magnified version of the LCD screen and a Samsung you know 4k high resolution

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.739
Television set and there's

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.350
blue green and red

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.100
pixels and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.779
One or two or three of these are on at a time to project a red green blue or

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.269
purple or yellow or white image on the screen but

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.269
when you look at that screen as

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.949
large as it is you can't really see

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.920
those

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.269
Individual pixels in that screen because your eye, does not have the resolution to resolve that but

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.869
When you magnify it you can you can see it and so that's that's

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.299
Similar to the compound eye of a fly and so what we started working with very

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.160
Early in my research career were optical fibers and this is the architecture of an optical fiber it's the same

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.860
Type of thing that is used to bring

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.959
cable into your house and transmit information and data over you know in high-speed and it's comprised of

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.359
really two critical elements here something called a core and

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.410
something that surrounds that that is a cladding and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.329
Most of these fibers are made out of just two slightly different

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.209
versions of glass one the core typically is a very pure glass

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.530
that's it's almost like quartz a very pure glass made of

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.479
Silica and then that cladding is made of a of a doped

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.599
Silica with a little bit of germanium in it that actually causes a very

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.499
Important feature of the optical fiber that I'll show you on the next slide

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.970
This other stuff

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.299
here the pink and the green region here that's just the protective coating the allows you to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.140
Handle these things because these fibers this the central core is about the diameter of a human hair

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.400
Could even be smaller than that and even though you can wrap these things around your finger if they get any

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.870
Imperfection they'll just break and so they they protect these things with a little bit of plastic

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.510
coating and so what I want to show you here is really the way that this works and and

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.179
Here you can see kind of a cross-section here

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.570
This is the core and this is the cladding and the only thing you really need to know about this optical fiber is

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.669
that at that

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.160
Interface between the core and the cladding that just that very microscopic layer there

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.859
You get something called total internal reflection

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:20.650
Meaning that that cladding acts as a mirror and so when you shine light into the fiber it bounces around and it can bounce around

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.179
You can have a spool of optical fiber that's a hundred miles long and the signal will go all the way through that

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.700
Because you lose very little light in an optical fiber and so you know some some

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.760
fibers need some wavelengths need to have

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.109
amplifiers in them to sort of you know boost the signal as they're going across the ocean but usually they can go for about

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.909
$100 typically without any kind of amplification

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.169
so

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.849
How do we make these things well this was a technology that

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.600
Was developed at Corning Glass back in the late?

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:06.489
1960s and what is done is to create what's called a preform and so these are cylinders of glass

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.830
they're typically

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.540
about the size of what you are actually seeing projected on the screen here so they're you know a few inches in diameter

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.830
there is a

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.510
cladding in there's a core in here and then that's surrounded, by another, glass that's that's a cladding and

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:35.979
What they do is they take what's called this big glass this big glass cylinder, that's called a preform and

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.250
put it into a

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.039
the top of

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.579
About a two to six storied drawing tower so this building

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.209
put it at the top and what you do is you begin to heat that fiber and

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.119
Glass begins to flow as it gets heated and it begins to drip

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.329
it melts and drips and it drips and

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.760
all the way down six stories onto this thing called a capstan that's just a

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:15.480
Rotating cylinder and what happens is that thing begins to spool that optical

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.599
Fiber is its melting and it cools all the way down those two to six story

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.570
time that it's dropping through and these things end up they can be drawn to a

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.589
Variety of diameters depending on how fast the cylinders

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.359
Rotating and how fast it's melting but the remarkable thing about this

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.790
Whole process is that if you start. Here with let's say a

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.270
two inch diameter

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.490
Core and a half inch diameter clad the

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:57.510
Ratio of the glass in that very thin fiber that's the diameter of a hair is

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:03.149
identical to the ratio of the glass in that initial preform

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:10.469
okay, it's a remarkable thing they both melt at the same rate they both get drawn at the same rate and you end up with

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.689
From a preform that you know probably has that much glass you can end up with

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:21.989
literally thousands of miles of this hair like optical fiber how do we get back to

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.850
eyes

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.050
well

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:33.990
Here is something called an optical imaging fiber and so this is a fiber that has been drawn it has a

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.659
core and a clad and

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:44.729
what they do is after that first draw they take them and they chop it up and they pack them and

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.510
then

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:54.150
Draw it again and then they chop that up and draw it. Again. Such that you end up with an array

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:56.730
optical fibers

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.730
that now

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.139
Look like this this is a large optical fiber array but here's an optical fiber

00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:09.618
Array, that's pressed against a piece of stationery and what you can see

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:15.019
Here is exactly that kind of pixelation that I was telling you about before

00:09:15.569 --> 00:09:18.109
With the eyes of an insect that is

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.559
Each of these optical fibers is carrying either a blue or a white image and

00:09:24.749 --> 00:09:27.799
as you lower the resolution you

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:33.979
Now no longer see that pixelation it now is able to carry an image I've got

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.469
two things I'm gonna pass around the room

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.719
Here's an imaging optical fiber this has

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.980
60,000

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.800
individual optical fibers in it and this is the

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:51.649
end of a preform of

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:54.558
one of these optical imaging fibers

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.290
So here that's

00:09:57.749 --> 00:10:05.359
That's the diameter that it started with and you can see as it melted it was drawn into that

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.730
thing right there

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:10.159
Okay, and what I'd like you to do?

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:13.009
is I'm gonna pass

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.740
my cart around but I

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.939
Don't know if this is gonna work but

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.860
As I pass my cart around

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.409
what you can do is you will

00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:35.089
hold it up to this hold it up to the card right in contact with it and

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:42.769
You'll be able to see a magnified version because we're going from the small small end to the big end see magnified version of my

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:50.328
name or pictures on this card and if you hold it up you know to the light you can actually see the structures of

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.439
The the individual fibers in here so don't drop it

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.639
We started with the eyes and?

00:10:59.249 --> 00:11:02.269
I'm going to show you how we can make a nose out of

00:11:02.819 --> 00:11:05.569
these eyes this is taken from

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.529
National Geographic

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:09.149
packing the early

00:11:09.149 --> 00:11:14.869
1980s there I haven't seen a better version of this if you think about 1980s this turns out to be a pretty expensive

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:20.929
experiment because they used LEDs and back in the 1980s LEDs were were

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.219
incredibly expensive but they had an LED on this dog and

00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:30.469
you know they had this this is not a real pheasant this is a

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.809
Well it may have once been a real pheasant but it's just a it's been

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:42.229
Spiked with a little bit of odor and you can see this dog come in you know it

00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:44.670
Probably can't see it

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.819
Except you know in this in this flash exposure but you can see you

00:11:50.249 --> 00:11:54.409
Can you can see the dog comes in and the dog doesn't do this

00:11:54.629 --> 00:12:02.479
the dog comes in and sort of goes in and out of the plume it's tracking right very complex behavior and

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:07.818
What is the dog doing during this time it's sampling the environment it's sort of comparing

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.139
one sniff to the next sniff to see if the odor is

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:20.688
Increasing, or decreasing so that it can begin to to figure out where where things are too kind of orient you to the mammalian

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:24.019
Olfactory system you know after our nostrils is this

00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:31.039
Very convoluted what's called epithelium sort of skin cells for lack of a better term that are

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.649
populated with these olfactory

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.179
Receptor neurons so these are just nerve cells that are

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:43.549
sampling the odor and they're sending signals back to

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:49.669
Little pea-sized structure called the olfactory bulb that is actually like a little

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:53.029
preprocessor it takes all those signals from all those

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.999
receptors in the in the neurons and

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.730
it then sends a

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.639
processed version of that to the olfactory center in the cortical regions of the brain

00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:07.410
and so here's the

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.649
Odorants that are coming in to the olfactory epithelium

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:16.670
and these receptors are positioned here and there's a very interesting feature here of

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.839
the mammalian system and that is that

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:27.259
You notice that there's red and green and blue receptors and they're all kind of spread out throughout

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.780
the region there they're pretty much identical

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.039
to one another we actually as as mammals we have

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.699
about a thousand of these receptor types for

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.470
mammalian systems

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.940
somewhere between

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.749
you know 2 and 10% depending on the

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.729
organism of the the genes are of the genes are actually

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:55.580
devoted to the olfactory system the thing that's important here is that

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.849
they converge and so all the red ones

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.859
converge and all the blue ones converge and all the purple ones converge and all the green ones

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.420
Converge in this cartoon and the reason that that's important is because

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.389
if you if you just had one receptor

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.380
Measuring these things you wouldn't get much of a signal

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.050
but when you begin to

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:23.059
to have a thousand receptors each of which is expressed

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:31.460
about tens of thousands hundreds of thousands in dogs millions of times then you get this signal to noise

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.920
amplification you get a

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.729
Square root of the number of receptors

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:45.499
improvement in the in the the signal to noise so if I had two receptors square root of two is one point four

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.790
two over one point four pretty bad signal if I have a

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:57.620
Million square root of million is a thousand a thousand to one ratio and signal to noise so you really get an improvement

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.790
making these receptors

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.980
converging on to the olfactory bulb and really amplifying the signal and

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:10.969
So here is some tracings that were done with the fruit fly this is a fairly simple odor?

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:18.500
Recognition system but here's the most important feature of the olfactory system and that is that you look at these

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.120
Six different odors here and what you notice is that

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:28.549
many of them respond to many different things so here this caproic acid and

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.100
Octa, known to very different

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:35.929
Compounds two different odors are being recognized by the same after here

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:42.108
but what's being processed is this pattern so it's this pattern of

00:15:42.989 --> 00:15:49.729
response that actually is what gives the signal to the brain and so here's a

00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:51.720
technical

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:58.040
Representation of this here's the odor it's presented to this array you get this response the response is

00:15:58.169 --> 00:16:03.199
Recognized as a pattern and then the key for us is that when you first smell

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:07.188
Coffee, when you're two years old you say Bobby what's that and she says?

00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:13.308
Oh, that's coffee and you remember that but here's a really interesting feature of the olfactory system

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.509
That is that those receptors that I showed you before

00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:20.599
Are all replaced every six months every

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.720
six months yet

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:26.809
we've all had this experience you go into

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:32.748
Somebody's home for the first time and you say gee that smells like my grandmother's house

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:35.988
alright you have that olfactory memory and

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.919
so

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:39.419
something is

00:16:39.419 --> 00:16:41.419
keeping the wiring

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:44.449
Constant and so this is a real challenge

00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:47.119
for those of us who try to

00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:49.139
mimic

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:50.999
these

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:53.358
kinds of systems in devices

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.829
because

00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:57.389
unlike

00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:59.389
most sensors that have to be calibrated

00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:06.229
every time if you had to train one of these kinds of things if you to train your nose every six months to

00:17:06.299 --> 00:17:11.209
Recognize every odor you encountered in your life you'd be in trouble why are we attracted to these

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.649
artificial nose as well

00:17:13.649 --> 00:17:19.129
Because when we use patterns we can reduce the number of sensors because we get

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.250
Combinations that are unique when

00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:25.638
You have ten sensors you can make lots of different

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:32.959
Combinations out of those ten sensors when they're which ones are on which ones are off and each one of those will give you some

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Some information and so what we we try to do instead of making a sensor for glucose and a sensor for cholesterol

00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:48.048
We take advantage of the principles of the olfactory system so that it recognizes everything it's anticipatory

00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:50.299
we don't have to worry about trying to

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:51.290
make

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:58.310
Something that is specific for everything because that would take thousands or tens of thousands of sensors if we wanted to measure

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.029
Everything what we do is we train the system to recognize

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:08.840
everything that we're really interested in it transfers the burden from trying to make lots of different sensors to the to the

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.669
Computational processing so how do we do this in our first iteration

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.020
What we did is we?

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:20.660
took a bunch of these optical fibers not the one you saw here but ones that are like the

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:28.370
communication fibers the ones that have a single core and a single clad and we coated them with different fluorescent polymers and

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.680
then we took advantage of

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.889
this ability to now present these odors in a pulsatile fashion so

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:43.460
Similar to a sniff we just work in a puff of a vapor on these this sensor array that has

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.190
19 different polymers on them and

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:53.690
We're gonna sniff it and we're gonna watch the the temporal response so what I'd like to show you now is a movie

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.170
this is a

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.460
nineteen

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.929
fiber sensor array being exposed to benzene

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:10.559
So there you go that's

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.990
Played again a couple times

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.800
It looks almost lifelike

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.890
What does this look like so we digitized these data and here's the response you just slide

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:31.739
For some reason did not come out when I imported it into my new computer so there's a yellow and a black

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.599
Line for every one of the traces but you can see you know this sensor goes up fast

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.849
This sensor goes down and we're using these temporal responses and we?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Train a computer then we say

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.399
This is the response of these 19 sensors to benzene then, we?

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.950
expose it to a bunch of different things

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.710
And here's what we get this is the true identity of these 20 different

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.400
Compounds vapors that we exposed it to and this is what the computer tells us

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.059
It thinks these things are so

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.819
acetone very simple organic molecule

00:20:15.309 --> 00:20:22.649
the computer gets it right 24 out of 24 times and these were presented in random order by the way they weren't just 24

00:20:22.929 --> 00:20:27.539
Presentations of this and 24 presentations of that anything on the diagonal is correct

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.940
but anything off diagonal means it

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:35.040
Made a mistake so let's look at this here's a this this doesn't look right here this is number 10

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.950
We know number 10 is this I

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.770
guess cologne and

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.920
it mistakenly thought it was number 3

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.699
Well number 3 is a perfume

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.630
so

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.959
it it's making mistakes that are

00:20:52.929 --> 00:20:56.099
Similar to what the kind of mistakes that we would make you know if you're?

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.950
presented with a

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.000
Cabernet and

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.900
you know maybe you can't tell the difference between Napa and Bordeaux the goal of this was actually to

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:11.609
build these things to sniff explosives for buried landmines

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:17.339
So here this is a very low concentration of a nitro aromatic compound like TNT

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:22.590
That's put into water you to sort of train dogs so number 19 is

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.910
correctly identified 20 out of 24 times but four times out of 24

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.459
Its mistaken is number 11. Which is water so it actually can smell water

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.729
Because machines can do that people can't we've kind of

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.339
Recapitulated the the mammalian system but I told you that there is a problem the problem is that

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:50.250
if we made this sensor array and we trained it it's like replacing your

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:55.049
Receptors every six months if you had to retrain your brain you'd have a problem

00:21:55.049 --> 00:22:00.689
you wouldn't recognize anything that you previously had smelled how do we get around that well

00:22:01.809 --> 00:22:06.209
We'd like to be able to do this we'd like to Train one sensor

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.870
Develop a computational

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.799
Recognition system and then have that transfer to any other sensor

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:14.919
we make after that

00:22:14.919 --> 00:22:20.429
So that they can be used for a long time and so this is where we get to these optical imaging fibers

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.950
We discovered that we could

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.020
selectively etch

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.329
the cores of the fiber relative to the cloud material I told you that they were

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.969
Slightly different kinds of glass ones a slightly softer glass is able to be etched with

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.419
Something called hydrofluoric acid it's what they use to make

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.559
Frosted glass and so what we created here are these little

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:51.509
wells at the end of the fiber but here's their still a core here at the bottom of the well that is able to to

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.980
Shine light into that well well we filled these, things with little

00:22:56.559 --> 00:23:03.749
Plastic beads that had fluorescent dyes attached to them one of these beads is sized

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.410
perfectly

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.150
to be able to

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:14.309
Fit into a well and one bead and one bead only and it sort of snuggles in there and it's stuck in there

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.189
And so what we did is we?

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.790
Made a bunch of these little

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:27.299
Beads these are really tiny they're three microns in diameter that's smaller than a cell

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:28.230
Okay

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:33.240
smaller than a human cell in one gram of these so kind of a thumb

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:40.650
There's about 10 billion of these beads we mix them all together and then we displayed them randomly

00:23:40.929 --> 00:23:42.460
into the

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.799
60,000 Wells on that little piece of glass that is coming around so there's

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.370
60,000 of these beads there's about 10

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.670
Different bead types so there's

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.460
6,000 beads of each type

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.790
that's the amplification we need

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.490
we just figure out where the beads are by

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:08.699
Exposing them to a vapor and the green beads respond this way the blue beads this way red beads this way and the computer can

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:16.380
recognize those unique responses and then map the array and every array is mapped differently but they it contains the same

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:23.459
Bead types in there here's the bead types you can see the chemistry there this is 40 beads so they're highly reproducible

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.100
But you know you can sort of see

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.760
when you pulse

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:35.760
This compound D MMP on here you can see the beads changing and then they return to baseline a few seconds later here are

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:37.919
very low concentrations

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.020
parts-per-billion of some compounds kind of in the range that dogs can smell explosives

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:49.380
any one of these signals is really noisy you can kind of see it right here but if you take a

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.910
Thousand of them and you sum them up this is what I was getting at before the noise

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.669
Kind of averages out and the signal builds up and you begin to see a very

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:04.620
robust strong signal and so you you have the ability now to

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.040
begin to smell things very sensitively and

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.390
because you have

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.540
10 billion beads in a gram you

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.250
can make billions of sensors out of these and so we did that and

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:25.020
These are with three different sensors over a period of months and you can see, we we were almost perfect

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.229
with our ability to train a

00:25:29.169 --> 00:25:36.299
Computational classifier and then completely replace that with another artificial nose so I want you to see there's

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.209
seventeen thousand seven hundred

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.250
exposures of which only four hundred contained anything

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.640
most of them were just blanks just air

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.769
Because we wanted to see if the system picked up anything by mistake that

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.810
Wasn't really there and it never did you know these are the sensor responses to different coffees

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:04.709
different cheeses you can see with your own eyes that they're different responses right they're smelling things differently and we can train a

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.670
Computer to recognize these and use them so when we're talking about

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.490
mimicking

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.090
Biology

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:18.690
we decided to see why do dogs have these big long noses and

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.589
So we took a cat scan of a dog's nose this

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:28.680
Was done at Tufts vet school and you can see this is the cross-section this is the olfactory epithelium

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.260
Remember I told you it's highly convoluted

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:37.259
You can really see how much surface area there is in a dog's nose and this is another

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.790
Cross-section a little bit further back toward the the eyes there's

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.349
lots and lots of olfactory cells here that are really

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:54.569
Amplifying the signal laser prototype this dog's nose, we made all those convolutions made a plastic mold

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:58.860
We cut it in half after we're done with this experiment we actually stuck our sensors

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:06.839
Into different regions of the nose same sensors same same chemistry what you can see is

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.129
This is a single sensor put in different regions of the dog's nose

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:18.359
The same sensor in different parts of the dog nose actually see different things because the odors are actually

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.139
separating they're partitioning so complex odors are

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:30.089
Presenting different things to different places in the dog's nose even though they're the same sensor you know this is kind of a fun experiment

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:38.280
ROMs perfumes vodkas and in every case we got an improvement in our ability to

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:46.589
Classify these things by just putting the sensors in different parts of the dog's nose these are hard things it's alcohol and water essentially

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:51.480
we got an improvement in in performance diverse sensor types allow you to be

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.900
Anticipatory we have replicates that improve their sensitivity and then we have the ability to make these things

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.479
Reproducible that allows you to maintain trained

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:06.569
over a long period of time so we talked about mimicking biology let me spend a few minutes talking about measuring

00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:11.609
Biology I know there's some non scientists in the audience this is what's called the central dogma

00:28:12.039 --> 00:28:15.148
the DNA gets converted into RNA

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:23.580
Many, copies of RNA and then RNA gets translated into protein and these are the micro Wells on the end of this fiber

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.220
And we first came up with these H well

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:33.899
Technologies this was what was referred to as micro, well arrays back, when we did this in the late nineteen

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:41.250
1990s and I've gone back and sort of done calculations but this particular fiber has a

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.309
Thousand times as many wells as

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.839
That piece of plastic in terms of the volume that one of these

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.429
Wells can hold relative to the volume one of these can hold it's five billion times

00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:54.519
smaller

00:28:54.519 --> 00:29:00.959
I always tell people now if you have that many zeros in front over or after something pay attention to it you know I already

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.949
Showed you that we can functionalize these beads with polymers that give you

00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:09.089
Measurements that replicate the olfactory system then we started catching

00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:14.279
single strands of DNA to these beads to be able to measure

00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:22.619
The presence or absence of a complementary sequence of DNA that, was present in a solution so you know DNA or RNA?

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.970
DNA is double

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:31.049
double-stranded it's a double helix you can unwind that and then you can measure whether that the

00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:33.299
Complementary strand is present by

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.120
probing it with a

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:44.189
Complementary strand that's attached to your surface here or you can bind RNA and measure that and so when we began to do this

00:29:44.379 --> 00:29:47.189
With these beads it turned out to be a pretty

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.470
Transformative thing and the reason it was transformative is that you have these little micro wells we have these little

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:59.250
Beads we just put a droplet of these beads on top of this micro well array and the beads go in the wells

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.829
we don't have to do any sort of complex

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.210
assembly it's just a

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:11.460
Self-assembly process and so we publish this paper you know this is exactly that fiber that I passed around it's

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:18.659
13,000 Wells it's a very small part of that so there's four of these areas that you could actually

00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:25.829
interrogate and at the time that we publish this this was the smallest size of one of these

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:33.419
DNA arrays that could be made and so now we came up with a way of being able to measure essentially a

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:39.419
Thousand things in the same area that you previously could only measure

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:45.030
one and so this really transformed the whole field of genetic

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:45.750
analysis

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.909
we founded a company many of you

00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:53.099
Who are in science recognize the name of this kind is called Lumina this is the first product it was

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:58.320
96 of those fibers that I passed around the room positioned in

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.840
perfectly to fit into those little

00:31:01.179 --> 00:31:07.649
96-well plastic plates that I showed you a couple slides ago and then over time they started making them

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:13.530
Fetching them in silicon and you know now one of these slides can you know has

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.079
literally hundreds of billions of beads and can measure 20 million letter

00:31:19.659 --> 00:31:21.460
differences in

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:27.360
DNA between two samples and at the time that we you know first came out with this technology

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:32.250
people were charging $1 per letter of DNA and today

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.230
It's less than a ten thousandth of a cent and so what is that enabled that's

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.140
enabled

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:44.009
Things that you're very familiar with so this is the technology that's behind 23andme I would call it

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:51.809
recreational genomics but they did get approval for a consumer colon test it's also the technology that's used to measure the

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:57.209
genetic diversity and populations they use these things all the time for breeding

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:02.699
Cattle for breeding corn there's all sorts of things that these things are used for and the companies

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:08.340
become incredibly successful with lots of people so the last thing I'm going to talk about is proteins they're the the

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.120
catalysts

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.360
Or enzymes that are

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:15.990
Catalysts that make all the reactions happen in our body but the problem has

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.990
Been that there's a technology

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:25.979
This has been around about 50 years called iliza it's the way that the clinical tests for proteins are measured it's called an immunoassay

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:33.830
And it's able to measure things in this concentration range so this is millimolar topeka

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.710
Molar and it's known that in the bloodstream there's

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.120
325 proteins that are in that concentration range

00:32:42.179 --> 00:32:45.079
But after the human genome was sequenced

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.980
It was determined that of those?

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:51.539
20,000

00:32:51.539 --> 00:32:57.559
243 genes that code for the proteins in our bodies about fifth of those about

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.720
4000 of those should be present in the blood it's just that we don't have a way to measure them so

00:33:03.179 --> 00:33:08.898
Imagine what we could do if we could measure all those proteins and so we developed something called Samoa

00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:15.979
So just representing all the proteins that we couldn't measure back you know 10 years ago and so we developed this

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.439
Technology this is what eliza

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.679
does it measures the intensity of a color

00:33:22.049 --> 00:33:27.319
Proportional to the concentration of a protein and this is what we do we have come up with a way to

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:35.329
literally digitize the signals of individual molecules so these are signals that are coming from the binding of

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.909
Individual protein molecules and it's an

00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:40.879
Absolute measurement you know here if I ask you what's the concentration

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:46.939
Here you'd have to have something to compare it to right you'd have to hold it up to two little cards and say

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.970
Oh, yeah I think it's somewhere between these two colors here

00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:53.839
Is absolute there's four molecules right there

00:33:54.179 --> 00:34:01.489
You don't have to calibrate and so we published this eight years ago so the first thing we attempted was to measure

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:05.689
Something called PSA there's a few men with gray hair in the room here

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:12.470
You know PSA this is prostate specific antigen it's been discredited for screening for prostate cancer because men have very

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:18.229
different baseline levels of this and it turned out that this single molecule

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:22.220
Approach the Samoa approach is able to detect

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:26.149
PSA at levels that are about three thousand times

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.300
lower in concentration than the

00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:34.969
Standard Eliza that I showed you this was also have been commercialized by a company that's based in Lexington

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:40.520
the arrays actually DVDs they're made by Sony on the same line that they

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.519
Used to make DVDs how many of you have bought a DVD lately

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.660
So that's why Sony's making these things now I

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:55.610
Know this is art and science so my friend Felice Frankel took a beautiful image of these so here's these microwell arrays that are

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.310
literally embossed on the surface of these

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:05.089
DVDs they're three micron wells there's two hundred and sixteen thousand of them there here's why we wanted to measure

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:12.799
PSA because men who've had prostate surgery they have their prostate removed and this molecule this protein that gets produced by the prostate gland

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.820
that disappears

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.820
but if there was

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:23.509
residual tumor that was left in when they the surgeon took the tumor out or if there was

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:30.140
metastasis prior to the surgery then that cancer begins to grow back and over time

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:34.580
It grows back above the range that now it can be measured

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:39.530
Because the tumor is larger there's more. PSA that's being produced by these

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.310
prostate

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:43.310
cancer cells and

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:49.940
every six months the patient goes in and gets a blood test and

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.830
most of the time they say

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:56.630
Oh, we can't detect it we can't detect it we? Can't detect and then they go come back and somebody says

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:57.240
oh

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.240
I've bad news for you you have a recurrence of your prostate cancer

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:03.050
well

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:08.690
we didn't think that was the best way to approach things first we took 20 men who were

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.470
Unmeasurable these were men who had their prostate removed

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.900
Through surgery and they were unmeasurable using the conventional test

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:23.900
Here's the limit of detection of the conventional test we could measure every one of them and here's our limit of detection

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.750
This is a log scale so we've got a long way to go but look at there's huge variation

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:34.370
Here, I'm not saying that this person's gonna recur or this person is not going to recur

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.809
It's just isn't it better to know the number and to be able to say

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:46.220
It's increasing over time we probably think you've got residual cancer and therefore we're gonna treat you before it gets

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:54.829
Super bad well this was a retrospective study and what this shows is that we could predict with a single blood test

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.220
Between three and six months after surgery with a hundred percent

00:36:58.859 --> 00:37:05.779
Confidence that these men would not have recurrence of prostate cancer so these is a retrospective study they'd

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.139
Collected samples over a long period of time just went out to five years we could tell somebody a man

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.099
Between three and six months after their surgery you don't have to worry about it

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:24.139
but if you have levels below this you better worry because only thirty five percent of those men were

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.729
Cancer-free after five years if their level between three and six months, was above that

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.719
Concentration level so we decided to do something for women

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:39.199
because we think we have the ability to measure a tumor that is one millimeter in diameter

00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:44.269
five millimeters this is the best you can do with imaging

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:50.749
this is mammography the best mammography picks up tumor this big this is what

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:51.710
We?

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:58.699
Think we can do by measuring blood borne biomarkers and the difference in volume is a hundred and twenty five times

00:37:59.069 --> 00:38:04.519
so the idea is if you can detect these things early you have the ability to

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.619
Maybe watch and wait and see if something develops over time

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.450
Or if it just stays the same you don't have to treat so we're not advocating

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:20.180
over treatment and over diagnosis we just like to know and so this these are the statistics

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:26.449
pretty pretty bleak a quarter of a million new cases of invasive breast cancer every year and

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:34.790
smaller number of non invasive breast cancers one eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and forty thousand deaths it is

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:40.609
Absolutely true for breast cancer as well as for other cancers that the earlier you detect

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:43.369
the better the outcome

00:38:44.609 --> 00:38:48.588
Pretty much 100% survival if you detect it early so

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.240
We ran some samples these are some preliminary results with

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.899
66 newly diagnosed women with breast cancer

00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:05.449
Prior to their therapy we took a blood sample consented them and then we trained a system to recognize

00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:08.179
eight proteins that we had identified

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:15.679
We thought might be useful for early detection of breast cancer this is all healthy patients

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:20.779
Versus breast cancer patients so all breast cancer all stages and we get?

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:24.679
accuracy of 96% mammography by the way is 82%

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.380
okay, a lot of false positives

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:30.470
some false negatives

00:39:30.569 --> 00:39:32.839
When we only look at. Early stage breast cancer

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:37.190
The accuracy goes up a little bit so we think we have a blood test

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:44.389
That can do early detection of blood cancer by measuring proteins that have never been measured before so these are just eight

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:52.219
We're now up to 30 you know we've got about 400 samples now that we're gonna start running through and begin to to consent

00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:54.589
whirlwind tour of the

00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:56.599
optical system of insects

00:39:57.359 --> 00:40:03.769
Mammalian noses measuring genes and measuring proteins and of course you know I could not have done this

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:11.149
Myself requires a large number of people and this is just current group members and maybe a few former ones that I think were particularly

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:17.720
Important for putting in here as either collaborators or former students who had contributed to some of the things that I talked about today

00:40:18.089 --> 00:40:20.689
so happy to answer any questions

00:40:21.299 --> 00:40:23.419
delighted to be here and thanks
