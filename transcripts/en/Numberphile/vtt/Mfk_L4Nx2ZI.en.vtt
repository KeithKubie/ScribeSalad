00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.190
JAMES GRIME: Today, we're going
to talk about one of the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.560
questions that we get sent in a
lot at Numberphile, and the

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560
question is-- well, Brady,
what's the question?

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.540
BRADY HARAN: The question is,
why does 0 factorial equal 1?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.880
JAMES GRIME: Right.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.210
Why does 0 factorial equal 1?

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.900
So let's start off with a
quick recap of what a

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.950
factorial is.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.652
For our whole number, let's
pick a number n--

00:00:23.652 --> 00:00:26.300
n factorial, which is written
like that. n with an

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.120
exclamation mark.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.670
This is equal to.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.340
You multiply all the
whole numbers less

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.330
than or equal to n.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.210
It's n multiplied by n minus
1 multiplied by n minus 2

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.370
multiplied by--

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.780
and you keep going down,
and you'll go down to 3

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.970
times 2 times 1.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.970
Quick example.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.230
Let's do 5 factorial.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.660
5 times 4 times 3
times 2 times 1.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.370
And you do that.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.890
It's 120.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.450
OK.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.050
The question we've been asked
is what is 0 factorial.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.660
So the way you can answer this--
one of the ways you can

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.180
answer this is to complete
the pattern.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.200
Let's complete the pattern.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.310
This pattern in particular,
4 factorial, is equal to 5

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.440
factorial divided by 5.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.280
If you can see that, if I take 5
factorial here and divide by

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.790
5, that means I can knock
off that 5, and you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.830
end up with 4 factorial.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.290
So 5 factorial divided
by 5, or 120 divided

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.420
by 5, that's 24.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.670
That's 4 factorial.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.370
3 factorial is going to be
4 factorial divided by 4.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.810
That's 24 divided by 4.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.790
That's 6.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.270
That's the answer
to 3 factorial.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.180
2 factorial, 3 factorial divided
by 3, 6, which we've

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.730
just worked out, divided
by 3, equals 2.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.800
1 factorial.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.890
Do it again.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.280
It's 2 factorial divided by 2.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.050
2 factorial is 2 divided by 2.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.130
We've got 2 divided by 2.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.780
That's equal to 1.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.150
Now this is where it's
getting exciting.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.880
Do you feel the anticipation?

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.480
So 0 factorial.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.880
We're going to complete
the pattern.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.340
0 factorial is 1 factorial
divided by 1.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.720
1 factorial is 1.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.070
It's 1 divided by 1, and
that is equal to 1.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.430
So 0 factorial is equal to 1.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.350
You complete the pattern.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.540
BRADY HARAN: Who says the
pattern has to be complete?

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.990
Where's that rule come from?

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.970
JAMES GRIME: I guess it doesn't
necessarily have to be

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.820
a pattern that completes.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.350
It is a pattern that
competes, though.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.290
Let me try another way
to explain it.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.100
BRADY HARAN: Let me continue
the pattern first.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.350
Does that mean negative 1
factorial would be next in

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.600
that sequence?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.365
JAMES GRIME: Let's
see what happens.

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:44.540
I'm not sure what's
going to happen.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.350
Let's try.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.460
Minus 1 factorial.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.220
So what shall I get?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.030
0 factorial divided by 0.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.935
1 divided by 0.

00:02:53.935 --> 00:02:56.210
BRADY HARAN: Oh, divided by 0.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.510
JAMES GRIME: You've broken
maths, Brady.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.270
Stop that.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.610
Another way to explain what
0 factorial might be.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.695
n factorial is the number
of ways you

00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:07.090
can arrange n objects.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.590
Let me just try to show
you what I mean.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.540
Let's get some objects.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.410
I'll get the wallet out.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.270
I'll get some coins out.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.740
See?

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.800
Who says mathematicians don't
make a lot of money?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.220
There's literally 50p here.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.410
Let's pick a silver
one and a 5p one.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.760
Three objects here, and how many
ways are there to arrange

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.940
three objects?

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.140
There's six ways to do it.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.240
It's 3 factorial.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.360
Let's just check them.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.620
That's one, that's two, or we
could have this one here--

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.180
that's three, that's four.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.020
Or we could have--

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.660
I think it was that one we
didn't have at the front.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.375
So that would be five and six.

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:53.670
If we take one away, we
have now two objects.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.290
How many ways are there to
arrange two objects?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.040
That's one, that's two.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.790
Take one away.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.980
How many ways are there
to arrange one object?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.410
There it is.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.070
There's one way to do it.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.460
One way to arrange one object.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.460
Now we're going to take
the last coin away.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.050
This is where it gets a
little philosophical.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.329
We have zero objects.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.839
How many ways are there to
arrange zero objects?

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.130
There's one way to do it.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.214
There it is.

00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:25.375
Do you want to see
me do it again?

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:28.000
There it is.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.680
Slightly philosophical, but
we say there is one way to

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.090
arrange zero objects.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.720
So again, the pattern holds.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.080
0 factorial equals 1.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.940
Just to continue the idea just a
little bit further, if we're

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.090
talking about factorials, let's
try and graph them.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.230
So let's say let's have one,
two, three, four, five.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.100
1 factorial is 1, so
if you call that 1.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.050
2 factorial is 2, so somewhere
about here.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.732
3 factorial is 6.

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:00.490
I don't know.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.760
Somewhere like this.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.870
4 factorial is 24, so that's
going to be actually quite

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.540
high up here.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.750
And then 5 factorial is
going quite high.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.780
If we join these together,
I've also said that 0

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.590
factorial is 1, so I reckon
this is the graph.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.810
So in theory, we should be
able to get values for in

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.540
between, like, say, the
number 1 and 1/2.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.405
1 and 1/2 factorial.

00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:29.150
What is 1 and 1/2 factorial?

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.490
So mathematicians
have done that.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.360
They generalize the idea.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.330
And there is the idea of
1 and 1/2 factorial.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.750
We call it gamma.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.610
That's the Greek letter gamma.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.320
We call it gamma of.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.400
And the way we write it--

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.810
actually, now this is getting
a bit more sophisticated.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.540
We say gamma of n is equal to
the integral between 0 and

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.160
infinity of--

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.110
let's pick something--

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.430
t to the power n minus 1,
multiplied by e to the power

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.890
minus n dn.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.380
Some people won't be
familiar with that.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.330
Some of you will be familiar
with that.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.340
Some of you won't be.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.830
It's a much more complicated
mathematical idea, but this

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.090
would agree with
the factorials.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.760
But it gives you in between
values as well.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.860
It plots this line.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.850
There is something
I do need to say.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.010
It's slightly unexpected, but if
we take a value for a whole

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.180
number, gamma of n, and n is
whole, this actually gives you

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.970
n minus 1 factorial, so
be careful of that.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.600
That might catch you out.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.060
Bit of a pain, that.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.730
So what's the point of having a
function that will give you

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.540
factorials in between whole
numbers when you can't arrange

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.070
1 and 1/2 objects?

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.980
So it's a generalization, and
it turns out to be quite

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.300
useful in many things.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.220
Particularly, I'm thinking
of probability.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.690
You can use them in formulas
that you find in probability

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.680
where you're thinking about
continuous time instead of

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.480
just arranging objects in
discreet probability.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.420
You're now starting to think
about continuous events.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.740
Time is the best example.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.220
Then you start to generalize the
ideas, and therefore you

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.410
need a generalized factorial.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:34.120
BRADY HARAN: 9, 6, and 3.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.650
20.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.200
44.
