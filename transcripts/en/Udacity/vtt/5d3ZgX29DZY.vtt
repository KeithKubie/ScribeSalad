In this question, you're going to use dimensional analysis, which is a tool we mentioned

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
briefly in the unit, to do some basic analysis of two fairly advanced physics equations.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Here we have E=mc², one of Einstein's famous equations which relates mass and energy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Energy isn't something we've talked about in class yet but with dimensional analysis

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you don't need to know what energy is to be able to quantify its units and the way

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we did dimensional analysis was we realized we can write the unit of just

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
about any physical quantity in terms of mass, length, and time.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So mass rates some power, lengths to some power, and time to some power.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So using your knowledge that m is the unit of mass and c is the unit of velocity or speed

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
you should be able to figure out what the units of energy are even if you do not know what it is yet.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That would be step one, but I really want you to do and what I want you to solve for this problem

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I want you tell me the units of this number ħ, an ħ is a number that shows up

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in quantum mechanics, which is a fascinating field of physics all the time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So even if you have no idea what some of these symbols mean, there's

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
actually still a lot you could learn about this equation.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's take a look at this term for example.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Well there is a lot going on in this term but a lot of it does not affect the actual units of what's happening.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So for example, I don't have to pay attention to this guy at all.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is the Greek letter Ψ Zand it's dimensionless, so we can ignore it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This d are just some instructions of some math to do so you

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
don't have to pay attention to those either.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The negative sign doesn't really matter and the 2 doesn't matter either.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So what we've left with is this. This is the relevant part to this equation unit wise.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Well, we have ħ²--we'll for something with units of mass times x which is L².

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We know that this whole term has units of energy then what are the units of ħ?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You know we can write this as mass to the something, L to the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
something and T for the something.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I've called those somethings a, b, and c. Enter in your answers here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
One of the points of this problem is to show you that even with very complicated physics

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
there's some very simple analysis that we already have the tools to do.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now if you're having trouble solving this one, don't worry, it's another tricky question

00:02:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so as always go to the forums for help.
