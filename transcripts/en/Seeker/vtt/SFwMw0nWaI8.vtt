00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.180
Short on change?

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.709
Ladies and gentlemen start your bowels!

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.389
Dropping a deuce might lead to dropping a
few dollars in your wallet.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.620
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.789
People sell body parts all the time, eggs,
sperm, plasma, but what about number two?

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.949
A nonprofit organization, Open Biome is tapping
into this tight market.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.560
OpenBiome collects stool samples and ships
them all over the world to treat patients

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.519
infected with a nasty bug called Clostridium
difficile infection or CDI, sometimes called

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.519
C. Diff.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.260
It’s normally in only 3% of adults and in
66% of children and most people who do get

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.360
it, aren’t affected by it.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.750
For those who are affected, this gut bacteria
can cause a high fever, severe diarrhea, and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.650
intense abdominal pain.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.300
Severe infections can be life threatening.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.110
Antibiotics help, but often they’re targeted
as the cause of infection.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.610
Antibiotics wipe the gut’s bacteria.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.690
Both the good and bad kind.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.240
Once it’s wiped clean, C. Diff takes over.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.610
This leads to a vicious cycle of infection,
round of antibiotics, more infection.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.610
and so on and so forth.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.920
This is the crappy thing about C. Difficile,
it’s really hard to get rid of.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.730
20-30 percent of those who get it, are gonna
get it again.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.800
Some, so badly, that they have to undergo
an emergency colectomy.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.210
Where doctors take part or all of your colon.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.210
yeah ouch.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.660
But there’s a new alternative, which we’ve
talked about on DNews before - turd transplants.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.390
If a patient’s gut is out of balance from
undergoing a round of antibiotics, A transplant

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.230
can re-colonize the gut with a more diverse
batch of bacteria.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.170
To find a donor, doctors first turn to the
family.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.570
Families have more similar gut bacteria, for
more reasons than just living together and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.740
sharing the same food.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.400
Genes seem to affect the microbiome, according
to a study from Julia Goodrich, a researcher

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.940
at Cornell University.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.520
She found identical twins had more similar
microbiomes than non-identical twins, strongly

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.970
indicating a genetic link.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.970
Microbiomes help us a lot.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.229
In our guts they digest food, regulate our
weight, and boost our immune system.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.780
One study suggests that gut bacteria impacts
how our brains develop.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.950
But before you go out and buy the latest probiotic
pill, consider this.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.729
According to science writer Ed Yong, drastic
measures like a fecal transplant should be

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.870
reserved for the very sick.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.970
What we know, right now, is that there doesn’t
seem to be a “healthy” microbiome.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.560
It’s a dynamic ecosystem that can vary not
just person to person, but throughout a person’s

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.560
lifetime.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.980
A pregnant woman’s gut bacteria changes
rapidly in the third trimester, it closely

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.600
resembles someone who is very sick, with high
blood sugar.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.150
Yet this works for her, she’s got a baby
to build!

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.350
Our microbiomes are so personal and adaptable.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.280
They change based on what we eat or even what
antibiotics we take throughout our lives.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.970
So it makes sense why OpenBiome is more selective.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.750
They only take 4% of the doo doo that’s
donated.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.560
That’s a lower acceptance rate than MIT!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.599
Some things you’d be rejected for: risky
sexual behavior, certain kinds of STIs, travel

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.250
outside of the US within the last few months
to a country where infectious diarrhea is

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.800
a risk, a BMI over 30, antibiotic use in the
past three months, asthma or eczema, history

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.300
of irritable bowel syndrome or chronic fatigue
disease, etc

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.390
But if you make it through the screening process
you can earn up to $13,000 bucks a year!

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.840
So if you’re pinching pennies, maybe you
should look into pinching a loaf instead.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.709
And if the thought of having a surgical poop
transplant doesn’t sound like fun, you could

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.580
also try taking poop pills.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.020
Yeah, that’s a thing.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:30.880

on that right over here.
