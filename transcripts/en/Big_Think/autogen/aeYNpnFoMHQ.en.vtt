00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.050
these multi Multi verses is that there
isn't any real good way to exclude them

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060
isn't any real good way to exclude them
 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.760
isn't any real good way to exclude them
there's no way to make sure that they

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770
there's no way to make sure that they
 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.690
there's no way to make sure that they
don't exist so maybe they do and that's

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700
don't exist so maybe they do and that's
 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.550
don't exist so maybe they do and that's
cool and exciting and by the way you are

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560
cool and exciting and by the way you are
 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.260

in your lifetime maybe discoveries will

in your lifetime maybe discoveries will
 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.770
in your lifetime maybe discoveries will
be made that will tell us about dark

about relativity yet if you have a

about relativity yet if you have a
 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.050
about relativity yet if you have a
smartphone and it tells you which side
