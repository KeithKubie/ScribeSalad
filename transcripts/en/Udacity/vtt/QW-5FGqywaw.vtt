You've seen some interesting interfaces with drawable and likeable, but let me

00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:08.943
give you another very common reason why people like to use interfaces. And that

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:15.540
is to be able to reuse an algorithm. Consider a common algorithm to compute an

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.578
average. Here I have an array of countries, each of which has a name and an

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:26.710
area. And I want to know, what is the average area of all of these countries.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.014
Now of course, I could write a loop to compute that, but let's say I want to a

00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:34.915
method that does this for any set of countries. So, I'd like you to complete

00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:39.061
this method that takes an array of countries. For each of them, find out what

00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:44.210
the area is simply by calling the Get Area method. Add up all those areas, and

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.084
then return the average.
