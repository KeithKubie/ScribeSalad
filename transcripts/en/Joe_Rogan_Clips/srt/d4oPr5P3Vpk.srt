1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,680
The Joe Rogan experience. Did you
see a, I thought Vinny Magalhaes.

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:07,770
She's got to take it that last I did too.
I remember seeing a lot.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,970
He's really coming into his own.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,640
His striking is caught up with
a lot of his grapple. Oh yeah.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,270
And he's fantastic after this back.
Very dangerous.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,630
I've never seen a guy that big bath
flexible. He can do everything.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,750
When it comes to Jujitsu. Do you ever
see when the flying armbar paid upon? No.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,430
Nope. It's crazy. Look, who the fuck does
that? Nope. I was at that match. The, uh,

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,540
the Metamorris, I think it was a
w w was it? Metamorris when he,

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,790
what'd he grappled Keenan?

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,440
Was that Metamorris few years back?
Maybe like four or five years. Yeah.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,630
It could have been metamorris or,
but it was clue.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,680
Metamorris matchups had some good ones,
but I forget all the matchups. Yeah,

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,950
those are good events, huh? Yes. Yeah. No
more. Huh? I wish there was more of those,

15
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,430
man.
I mean,

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,430
I'm happy Eddie Bravo's sort of taken
over that space with the Ebi and a combat.

17
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:56,280
You just who now have you seen
that slaps her so sick, man,

18
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,510
it's so six great idea.
It's nice.

19
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:01,650
It's a great idea at times
like you might be holding on,

20
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:05,270
but that's slap that might cause
the guy to let go of something.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,830
Changes the game.
There's things aren't available anymore.

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,950
You can't just allow yourself. It's just
too hard. You could somebody like, oh,

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,010
somebody stopped, somebody whacked the
roadshow. Stop. Somebody's got on top,

24
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,950
mounted them and just blasted
them with pumps. Their head. Yeah.

25
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,770
It was pretty rough, man. It's
like you, it's almost like,

26
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:23,700
am I going to look at that?

27
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,170
I mean you can do ground and pound and
we learned from boss route and way back

28
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,720
in the Pancrase days. Do you
remember those days? Yeah.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,890
Boss route and figured out how to pull
his hand back way further than other

30
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:39,450
people and boss route and would
smash guys with palm strikes.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,080
He was throwing like upper cuts and hooks,
like he wasn't just like [inaudible].

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,690
Yeah. This, these are really high
level Jujitsu to with smacks.

33
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,530
Look at home. What? Ugh. Yeah. I need all
that guy's not used to getting slapped up,

34
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,500
not by a guy with a nasty
guard like Wagner roadshow.
Ah, yeah. If he wants to tap,

35
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:03,240
his nose is fucked up. Goodness.
Yeah. Can you tap from the slap? Yeah,

36
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:06,400
you can tab. Oh, he's getting
beat up the reputation.

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,500
Stop Mike Bell Tron seen enough.
See,

38
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,370
once he starts dropping those
palms down, boy. Huh? Paul, Huh?

39
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,960
Yeah, it's a forehead. It's
a reality check. You know,

40
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:21,540
it's a reality check about how
dangerous this position is.

41
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,020
You can't really just sit and let a guy
mount you do something desperate to get

42
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:31,070
out of that. But in Jujitsu,
if the guy's just mounting you,

43
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,000
you can kind of chill out,
chilling out,

44
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,910
figuring out how to escape a leg
or something. That shit. Yeah.

45
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,160
Combat you just so you gotta
get the fuck out of there.

46
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:42,240
That's a terrible place to be. Yeah. Same.
They were like MMA, right? Being mounted.

47
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,460
So especially when you're tired.
Well,

48
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:49,050
the difference between MMA grappling and
regular grappling to used to always be

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,110
with the, one of the big ones, at
least I should say, was leg locks.

50
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,260
They thought you really couldn't get
away with leg locks in as much in MMA

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,830
because as you're going for the legs,
you have two arms committed to the legs.

52
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:00,310
So I'm just going to punch you in the
face and you don't have defense for it.

53
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,260
But now you're seeing when God's like m
and Ra bursts on the scene and started

54
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,570
ripping guys knees apart,
you see how effective that is.

55
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:11,920
And then Paul Horez people, no, no,
you don't like, like less scared of it.

56
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,350
It's they're scary, Huh? Yeah.

57
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:17,800
I've actually so infatuated Cabrini
operations and to reconstructions. Ah,

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,930
but are you like, do you like
to watch? Oh yeah, yeah. Like,
yeah, John Danaher. Yeah,

59
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,770
dude, he's so interesting.
[inaudible] you know? Yeah, yeah.

60
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,980
I remember just like kind of looking
into the little bitty Cummings. Yeah.

61
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,900
Those guys are savages. Gary, Tony,

62
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,140
fucking people's legs up and you know,

63
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:38,710
and then Craig Jones and all these other
guys that are coming from all over the

64
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,660
world that are leg locks specialists now,

65
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,550
they all have these
complex leg locks systems.

66
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:46,360
Now it's a totally different
thing. Holy Shit. You fuck up?

67
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:50,790
You go zig when he should
have zagged. Like when Brian
Hall fought Bj Penn. Right.

68
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,630
And he caught him in that. I was
like, no, no, no, not that way. Yeah,

69
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,580
you just try to get out. He tried to get
out and Ryan Hall just locked it up. Oh,

70
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:02,200
I just imagined the field right
now. I always tap road. Oh,

71
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,700
well it's once that stuff gets chewed up
inside there, that's the problem. I mean,

72
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,900
some people could just take it,

73
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,890
but once you start ripping
meniscus apart and cartilage apart,

74
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,090
once that stuff starts happening,

75
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,840
ligaments starts getting stretched out
and rip a little bit and there are always

76
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:21,040
going to be wiggly. I mean, even Gordon
ride just ripped his fucking leg apart.

77
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,010
Did he really? Yeah. Yeah.
He just had surgery. Um,

78
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,860
I think he did it in an actual
grappling match that I think his foot,

79
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,640
his leg moved weird and it just,
it popped his, his knee apart.

80
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,950
But the guy had a hold on
it. I don't think so. No, no,

81
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,350
I think it was in a scramble. I think
it came apart in a scramble. Um,

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,170
but there's a lot of those leg lock
experts right now that scare the shit out

83
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,270
and everything came from dean lister,
which is crazy.

84
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,670
[inaudible] you know the story?
No,

85
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,460
John Danaher was talking
to Dean lister and uh,

86
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,210
Dean lister was talking about leg
locks and John Donna her said something

87
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,340
inquired about why you do leg locks.
And he goes,

88
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,650
why would you ignore 50% of the body?

89
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,870
And John Don heart being a fucking crazy
wizards. And he is like, why would you,

90
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,240
why would you,

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,210
there's all these means there's a fucking
hilarious meme of John Donna her in

92
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:12,190
bed next to a woman and it says,
why would you ignore 40% 50% of the body?

93
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,480
Oh Man. Yeah. And then other guys. Yeah.

94
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,161
Well, Don, hers,

95
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:23,161
a guy who understands things like he
sees them on a very complex level,

96
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:28,750
like he understands all the various
possible exchanges and what's the best way

97
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:32,800
to mitigate, like stop the defense,
push the offense, control the situation.

98
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,500
What is, what is the ultimate
control position I have to get to?

99
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,950
Do I have to get on the inside? Do I grab
it this way? Do I grab it? And then they,

100
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,890
once they started really experimenting
and putting it together and putting it

101
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:42,724
into a system,

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,600
and you see how these guys who have
only been doing Jujitsu for a few years,

103
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,490
like Nicky Ryan and Gordon,
right?

104
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,820
They start tapping all these like
really legit guys. They're like,

105
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:55,440
what the fuck is happening? Yeah. The
systems are craving Kamora system.

106
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,090
Everything. Huh? [inaudible] I
think that helps a lot. It just,

107
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:02,240
when it comes to training, learning
things in systems, you know what I mean?

108
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,780
I think 10 plan, it has like their
own short system right now for sure.

109
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:09,620
And it helps. It helps you go to
another state. Like it's the same. Yeah.

110
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,950
Same System, right? Yeah. All
systems help. Yeah. You know? I mean,

111
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:16,670
and then fighters devise their
own system really often, you know,

112
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:19,500
have their own entries in their
own ways of defending things. Yeah.
