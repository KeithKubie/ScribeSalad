00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.650
I want to begin our
discussion of computability

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.070
by taking you back to
early high school or

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.320
late middle school, when you first
learned about the notion of a function.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.920
Here we have the teacher, and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280
here are some very earnest
students sitting in the front row.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.410
The teacher begins by defining the
notion of a relation, saying that it is

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.120
a set of ordered pairs,
where the first element comes from a set

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.640
called the domain, and the second
comes from a set called the range.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.090
And a function then is a special
kind of relation where

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.460
each element of the domain is paired
with exactly one element of the range.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.230
And of course this rather
abstract definition

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.060
is well beyond the maturity
of everyone in the class.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.955
Then, the teacher writes some
examples of functions on the board.

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:48.940
Like f(x)=3x+2, or g(x)= -x2+1.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.390
And then the students get
a flash of insight and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.840
say to themselves, oh I get it.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.820
A function is what you do
to x in order to get y.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.560
I mean f(x).

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.740
In effect, the student understands
the function as an algorithm,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.290
a finite number of steps to follow that
let's you find the output given an input.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.720
Notice, however, that the teacher's
definition was very different,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.480
being given in terms of the rather
abstract notion of sets.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.110
Now for the rest of this algebra class,
and maybe for as much math as this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.770
student studies, the difference
between the student's computational

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.300
understanding and the teacher's
definition, won't be important.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.245
The student will know how to
solve all the problems and

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:35.155
probably won't give the teacher's
definition much more thought.

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:38.995
In reality however there's a profound
difference between these two notions.

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:42.705
And indeed this difference between
computation on the one hand and

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:44.135
functions on the other,

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:46.325
will be the subject of
the first part of this course.
