00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.170
Even though both of Marvel’s world-famous
super-teams debuted in the exact same month

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.360
of the exact same year, the X-Men and the
Avengers have had their own unique problems

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.660
to worry about in the 50 years since.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.750
So as much as fans might hate today’s blockbuster
reality of separate studios keeping universes

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.310
from crossing over, it isn’t too different
from the comics.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.289
That being said, the Mutant do-gooders and
Earth’s Mightiest Heroes have found a few

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.010
reasons to cross paths (or swap members) over
the years.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.720
And when the X-Men and Avengers meet, there’
just one question on fans’ minds: when you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.400
get right down to it, who’s the stronger
team?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.790
It’s not an easy question to answer – or
even one Marvel wants people to ask – but

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.380
it’s a fun one to explore.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.510
In the comics or on the big screen, any competition
has to begin with the most obvious question:

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.820
who would win in a fight?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.930
We’ll try to answer this question and more
in our latest Docu Series: X-Men vs The Avengers:

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.489
Who is Marvel’s Most Powerful Team?

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.780
The Leaders

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.280
While most comic book fans would tell you
that Captain America has emerged as the de

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.960
facto leader of the Avengers, the team’s
origins, and the version seen in Marvel’s

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.560
Cinematic Universe have viewed Steve Rogers
as the heart, but not necessarily the brains

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920
(or the money) behind the team.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.090
That duty fell to billionaire superhero Tony
Stark, always one step ahead of the problem,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
with enough technology and wit to solve it.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.710
For the X-Men, it’s an easier question:
Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops is the embodiment

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.920
of a fearless leader, and while he may be
lacking in funds or gadgets compared to the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.470
Avengers’ resident beam-weapon-blaster,
he makes up for it in courage and determination.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.240
If we’re talking purely about power, Cyclops
has an edge: Tony Stark’s famous armor and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.670
on-board attacks are powerful, but they can’t
hold a flame to Cyclops’ eye blasts, channeling

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.280
massive beams of concussive force from an
alternate dimension.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.909
Unfortunately, the students and teachers at
the Xavier School don’t really believe in

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.909
armor.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.480
Combine that with Iron Man’s ability to
fly, and it’s hard to believe Tony wouldn’t

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.239
come out on top – even if he lacks the conviction
or inspiration Cyclops has in spades.

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.849
Edge: Avengers

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.519
The Lost Warriors

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.329
Two men blessed with increased durability,
agility, reflexes and strength: one, a clawed

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.900
mutant who’s impossible to kill, and the
other, a soldier out of time who will never

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.900
give up.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.810
The comparisons between Captain America and
Wolverine might not be obvious on the surface,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.760
but they’ve got more in common than you
think.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.569
Burying a past filled with dead friends and
loved ones, and with only the war to give

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.020
them purpose, you have to think that any fight
between the two would end in cold beers, instead

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.020
of blood.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.779
But our mission demands that we not just imagine
the amazing flurry of feet, fists, and sprayed

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.829
sparks that this fight would entail, but who
would emerge victorious.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.579
Even in the most even fights, you have to
put your money on the one who heals instantly.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.709
But the fact that most comic book fans wouldn’t
WANT to see these two heroes fight to the

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.779
death perfectly demonstrates how even the
teams really are.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:17.939
Edge: X-Men

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:25.950
The Witches

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.150
Now we’re talking about true power: in the
Avengers corner, there’s Scarlet Witch,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.459
a troubled woman struggling to control the
magical powers she is able to wield over reality

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.459
itself.

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.250
In the X-Men corner, there’s Jean Grey,
a troubled woman struggling to control the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.639
mutant and cosmic powers she is able to wield
over reality itself.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.739
We would usually call this one a draw – since
Scarlet Witch is also a player in Marvel’s

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.780
version of the “Ultimate” Avengers – but
add in the Phoenix Force that makes Jean Grey

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.980
the most powerful mutant in the universe,
and nobody, not even her teammates can hope

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.099
to survive.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.219
Edge: X-Men

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.569
The Gods

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.309
What’s a fight without some thunder and
lightning.

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:14.139
It’s actually weird how perfectly these
teams stack up against eachother… almost

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.540
as if they were created by the exact same
men at the exact same time….

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.720
Anyway, the god of thunder taking on a goddess
of nature, if you believe the legacy of Storm’s

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.909
family, is the kind of fight that comics exist
to make possible.

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:31.409
Both are serious aces in the hole for both
teams, since controlling the wind, clouds,

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.400
and lightning isn’t a tool most villains
can call on.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.900
But again, one little factor seems to make
all the difference: one of these two is as

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.759
hard to kill as a Norse god, and the other…
isn’t.

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.879
Edge: Avengers

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:52.580
The Hulk Vs…

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.150
This one is pretty self-explanatory: the Avengers
have a Hulk.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.400
The X-Men have plenty of angry mutants, brilliant
mutants, and even some green ones… but zero

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.400
Hulks.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.439
Edge: Avengers

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.150
The Running Totals

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.550
Putting the heroes head-to-head shows that
they really are a solid match – which is

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.840
probably why their track record of ACTUAL
fights in the comics usually end in a draw

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.780
(and more often than not, somebody is being
misled, manipulated, or mind-controlled).

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.389
When the teams first met in combat while they
both tried to capture the villain Lucifer

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.150
in 1965, it was Professor X who stopped the
fight before one team came out on top (http://readcomiconline.me/Comic/Uncanny-X-Men-1963/Issue-9?id=23308).

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.330
The champion was actually chosen when the
X-Men were mind-controlled into fighting the

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.350
Avengers, and were taken down one by one:
Beast fell to Black Panther, Ant-Man went

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.629
giant to defeat Cyclops, Hawkeye outsmarted
Ice-Man, and so on, and so on (http://readcomiconline.me/Comic/The-Avengers-1963/Issue-53?id=11431).

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:51.370
But two decades later the score was settled
when the mutants won a moral and legal victory

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.830
in the X-Men vs Avengers series (http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AVX-003.jpg).

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.600
The epic showdown between both sides in 2012’s
“Avengers VS X-Men” turned out to be a

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.860
draw as well, with both teams working together
to take out the Phoenix Force.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.810
Which might be the entire point: the teams
are both as powerful as Marvel can make them.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.810
Who wins in a fight?

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.770
That question can’t be answered, since the
people writing the comics know that it’s

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.759
a conflict which shouldn’t and couldn’t
be that simple.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.400
So, the teams are different, but equal, then.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.830
While the Avengers tackle alien villains and
protect the Earth from supervillains the world

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.909
over, the X-Men tackle mutant villains and
crises, working to keep mutants capable of

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:30.060
re-writing history and time itself in control.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.330
To be honest, the fact that both teams have
failed in their missions in some pretty high-profile

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.810
storylines would suggest that they BOTH have
some room to grow before claiming they’re

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.639
“the most powerful,” but in Hollywood,
there’s at least one clear winner.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.789
The Box Office Champion

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.970
The X-Men movie universe and its solo Wolverine
adventures has done well for itself on film,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.660
bringing in more than 3 billion dollars in
total.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.110
But compare that to Marvel, having now brought
in over 10 billion worldwide, and the Star-Spangled

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.620
hero’s crew of misfits has claim to the
crown.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.260
So, is it enough to be the most powerful Marvel
super-team when it comes to ticket sales?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.910
Even if it is, we’ve got some bad news:
although Fox’s X-Men universe has less than

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:16.039
half the box office totals of Marvel’s Avengers,
they made it with half as many movies.

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:20.419
Which is either a massive coincidence, or
proof that the universe itself wants Marvel

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.190
fans divided on which team reigns supreme.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.190
Conclusion

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.190
So what do you think?

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.949
Is it only right that Marvel’s two greatest
teams should come to a tie whenever they compete?

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:35.290
Or do you think the rise of the Marvel Cinematic
Universe beats Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.599
and friends hands down?

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:41.120
The future of the movies may not offer an
answer, but in today’s world of billion-dollar

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.730
superhero blockbusters, almost anything is
possible.
