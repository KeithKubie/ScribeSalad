00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:30.160
So I love maths. And unfortunately, not everyone
loves maths as much as I do. And there are

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.949
many reasons for this. And in my previous
work, I have spent quite a lot of time showing

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:42.580
that maths can be fun, that maths can be delicious,
that maths can be creative, that maths doesn't

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.760
necessarily have right answers, that maths
uses your imagination.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.989
But the thing that I'm addressing today is
slightly different. Because people often say,

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.330
well that's all very well, but what's useful
for? And I've often shied away from that question,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.390
because I think we spend too much time going
on about how useful maths is, and especially

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.750
to young people. Since when did any young
person get interested in something because

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.740
we said it was useful? It's like introducing
a friend and saying, I'd like you to meet

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.510
my friend. They're really useful.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.610
Or it's like trying to get people to eat broccoli
because it's good for you. Broccoli is delicious

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.620
it is also good for you. But then I thought
about it, and I thought, well, maths is useful.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.640
And the way in which it's useful is because
it's illuminating. And the way in which it's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.500
illuminating is because it helps us to think
more clearly. And wouldn't it be useful if

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.250
more people in the world could think clearly,
especially these days?

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.660
And so I realised that I felt a driving urge
to try and help with this current situation

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.630
we're in, where we find ourselves often surrounded
by fake news or claims or fake news-- maybe

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.240
it's fake fake news-- and divisive arguments.
People yelling at each other. People being

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.790
victims, exploiting, bigotry, prejudice, blame,
shouting, and tiny attention spans. And I've

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.820
always believed it's important to think about
all the things that I'm good at and do the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.909
best possible thing I can with them to help
the world.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.630
And I realised that in the current sociopolitical
climate, it was really important for me to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.829
do something about that. And you might say,
what can a pure mathematician do about that?

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.409
And I thought, well, what I can do is I can
help us all gain better clarity about the

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:42.079
kind of arguments that are happening. I'm
not going to tell you what to think, but I'm

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:49.590
going to show you some ways that I find helpful
in navigating the rather confusing world that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.060
we're in at the moment.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.650
Because how can you make sense in a world
that doesn't? Well, I think that we can. And

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.720
so this is a message of optimism. I am an
optimist. That's why I'm in education. You

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.529
can't really be in education unless you're
an optimist. And we believe that the key to

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:12.389
everything is the young people and how they're
going to think better in the future, when

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.900
the rest of us have gone. Maybe that wasn't
so optimistic.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:26.200
So the point of my talk is to show how pure
maths really does apply to our daily lives.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.340
Usually, we think of pure maths as something
abstract and remote. But I am going to argue

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.950
that pure mathematics is, in fact, a framework
for agreeing on things. And mathematicians

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.000
have this curious ability to agree as a research
field. So we really make progress. Things

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
become theories.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.561
In other subjects, people keep arguing and
arguing and arguing. Say in philosophy, there

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.650
are many theories, and you argue, and there's
never anything that's necessarily right. If

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.879
there's a philosopher in the room, they may
argue with me. But mathematicians have a very

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.329
clear framework for agreeing when something
has been properly justified. And this involves

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.949
setting up what you're talking about carefully
and then using logic carefully about it. And

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:13.390
this is sorely missing from many arguments
in life at the moment.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.449
So, traditionally, pure maths is thought of
as remote and distant from the world, and

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.420
it's nothing to do with real life. But it
applies. Usually, we think of it as being

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.740
useful to applied maths, where applied maths
is then useful to maybe science, and science

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.150
is useful to, perhaps, engineering and medicine.
And engineering and medicine are definitely

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.420
useful. And they are useful to largely a numerical
part of the world.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.259
And many people think that maths is all about
numbers, and maths is not all about numbers.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:50.600
I do not do any numbers in my research as
a category theorist. And maths is about something

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.520
more than that. So while this view of the
chain of implications of applications of mathematics--

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.930
this view is important. There's more to it
than that.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.919
So I'm going to argue that pure maths is about
how to think, and how to think affects the

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.379
entire human world. And that this is a direct
application. It doesn't have to go through

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.620
all those intermediate steps. And in fact,
I was at a very interesting event recently

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.650
about maths in the real world, and everyone
else was an applied mathematician except me.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.420
I'm not an applied mathematician. I'm a pure
mathematician.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.539
And one of the very interesting audience questions
to the whole panel at the end of the day was,

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.159
what maths do you use in your daily life?
How do you use your research in your daily

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.211
life? And I felt very, very validated, or
possibly vindicated, or maybe both. Because

00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:42.840
the applied mathematicians all kind of said,
well, I don't really use my actual research

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.930
in my daily life. But what I do use is the
way of mathematical thinking and thinking

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.930
through things.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.599
I thought, see? That's pure maths. I use it
in my daily life all the time. And I'm going

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:59.180
to show you how, including I'm going to talk
about analogies, the interconnectedness of

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:06.290
things, relationships of various kinds, pivots
between different contexts to help us understand

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:14.720
other people, and, finally, intelligence and
what I think intelligence is, or what it should

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.740
be.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:23.610
So, first of all, analogies. I often like
to think of maths-- there are many ways of

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.110
thinking of maths. I often like to think of
it as a theory of analogies. Because what

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.389
we do is we look at things in common between
different situations. And then we say, oh,

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.841
if we forget some of the small details about
these different situations, they will become

00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:36.841
the same.

00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:42.219
So, for example, we might think about two
apples and two bananas. And we go, oh, well,

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:45.550
these two things have something in common.
If we forget that these are apples and that

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.800
these are bananas, then they just become two
things. And now they are both examples of

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.440
the same concept. And that's what abstraction
is. It's moving from the kind of real things

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.939
to something that they have in common.

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:01.949
And the thing that maths does is it makes
very precise what that thing is that they

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:06.289
have in common. We don't just say, oh, two
apples are analogous to two bananas. We say

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.259
exactly what it is that we're thinking about
that makes them analogous. And there are different

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:17.689
choices you can make for this. So, for example,
if instead we had said two fruits, that would

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:21.909
still be true, right? They're both still a
type of two fruits.

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:26.449
But in making that analogy instead, we have
made something much more restrictive. And

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:33.210
so we will leave out, say, two chairs, which
are now not part of this analogy. Whereas,

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.120
if we say two things, then we get to include
all of that in the analogy. So different levels.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.190
There isn't one correct level for making the
analogy, but there are different levels that

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.970
are more or less illuminating for different
situations.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:51.680
And the key in maths is that we say what level
it is we're using. The problem in life is

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.460
that we usually don't. And so we end up in
arguments about whether something is or isn't

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.450
analogous. And the answer usually is there
is a sense in which it is analogous, but is

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:06.180
that sense illuminating? And that's more what
maths is about. It's not this is right, this

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.659
is wrong. No, you're wrong. You're right.
No, I'm right. It's about what is the sense

00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:13.669
in which something can be thought of in this
way, and how will that help us?

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:20.590
So here is an example, a more profound example,
from maths, where 1 plus 2 and 2 plus 3 are

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:27.340
both examples of a plus b. And this is an
abstraction which sometimes makes people shudder.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.639
And sometimes people say to me, I was fine
with maths until the numbers became letters.

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:31.639
[SHUDDERS]

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:39.909
But the point of the letters is that we now
get to include more things. And we can study

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:45.090
something plus something generally all at
once. And then we can understand a lot of

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:49.590
different situations at the same time while
only having understood it once. And this is

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.760
really good if you're lazy like me, because
I don't want to do the same thing over and

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.830
over again. And pure maths comes out of not
wanting to do the same thing over and over

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.100
again. Once you've done it a couple of times,
you go, OK, I'm going to make a theory that

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.820
does that for me so that I don't have to do
it anymore.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.920
Just like if I had been born before dishwashers
were invented, I feel like I might have invented

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:16.200
a dishwasher, because I really hate doing
the washing up. So we can take this further,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.590
because if we now look at 1 times 2 and 2
times 3, we can go, oh, yeah, well, that's

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.760
a times b. That's what those things have in
common.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.340
But we can now say, well, wait a minute. On
the one hand, we have a plus b. And on the

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:35.250
other hand, we have a times b. Both of those
are just things we can do to a and b. So that's

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:41.820
a further level of abstraction, which I might
write a blob b, where that blob is now an

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:47.830
abstraction from plus and times and could
represent any other kind of operation. It's

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.960
called a binary operation, because it takes
two things.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:58.290
And sometimes that top level is really helpful,
because we can do things like talk about commutativity

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:04.720
in general. Commutativity is where a plus
b is the same as b plus a. And also, a times

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.200
b is the same as b times a. But that's two
things. If we just think about commutativity,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.450
we only have to think about one thing. And
this is a very important way that pure maths

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.330
helps us understand more things.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:21.560
Our brains are finite and a bit feeble. So
we have to be able to understand lots of things

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.910
at once in order to save our brain power.
And one way to save our brain power is just

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:33.580
to ignore stuff and simplify things by forgetting
important details, and many people do that.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:40.190
But a better way to do it is to become more
intelligent. And as you become more intelligent,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.880
you find ways of packaging things together
as one concept. And then you can understand

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.940
it as one concept, instead of having to carry
around 10.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.640
Just like when you first learn to read, maybe
you spell out every letter one by one, and

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.620
it's very arduous. But then, eventually, you
start seeing whole words. And then it takes

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.270
much less processing power for your brain
than having to read every letter. And then,

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.710
if you learn to speed read, then you learn
to see whole phrases at once as units, and

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:10.020
then you can read really fast. And this is
how to think in that kind of way, packaging

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.720
things together.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:19.690
So here's another example of some analogies
where different levels of analogy are possible.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:25.100
Straight marriage and same-sex marriage are
sometimes thought of as being just the same,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.160
because they're marriage. And then, other
people get very angry and say those are not

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.720
the same. So let's think about what level
of analogy we could use here.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.830
If we think that marriage is just between
an unrelated man and woman, then indeed, straight

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:44.200
marriage is not analogous to gay marriage.
But if you think that, actually, it's between

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.500
any two unrelated adults, then they are analogous.
And instead of saying which one is right and

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.180
which one is wrong by definition, we should
think about the different levels that people

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.320
are using to make those connections.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.890
Now, what happens next, often, is that the
people who oppose gay marriage get very upset

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:07.570
and say, well, the next thing we know, we'll
be allowing marriage between any two adults.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.620
And because there are some young people in
the room, I've redacted what exactly is going

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.200
to go on here. Maybe you can work it out.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.080
But then they say, well, if we allow it between
any two adults, well, maybe, then, the next

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:24.120
thing we know, we'll be allowing it between
any two humans. And then, maybe the next thing

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.440
we know, we'll be allowing it between any
two living creatures. And then, maybe the

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.960
next thing we know is we'll be allowing it
between any two creatures.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:44.791
Now, logically speaking, any of those levels
has sound logic. That doesn't mean that they're

00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:51.690
all equally morally valid. But what is certainly
true is that just because we are OK with this

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:57.060
level does not mean that we have automatically
included the whole level all the way up to

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:02.710
the top. So if somebody thinks that thinking
this implies thinking all the way to the top,

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.660
that isn't logical. We can then have arguments
about where is the correct place to stop.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.570
But if we make precise what we're actually
using as the analogy, we can have a more sensible

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:17.010
argument, rather than just yelling at each
other.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:24.560
So now I'm going to talk about the interconnectedness
of things, because everything is very interconnected.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.950
We get told sometimes that growing up is about
becoming independent. But none of us is independent,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.380
unless you're living in a cave as a hermit,
which you're not, because you're all here.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:40.110
We all interact with other people, and nothing
happens in isolation. Everything happens together

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.710
with some other things that cause it to happen
in huge chains.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:48.300
And my field of research, category theory,
is all about how thinking about how things

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.250
are connected can really help you understand
those things. Just like when you're studying

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:58.040
a person and thinking about writing their
biography, perhaps, it would be very odd to

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:03.330
just write about their character in isolation.
Whereas, if you write about it, you usually

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.390
write about their family relationships and
their friends and the people they work with.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.970
And if you're getting to know someone, if
you just put them in a room by themselves,

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.750
it'd be quite difficult. But you can tell
a lot about someone by how they interact with

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:20.460
different people, how they interact with important
people, how they interact with serving staff

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.730
in a restaurant, how they interact with cashiers
in the supermarket or something. You can tell

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.790
a lot from how people interact.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.330
And it's the same with any object. There's
always some web of interconnectedness that

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:37.950
adds insight to those thoughts. So here's
one of my favourite diagrams of interconnectedness.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:45.290
I'm sure that we all know this, since we are
in London. This is a fantastic example of

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:50.710
something that is a logical diagram, because
this is not geographically accurate, right?

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:55.560
The stations are not in the correct places,
which means that sometimes hapless tourists

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.730
end up taking the tube when it would have
been way quicker to just walk four minutes

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:04.020
up the street. It's not clear from the map
how close things are. And once you're on the

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.660
train, it doesn't really matter exactly where
it's going. You just want to know where you

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.030
can get to. And so this basically just shows
connections between stations.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.610
And that's what category theory does a lot.
Is says we're not worried about physical location.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:22.420
What we're interested in is the conceptual
connection between things, how things are

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:28.150
linked according to what we're interested
in right now. Now, there may be situations

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:33.120
when having a geographical representation
of the tube is useful. Here is a geographical

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.430
tube map. I don't know if you've seen one
before, but it's pretty confusing. I find

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:43.240
it very interesting, thinking about how different
it is from the original one, and how fantastic

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.430
it was whoever designed-- I've forgotten who
designed the main one.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.720
But once you start peering at this closely,
you kind of-- what I usually do is I find

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.180
the Circle line first. And then I kind of
orient myself using the Circle line. But this

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.330
isn't to say that one of them is better than
the other. It's just that they're better for

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.640
different purposes. And this is the point
of thinking mathematically. You can think

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.790
about certain aspects of a situation for some
purposes and other aspects for other purposes.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:14.560
And what that can help us do is get a certain
flexibility to our thinking. Because one of

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.330
the great problems with the world at the moment
is rigid thinking. And I sometimes think that

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.860
strength, physical strength, isn't just about
strength but flexibility. Materials that have

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:30.220
some flexibility in them can be very much
stronger. And when cars crash, it's the give

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:35.440
of the car that crumples up that is actually
making it safe for us, because it's absorbing

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.520
the impact.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.020
And I think the same is true of the way we
think, as well, that flexibility of thinking

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:49.530
and the ability to absorb new ideas and process
them is really important. So relationship

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:55.010
breakdown is something that I think about
in terms of interconnectedness. Because often,

00:16:55.010 --> 00:17:00.230
people want to blame one person and say who
is at fault. And there are many situations

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.280
where it's really not that simple.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:09.240
So there are some, in situations of domestic
abuse, where perhaps we can agree that is

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.549
really one person's fault. But aside from
that, it's often some kind of vicious circle.

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:21.569
So maybe Alex feels disrespected, and as a
result, Alex is unable to show love. And as

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:28.880
a result, Alex's partner, Sam, feels unloved.
And as a result, Sam is unable to show respect,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.590
which is why Alex is feeling disrespected.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.890
And what often happens is that one person
in a relationship cares more about feeling

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.340
loved, and the other person cares more about
feeling respected. And then, it goes around

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:46.800
in these cycles. And this vicious cycle is
something that we can then think more about

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:52.640
by thinking about what the arrows are representing.
So these arrows here are about actions, and

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.160
these arrows are more about feelings.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.140
And once we've broken it down like that, we
can think about which things are easier to

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.560
change. Is it easier to change your actions
or your feelings? Now, personally, I think

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.220
it's easier to change my actions, because
the feelings are things that just happen.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:13.000
And so then, for some people, maybe, they
think it's easier to change their feelings.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.070
And there's no right answer to this. But when
you have a vicious cycle, if you understand

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:24.030
what's causing the cycle, then you can figure
out which arrow is the easiest one to break.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:28.640
And maybe there's a theory that whoever has
more power in the situation should be the

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.760
one to take responsibility to break the cycle.
Now, this is a very important example, when

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:40.170
we think about police violence. Because this
vicious circle comes back if we think about

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:44.600
the fact that maybe police feel threatened
by black people, and that's why they show

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.500
more violence towards black people. But as
a result, black people feel threatened by

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.510
the police. And as a result, maybe black people
defend themselves aggressively against the

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.070
police, which means that the police feel threatened
by black people.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.690
And this cycle goes round and round and round.
And every time there is some police violence

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.660
against somebody who isn't white-- and there
is a lot of that in America at the moment,

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:12.900
and there always has been. Every time, there
will be people yelling, saying, well, the

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.990
police are just trying to do their job. And
if the black people hadn't been aggressive,

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.610
nothing would have happened. And then the
other people yell that the police shouldn't

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.610
be aggressive.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.591
But what we should really do is think about
how these things are all connected. And then,

00:19:23.591 --> 00:19:29.690
I think we can think about who has more power
in this situation. And personally, I think

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.740
that it's the people who have more power who
should take the responsibility to change something

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.410
and find an arrow to break. But at least,
even if we disagree about that, at least if

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:44.400
we've understood this interaction, we can
have a more sensible conversation about which

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.210
arrows should be broken and who should break
them.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:55.680
Another way of thinking about interconnectedness
is where I drawn myself diagrams of causation.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.760
So when something happens, like the egregious
incident a couple of years ago when someone

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:08.750
was ejected from a United Flight because they
needed a seat for cabin crew-- and he was

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.870
ejected rather forcefully and sustained some
quite serious injuries on the way out.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.980
And many people started yelling on the internet,
as they always do, oh, well it was his fault.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.800
If he had just obeyed them, then he wouldn't
have been injured. And other people were saying,

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:27.000
well, you shouldn't just beat someone up because
they didn't want to get off a plane. And then

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.540
they just argue at each other. Well, kind
of both of those things are true, and there's

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.670
really a lot of things going on.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:38.290
And I even read-- we're being filmed, so I
won't name this person. But I read a rather

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:43.690
curious editorial by somebody in a British
newspaper who declared that it's actually

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:48.890
our fault, all of us, because we're late for
flights. And the fact that we're late for

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.490
flights means that they overbook flights.
And because they overbook flights, they sometimes

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.920
have to kick people off flights, and that's
why that person got injured. So it's your

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.510
fault, all of you.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:02.890
I mean, there's a tiny element of truth to
that, but it's a little bit tenuous. And so

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.960
I decided to draw a whole diagram of all the
things causing this, because it's never just

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:14.420
one thing, right? So the end result was that
someone was injured. And well, it's because

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:20.059
he refused to leave and also that security
used force. But the airline called security.

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:23.630
Someone had to call them in the first place.
Why did they do that? Well, and why did he

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.140
refuse to leave? He needed to get to work.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.740
Why did the airline choose that person? There
are questions remaining about whether they

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:35.780
were racially profiling. Then, why did the
airline even decide to kick people off in

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.350
the first place? Well, they had to kick people
off because nobody volunteered. Why did nobody

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.690
volunteer? Well, maybe the airline offered
them too little money. They didn't offer them

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:44.690
very much money.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.180
And maybe, for some reason, everyone really
wanted to get home. Well, that's kind of understandable.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.820
Well, also, why did the airline even decide
to remove people in the first place? Because

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.860
the plane was too full. Why was the plane
too full? Also, why did they need to do that?

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:01.790
Because they needed some crew in Lewisville.
And why did they need some crew in Lewisville?

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.690
Maybe there was some issue with their scheduling.
Maybe it was their fault for scheduling badly.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:11.220
And so why was the flight even too full? Well,
because they overbook flights. Why do they

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.430
overbook flights? Also, not enough people
didn't show up. And the flight was overbooked

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:20.750
because people often miss flights. So, finally,
we have that reason up at the top there.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.710
But then we can think about which are the
most important contributing factors. And we

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:30.180
can think about which arrow shouldn't have
happened and who should have taken responsibility

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.400
for making sure that arrow did not happen.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:40.420
So here is another example, which is why I
get fat. Now, I used to be a lot fatter, and

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:45.630
I lost 50 pounds, and I would quite like to
keep it off. And so I think about this. And

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.730
whenever there's anything about-- there have
been recent measures about trying to cut obesity,

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:54.480
trying to stop BOGOF deals on sugary things,
or trying to make people put the calories

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.980
on the restaurant menus.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.350
And there's always somebody-- I always read
the comments online. People say, never read

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.340
the comments. I say always read the comments,
because if you don't read the comments, you'll

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.540
just stay in your own echo chamber. And you
should particularly read the comments until

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:15.900
you find something that makes you ill because
it's so awful. And I do that every day. I

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:21.040
honestly do, because I think it's so important
to stay aware of what people are thinking.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.930
So, anyway, whenever there's something about
losing weight, someone will go, oh, well,

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:31.670
it's not rocket science. You just have to
eat less and exercise more. Well, even rocket

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:41.750
science is just applied maths. So why do I
put on weight? Well, I put on weight because

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:46.900
I take in more energy than I burn, which is
because I eat too much and because I exercise

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.660
too little. But it's also because of my metabolism,
and there are some things that change your

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.660
metabolism.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.540
So, for example, eating too little and exercising
too much change my metabolism, which means

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.090
I put on weight. So it's actually because
I eat too much and also because I eat too

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:06.680
little. This is already getting a bit complicated,
right? So my metabolism is that way. Well,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.080
it's partly because of genetics, and it's
partly because of sleep patterns, which can

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.929
change your metabolism. And why do I eat too
much? Well, I like food. But it's also because

00:24:15.929 --> 00:24:21.330
of emotions, and it's also-- let's see what's
happening next.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:26.200
I eat too much. It may be genetics and also
upbringing. Food is a lovely thing to have,

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.610
and we love eating food. And that's why I
like food. There's also social pressure to

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:36.040
eat too much. People think you're boring if
you don't just gobble everything up communally

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:41.750
with everybody. And then, there's also social
norms, but those cause emotions. So there's

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:46.770
also time pressure, so time when I'm stressed,
I get emotional. And I also sleep less, and

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:47.770
that doesn't help.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:58.240
And then there's also life. Life causes emotions.
But then there's also the entire food industry,

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.910
which is, if you think about it, there's a
multi-billion dollar industry that is trying

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:07.860
to get us to eat too much. It's no wonder
that they're doing really well at it. So they

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:13.120
do advertising. The advertising makes us eat
more. And the growing obesity rates fuel the

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.800
diet industry, because they all want us to
go on diets that fail.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.660
And this is all caused by money. They're trying
to make money out of us, and they've figured

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:27.440
out that they can. Moreover, when I do gain
weight, then I do all these things, which

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.929
doesn't help. So now we have all sorts of
cycles all over the place. So now tell me

00:25:31.929 --> 00:25:33.440
that it's simple.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:40.230
It is simple. If we become intelligent enough
to understand a diagram of interconnectedness

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:44.750
like this as one thing. And that's a much
better way of simplifying it than just saying,

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:51.140
oh, you just have to eat less. If you do just
eat less, then you have just deleted the entire

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.260
rest of the diagram. That is one way to make
this diagram into one thing. But a better

00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:01.010
way is to become intelligent enough to comprehend
the whole diagram as one thing, and I think

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.990
that's a better way.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:16.520
So I did, then, draw a diagram for the 2016
US election. A lot of people were yelling

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.170
about whose fault it was. Some people saying,
oh, it's all the people who voted third party.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:25.991
Oh, it's Bernie, the Bernie or bust people.
Oh, it's Hillary's fault. Oh, it's someone's

00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:26.991
fault.

00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:31.179
It's a lot of things together. And sometimes
I feel like it's really not that profound

00:26:31.179 --> 00:26:34.090
to say it's a lot of things together. And
yet, there are so many people trying to say

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:41.720
it's just one thing. So there is my diagram
for that election, which is one of the motivating

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.990
reasons that I wrote this book. Because I
was teaching in Chicago at the time, and it

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.260
was impossible not to talk about it and to
try and use mathematical thinking to help

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.060
understand the situation as much as possible.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.371
So, relationships. We've talked about some
literal relationships between people and the

00:26:58.371 --> 00:27:03.110
idea of relationships overall. I'm going to
show how thinking about relationships can

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:07.960
really illuminate some situations. And I'm
going to start by talking about factors of

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:13.050
30. Now, if you've read my first book or seen
me talk about my first book, this might be

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.420
a little bit familiar to you. But we're going
to take it further.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:26.230
So the factors of 30, maybe you can remember
what they are. They are 1 and 2, 3, 5, 6,

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:38.210
10, 15, and 30. Very good. You passed. So
it's not very interesting. It's a bunch of

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:44.440
numbers in a straight line. And we can make
it more interesting, I think, by showing which

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.730
ones are related to each other as factors.
Because some of these numbers are factors

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.970
of each other. And we can draw something a
bit like a family tree showing how they are

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.020
related.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:58.140
And just like a family tree, we don't need
to draw lines between two generations, because

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.050
we can deduce that, right? We don't draw a
line from grandparents to grandchildren. We

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:08.750
just via parents. So 30 is at the top, like
a kind of great-grandparent. And then 6, 10,

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:17.240
and 15 go into 30. 5 goes into 10 and 15.
2 goes into 6 and 10. 3 goes into 6 and 15.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.880
And 1 goes into 2, 3, and 5. So now we see
it's a cube, which is a bit more interesting

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.490
than a bunch of numbers in a straight line.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:32.520
We can think about why it's a cube. There
are lots of things you can do this. But if

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.340
we think about it, 1 is at the bottom because,
obviously, nothing goes into 1. And then,

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:41.540
2, 3, and 5 are there because the only thing
that goes into them is 1 and themselves. You

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.860
might remember that means that they're prime
numbers. So the prime numbers are at the bottom

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.860
level.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.510
And then, the next level up, we've got things
that are products of two prime numbers. So

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:57.390
6 is 2 times 3, 10 is 2 times 5, and 15 is
3 times 5. And then, at the top, we have 30,

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:02.400
which is a product of three prime numbers--
2, 3, and 5. So we have a hierarchy now that

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:08.770
consists of how many prime factors each factor
has. And I can draw that one like this.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:13.690
So at the bottom, we have the empty set. That's
the symbol for the empty set. And then we

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:18.309
have one-element sets, and then we have two-element
sets. And at the top, we have all three of

00:29:18.309 --> 00:29:21.920
the prime factors-- 2, 3, and 5. And that's
how you make all the factors of a number.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.230
You find all the possible combinations of
its prime factors.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:30.340
Now, maybe it becomes clear from this diagram
that it doesn't really matter what those numbers

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:36.640
were-- two, three, and five. So they could
have been a, b, and c. So now we have the

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:42.740
same picture but with a, b, and c instead
and all the possible subsets of a, b, and

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:47.700
c structured using the hierarchy of ones with
two things, ones with one thing, and then

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.730
no things.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:55.110
Now, we could try this again with 42 to see
if we understood it. So here are the factors

00:29:55.110 --> 00:30:06.880
of 42. They're 1, 2, 3, 6, 7-- it's a bit
harder, this one-- 14, 21, and 42. And if

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.560
we draw the diagram again, now we can start
from the bottom, because we've understood

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.630
the prime factors should go at the bottom.
That's 2, 3, and 7. And then the products

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:18.530
of two prime factors, and then the products
of all three prime factors.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:25.710
And what you can see, if we write it out using
the sets of prime factors, that it's the same

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:30.310
diagram. Once you've gone all the way up to
the abstraction of a, b, and c, it's the same

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:35.020
thing. It's just that we swapped out a five
for a seven in the middle diagram. And then,

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.900
to get back to the one on the far left, we
multiplied the numbers together that are in

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.900
each position.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:46.179
Now, there's something very crucial I want
to draw your attention to in this new diagram,

00:30:46.179 --> 00:30:53.640
which is that six is less than seven. Now,
this doesn't sound very profound, but if you

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:59.320
look at the diagram, six is higher up than
seven in this hierarchy. But six is smaller

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.660
than seven on a normal number line, where
we're just doing things by size.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:08.350
And there is often a situation where there
are two different ways of placing things in

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:14.600
a hierarchy. And the crash between those two
different ways is what causes tension and

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:20.370
antagonism. Just like for example, if at work,
somebody older is more junior than somebody

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.980
younger who has been promoted over them, that
can cause antagonism.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:31.330
Now, this has become very abstract. We've
turned the numbers into letters. And I'm going

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.299
to show you that there was a point to turning
the numbers into letters, which is it's now

00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:41.330
very much more widely applicable, because
those letters could be anything. For example

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:47.940
they could be three types of privilege-- rich,
white, and male. And then, at the next level

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.460
down, we'll have everything with two types
of privilege. So we have rich and white, rich

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.870
male, and white male.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:59.360
And then, at the next level, people with only
one type of privilege-- rich, white, or male.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.040
And then, at the bottom, people with none
of those two types of privilege, three types

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.470
of privilege. So if I put back in the missing
types of privilege for emphasis, we have rich

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:14.640
white non-male people, so that we remember
that we are including non-binary people. We

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.950
have rich non-white male people. We have poor
white male.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:30.350
Ah, yes, I'm using poor instead of non-rich,
because it doesn't fit sideways. We have rich

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:36.510
non-white non-male people. We have poor white
non-male people, and we have poor non-white

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:41.471
male people. And then, at the bottom, we have
poor, non-white, non-male people. So there

00:32:41.471 --> 00:32:46.710
are many things that we can understand from
this diagram. We've gone from a cube of factors

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.980
of 30 to a diagram of interaction of different
types of privilege.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:57.240
Now, the first important thing to notice is
that every arrow represents a loss of one

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.390
type of privilege. And it's important to notice
that this just means that if everything about

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:07.040
you stays the same but you just lose that
one type of privilege, then your position

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.360
in society will get worse. That's what the
theory of privilege says. It doesn't mean

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.929
that all white people are better off than
all non-white people.

00:33:15.929 --> 00:33:20.120
Sometimes, people who are angry about this
theory get really upset and points at some

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.760
super rich black sportstar and say, see? They're
really rich. White privilege doesn't exist.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.150
But that's not what white privilege is about.
It's about saying that if that super rich

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:34.160
sportstar were all of the same things but
also white, they would be in a better position

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.740
in society. For example, they would not have
to fear for their lives in America if they

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.870
get stopped by the police.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:47.410
Now, there is something more that we can understand
from this diagram. If we look along a row,

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:51.200
there are no arrows going between things on
a single row, because they've all got different

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:57.130
types of privilege. But we can think about
how much privilege they really have in society.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:02.780
So maybe we can think that rich white women
are actually doing much better than, say,

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:07.380
rich non-white men, who are probably actually
doing better than poor white men.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:12.859
Because it turns out that money can mitigate
for many, many problems. And so, actually,

00:34:12.859 --> 00:34:16.970
the rich white non-men are kind of there,
and the poor white man is sort of there. And

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:21.320
the same is true on the bottom level. But
actually, we can go even further than this.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.850
Because if we think about the difference between
the two levels, if we think about poor white

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:31.679
men and we compare them with, say, rich black
women, we can maybe agree that it's definitely

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:36.119
possible for rich black women to be way better
off in society than poor white men.

00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:43.339
And we can think about some extreme examples
like Michelle Obama or Oprah Winfrey. They're

00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:48.369
definitely doing better than poor unemployed
white homeless men. And so, actually, the

00:34:48.369 --> 00:34:54.279
diagram is like this. It's a cuboid. It's
not really a cube. And this has helped me

00:34:54.279 --> 00:35:00.349
understand why some poor white men are so
angry in society at the moment, because they

00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:05.440
are considered to have many types of privilege,
but they don't feel any manifestation of it

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.470
in their actual lives.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:11.579
And I think it's much more productive to understand
the root of that anger rather than simply

00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:15.410
get angry with them in return. And there's
a bit too much of just getting angry with

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:17.239
them in return.

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:22.299
So this kind of diagram, seeing these abstract
structures, can also help us switch contexts.

00:35:22.299 --> 00:35:27.069
So we can pivot between different contexts
that have the same diagram in them, and we

00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:36.150
can find analogous situations. So, for example,
in these cubes, 30 and 42 and rich white men

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.349
all occupied the analogous position.

00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:44.339
And we can look at just one type of privilege
relationship and show that the relationship

00:35:44.339 --> 00:35:50.099
that male people have over female people,
because they are dominant in society, is like

00:35:50.099 --> 00:35:54.339
white people over black people, because white
people are dominant in society over black

00:35:54.339 --> 00:36:00.380
people. And that's also like rich people over
poor people. And so the male people, the white

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:05.420
people, and the rich people occupy an analogous
situation in those situations.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:10.289
Whereas, if you think about the relationship
that male people have to female people compared

00:36:10.289 --> 00:36:15.349
with female people to male people, that is
no longer analogous, because the arrow is

00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:19.839
pointing in the opposite direction. Now, of
course, it is analogous if you go one step

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:25.260
further and you just say, oh, well, it's people
and other people. But is that a useful level

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.490
of analogy to go? Well, we can have a discussion
about that.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:34.930
But there is a sense in which male people
being prejudiced towards female people is

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:39.660
different from female people being prejudiced
against male people. And the sense in which

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.010
it is different is visible here, because there
is a power difference between them. Now, we

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.740
can then have an argument about how that power
difference manifests itself, but there is

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:51.650
a power difference. And in all of those situations,
when there is a power difference, it also

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:56.240
means that racism of white people against
black people has something different about

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.029
it from racism of black people against white
people.

00:37:01.029 --> 00:37:06.220
So there's another thing here, which is that
something might not be at the top in one context

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.990
but be at the top in another context. So these
things aren't fixed. We're all in different

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:15.779
situations all the time. And in some situations,
we're more powerful than in other situations.

00:37:15.779 --> 00:37:20.630
So when I'm standing in front of a class with
students and I'm going to grade their finals,

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.539
I have a lot of power over them. But when
I'm walking up the street and they're all

00:37:24.539 --> 00:37:30.140
taller than me and can beat me up, then it's
less so. Not that my students would ever actually

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.579
beat me up, but that's how I feel when I'm
walking up the street, that more than half

00:37:33.579 --> 00:37:36.930
of the population is stronger than me and
could beat me up.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:42.970
So in this diagram here, rich white men occupy
the top position. But if we restrict our attention

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:48.490
to non-male people in the diagram, now it's
the rich white non-male people who are at

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:55.170
the top. And in fact, we could restrict our
whole context to women, and we could use rich,

00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:00.089
white, and cis-gendered as three types of
privilege. Remember that cis-gendered means

00:38:00.089 --> 00:38:05.529
that your gender identity doesn't match the
gender identity you were assigned at birth.

00:38:05.529 --> 00:38:12.710
And we now see that rich white cis women occupy
the analogous position that rich white men

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:18.780
do in broader society. And this has helped
me understand why white women-- why there

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:24.589
is so much anger against white women in some
parts of the feminist movement at the moment.

00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:29.069
Because white women may be prone to seeing
themselves as underprivileged relative to

00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:34.700
men, because we all feel, everyday, sexism,
all the time. But on the other hand, they

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:40.440
don't remember how much privilege they have
over non-white women, and so people feel angry

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.859
about that.

00:38:41.859 --> 00:38:48.079
Now, we're all less privileged than somebody
and more privileged than somebody else. And

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:52.579
so we should be able to perform these pivots
to understand what it's like to be in both

00:38:52.579 --> 00:38:57.099
of those situations. And this goes both ways.
Because not only can we understand what it's

00:38:57.099 --> 00:39:01.279
like to be in an underprivileged situation,
we should also understand what it's like to

00:39:01.279 --> 00:39:06.950
be in a privileged situation. Not only because
of how other people view us, but also by what

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:12.490
it will feel like if somebody calls us out
and what a useful way would be to call someone

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.130
out without making them upset and defensive.

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:22.499
So here is a pivot that I have realised that
I'm able to do. As an Asian person growing

00:39:22.499 --> 00:39:28.410
up in England, as I did, I have less privilege
than white people because of white privilege.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:33.670
But also, I know that I am probably more privileged
than most non-white people, because Asians

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:40.829
occupy a slightly different position than,
say, black people. And so I can do this pivot

00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:45.710
where I can understand racism from both points
of view. And I think this helps me to see

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:49.410
things from other points of view. And so it
helps me to empathise with people who have

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.160
different experiences from me.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:57.119
So another pivot that I can do is about being
rich. Now, when I do the cube of privilege

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:02.160
and talk about being rich, almost everybody
puts themselves in the non-rich place, because

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.380
they all think that they're not rich. But
we're all richer than somebody, and we're

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.779
all less rich than somebody else.

00:40:07.779 --> 00:40:13.552
So, yeah, I'm not so rich that I don't have
to work ever again, but also, I'm doing fine.

00:40:13.552 --> 00:40:16.450
And there are people who are not doing fine.
They're struggling. They're unemployed. Maybe

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:22.089
they're working at minimum wage. And so I
can see aspects about richness from both points

00:40:22.089 --> 00:40:24.339
of view, as well.

00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:28.859
So here is the one about white women, where
white women often see themselves as underprivileged

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:33.150
compared with white men, and they forget that
they are overprivileged compared with non-white

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:38.369
women. And I think we're often prone to see
ourselves in the underprivileged situation.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:44.099
And it would make better conversations if
we can always pivot to remember how we are

00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:47.059
also overprivileged in other ways.

00:40:47.059 --> 00:40:56.099
So, finally, I would like to talk about intelligence
and what I think intelligence is. Because

00:40:56.099 --> 00:41:00.480
sometimes people have arguments where they
go, oh, you're just not being rational. But

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.670
what does rational mean? You're not being
logical. Well, if you study logic in maths

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:09.880
or philosophy, you discover that logic starts
with some assumptions, and then you deduce

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.660
things from those assumptions.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.279
You have to start with some assumptions. Otherwise,
you can't get anywhere. So sometimes people

00:41:17.279 --> 00:41:20.509
say if you are using assumptions, then that
means you're not being logical. That's not

00:41:20.509 --> 00:41:26.190
true. But also, if you only use those assumptions,
then that's not exactly illogical. You just

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:31.359
haven't got very far with your logic. So some
people say that they don't believe in gay

00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:35.880
marriage, because they think that marriage
is between a man and a woman, which sounds

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.609
logical, but all I've actually done is said
the same thing twice.

00:41:39.609 --> 00:41:44.349
There may be other ways of defending that
that position, but that isn't a very good

00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:51.559
one. But it's not illogical. So if I say,
I like this table, because I like this table,

00:41:51.559 --> 00:41:57.719
that is logical. It's just not very helpful.
That's not very productive. And so being logical

00:41:57.719 --> 00:42:00.930
is not the be all and end all of intelligence,
I think.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.549
So I thought about it, and because I'm doing
all these diagrams of interconnectedness,

00:42:04.549 --> 00:42:11.599
I tried to distill what I think intelligence
is about. And I think it's about being reasonable,

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:16.979
being not just logical but powerfully logical.
By which I mean that you're able to make very

00:42:16.979 --> 00:42:22.440
long chains of deductions, both forwards and
backwards. So you don't just say, I like this

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.890
table, because I like this table. That's not
a long chain of deductions.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:31.430
But if you can unpack a very, very long way
why something is happening-- which is what

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.880
mathematicians do all the time, because we're
trying to trace things back to their first

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:40.079
principles. That's, I think, powerful logic,
where you actually get somewhere.

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:45.940
So the last thing, I think, is that to be
intelligent, you should really be helpful.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:49.640
Because if you just sit around making logical
deductions that don't help anybody, I don't

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.680
think that's very intelligent. We can argue
about that, but that's what I think. So then,

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.440
what is reasonable mean, and what do all these
things mean? I thought, well, what I think

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:03.940
reasonable means is that not only do you use
logic, but you have some kind of framework

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.049
for testing yourself.

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:11.460
And this is a really important aspect of the
scientific method and mathematical theories,

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.920
that it's not just that we have a theory and
we think it's true. There is a very clear

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.630
framework for when it is not true. And if
somebody wants to say it's not true, there

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:22.369
is a clear framework for how they do that.
And there's a clear framework for when we

00:43:22.369 --> 00:43:27.099
should agree. So if they find a mistake in
our proof, then it doesn't actually mean the

00:43:27.099 --> 00:43:32.839
end result isn't true, unless they can find
a counter-example. It might mean that our

00:43:32.839 --> 00:43:34.740
argument isn't very solid.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:39.589
With scientific theory, sometimes people say,
oh, scientific theories are just theories.

00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:42.970
It's just some kind of statistical certainty
about things. But the point is that there

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:47.249
is also a framework for telling when you're
wrong. So there is a framework for deciding

00:43:47.249 --> 00:43:51.170
when you're fairly sure about something, and
there is a framework for telling you're wrong.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:55.229
And that makes it different from someone who
says, I just don't think the moon landings

00:43:55.229 --> 00:43:59.440
happened. That's my theory. It's as good as
a scientific theory. Because they have no

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.809
framework for admitting when they could be
wrong. There is no amount of evidence that

00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:07.200
would convince them they would think the entire
thing was fabricated. So if there is no possible

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.049
framework for someone admitting they're wrong,
then it's not really a framework. And I would

00:44:11.049 --> 00:44:15.369
say they're not being reasonable in the sense
that one cannot reason with them.

00:44:15.369 --> 00:44:21.799
So being powerfully logical, I think, is about
not just using logic, but having techniques

00:44:21.799 --> 00:44:26.970
that you've developed for using logic that
help you get further, such as seeing things

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:31.770
in an interconnected way, pivoting between
situations. I also spend a lot of time in

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.489
the book talking about grey areas and how
we should deal with those, because they're

00:44:35.489 --> 00:44:41.109
very difficult. Being able to see many different
causes of something. Being able to have ways

00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:43.510
of unpacking things back and back and back.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:48.789
And finally, how are you helpful? Well, I
think that to be helpful, you need to have

00:44:48.789 --> 00:44:54.350
techniques for being helpful. But very importantly,
you need to be able to engage emotions. Because

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:58.980
being helpful, I'm talking about helping other
people. And if we don't engage our emotions,

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.380
then we can't be helpful to other people in
as much as we could if we do engage emotions.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:09.219
And this works at many levels. It works at
the level of education, where if students

00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:14.559
don't feel things when they're learning something,
then it is much less likely to go in. And

00:45:14.559 --> 00:45:18.329
this is one of the problems with a lot of
science and maths education, that it's just

00:45:18.329 --> 00:45:22.650
a bunch of cold facts, and you're just supposed
to follow these rules.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:26.119
It's not the teacher's fault. If we think
about huge chain of causation, there are all

00:45:26.119 --> 00:45:31.660
these regulations imposed on the teachers.
They have to meet these curriculum standards.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.009
They have to prepare everyone for these tests,
and these other tests, and these other tests,

00:45:35.009 --> 00:45:39.680
and these other tests. And then it just becomes
all about a bunch of tests instead of having

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:45.890
feelings about what you're doing and seeing
the amazing stuff and the horrible stuff and

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.099
the surprising stuff.

00:45:47.099 --> 00:45:53.069
So emotions are a really important part of
this, I think. And too often, we pit emotions

00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:58.690
against logic in a futile battle. Because
if you pit emotions against logic, I don't

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:02.701
know about you, but I think emotions always
win. Because emotions just are true, and you

00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:08.249
feel them so strongly. If you're afraid of
something, then no amount of somebody logically

00:46:08.249 --> 00:46:12.869
arguing with you is probably going to stop
being afraid of it. Well, not me, anyway.

00:46:12.869 --> 00:46:18.180
Maybe someone more logical than me or less
emotional.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:24.980
So I subscribe to Carlo Cipolla's theory of
stupidity. His theory stupidity is very interesting.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:31.380
It comes in several steps. One of the things
he says is that every group of people has

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:37.130
the same proportion of stupid people, whether
that is children, adults, politicians-- maybe

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:43.259
more with politicians-- Nobel Prize winners,
professors, toilet cleaners, criminals. But

00:46:43.259 --> 00:46:44.880
then he says, what does stupid mean?

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.469
And he also says, oh, and the proportion is
always the same, and it's always more than

00:46:48.469 --> 00:46:57.440
you're expecting, even after you've taken
that into account. So this is how he defines

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:03.599
stupid. It's on a graph. And this axis is
how much you benefit yourself, and this access

00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:05.960
is how much you benefit other people.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:15.650
So if you benefit yourself but hurt other
people, you're a bandit. If you benefit other

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:21.349
people but you hurt yourself, he says that
you're unfortunate. So we could think of martyrs,

00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:25.869
as well, but some people think martyrs are
benefiting-- well, anyway. So this is where

00:47:25.869 --> 00:47:28.239
you help loads of other people but you hurt
yourself.

00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:32.570
And I spent some time doing this, because
I believed that that was the noble thing to

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:37.630
do. And I think that quite a lot of women,
and men of a certain type, also do that. Because

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:42.260
we believe that being self-sacrificial is
noble and that our needs come last and that

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:45.560
we put everybody first. But that's not very
productive in the long run.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:55.279
Now, if you hurt other people and yourself
at the same time, you are stupid. And so the

00:47:55.279 --> 00:47:59.490
final quadrant is where you benefit other
people and you benefit yourself, and that

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:04.960
is what he calls intelligent. And I agree
with that, and I like it, because it has nothing

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:13.480
to do with grades, qualifications, standards,
prizes, money, status. It has nothing to do

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:19.430
with any of those things. It's about what's
really important in society, in my opinion.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:25.960
And so, to finish, I would like to talk about
this, that what I've said is that logic can

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:32.489
actually help us empathise with other people.
We take the emotions out, but that can actually

00:48:32.489 --> 00:48:36.239
help us to understand how other people feel
more instead of just getting upset with their

00:48:36.239 --> 00:48:41.799
conclusion that we disagree with. And empathy
can also help us understand other people's

00:48:41.799 --> 00:48:45.380
logic. Because once we understand how they're
thinking, we can understand the logic from

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:50.279
their point of view, rather than just trying
to understand it from our point of view, where

00:48:50.279 --> 00:48:51.440
it makes no sense.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.160
Because usually, when somebody is yelling
at somebody else that they're not being logical,

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:59.380
they usually are. They're just using different
logic. And if we can find out where the logic

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:04.069
is differing, then we can have a more sensible
conversation, rather than just saying, oh,

00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:09.400
you're not being logical. And so instead of
a vicious circle, we could set up this a virtuous

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.710
circle, where our feelings and our actions
work together to help everyone around us as

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:15.200
much as we can.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:20.840
And so I think that abstract mathematics really
can help us with this virtuous circle. And

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:27.549
that is what I wish for the world. My wish
for the world is that we would all try harder

00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:33.470
to understand each other, rather than competing
all the time and trying to prove other people

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:39.970
wrong. I really think that abstract mathematical
thinking can help us achieve that, and I hope

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:43.630
that you'll join me in helping us all achieve
that. Thank you very much.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.890
