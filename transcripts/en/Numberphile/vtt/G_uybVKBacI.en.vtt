00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.319
So let me first tell you what a braid is imagine that you have like two wooden planks and then there are some strings

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:08.620
attached

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.849
In a neat row to the first wooden plank, and then they are all tangled up

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.698
But then when they arrive to the top they are again in a neat

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.159
Straight line where they started so like one goes to one two goes to two. Yes

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.609
So that's called a pure braid I'll only talk about pure braids today

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.589
It doesn't hugely matter you can also consider ones that that crisscross and end up somewhere else

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
But let me try to draw one that actually goes back to where it started from it goes from

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.779
Bottom to the top in between you have some tangled mess

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.119
So when you have some big tangled mess, what's your what's the first question that comes to mind?

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.710
How would you untangle it?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.980
How would you untangle it or can you even untangle it so sometimes you have a big tangled mess

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
And it's entirely possible to untangle it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.519
What does it mean to untangle it it means to make it into this braid. This is like the non braid

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.860
So how do you untangle something? So imagine that the strands are say made of rubber?

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.369
They are stretchy you can move them around as much as you want

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.249
You can stretch as much as you want, but you cannot cut them once you cut them the game is ruined

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.710
So the question is if you see a tangled mess like this

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.180
Can you make it into a an untangle? This has some practical?

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.409
Applications for example if you made this video a year ago, I had long hair and when you braid long hair, oh

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.869
Maybe I can show you on

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.329
just this little bit so the standard thing you do is you divide it into

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.049
Three parts this will make me look rather silly

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.769
And then you do this braid one goes over the middle one and then the other goes over

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.059
but became the Middle one and you just continue doing this until

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.959
You reach the end of your hair and then you put an elastic on it. Now it's not two wooden planks

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.899
But at the top. It's attached to your head and at the bottom It's fastened in an elastic

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.449
so the top and bottom are kind of fixed the same as in the picture that I just showed you and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.260
The good thing about that braid is that it cannot be untangled

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.590
Because if it could be untangled then as you move your head around it probably would become untangled and the one that I just drew

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.030
Probably cannot be untangled for example if you look at just the first and the last string you can see that those are

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.459
Like this, they are

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.540
they are kind of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.150
wrapped around each other in a way that you can't imagine untangling, so

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.739
Why is it that some braids cannot be undone when you move the strands around move the strings around?

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.959
What's the problem that you might run into it's that two strands catch on each other?

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.869
And you can't move them past each other without breaking them

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.629
So that's the main reason that some braids cannot be undone if the strands would just go through each other magically

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.459
It ghosts then any braid could be undone. This is in

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.298
Three-dimensional space that we all know very well because we live in it

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.219
I'm claiming that if you think of braids in four dimensional space then they become completely

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.509
Uninteresting the main reason is that if you have two strands in four dimensional space they can basically go through each other like ghosts

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.319
So why is that let me try to give you an analogy first?

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.488
So there's a little ant that lives in the plane

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.798
So this ant is two-dimensional all it ever knew was this

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:52.119
Two-dimensional plane that it lives in and this two-dimensional plane has a wall the wall is one dimensional

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.629
it's just a line in the plane, so this little ant

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.720
Can't go through the wall and will never know

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.258
What's on the other side of the wall it just hits a red line

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.040
It just hits a red line, and it can't go through it. What happens if One day

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.300
a miracle happens and all of a sudden the world of this ant becomes

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.480
Three-dimensional so all of a sudden there's height that day

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.430
The ant could just go up to the line and say wait

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.769
But this line has no height at all so I can just jump over it and discover the other side

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.679
So that's how if you add a dimension

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.250
things that were

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.670
uncrossable before are suddenly

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.880
Crossable because you can use the extra dimension to cross them

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.900
[Brady] is that assuming that when we kick up to the fourth dimension

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.149
Our hair doesn't take on an extra dimension with it?[/Brady]

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.660
exactly yes, exactly, so

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.340
This wall that the ant that that has kept the ant on one side of its plane

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.460
For its entire life when you added an extra dimension the wall didn't suddenly become infinitely high in two-dimensional

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.620
So that's a very good point

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.700
So let me try to show you why this ant picture is relevant to the braids and the fourth dimension?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.999
So you have a braid in three dimensions?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.960
And you can't untangle it

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.700
Because somewhere you have two strands that you want to move past each other and you can so this is one strand

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.420
and

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.839
Behind it. There's another strand and you

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.279
Want to move it past what you can't because it gets stuck on this strand. That's in front of it

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.410
Yeah, so what you want to do is to move this

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.419
But it's not working

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.419
Imagine the plane in which

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.150
this front strand lives and

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.710
this

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.130
Strand behind that you're trying to move past

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.980
Will only intersect that plane in one point right so that point will basically be the ant

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.930
So if you're just thinking of the picture that you can see in this one plane

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.830
Then you have the ant which is where the strand behind?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.719
Intersects the plane and you have this other strand which lives in the plane

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.260
And that's the wall and then when I try to move this strand behind and get stuck on this strand

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.830
That's basically the ant running up against the wall that becomes the hitching point of the two strands that becomes the hitting point

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.570
But if I add an extra dimension now this is hard to imagine because I mean the the braid is already in three-dimensional space

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:38.380
so then I have an extra fourth dimension you can imagine that extra fourth Dimension by

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.170
Imagining that this playing all of a sudden becomes a three-dimensional space, okay?

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.569
so if I add an extra dimension to the whole picture

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.170
Then there will be an extra dimension added to this plane

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:57.760
So in this new space the bottom braid can simply jump over the other strand in the extra dimension

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:05.420
So not in the three dimensions that it lived in before, but when you add the extra dimension it can jump over

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.260
[Brady}Could you still braid your hair if you were a four dimensional being would your hair have a new property that's still made it braidable?[/Brady]

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:20.320
Well it depends, so if I stayed the same, but I was placed in four dimensions then no

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.570
For the reason that I just told you because each strand of my hair is basically one Dimensional

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.269
[Brady] your DNA would probably all fall apart as well.[/Brady]

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.899
but if when I was placed in four dimensions

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:42.639
I myself became four dimensional and my strands of hair became two-dimensional then I could so I

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.009
Said braids in four dimensions aren't interesting and now I will show you why they are

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.069
The key is that it's not enough to Braid strings

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:58.439
I just showed you that if you're braiding strings that can always be undone in the fourth dimension

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.510
So I have to show you what to braid instead

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.249
You can braid something besides strings to show you that first. I like to show you a different way

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:11.520
To see just regular braids in three dimensions and since we were talking about ants

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:17.999
So you have some ants and I'm making a movie in which the ants start out in a neat straight line

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.790
and then they crawl around and

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.080
Eventually they get back to the neat straight line

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:32.609
I will film them doing this and then there will be a whole bunch of frames I could imagine just stacking the frames

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:37.049
In the first frame I have the four ants in a straight line

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.900
and then in the second frame

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.190
They will have moved slightly in the third frame

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:51.149
They will have moved again and then so on and so forth until I get to the last frame in which

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:57.210
they are again in a straight line and in between if I trace all the

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.090
Ways that they had moved what we got there is a braid okay?

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.599
so if I make a movie of ants crawling on a plane

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:14.520
Then that's the same as having a braid in 3D just by stacking all the movie frames on top of each other

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:20.699
So what does my previous statement mean in this context so my previous statement?

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:26.099
Is that braids in four dimensions are uninteresting? What would be braids in four dimensions?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.490
Well, it would be like flies flying around in

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:37.620
Three-dimensional space, and then I make a movie of the flies flying around and I stack them on top of each other

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.410
so the fourth dimension is the time and the frames of the movie each frame is a

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:50.010
Three-dimensional thing because they are flying in space, so what I get is braided strings in four dimensions

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.830
So that is still uninteresting to a mathematician for the same reason why it's uninteresting to you

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.960
Because it wouldn't hold your hair together. It can always be undone

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:06.499
So there's no very interesting analysis that can be done the only point. I want to get out of it

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.840
Is that you can think of this

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:16.609
Uninteresting object as a movie about flies and now I can tell you what the interesting object is instead of making a movie about flies

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.409
You could make a movie about other things moving around in

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.310
three-dimensional space

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:29.839
The one that I actually think about in my research is rings flying around in three-dimensional space

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:37.670
So if you have some rings they start out in a straight line, and then they can fly around in

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.820
three-dimensional space and

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:47.239
Eventually get back to the same position if I make a movie about this and take all these three-dimensional

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.650
movies frames and stack them on top of each other in four dimensions

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:57.919
I get something like a braid so your braiding tubes. As opposed to rings, tubes are two-dimensional

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.670
So you're braiding two-dimensional things in?

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.659
four-Dimensional space so wire rings more interesting than flies

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.430
I have some slightly mangled rings here. So if they just fly around

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:17.000
not interacting ever they are exactly like flies and they are boring, but

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.189
Since they are rings. They have a hole inside something they can do is

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.599
fly right through each other and flying through each other that's

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:32.750
Fundamentally different from just being flies, and that's what makes these braided tubes

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.900
something interesting as opposed to

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.960
Just braided strings which in four dimensions are uninteresting so they are allowed to

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:48.260
Expand and and get smaller and bigger as they need to further purpose of flying through each other as

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.459
they fly through each other they create the analogous kind of

00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:57.799
Tangled nests kind of things that you can move past each other right within a braid yeah

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:05.180
It's a Tube going through another Tube which would be impossible in three dimensions for a tube to go through another Tube without

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.459
intersecting it but in four dimensions

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:13.939
It's possible, and it catches the same way that strings would catch on each other in three dimensions

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:18.529
Can I only go completely inside each other or can they overlap like?

00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:19.519
No

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:24.739
they can't intersect so they are still you know there you can think of them as

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:30.709
Physical objects physical object they are not phantom rings the material doesn't go through each other

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.559
It's just the rings flying through the hole

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:36.079
inside the other ring

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:43.250
This you can generalize to any dimensions, so in three dimensions you can braid

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:50.149
One-dimensional string with a one-dimensional string one dimensions with one dimensions one plus one equals two

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:54.619
which is three minus one in four dimensions, you can braid a

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.690
one-dimensional with a two-dimensional, so that's the fly when you take the

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.300
Trajectory in time that is the ring when you take the trajectory in time. That's three and

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.880
three equals four minus one

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.779
you can also

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:10.860
Braid A

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.990
two-dimensional with a two-dimensional which is four which is bigger than

00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:22.969
four minus one and similarly in five dimensions, you couldn't braid a one-dimensional with a one-dimensional or a

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:24.660
one-dimensional with a two-dimensional

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.899
but you could you could do two with two or three with three as long as

00:13:30.149 --> 00:13:34.999
dimensions of your two strings add up to at least the dimension of the

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.049
Containing space minus one then you can break them together

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:45.888
Well in my research, I mostly think about one in two dimensional things

00:13:46.589 --> 00:13:53.059
Braided or tangled in four-dimensional space or the simplest thing of one-dimensional things

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.399
braided or tangled in

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.190
three-dimensional space and the relationships between them

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:08.190
So my favorite way of visualizing. It is is to think of it in terms of movies in three dimensions and

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.369
That is actually a little bit restrictive

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.570
because

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:18.599
Visualize the fourth Dimension is time and time only moves forward
