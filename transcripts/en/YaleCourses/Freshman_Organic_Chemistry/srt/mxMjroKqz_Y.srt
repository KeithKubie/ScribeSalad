1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,970
So we want the understand
defraction patterns.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,170
It's clear that there's some relationship
between the arrangement of the

3
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:14,150
electrons that are doing the scattering
and the pattern of the scattery you get

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,430
right at a particular angle.

5
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:19,580
There's a particular intensity
and it must be depend on how,

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,700
it must depend on how those
electrons are arranged.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,360
But how is the interesting question,
right?

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,670
So what we're going to do now is
look just a little bit at the,

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,830
no one figures this out.
In a real case,

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,280
people have written fancy
computer programs to do this,

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,500
but so that it doesn't seem mysterious.

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,290
I want you to get the
idea of how it works.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,493
Okay,

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,760
so the first slide we showed,

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,050
or the third slide actually that we
showed last time was made of a bunch of

16
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:57,650
these things we call benzenes.
That collections are six dots

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,870
and they're simple.
They're already all oriented the same way.

18
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:07,610
That's not very reasonable except
when they get regular and a crystal,

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,130
which is where we're going.
But anyhow,

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,460
if you have a whole bunch of
them but randomly distributed,

21
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:18,461
it turns out the intensity you get is
stronger proportional to the number of

22
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,120
them that are doing the scattering.
Right?

23
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:26,060
But the pattern you get is the
same you'd get from just one.

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,370
So that's why we use this funny slide
and this was the pattern that came out,

25
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,530
this thing that looked a
little bit like a snowflake.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,860
And I'd like you to understand why
that hexagon a dots gives a snowflake.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,920
So we take the hexagon or dots and what
do we look for to see where scattering

28
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:49,340
might be to see what, what's
the number, what the trick is.

29
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,140
The trick is to look at things
that lie on equally spaced planes.

30
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,070
Try to choose a set of planes so that as
many of the electrons as there are will

31
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:09,990
fall on or near that set of
evenly spaced planes. Right?

32
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,260
So [inaudible] this is two dimensions.

33
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:16,200
So we're looking for lines or
cross sections of planes, right?

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,650
So how,

35
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,650
how could we draw lines on here evenly
spaced lines so that all the dots will

36
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:28,810
fall on them? Well, we could do
it that, uh, this way, right?

37
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,830
So they're evenly spaced,

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,210
three of them and all the
electrons fall on or near them.

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,730
Notice they don't have to fall exactly on,

40
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,890
cause if they're displaced a little bit,

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,330
the phase of the wave will change a
little bit compared to the others,

42
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:50,070
but only a little bit. So it just has
to be near not exactly on. Okay. So,

43
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,230
uh,
there we have it now.

44
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,360
So that means that you'll get scattering
in that direction where all there well,

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,990
where they will reinforce one
another. Right. Let's, uh,

46
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,280
let's go back to the,
to the display we were looking at before.

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,730
Ah, here. Okay.

48
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,870
We were talking about this just as
class started. So a wave comes in,

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,490
makes these things all move up and down
the electrons here and here at the same

50
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:24,140
time. Actually let's make all three
of them vibrate for current purposes.

51
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,520
Okay.

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Now we're interested in what angles light
can come out and all these things will

53
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:33,230
help each other out reinforce one another.

54
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,220
So as we go here that and
look at that vertical line,

55
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,050
we see that they're not all in phase at
that angle, but as we increase the angle,

56
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:45,050
when we get to say here,

57
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,300
it looks not so bad. The top and the
bottom are actually exactly in phase,

58
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,280
but the middle one is exactly out of
phase and it'll cancel out the top one.

59
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,190
And if there were a whole
row of these, the the, the,

60
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:02,870
the second one cancels the first,
the fourth would cancel the third,

61
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,150
the sixth would cancel
the fifth and so on.

62
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,380
There wouldn't be anything coming out.
And now we go a little bit away from that.

63
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,630
And it's worth making a point here.
Suppose that this were a very, very,

64
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:19,580
very long line of scatterers.
Right? And the first two, let's,

65
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:23,000
let's get to this place here where
they're all exactly in phase,

66
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,730
that'll obviously very,
very strong angle.

67
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,060
But suppose we looked at another
angle that was close to that.

68
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,890
Just that just a teeny bit off.
So the first two are off by just,

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,430
you know,

70
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,260
one degree in phase and the next
one's off by two degrees in phase,

71
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,720
not much off.
Okay.

72
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,170
So are we going to get pretty
strong light coming out from that

73
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,283
Russell?

74
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,130
If it's a very long string,
if the first one's one degree out,

75
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,940
by the time we get to the hundred 80th
it'll be 180 degrees out or exactly 180th

76
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,970
we'll cancel the first one 181st
we'll cancel the second 183rd second,

77
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,060
we'll cancel a hundred we'll
cancel the third and so on. Right.

78
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,560
So it has to,
if you have a really long string,

79
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,310
it has to be exactly on from one to the
next in order to get them so that you

80
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:24,590
get something coming out
and what you get coming out.

81
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,590
Then we'll be quite strong because
there'll be the scattering from the whole

82
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:28,424
bunch of them.

83
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,693
Right.

84
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,910
Where does that, where did you
see that in last week's lecture?

85
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,270
Friday's lecture.
Right.

86
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,300
You saw it that you got very fine dots
when you had a really long row of things.

87
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,170
Okay,
so back to here.

88
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,183
Uh,

89
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,740
so there'll be things that are almost
exactly in phase and it'll be a certain

90
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:01,060
angle at which there'll be in phase
in that angle is shown by that,

91
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,580
the end of that Arrow.
And you get therefore a dot there.

92
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,410
And also by symmetry,

93
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,400
the other five of the six dots
as you could draw the lines,

94
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,050
other angles at the same way.
Everybody with me on that? Okay?

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,870
Okay. Now, uh,

96
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:22,871
so we look for electron density
on or near evenly spaced planes.

97
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,070
Now because it only has to be near, there
are other directions we could draw it.

98
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,220
So we get a set of planes where there
near but not on like here right now,

99
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:40,070
one is a little above the plane too,
or a little below the plane, right?

100
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:42,920
Or vice versa for the second line.
Right.

101
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:45,710
But they're pretty close and
there are certain spacing.

102
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,810
Now that spacing is larger
than the blue spacing.

103
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,050
Does everybody see that?
What does that mean?

104
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:59,051
About the angle at which the reflection
will occur or the scattering where

105
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:03,650
there'll be in phase,
the angle will be smaller.

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,120
So the, the part of the snowflake
that comes from that is here,

107
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,883
right?

108
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,070
Smaller angle because it's a larger
distance and you could see immediately why

109
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:18,710
that is. If we look at this
thing that, that if there,

110
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,040
if you look at the top to the
bottom where they're far apart,

111
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,220
the lines are far apart.
You get the first reflection there.

112
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,960
But if the line, but if the lines
are closer together, like these two,

113
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,280
then you have to go to a higher angle
in order to get that first one first

114
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:36,620
coming into phase,
right?

115
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,870
So that's that reciprocal relationship.
Okay.

116
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:45,410
So we get a set of six dots like that.
And that's most of the pattern.

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,860
But there are other places too.
You can see it, for example,

118
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,330
you can take those lines
in that set of lines.

119
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,830
Every, uh, every dot. The
center of every.is on a line.

120
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,190
There happens to be aligned in the middle.
That doesn't have anything on it.

121
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,530
But who cares, right? The others
are on evenly spaced lines,

122
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,280
right? So they'll all be in
phase where we'll that one km,

123
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,050
that reflection close in or far out,
far out.

124
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:17,810
And there you see it way out at the edge.
Can you see it there?

125
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,910
Just a little bit with the,

126
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,610
I can turn the room lights down
but I don't think it's worth it.

127
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:23,570
You can see that it's there and there.

128
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,470
And so there's six of them
out there as well. Okay,

129
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:31,700
so you got the idea of how by
looking for evenly spaced planes,

130
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,170
you can,
uh,

131
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,250
you can predict what the pattern will be
for a certain arrangement of electrons.

132
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,280
Now don't notice those
ones far out are very weak.

133
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,770
That's because although the centers
of the dots lie ride on the lines,

134
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,390
the lines are getting so closely spaced
that there's part of the electron

135
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:55,770
density that's not write the lines.

136
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,400
That in fact gets out to almost
halfway between the lines,

137
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,480
right at that part of the electron
density will be canceling.

138
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,710
So most of the electron
density is all in phase here,

139
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,750
but some of it is out of phase.

140
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,330
And as you get the lines
closer and closer together,

141
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,570
the fact that the electron distribution
is finite and not tiny points means that

142
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,700
things will get weaker and weaker
as you go to higher angles.

143
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,540
Okay, so there, there again,

144
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:30,470
we notice here that the closer
spaced planes you have higher angles.

145
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:34,220
This is what we've just
been talking about. Now,

146
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,930
when you take a slide with a
regular lattice of these benzenes,

147
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,180
then if you remember, if you took just
one, you get this snowflake pattern.

148
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,140
If you take a whole row across the top

149
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,410
right like that,

150
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,110
oh, pardon me, I meant to say that one
will be very weak. You can hardly see it.

151
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,220
What you need is a bunch
of them to cooperate to see
something that you can see.

152
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,700
Now first we could take
the whole row along the top

153
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,370
and and we're going to look only at
scattering in the vertical direction.

154
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:13,740
So I've narrowed in on the picture.

155
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,410
But if we take that
whole row along the top,

156
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,650
remember they'll all scatter in phase
at the specular angle because for go for

157
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,640
scattering up and down.

158
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,560
So now it gets more intense because
they're all cooperating for other

159
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,550
directions. They wouldn't all be in
phase from one hexagon to the next,

160
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,210
but for scattering up and down where
they're all at exactly the same level,

161
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,090
they'll all be exactly the same.
Okay.

162
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,700
Now suppose I had the next row.

163
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,970
Will they be in phase?
Well,

164
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:51,160
the second for the same scan for the
same direction of scattering up and down

165
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,130
where that top row is all in phase.

166
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,000
So we would get the
scattering shown here right?

167
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,830
Stronger than it was before because
it's a bunch of these things now. Right,

168
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,130
but still not really strong.
But let's add in the next row.

169
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,850
Is that going to make them
all stronger again? No.

170
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:14,830
Most of the time they'll be out of phase
from the next row for scattering in

171
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:18,580
this direction. Right. Most of
the time there'll be out of phase,

172
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,500
but for particular angles
there'll be in phase. So in fact,

173
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:27,790
what that will do if we
add the next row that we,

174
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,380
we made the picture of brighter,

175
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,810
cause we got twice as many
things scattering now,

176
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,280
but there'll be bars across it like that.

177
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,230
It's always the same pattern getting
brighter and brighter as we add more of

178
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:46,180
them, but at certain angles that are
in phase now and at certain angles,

179
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:50,470
they're out of phase from one pattern
to the next or from one row to the next.

180
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,020
Now, so what's going to, if we add
the whole sheet of them, can you see

181
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,180
Sam?
Ah,

182
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,400
they'll only be really precise
angles at which they all interfere.

183
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:13,140
Otherwise the hundred 80th will interfere
with the first 181st with the second

184
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:17,550
and so on, right? So if we add
the whole phase, the whole thing,

185
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,970
then if we look at the pattern,
it's going to be brighter, right?

186
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,400
But it'll be only at knots,

187
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,170
holy at very precise angles,
right?

188
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,280
And that's what we saw when we went to
this final picture for scattering from a

189
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,183
lattice.

190
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,190
So what this means is that the lattice
repeat concentrates the snowflakes

191
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:45,860
scattering into tightly focused
spots on a regular pattern,

192
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,503
right?

193
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,220
So this is the diffraction from
a two D lattice of Benzenes,

194
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,140
which is the same as the underlying
snowflake that came from just one.

195
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,610
But it's as if it were being viewed,

196
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:07,950
as I said last time through a peg board,

197
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,553
right?

198
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,630
All that scattering gets concentrated
into a few points. Very Bright.

199
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,940
And these are these regular points.
Now,

200
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:19,850
some people seemed not to
know what a pegboard was.

201
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:22,280
So I took a picture of a
pegboard over the weekend.

202
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,910
How many people have never seen a
pegboard before? Just to calibrate me?

203
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,500
Okay? Most people have seen
a pegboard, but you know,

204
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:32,830
you put it that you could put these hooks
in it and then hang whatever you want

205
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:36,670
on it, like tools or pictures or
whatever you want to put on your wall.

206
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,620
So it's like looking through the holes
in that at the snowflake pattern.

207
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,790
Now there's there two quotes,

208
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,800
spaces that get talked about direct space
or real space and diffraction space or

209
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:53,350
reciprocal space.
Okay.

210
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,950
So the crystal is the real
thing that you're interested in.

211
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,390
And diffraction photo
is in diffraction space.

212
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,830
You see these dots that allow, we
saw for example, for copper sulfate,

213
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,870
right? So in real space you
have a unit cell structure.

214
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,060
That is the thing, the pattern that
then gets repeated to make the crystal,

215
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,100
but you have the pattern,
right?

216
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,720
And that gives rise to this fuzzy pattern
like a snowflake and reciprocal space.

217
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,610
And then you have a crystal lattice or
regular repetition of these patterns,

218
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,080
right? And that's as viewing
through the holes in the pegboard.

219
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:34,963
Okay?

220
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:40,510
And remember that decreased spacing
and real space corresponds to increased

221
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,320
spacing and reciprocal space, which is
of course why it's called reciprocal.

222
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,880
Okay? So that's what we want to
understand about how it works, right?

223
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,930
There are patterns which give rise
to patterns and reciprocal space,

224
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:58,070
that buzzy thing. And then if you
have a repeating lattice of that,

225
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,710
it gets concentrated
into particular points,

226
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:03,650
but it's the same underlying pattern.
So there's the pattern,

227
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:07,490
which is the structure of the molecule,
and there's the lattice,

228
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,900
which is the structure of the crystal.
Okay.

229
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:13,850
Now let's look at the light bulb filament,

230
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:17,930
the last thing we looked at and see why
the scattering from that looks the way

231
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:21,680
we do it looks like this x with,
with dots along it.

232
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,280
Okay, so we take, we want to find if
there are electrons on this helix,

233
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,180
right?

234
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,860
We can find a set of evenly spaced
parallel planes like the yellow ones here.

235
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,980
So we'll get scattering
perpendicular to those planes.

236
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,610
And sure enough there it is that spot.

237
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:46,030
But we could also take a set of planes
and it goes not only up but also down

238
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,020
both branches,

239
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,430
but both directions of that particular
branch of the ex come from the same

240
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,650
planes.
Okay.

241
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,450
But you could make planes that are
twice as close to one another. Right.

242
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,430
What will those give rise to?

243
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,050
Twice as far out. The sign is twice as
big, actually. Not that actual spacing,

244
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,340
but it's, it's that one, the second
one out along the branch. Okay.

245
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,350
Now will that be,

246
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:20,351
do you expect that to be brighter
or not as bright as the first one?

247
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,110
Not Well,
uh,

248
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,800
there it probably will be not as bright.

249
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,800
And the reason is that for,

250
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,810
there are two things that have
to do with the brightness.

251
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:37,811
One is how much density there is on the
plains versus how much there is between

252
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,100
the planes,
right?

253
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,410
And we see here that say take the
original yellow one. There's a lot.

254
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,460
All of this stuff is nearly on the
plane and halfway between the plate and

255
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,250
there's not very much just a
thin cross section of the wire.

256
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,590
Okay? Uh, but as the planes
get closer and closer,

257
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,220
the fact that the wire has a
finite thicknesses thickness
means that some parts

258
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:10,370
of the wire, the same part of the wire
are out of phase compared to others.

259
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,380
So because of the finite thickness,

260
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:15,770
you expect it to slowly fall
off in intensity as you go out.

261
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,900
But you'll then get the third
one along the branch and so on,

262
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,560
and you can do the same trick
in the other direction, right?

263
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:29,180
So that's why it's an x. You can draw
this analogous mirror image lines.

264
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,610
Okay. Now what does the x,
the angle of the x tell you?

265
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:38,510
The x could look like this or
it could look like this, right?

266
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,430
What do you learn from that?
The angle that the x makes,

267
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,370
how tightly wound the helix is.
Cause if the helix, we're very right,

268
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,960
then the planes would be like this.

269
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:55,410
And if you'd grab the string and
the spring and stretched it out,

270
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:57,810
they'd look like this.
Right?

271
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,080
So the angle of the x tells
how tightly wound the helix is.

272
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,110
Tells the pitch of the Helix.
Okay.

273
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,320
What does the spacing
of the spots tell you?

274
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,090
Did you do the homework I suggested for
today that you didn't have to hand in?

275
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,480
Then you'll know what the
spacing of the spots tells you.

276
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,210
If you know the wavelength of the x
rays or of the light in this case,

277
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,240
what does the spacing
of the spots tell you?

278
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,870
Okay.

279
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,060
It tells you this how,
what?

280
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:34,630
The actual distance is between
successive turns of the Helix,

281
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,310
how far apart the planes are.

282
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,710
So it tells the scale of the Helix,
right?

283
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,630
The angle you get from the x,

284
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,820
but how big the actual helix is you
get from the spacing of those dots.

285
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,170
If you know the wavelength and the
distance that you're magnifying.

286
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:56,020
And in that case of the demonstration,

287
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:59,440
the distance from the slide at the back
of the room to the front of the room for

288
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:00,274
seeing this

289
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,390
and the spots weaken successively because
of y or thickness as we just explained

290
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,650
as you go on out.

291
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,490
Now that looks very much like a Rosalind
Franklin's B d n a photograph from

292
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:16,630
1952.

293
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,810
So we see the helix and
we see how how angled the,

294
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,660
the success of turns of the Helix are,
what the pitch of the Helix is,

295
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,090
and from the spacing of the dots,

296
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,350
we get how big the actual helix is.

297
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,210
But there's something funny,

298
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,810
it's the intensity doesn't just
evenly decrease as you go out.

299
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,620
It's instead of being strong,
not quite as strong,

300
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,900
less strong, weaker,
very weak. As you go out,

301
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,220
it goes weak, strong,
strong, very weak, strong.

302
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,830
Now why is that? Why do you get
such a funny pattern of intensities?

303
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,140
Let's look here at this uh,
thing again.

304
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:08,170
Remember where if we will look for
the first, second, third, and so on,

305
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:10,360
we saw that they come in and out of phase,

306
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,340
but let's suppose so it would be if
you have things that are twice as close

307
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:18,010
together here as in the first case,

308
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,250
what effect does that have
on the actual pattern?

309
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:26,251
We see the pattern we saw if we
had only every other one was here,

310
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,090
the direct beam. First
reflection, second reflection,

311
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,700
third reflection,
fourth reflection.

312
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,300
How does it differ if
we add one in between?

313
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,130
Okay, here's the first
reflection. Do we see that

314
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,040
if we have all three,
that's what

315
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,910
would've been the first reflection if
we didn't have the intermediate one.

316
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,830
Do we see a reflection here if
we have a whole row of them? No,

317
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,980
because every other one cancels
out so we won't see that one.

318
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,540
How about the next one?
Yeah, we very bright, right,

319
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:08,260
because there's more doing the scattering.
How about if we go to the next one?

320
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,050
No, nothing there. Cancel.
Right. How about the next one?

321
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,680
You perceive a pattern emerging.

322
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,940
What is it?
What

323
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,910
you see it and you don't see?
It.

324
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,830
Can you, can you say it in
a more mathematical way?
Suppose we numbered them.

325
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,840
The the one straight ahead. We'll call
zero. Then there'll be the first one, two,

326
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,440
three, four, five. What happens?
What do we put one in between?

327
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,280
Is One there.
This was one here,

328
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,710
right? There was one for the top and
bottom. Is that there? How about too?

329
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,910
How about three? No. How about for,

330
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,970
what's the, can you state at
mathematically Lexi, what do you say?

331
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,463
Can't hear it very well.

332
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,250
Which ones disappear?
The odd ones.

333
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,210
One, three, five, seven,
nine. The odd ones disappear,

334
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:26,630
but the even ones are still there,
right? If we put an extra one in between,

335
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,830
now let's think about DNA.
Here's a helix,

336
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,570
right? But what do you say
about DNA? Is it just the Helix?

337
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,300
It's a double helix. So there are two
heela sees. Okay, so suppose we have that.

338
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:40,720
They're the,

339
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,150
they're the success of turns and we
get scattering at a certain angle.

340
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,650
But suppose we make a double. He
likes now what'll happen, Lexi,

341
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:49,580
you're going to help me again.

342
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,050
How different will it
be if we have a second?

343
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:57,400
He licks wound halfway between the first,

344
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:01,520
he likes what will happen to
the what we are from one helix.

345
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:06,140
We had one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine with angles. Right.

346
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,590
What happens now?
Can't hear

347
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,110
all the arguments disappear.
Right?

348
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,980
So what would you have expected to see
in Rosalind Franklin's picture then?

349
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:24,110
Right. It would be weak. Strong,
weak, strong, weak. Strong.

350
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,011
Right.

351
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:29,000
But generally getting weaker as you go
out because of the finite thickness of

352
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:32,420
the wire. Is that what we see? No,

353
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:36,560
we saw the first one is very weak.
Strong,

354
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,560
strong, very weak. Strong.

355
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,560
Can you see any, how could
that be? What is that you?

356
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,480
Yeah, perfectly in face. What do you
mean they're not perfectly in phase?

357
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,740
There may be they're not equally.
Ah,

358
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,460
maybe the second one isn't
half way between the first.

359
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,690
The turns of the first
one. Right. What happens?

360
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,680
So the planes are twice as close there
and that would cancel every other

361
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:09,800
reflection. All the odd winds.
But suppose it's like that.

362
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,340
Did you ever see a
situation like that before?

363
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,050
Where what repeats is not
aligned but a pair of lines.

364
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,803
Angela,

365
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,280
the second diffraction pattern
we looked at was of that sort,

366
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,630
which showed the same dots,
but the intensity got modulated.

367
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,540
Remember?
Okay,

368
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:36,260
so let's instead of doing this
where we have equally spaced ones,

369
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,110
let's do one where
they're not equally spaced

370
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,860
like this. Now, oops, came loose here.

371
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,450
Uh, here we go. Oh No.

372
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,453
There we go.

373
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,520
Okay, now consider the top
and the bottom one, right,

374
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:04,521
which are in successive turns the same
helix and the this one is offset in the

375
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:08,670
middle, but consider just the
top and the bottom one. Okay.

376
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:12,960
There's the first reflection, the
second reflection, the third reflection,

377
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,200
the fourth reflection. Everybody
see between the top and the bottom.

378
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,580
Now tell me what happens if,

379
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,710
if I had that other one offset this way.

380
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:27,420
How about the first reflection there?
Is that going to be strong? No,

381
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:32,421
because the this one is canceling it
and remember there's also one like this

382
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:36,000
below this one. Remember, it's a
really long row of these things,

383
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:40,380
so it gets almost perfectly canceled.
Not quite because it's not quite.

384
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:44,550
There would be exactly the minimum and
when the first and the third are in phase,

385
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:48,360
the second one is not exactly out
of phase, but very close. Very weak.

386
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,570
That reflection's going to be.
Now let's go to the two.

387
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:55,380
What would be the second reflection of
the single helix there? How about there?

388
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,970
Yeah, the second one now is helping out a
little bit. Not Perfectly, but it's hell.

389
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,700
In fact, probably if you go just a little
bit further, maybe there'd be better.

390
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,140
But anyhow, there'll be
a reflection there. Okay.

391
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,910
Now how about if we go to the third?

392
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,300
That's as good as the second one, right?
And how about if we go to the fourth,

393
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,690
who would the fourth if
they were evenly spaced,

394
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:23,140
what would you expect for the
fourth? Very strong. Right?

395
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:27,880
So let's go to the forest. One,
two, three, four. What should it be?

396
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,630
Really weak.
And how about the fifth?

397
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,520
That's precisely what she
saw, right? Weak, strong,

398
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:44,070
strong. Very weak. Strong. So that's much,

399
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:49,140
this is how much it's offset from the
center in order to get that sequence of

400
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:49,974
intensities.

401
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,180
Everybody with me on this?
Okay.

402
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,770
So that's that repeated pair pattern
that we saw before and there's there you

403
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,060
see that that the outer coil of the DNA,

404
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:11,050
which has phosphorous in it
with a lot of electrons, right?

405
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:15,160
That's very much like this.
Like this helix. Okay.

406
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,550
Is much more electron density near
these planes than between them.

407
00:27:18,551 --> 00:27:19,660
Then halfway between,

408
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,660
but there's also much more electron
density on those near those blue plains.

409
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:27,040
Then in between for the same reason.

410
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,370
And that means that you
get those spots on the side

411
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,500
that tells you the diameter or the helix.
Okay.

412
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:41,501
And the things top and bottom tell
you the base stacking distance.

413
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,800
Let me back up just a second to
show you what we mean, right?

414
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,430
So there are a bunch of electrons here,
bunch of electrons here, lunch here,

415
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:52,220
bunch here, and that gives
scattering in this direction.

416
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,620
So all that information, the helix
diameter, the fact that it's a helix,

417
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:00,180
the fact that it's a double helix,

418
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:04,620
the fact that it's an offset double helix
and the diameter of this cylinder are

419
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:08,190
all easily read out if you
know what you're looking for.

420
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:13,290
Which crick knew because he had been
studying Heela sees of proteins,

421
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,820
right? So he knew about, he knew
from helix scattering. Okay,

422
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,520
so knowing the molecules,
electron density,

423
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,570
as we knew our artificial
sort of benzene or this DNA,

424
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,320
it's easy to calculate the
crystals diffraction pattern,

425
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:30,330
especially if you have a
computer to help you out.

426
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:33,840
But it's not an intellectual
challenge. It's just work. Right?

427
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,590
Using pretty heavy duty math people got
the Nobel prize for developing it or,

428
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,130
or a canned program.
That's what they got the Nobel prize for.

429
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,930
You can go the other way and go from the
ex-ray pattern to what it was that was

430
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:53,400
causing it. Right. What we did was go
from what's causing it to the pattern now,

431
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,390
but in fact you can go the other way
now when you press a button on a machine

432
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,840
and you get out the electron
density at every point in space,

433
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,130
okay, that's the, that's the
yield from an x ray structure.

434
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,910
Why don't you get the nuclear positions?
Why do you get the electron positions?

435
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:20,190
Alex can't hear. It's too, it's too heavy.

436
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,740
So it doesn't vibrate the nuclei.

437
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:26,550
So they don't function as an antenna
to give off the new waves the way the

438
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:30,600
electrons do. Okay. So you get a
result, which you can plot on a map.

439
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,710
Now in the olden days when I
started doing this kind of thing,

440
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,920
the kind of map you got out was a big
sheet of computer output paper and it had

441
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:45,741
numbers it and it that a given piece of
paper was a given slice through the unit

442
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:50,800
cell through the pattern, right? And
numbers were printed out that said,

443
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:54,490
what was the electron density at
that particular point on that level.

444
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,020
So you know, you had
uh, uh, x axis, y axis,

445
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,140
and at this point it was 75,
40 to 55,

446
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:04,240
87 or whatever the number is and so on.

447
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,480
And what you do is take a felt tip
pen and co connect dots of equal size,

448
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,740
right? And you'd get a contour of
that particular electron density.

449
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,550
And here's where that was done
for a particular compound.

450
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:22,810
This is taken from a book written at
that time by stout and Jensen. Uh,

451
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:25,750
and you drew these by hand because you
didn't have a computer that could draw,

452
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,640
it, could figure out where
to draw it and so on.

453
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,570
So here was here where Adam's in
a particular crystal structure.

454
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,440
Now that Pr,

455
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,170
then you had a whole bunch of sheets of
paper for different slices through the

456
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:39,220
electron density.

457
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,460
Stack them up right now sometimes the
particular slice you're working in went

458
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:48,700
right through the middle of an atom.
So you've got very high electron density.

459
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,050
Sometime had just barely touched the atom,
right?

460
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,950
So you see here that that one,
that Adam,

461
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,360
this particular slice was very near the
nucleus. So we got high electron density,

462
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,940
but that when the nucleus
was not in this plane,

463
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:08,760
so you just got a little glancing
blow at it, but you could make,

464
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:13,750
you could draw these things on acetate
or plastic sheets and stack them up,

465
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,040
right?

466
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,780
So this was the model made for the
first determination of the structure of

467
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:22,990
penicillin. In fact, the potassium,

468
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:25,300
salt of penicillin,

469
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,540
where's the potassium,
Adam?

470
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,680
How can you distinguish potassium from
nitrogen or carbon or hydrogen or oxygen?

471
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,550
It'll have a lot more electron
density. So you see it, all right?

472
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,790
There's the potassium,
lots of density, okay?

473
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:49,900
Now here's a molecule
that happened to be flat.

474
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,700
So it was possible to slice
through practically all the nuclei.

475
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,640
It's not a very common type of molecule,
but this one is Rubo few, Seren,

476
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:01,600
okay?

477
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,460
Now these contours are drawn at intervals
of one electron per cubic Kang strum,

478
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,630
right? So the first one is
one electron cubic Galveston,

479
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,630
two electrons per cubic costume, three
electrons per cubic instruments. So on.

480
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,130
Now there are both carbons
and oxygens in this.

481
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,750
How can you tell which ones are oxygen's?

482
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,790
Yeah,
you in June,

483
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,240
they should have more contour lines.
So if we look here,

484
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,470
we see that that one goes up to five
electrons per cubic construct. One, two,

485
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,630
three, four, five rings, right?

486
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:43,040
That one goes up to seven electrons
per cubic Armstrong. And so do those,

487
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,610
right?
So those are the oxygen's.

488
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,150
Go ahead and there's a picture of
the structure and you see indeed,

489
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:51,590
those atoms are oxygens.

490
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,570
All right? Now, uh,

491
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,020
what is our fundamental goal
of looking at this stuff?

492
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,190
What do we want to see bonds?
Do you see bonds?

493
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:09,620
What does it look like?
It looks like just a bunch of balls.

494
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,920
Just Adams. But there was Louis, right?

495
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,410
Are there electron pairs but
halfway between the bonded

496
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,940
Adams?
No,

497
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,700
it's just Adams.

498
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,100
Why are there no hydrogens?

499
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,530
Because they have hardly any electrons
compared to the others, right?

500
00:33:34,531 --> 00:33:38,430
So they're very weak thing.
Okay.

501
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,880
Now those are bonds.
You can see I'm there.

502
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,220
Where did those lines come from?

503
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,640
Angela? Would you say somewhat
true that, yeah, your drone.

504
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,050
How did you know where to draw
the bonds? Connected, dawn,

505
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,410
you connect the centers of the rings,
right? Those are the bonds. Now,

506
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,660
how do you know what's the single bonds?
What's a double bond?

507
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:01,620
What's a triple bond?

508
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,153
Yes.

509
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,440
Do you notice in that you notice in the
structure here on the bottom right there

510
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,070
double bonds and single bonds.
How do I know which is which?

511
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,360
Is there any way annoying
knowing Elizabeth distance
between the distance noble

512
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:19,270
bonds or should be shorter than
saying hold bonds and in fact,

513
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:24,250
notice that that here we have
short, long, and intermediate.

514
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,170
Why Intermediate?

515
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,870
Why do I draw a dotted line there?

516
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:41,640
Because we have this love here,
residents,

517
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,250
right?
So they're one and a half bonds.

518
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,840
Okay? But fundamentally what
we see our spiritual Adams,

519
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,810
right? No bonds, no one
shared pairs on oxygen.

520
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:03,880
Just Adams.
So was Louis Way off base?

521
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,090
Yeah.
Actually you can see the bonds with X-ray,

522
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,840
but you don't look at total electron
density. The way we're looking at it,

523
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,410
what you look at his difference density.

524
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,560
You see how different is the picture?

525
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:25,561
I actually determine from what I would
have expected if they were truly spec

526
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,090
just spherical Adams undistorted.
How do you find,

527
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,500
how would you make such a map?

528
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,140
So you have these pieces of paper that
say how much the electron density would

529
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:44,940
be at all different points experimentally.
How much it is experimentally.

530
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,890
Now I want to see how different is that
from what if I just had spheres for the

531
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,060
atoms?
What would I do?

532
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,800
I have to find out what the
spheres would look like,

533
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,090
what density they would predict at all
these different points, and then do what?

534
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,580
Subtract. Right? So that's
the difference. Density.

535
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,480
Sometimes it's called
[inaudible] formation because
it's how much the electron

536
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:13,080
distribution gets deformed
when bonds get made.

537
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,070
Okay? So you take the observed
electron density, which is from Ray,

538
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,750
which is experimental,
and you subtract atomic electron density,

539
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,830
which you calculate somehow. You know
what's very cool? Adams would look like,

540
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,940
we'll get to that next, how you would
know what that is. But anyhow, you,

541
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,490
how do you know where to,
when you're going to do the subtraction,

542
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:37,080
you have to make sure you position the
atoms properly to be subtracted, right?

543
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,190
How do you know where to put them?

544
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,020
How do you know where to
put your spherical items? So
that just attracted, yeah,

545
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,080
you put it on the center of
those rings, right? Okay.

546
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,910
So let's look at a case like this.

547
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:55,360
This was done by laser Ovitz and
Ziva Bercovitch yell and uh, what,

548
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,390
how was 33 years ago?

549
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,800
So this is an interesting molecule
because it has lots of different kinds of

550
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:05,910
bonds in it. Single bonds,
double bonds, in fact,

551
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:07,470
three double bonds in a row.

552
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,150
And also benzene rings that
have these resident bonds. Okay?

553
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:15,480
So we're going to look first at
one of the benzene rings. Okay?

554
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:20,220
So this map that I'm showing you
here is a difference density map.

555
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,250
It's the total minus what
it would be for the atoms.

556
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,430
But notice what was subtracted is just
the carbon density didn't subtract

557
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:32,340
hydrogens. So let's look at
the features that are big here.

558
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,990
This is how the electron density changed
in forming the molecule from Adams.

559
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,450
Okay?
So first look up there.

560
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,230
There's some very dense contours
right in the middle up there.

561
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,010
And that's the hydrogen which
was not subtracted, right?

562
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:51,240
So it's the biggest game left in town
once you've subtracted the spherical

563
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:55,770
carbons. Okay? Uh, okay,

564
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:56,940
so that's,
and the,

565
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:01,410
the total amount of intensity
in that region is one electron,

566
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,120
which is what you expect.

567
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,060
But now the total amount of debt formation
density in this region where there's

568
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:13,320
a single carbon carbon bond
is only a 10th of an electron.

569
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,730
What would Lewis have said?
Two electrons.

570
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,450
It's a 10th of an electron. Okay,
now let's slice that and, and,

571
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,280
and, and within the carbon, carbon
bonds of the ring, the aromatic ones,

572
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,810
it's bigger.
Why bigger?

573
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,550
Cause it's partially double bond in
the resonance structures. Right? Okay.

574
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,980
So it's 0.2 electrons for
those ones in the ring.

575
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,200
Now let's slice it and turn it so we can
see it's cross section and it's round.

576
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,290
No surprise there.

577
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,110
But let's slice the ones
in the ring and turn them.

578
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:57,260
It's oval, not round. The
bonds are not round. Why?

579
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,400
Oh,

580
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,940
because they're partially made up of
these p orbitals that point in and out of

581
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:09,440
the ring. Distorted
from being round. Okay.

582
00:39:09,441 --> 00:39:13,760
Now let's look at the double bonds that
are in the middle of this molecule.

583
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,540
Okay, first that one, we've
already seen that bond before.

584
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:22,340
That was 0.1 had around cross section.
But let's look at one of the double bonds.

585
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,810
Not Too surprisingly,

586
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:28,700
it has more electron deformation
density and at 0.2 right?

587
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,650
And the one in the middle
actually has 0.3. Now you might,

588
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,050
they're both double bonds. So
probably they look similar, right?

589
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,200
And in a sense they do.
If we slice the first one and turn it,

590
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,930
it's oval for the same reason as before.

591
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:49,100
There's a p orbital pointing in
and out of the, of the board,

592
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,570
and if we look at it below,

593
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,500
part of the bond is caused by overlapping
as we'll see of those p orbitals,

594
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,420
so it's got an oval up and down shape.
How about the next one?

595
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,150
If we slice it and turn it,

596
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,650
it's also oval in cross section,
but perpendicular.

597
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,043
All right.

598
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,630
What do you expect the next one
would look like? It's symmetrical.

599
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,120
It'll look like the first one again,
but here's something interesting.

600
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,160
That cross section of the middle one
showed the defamation due to the pink,

601
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
but not the defamation showed showing
due to those neighboring blue ones.

602
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,480
There's must be something different
about the interaction at the end and the

603
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:38,120
interaction in the middle.
Does everybody see that problem?

604
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,510
You might think the middle one would be
round or cloverleaf shaped, but it's not.

605
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:49,190
It's distorted in the in plane direction.
But to understand this,

606
00:40:49,191 --> 00:40:50,270
you have to be patient.

607
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,960
Wait till next week or later this week
when we start getting into quantum

608
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:54,794
mechanics.

609
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,170
But notice that it's as if
the carbons form better bonds.

610
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,910
So the, the bonds from those central
carbons at the end go up and down,

611
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:07,070
but the ones in the middle are in plain.

612
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:14,560
Cool. Now, how many electrons
are other in a bond?

613
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:19,950
So here we're going to plot how many
electrons vertically and how long the bond

614
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:23,860
is, which is related to whether it's
single, double, triple. In fact,

615
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,060
a single bond is there a double bond
in a triple bond? Have those distances.

616
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,280
Now, if you, uh, and in fact you
could also do a one and a half, right?

617
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:36,080
Those bonds in the benzene ring.

618
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,990
Now what would you expect this to be?
How many electrons? If you were Louis,

619
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,140
how many electrons would you have
in a single bond to double bond?

620
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,940
Four, six, three.

621
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,550
One and a half.
Okay,

622
00:41:55,551 --> 00:42:00,260
so there's what you would expect for the
plot if Louis was right, two, four, six.

623
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,210
Okay.

624
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:07,210
Now we can take this molecule that we
just looked at and see how much electron

625
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:10,190
density there is in each of those bonds.

626
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:13,610
And I've color coded it and
it looks pretty darn good.

627
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,563
Right?

628
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,110
Hurray for Lewis.
And in fact,

629
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,220
the people who did the work laser over
itch and bercovitch Yellen looked at a

630
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:26,430
bunch of other structures to and
added those to the same plot.

631
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,820
And they're not bad
except the scale is wrong.

632
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,630
Instead of being two four, six,
which I've fade it out here,

633
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,290
it's 0.1 0.2 0.3

634
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,750
so bonds are a very minor game
and the distribution of electrons,

635
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,810
Louis in a sense was sort of right.
There are,

636
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,370
is electron density shifted between the
atoms, the hold them together, right,

637
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:58,700
but much less than pairs of electrons.
In fact,

638
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:03,910
this amount of bonding density is about
one 20th of what Louis Bite of said,

639
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,960
but never did say because
he wasn't that naive. Okay.

640
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,800
So instead of getting to
you get a 20th of 2.1 okay.

641
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,500
So Bonnie density is about a
20th of a Louis. Incidentally,

642
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:22,290
the unit Lewis is used only
within this class. Okay.

643
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:28,070
So here's another example done by donuts
in Switzerland and these people who

644
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:32,600
were the uh, uh, Seiler and Shites
or who were, you know, Swiss,

645
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:37,601
who were the progeny of watchmakers
and people that do very precise work,

646
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,530
cause the do this,

647
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,150
you have to have really
precise experimental work
if you're going to subtract

648
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:48,260
something from something else and have
the difference be meaningful when the

649
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:51,200
numbers are almost precisely the same,
right?

650
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,230
Remember we looked at the total electron
density. You look just like spheres.

651
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:58,130
So you have to be really good with this
if you want to have this be meaningful.

652
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,030
And those guys are really good.
This was done what, 25 years ago.

653
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,860
Okay. So they took this molecule which
is highly symmetric, which is great.

654
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,230
Remember it's got its residents structure,

655
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:13,670
so all the bonds around the
middle or the same top and bottom.

656
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:14,990
Okay?
So we all,

657
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,740
we need only look at a quarter of
the molecule or for convenience,

658
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:22,040
a little bit more than a quarter.
So I'll blow it up here.

659
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,430
And there is the electron
difference density.

660
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,460
So this is how the electrons shifted
during formation of the bonds.

661
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,890
Okay, so there is a carbon, carbon
aromatic bond, a bond and a half.

662
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:38,010
And if you'd turn it and look at it,
it's the store did the way you expect.

663
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,030
Just as in the previous experiment
we talked about. Here's another one.

664
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,680
Same deal right now. Here
is a single bond. Carbon,

665
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:51,330
carbon single bond. What's it going
to look like in Cross section round?

666
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,660
Good.
Now here is a carbon nitrogen triple bond.

667
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:01,020
This is something new. What's it
gonna look like in Cross section?

668
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,810
Maybe like a cloverleaf,
Huh?

669
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,800
Like that?
It looks like that.

670
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,360
It's round. It's not cloverleaf
and it's not a diamond.

671
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,760
It's round in cross section,

672
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:27,000
so we'll address that later.
What's that? That's not a bond.

673
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,350
That's the unshared pair on nitrogen.

674
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,280
Well, what's special here?
What are we looking at?

675
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,540
We're looking at the
carbon fluorine bonds.

676
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,110
Does it look like the carbon
carbon bonds are carbon nitrogen?

677
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:52,030
How's it different?
There's no there. There,

678
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,780
right? There aren't any electrons
holding carbon to fluorine.

679
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,730
What the heck is going on?

680
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,830
Where is the CF bond?

681
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,680
This brings up the second
great question in the chorus.

682
00:46:05,681 --> 00:46:09,520
What's the first question?
How do you know? Right.

683
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:14,380
And the second question is
illustrated by this. A film clip.

684
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,480
Oh, the sounds down. What
caused the sound to go down?

685
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,780
Huh?
See if that does it.

686
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,380
Come on,
baby.

687
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,800
I worked hard on this.

688
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,130
That sounds familiar though.
Can you

689
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,790
I find it before class.
Did you hear it?

690
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,590
Okay.
I'll tell you what it says.

691
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,953
Do what?

692
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,240
Let me try this just to make sure.
It's not that

693
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:28,570
I can do it myself.
This is a disaster.

694
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,710
Catch some thieves. Harmson that's
what we're here for, Mary. Well,

695
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,580
sir, click, click, click, click.

696
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:48,880
What do you think of him
compared with what sir? Exactly.

697
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,380
Okay.
What do you think of it

698
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,910
compared with what's are
exactly.

699
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,970
That's the second question
compared with what?

700
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,890
In anything quantitative.
Even many qualitative things.

701
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:11,410
That's the question and that's
where we're having problems here.

702
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,120
Looking for the CF bond.

703
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:17,200
We already saw this question
when we talked about resonance.

704
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:20,920
Remember I asserted that
when you have residents,

705
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,260
the molecule is unusually stable.

706
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:29,200
What should you have asked
compared to what? Right?

707
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,191
In that case,

708
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:34,750
it turns out it's compared to
observed or calculated energy.

709
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,350
Compare.
The observed are calculated energies.

710
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,830
What really happens to what you
would expect if it were not resonant.

711
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,600
And we'll talk later about how on what
basis you might have an expectation.

712
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:52,930
Now we're talking about difference
electron density. So what do we compare?

713
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,010
We compare experimental electron
density or it could be calculated,

714
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,060
right? Cause we, if we can use
quantum mechanics to calculate it,

715
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,710
but compare experimental electron density
to what? What have we compared it to

716
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:15,400
what it would be if it were just
Adams, right? But what kind of atoms,

717
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,900
right?

718
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,070
We compare the observed are calculated
total electron density to the sum of

719
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:25,120
electron densities for a set
of undistorted Adams. Now,

720
00:49:25,121 --> 00:49:29,290
what's an undistorted Adam?
Okay.

721
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,840
Now to avoid Paoli problems,

722
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:37,030
and this isn't the time
to discuss what those are,

723
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:42,270
we need to subtract not an
unbiased spherical fluorine atom,

724
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,510
which if you count up how many
electrons there are on fluorine,

725
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:52,410
each quadrant of space around flury in
of which there will be for each quadrant,

726
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,520
we'll have one in three
quarters electrons in it, right?

727
00:49:57,521 --> 00:50:00,790
You multiply that by four
and you get seven electrons,

728
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:04,420
which is the valence electrons
of, of, um, of fluorine,

729
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,770
right? But, uh, if you,

730
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,800
but you can't have one and three
quarters electrons from fluorine and also

731
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,500
electron from carbon in the same place,

732
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,370
that's too many electrons
in the same place, right?

733
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:26,350
So what you have to start with is not
an undistorted spherical fluorine atom,

734
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,710
but a fluorine atom that's
prepared to make a bond,

735
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:34,070
which has only one electron in the
region where it's gonna make a bond.

736
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,650
So if you subtract the spherical one,

737
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,450
you're subtracting too much from
the region of the bond, right?

738
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:45,830
So that's why you don't see any
electron density in there. So,

739
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,010
and if you want to understand this
better than I've explained it,

740
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,130
go on the web and look at Professor Dunn.
It's explaining it.

741
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:56,450
We have a little movie of him talking
about this particular problem, okay?

742
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,501
But at any rate,

743
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:02,501
the conclusion of all this is that bonding
density is about one 20th of a Louis,

744
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:07,970
right? And it's time for me to quit.
We'll go on with this next time.
