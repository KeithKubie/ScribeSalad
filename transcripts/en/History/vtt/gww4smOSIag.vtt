00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.670
- All right, gentlemen, up next
is our weapons test.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.380
Up first, the kill test.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.500
BRAD: I think my sword
is a lot prettier

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.210
than Jeff's so I'm not really
worrying about the aesthetics.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.460
I'm worried about the sharpness.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.880
[rock music playing]

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.040
All right, Brad, the one issue
I have about your handle right

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.000
here, it did cause some issues
by rubbing against the thumb

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.750
right there.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.250
But, more importantly,
it is a sharp blade

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.250
for slashing and thrusting.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250
It will kill.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.540
Cool.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.670
Jeff, you ready?

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.210
Let's do this.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.580
[rock music playing]

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.250
Ooh.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.960
All right, Jeff.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.880
The little bit on the inside of
your basket hilt right there,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.750
it did dig in into his knuckles.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.960
But overall, it will kill.
- Thank you.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.460
Good job.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.580
All right, bladesmiths, next
up is the strength test.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.120
Ben?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.290
To test your schiavona's
basket and blade,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.460
I'm gonna punch into
these terra cotta pots

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.290
and then chop into
these birch logs.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.960
And remember, it's
not what happens

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.080
to the vase or the wood, it's
what happens to your blade.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.790
Brad, you're up first.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.960
Are you ready?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.750
My schiavona is
definitely ready.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.250
[rock music playing]

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.750

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.120
[laughing]

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.120
Well, Brad, once I started
chopping into that log,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.000
it was just going
the whole time.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.120
There is a tiny little
deformation right there,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.170
it's pretty narrow.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.000
You can hear it, you know?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.420
[tapping sword]

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.500
All in all, it's sharp,
and it's a good chopper.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.290
All right, Jeff, you're up.
You ready?

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.330
Let's do this.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
[rock music playing]

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.250
[pot breaking]

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.620
[chopping]

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.170
Nice.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.960
Well, Jeff, this is
a heck of a chopper.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.500
It's got a lot of
forward weight,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.540
it's a little bit on the
heavy side but not too much.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.170
In general, and in total,
it held up very well.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.540
Nice job.
- Thank you.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.880
All right, gentlemen,
this is our sharpness test.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.790
You slice the rope, releasing
the sandbag, then cut the bag.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.960
What we wanna see are good,
clean cuts through the rope,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.670
and clean cuts through the bag.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.620
Brad, you're up first.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.880
Are you ready?
- Ready.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040
[rock music playing]

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.580

[slicing]
[both laughing]

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080
Wow.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.750
Whoa.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.420
OK, Brad.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.920
On the cuts, passed through
the rope with no problem.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.210
This blade has a beautiful edge.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.040
A fine cutter, excellent.
Well done.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.000
Thank you.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.380
Jeff, you ready?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.710
Let's get it on.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.750
All right, let's do this.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.420
Wow.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.290
All right, Jeff, what
I like about your blade

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.380
is its look, this
industrial look.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.750
It's cool.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.380
It didn't slice all
the way through the bag

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.580
but it cuts very cleanly.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.620
Nicely done.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.120
Thank you.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.620
Brad, Jeff, you are both
extraordinary weaponsmiths,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.920
but there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.790
[rock music playing]

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.080
Jeff, congratulations, you are
our newest "Forged in Fire"

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.620
champion.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.960
Brad, unfortunately your
weapon did not make the cut.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.290
Brad, this is probably the
most difficult hilt design

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.670
we have sent any of
our smiths home to do

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.830
and you both did
a really nice job.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.170
We had to look at the
finest of details,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.620
and that was that rolled edge
you took in the strength test.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.670
And that's why we've
gotta send you home.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.000
I did the best that I could
and I put every single bit

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.620
of effort into my blade.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.620
I am just so close to
being the champion.
