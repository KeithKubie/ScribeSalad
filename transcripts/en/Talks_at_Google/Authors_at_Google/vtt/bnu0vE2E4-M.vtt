00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.580
MALE SPEAKER: "The Skeptics
Guide to the Mind--

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.790
What Neuroscience Can and
Cannot Tell Us about

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.570
Ourselves." The first two
chapters are about out of body

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.760
experiences, phantom limbs,
problems assigning agency to

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.610
our own actions.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.720
And Doctor Burton describes many
of the same reports that

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.410
are trotted out in the scores
of popular books on

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.960
computation--

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.150
on Neuroscience and
the brain--

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.800
more often than not, with
some of the unsupported

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.970
interpretations that are
floating around about what

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.320
this data means.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.685
He points out that even
reputable Neuroscientists are

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:41.570
as quick to fuel the public
appetite for disturbing

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.440
anecdotes and attention
getting soundbites.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.590
What Robert's book helps the
reader to do is to revisit

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.480
some of the many patient cases,
animal studies, MRI

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.710
recordings, from a different
perspective, offering

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.280
alternative explanations and
dissecting the way these

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.970
results are explained in
the popular press.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.990
And why so many of those
explanations are misleading,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.740
premature, and needlessly
theatrical, essentially

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.940
pandering to our high opinion
of our own vaunted brains.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.520
But having studying Neuroscience
for now about 20

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.350
years about 10 years--
excuse me--

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.690
it seems--

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.800
and taught a course at Stanford,
I thought I was

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.000
pretty savvy about neuroscience
and the ability

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.530
to parse out the true
facts and reading

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.900
some of these papers.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.260
But in several instances, Robert
helped me to recognize

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.130
how I had allowed language and
hyperbole surrounding the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.100
public versions of these
scientific studies to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.780
insinuate itself into
my scientific view.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.440
Robert's new book seeks to
exorcise some of these

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.960
comfortable and often
compelling, but ultimately

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.100
misleading, views of
Neuroscience It's

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.470
a thoughtful book.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.120
It's a really intriguing
and fun book to read.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.765
And I'm looking forward to
what he has to say today.

00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:08.665
ROBERT BURTON: Thanks, Tom.

00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:12.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.440
Is that too loud
or just right?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.210
It's OK?

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.580
Because I tend to talk
really quickly.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.320
I'm from the era where
you paid for the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.090
phone by the minute.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.240
ROBERT BURTON: And if you guys
have to leave now, this slide

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.840
sort of is the main takeaway,
namely, though we don't like

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.370
to admit it, the tools of
Neuroscience are not fMRI

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.620
scans and inter-cellular
recordings.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.680
The primary tool for studying
the mind, as opposed to the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.700
brain, is the mind itself.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.520
We dream up to questions.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.200
We dream up the experiments.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.910
We write the algorithms
for the fMRI.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.180
We interpret the results.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.230
And herein lies Problem A, which
we're not going to go

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.170
into any further, which
is the polemic of the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.420
mind studying itself.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.290
What I really wanted to talk
about today is to what extent

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.970
our own brains shape the way
we conceptualize the mind.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.750
Let me just start by asking
a simple question.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.690
How many of you people think
that the brain is the mind?

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.970
OK.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.480
How many people think the brain
emerges from the mind?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.100
How many people think the brain
is other than one of the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.190
first two possibilities?

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.540
OK.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.760
So what it amounts to is, as
soon as you ask that question,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.890
what you realize is,
what is a mind?

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.090
I mean--

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.060
the mind is not a synapse.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.010
It's not a neuron.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.400
It's not something that you
weigh, measure, feel, pet,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.530
stroke, talk, ask
questions to.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.760
OK.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.380
So what I really want to do is
talk about the brain as it

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.460
generates some of our concepts
of the mind and maybe to just

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.280
alter, if possible, the ways
we think about a mind.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.450
I'm not going to give
you any answers.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.780
If you think I know what the
mind is, the door's open.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.400
So--

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.370
but before we do that, I want to
see one thing to Google and

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.820
at the same time be the
background of this talk.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.260
This is something I
heard yesterday.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.950
And it was someone in the
locker where I work out.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.200
And he said--

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.930
and he said then, with a
perfectly straight face,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.480
there's so much information,
I have trouble

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.210
keeping up with reality.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.450
And what makes this funny, to
me, is that you're confusing

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.540
two concepts--

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.020
fact with reality.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.230
And reality is a philosophical,

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.560
metaphysical conundrum.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.170
It's not a scientific fact,
unless you believe that

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.170
everything is objective.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.660
And that's it.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.630
In which case, you're still
stuck with what are abstract

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.810
ideas, and so on.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.180
But the difference is you
have facts at one level.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.400
And you have ideas
at another level.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.600
And the real question in going
from the brain to the mind is,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.360
can you bridge that gap?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.070
So a second of background--

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.190
I'm so old that I started in an
era where people believed

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.890
in mind-body dualism.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.360
When I was a neurology resident,
one of the questions

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.750
you were commonly called on
to have to solve is, is a

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.470
patient's problem psychiatric
or neurologic?

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.490
As though there was
a difference.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.100
Now we've gone 40 years
down the road.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.890
And technology is obviously
spectacular compared to when I

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.400
first started out.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.880
But there's an inherent,
underlying problem.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.105
One has to translate
Neuroscience into a language

00:05:45.105 --> 00:05:47.650
that's comprehensible.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.640
It doesn't mean anything
to say that synapses

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.830
are firing at x-rate.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.540
You have to know what that means
in terms of experience.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.560
You have to have a language
for interpretation.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.260
But the language, ironically,
of Neuroscience is the

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.290
language of popular culture, of
psychology, of philosophy,

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.180
movies, et cetera.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.060
So in other words, when people
start an experiment, they say,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.670
I'm going to the
study altruism.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.710
OK.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.800
That's a great idea.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.670
But everybody has different
idea of altruism.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.110
Some people think it's
self-serving and other people

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.750
think it's self-sacrificing.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.260
But the concept of altruism
is not written in stone

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.030
somewhere, where you can study
it, get adequate data, and

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.240
suddenly say that data
represents an objective fact

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.170
at the level of the
definition.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:44.350
So the circular arrows I have
there are because there's

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.240
become a peculiar recursive
phenomena.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.570
As philosophy wants desperately
to keep up with

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:58.440
science, it takes the facts
of Neuroscience.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.500
And as Neuroscience tries to
explain Neuroscience to the l

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.080
they use the language
of philosophy.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.780
So you see all these books now
on free will, for example.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.300
Well, free will it's not is
not a scientific piece of

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.890
information.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.160
It is a concept that originally
arose out of a

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.430
theologic construct.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.800
So I was just talking with Tom
a minute ago about the

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.390
computational aspects
of the brain.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:28.060
So let's take the picture on the
left, which allegedly is a

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.420
reconstructed, three
dimensional

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.360
picture of a pain matrix.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.630
Now imagine that you have
someone who tells you that

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.600
their toe hurts, and you
have that picture.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.290
You say, well this corresponds
with the

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.400
person's subjective phenomena.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.910
Now suppose you have the same
picture, and they tell you

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.780
they don't have any subjective
phenomenon.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.150
Question is, how do you
interpret that?

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.280
Now there are loads of studies
on so-called neural correlates

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.110
of pain, including in
unconscious animals.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.460
Now you get into a real
philosophical, psychological,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.320
or metaphysical conundrum, of
what is unconscious pain?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.000
So if you believe that this
report is the neural correlate

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.860
of pain, was it mean if you see
that someone who says they

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.810
don't have pain?

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.360
So there are obviously some
major issues that have arisen

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.080
in talking about different
levels.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:31.290
And it's created and some
fabulous nonsense.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.830
And I'll just let you look
through these real quickly.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.150
These are all gathered
from good journals.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.590
These are not from
garbage journals.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.770
How about that one?

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.900
What does it mean to have
a site for free will?

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.980
And this one, I saw
this morning.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.450
And here again is the problem.
"Unrealistic Optimism in the

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.830
Face of Reality" is in
Nature neuroscience

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.900
article this morning.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.420
Or "fMRI Proves that
Pain is Real".

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.660
I mean, what else would it be?

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.850
But then it gets into the
definition of what is real.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.810
This is one where they showed
a number of women some

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.440
pornographic pictures, and
they weren't aroused.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.010
And they found an area of the
brain didn't light up like it

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.320
should in other women who were
aroused-- and therefore, the

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.750
conclusion, that the pain--

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.050
that libido problems were in
the brain, not the mind.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.360
And I'm going--

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.150
misunderstanding of the
difference between the brain

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.680
and mind, I thought maybe that
there were people having a bad

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.180
hair day or something.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.880
I mean the reasons are
infinite, but the

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.550
interpretation is
reductionist.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.440
This one was particularly
spectacular.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.630
The suggestion was that since
you can demonstrate neural

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:48.440
pathways or areas of brain that
light up for courage, the

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.940
theory is well maybe we can
stimulate courage through

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.550
trans-cranial magnetic
stimulation.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.520
But the one that really
stopped me was--

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.890
a couple weeks ago,
this one came out.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.260
Now does anybody think that a
baby five months old doesn't

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.230
have memory and consciousness?

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:14.020
Francis Crick once said a study
not worth is doing well.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.850
But nevertheless, this is what
happens when you're trying to

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.420
prove something beyond
the area of data.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.700
If they had said, we have seen
a certain neural activity

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.815
associated with babies at this
level of neural development,

00:10:29.815 --> 00:10:31.390
hey, that's great!

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.940
Data is data.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.580
The interpretation is
storytelling, which is really

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.230
going to be the punchline
of my little talk today.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.840
But it's not just humorous.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.790
It's changing our attitude in
ways that are fundamental and

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.600
kind of alarming.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.670
So I want to actually present
a clinical case to you folks

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.665
and ask you to make
the diagnosis.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.910
As you do, think about why
you came up with the

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.050
ideas that you did.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.510
Keep in mind that one of the
real advantages of the Oliver

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:10.770
Sacks method of neurology is in
observing the patient and

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.600
talking to them and get the
steps that lead up to whatever

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.230
ideas or that emerges.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.810
So the case was very simple, was
a young 25-year-old woman

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.240
who was in a massive automobile
accident,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.460
unfortunately had devastating
brain damage.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.820
She was left in what's called a
persistent vegetative state.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.730
She would open your eyes but
did not look around, didn't

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.670
register, didn't respond, had
normal wake-sleep cycles, but

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.000
essentially had no response to
her outside environment.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.350
And the regular MRI scan
showed massive

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.700
areas of brain damage.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.670
But not all of her
cortex was--

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.400
there were preserved areas of
cortex and other areas that

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.180
were greatly damaged.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:01.740
Well at the researchers did a
wonderful, technologically

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.280
sophisticated study.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.340
They put that they put
headphones on her, put her

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.240
inside an fMRI scanner, and
asked her two questions.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.450
One, can you imagine walking
around your house?

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.320
And number two, can you imagine
playing tennis?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.680
And she had been an avid
tennis player before.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:29.570
Now they then compared her fMRI
scan to normal controls.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.630
And they were quite similar,
given variances fMRIs.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.010
They were basically the same.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.680
So her brain lit up
the same way as

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.860
normal, healthy controls.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.880
How many of you people
would think that

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.130
she's therefore conscious?

00:12:48.848 --> 00:12:51.190
OK.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.270
Now let me say that she's
still lying there

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:53.990
unresponsive.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.510
And now what we're left with
is a definition of

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.810
consciousness.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.470
And how do you figure out what
represents consciousness?

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.270
Now I'm going to put aside that
consciousness can be a

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.440
variety of states from nightmare
to delirium to

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.320
confusion to they kind of
confusion you have when you

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.550
first awaken in the morning,
but you're still awake and

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.080
conscious, but you're
fuzzy in the head.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.250
So there are lots of subjective
states of

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.610
consciousness, not just one.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.000
It's not binary.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.530
And there's also the
problem of arousal.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.370
But put that aside
for the moment.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:26.190
And then so you start to think
about, well, how much did you

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.580
bring to unconsciously versus
when do you know it was

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.750
consciously done?

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.390
So there are two aspects
to that question.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.360
So the first is, we know that if
you're at a cocktail party

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.150
and you hear your name
mentioned, even though you

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.000
weren't listening, suddenly
you become aware of

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.950
conversation that you hadn't
heard earlier.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:48.420
Well I've done lots of studies
that have shown that you can

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.785
process auditory and visual
information even when you're

00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:54.110
unresponsive.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:58.410
For example, on the lower end of
the scale, when mothers are

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.020
sleeping and you present a
bunch of names to them,

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.680
nothing happens.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.650
You present the name of the
child, even though they don't

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.770
wake up, their EEG changes.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.820
You can present people in coma
visual representations of

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.540
their family, and their brains
and cortical areas that are

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.820
lower levels than the total
cortical area will light up.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.480
So what you're left with is a
fundamental question that has

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.860
not yet been answered.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.330
I'm not even sure it's
addressable.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.540
But it certainly hasn't been
answered is, how much of our

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.720
thought conscious?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.900
And how much of our thought
actually is unconscious?

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.790
Then the question arises, in
this day and age, what would

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.760
you say to the family?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:46.370
So here's what the authors said
in their article and said

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.620
the family.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.700
And my question is that the
correct approach to modern

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.600
Neuroscience?

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.470
Would that be-- how many people
would vote that that is

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.860
what they should tell
the family?

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.020
Wouldn't it make more sense to
say, we see that she still

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.720
clinically unresponsive,
statistics in this group

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.530
patients is the recovery
is relatively limited.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.430
But on the other hand, we have
this new information and it

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.750
may shed additional
light on this.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.800
And we need to follow this up.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.520
We need more.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.150
We need to consider this.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:25.180
But then what you realize is
what we're really down to is

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.680
again the problem
of definition.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.410
So let me ask you a question,
how many people in this room

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.110
think you have complex,
conscious thought?

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.600
OK.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.520
So let me just try and dissuade
you of that one.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.350
The average the average person,
even at Google--

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.410
so average for Google, which
maybe you shift the Bell Curve

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.190
over 52 IQ points, whatever,
still can only remember seven

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.780
to nine digits.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:06.440
Still if you take a complex
telephone number, you chunk it

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.240
into the area code, prefix,
suffix, et cetera.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.600
We can only remember about four
chunks of information at

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.550
one time, at one time.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.370
And that lasts for a minute or
two, so-called short term or

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.650
working memory.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.300
That's all you could
do consciously.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.570
You have the RAM of the first
computers ever made.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.440
And I mean, itty bitty.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.240
Now if you have a--

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.090
trying to do a complex thought
that involves, let's say,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:46.510
myriad factors, let's say like
global climate change.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.450
Now you come up with four or
five factors, like you got to

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:55.630
invest in Greenland
or the role of

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.500
polar bear or whatever.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.770
Then suddenly somebody gives you
another set of five, you

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.990
can't keep those five in along
with the other four.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.380
So it's like having an--

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.220
what do they call those?

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.069
Etch-a-Sketch?

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:13.450
Where you have to erase or store
that memory, in order to

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.210
put more in-- your random
access memory

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.349
of short term memory.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:21.339
Once it's in your unconscious,
it's subject to every single

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.119
bias that your unconscious
brain has.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.380
And you don't need for me to
tell you that that's the

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.150
subject of everything--

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.250
Daniel Kahneman books.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:33.240
I mean, it's everywhere we are
understanding the biases of

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.120
the unconscious.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.250
So what it amounts to-- once
you're down in outside of

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.110
awareness--

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.020
If a Blue Jay flies over here,
it may change my idea about

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.230
what is global warming,
for example.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.780
OK.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.270
Now let me ask the same question
again, how many of

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.470
you people believe in complex,
conscious thought?

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.110
It doesn't change anything
what I tell you.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.050
And that's really
what I wanted--

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.450
this is what of this is
going to be about.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.370
Something's wrong because we
know-- we all feel that.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.620
OK.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.150
Some years ago, I wrote a book
--five years ago-- a book

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.850
called "On Being Certain".

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:16.950
And in it, what I finally
realized is that, in addition

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.270
to having the computational
skills of your brain, your

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.760
brain has to notify yourself
what's going

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.230
on outside of awareness.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.575
So you take for example--

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.350
I look out at faces.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.990
Now, I don't recognize
most of you.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.200
But I recognize that
you're all people.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.970
I mean it that much--
or mostly.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.050
That's a pattern recognition
that's going unconsciously.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.030
But I don't have any sense
of recognition.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.570
But if I recognize somebody
sitting in the front row,

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.600
let's say, I will also--

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.690
my brain, if it wants to draw
attention to it, will say,

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.950
that's Peter Norvig,
let's say.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.790
So you if you think about
it, we have systems for

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.530
understanding ourselves
in our environment.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.160
That's sight, sound, so on.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.440
We have somatic sensations
for the external world.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.370
We have visceral sensations
for internal world.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.450
But we obviously must have
some kind of subjective

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.200
sensation for what goes
on computationally.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.370
It just doesn't go on--

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.760
it goes on in silence,
the computation.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.775
But then you have
to be notified.

00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:30.370
If there's 3% chance that I
recognize someone in the

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.530
audience, maybe it doesn't
reach the threshold.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.390
I don't notice it.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.280
It reaches 60% as
a competition.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.930
Not only do you get
the computation.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:38.490
But you get a message.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.530
The Message says, I recognize
that person.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.680
And then at 100%, you say that's
absolutely Joe Blow.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.540
And the same kind of idea
goes for thought.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.440
If you have a hunch, and it's
such a low level that you

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.440
don't pay attention to it.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.110
Then you say, I don't know.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.900
That might be right.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.680
That's worth pursuing.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.950
Oh, um, to an ah ha, which
is an absolute certainty.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:02.180
But nobody here can
generate an ah ha.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.105
An ah ha happens to you.

00:20:04.105 --> 00:20:05.740
It is a sensation.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.860
It is the same thing as an itch
or a pain, only it's a

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.680
glorious sensation.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.360
So what finally occurred to me
is that we have a number of

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:20.270
involuntary mental sensations
that generate much of what we

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.260
experience is a mind.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.480
Let's put aside emotions and
moods and a small amount

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.680
memory that we can have
in random access.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.780
But when I asked you the
question about how many people

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.920
think you still complex
conscious thought.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.900
The question is why?

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.410
Because we experience it.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:40.530
So we're having an experience.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.490
So let me ask you--

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.270
put it another way.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:48.340
What if you go to bed at night,
and you're trying to

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.030
remember Charlie Brown's name,
and you can't remember it.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.810
Wake up in the morning,
and you remember it.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.990
And you say, it just
occurred me.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.240
It popped into my mind,
whatever you say.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.710
You have no sensation of
thinking, is that correct?

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:02.640
It just occurs to you.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.220
That's why people talk about
muses and so on.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.690
But if you try really hard to
remember Charlie Brown's name,

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.180
you have a sense of effort.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.850
You have a sense that you're
thinking about it.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.930
So the real question is, is
brain working differently

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.700
under those two circumstances?

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.180
And how would you know?

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.410
It seems unlikely that your
heart beats differently when

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.260
you feel it beating than
if and when you don't.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.390
By the same token, it seems
unlikely that your brain would

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.730
have a mechanism where it
switches back and forth.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.740
If you're aware of it,
it works in one way.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.520
And if you're not aware of
it, it works completely

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.840
differently.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.360
So what's the difference?

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.040
The difference is the way
you feel about it.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.340
So if you're trying to study a
really hard calculus problem,

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.030
and you feel like you're
putting a lot

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.890
of effort into it.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.520
So you say, I study
really hard.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.710
I thought really hard
about that.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.300
But suppose you wake up in the
morning with the answer to

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.300
that problem, you don't have
any sense of effort at all.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:58.910
None.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.020
So if you go back to the diagram
previously about

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.390
little, small nubbin of purely
conscious thought, but it's

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.260
all we experience.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.965
That's how we think we all
have conscious, complex

00:22:10.965 --> 00:22:13.590
thought, irrespective
of what you might

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.203
surmise from the data.

00:22:15.203 --> 00:22:16.030
OK?

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.010
And my one point is they
are different.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.570
There are the sensory
phenomena.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.750
And there are the
computations.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.110
And just as an aside, for those
people who are of the

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.050
old school and have studied
the Chinese box experiment

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.040
about whether AI has--

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:37.000
whether a computer can really
understand, is a confusion

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.540
about the difference between
computation and sensation.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.730
Computers do really great
at whatever they do.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.970
It's in the semantics of
understanding that they don't

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.760
have the sensory phenomena
that gives us a sense of

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.160
understanding.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.600
But they may come up with
the same net result.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.160
And it may well surpass us.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.190
So you have two aspects.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.840
If you think about AI,
that's computation.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.570
If you think that the future
of AI, if you want to make

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:07.030
true robots are human beings,
you'll have figure out what

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.250
the sensory phenomena are.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.400
And that's really the hard
problem of consciousness.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.360
Whether we can ever
get there--

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.720
you can debate about that.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.140
But unless you're clairvoyant,
I can't tell you

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.410
which is more likely.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:23.710
So if you think about it, it's
not just pattern recognition

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.330
equals recognition sensation.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.440
But there are a whole
host of sensations.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.720
Feeling and knowing,
I just mentioned.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.000
What I'd like to just start
with something that we all

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.080
know but kind of deny.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.720
We have physical dimensions
of a sense of self.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.050
For example, if I stimulate a
certain area of the brain, I

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.380
can create out of
body sensations.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.240
This can happen with people
with brain tumors, with

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.530
certain forms epilepsy.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.740
What it amounts to those we
can actually, with virtual

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.420
reality, shift one's own
personal sense of self.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.340
Because our sense of self comes
from our lives, in terms

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.700
of where we think
we're located.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.810
So if you look out at the world,
you're seeing it from

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.350
wherever perspective
of your eye.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.680
Now if I put a virtual reality
apparatus on your eyes, but

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.840
then have the camera start from
a different position,

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.170
like from the vantage point of
a nearby mannequin, people

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.910
will feel that they are located
inside the mannequin.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.580
And then you can come up to that
mannequin with a knife

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.060
and try and stab
the mannequin.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.250
And the person will actually
experience increased heart

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.470
rate, sweating, and a feeling
of anxiety because he

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.150
actually-- even though he
knows, cognitively, that

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.600
that's not him, he can't control
the feeling that he's

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.150
actually inside the mannequin.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:42.920
So these body swap illusion's
clearly tell you that the

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.515
brain creates a physical
sense of self.

00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:48.940
It's an involuntary sensation.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.080
Also creates a sense
of ownership--

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.830
and by ownership, I mean, if you
raise your arm like this

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.310
you feel like you've done
it voluntarily and

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.850
that it's your arm.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.970
If you go to a doctor's office,
and he raises your

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.850
arm, it's still your arm.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.480
But you no long feel that
you did it yourself.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.924
We have very good body
part recognition.

00:25:12.924 --> 00:25:16.800
If we have good recognition for
our body parts, then we

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.810
also have a sense of ownership
of our mind.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.730
It's my mind.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.450
And these are my thoughts.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.410
We can't get away from the
fact and when we have a

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.780
thought, we thought we thought
it, because of the feelings.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.990
We can have a feeling that
since we have a sense of

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:35.010
agency that we generated the
thought, and that a sense of

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:39.720
agency is part of what makes
Thought A feel like it

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.310
generates Thought B.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:48.100
Now it's hard to say this and
fully accept this because all

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.830
we experience is Thought A
causes Thought B. So even

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.960
while I'm talking to you here, I
believe that I'm making some

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:01.700
clever set sentences following
a linear fashion But if you

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.380
think about it, the brain
works in parallel.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.820
Myriad things going
on simultaneously.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.550
So Mike's sensation of a linear
thought may actually be

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:15.540
a misrepresentation, what
is occurring at

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.920
an unconscious level.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.680
But let me go on.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.860
So if you have a sense of
ownership of your body parts

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.490
and a constrained
physical self--

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.420
they've even shown, for example,
that if you have

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.315
damage to your amygdala, it will
change how close you can

00:26:32.315 --> 00:26:33.150
get to other people.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.500
If you have damage to you
amygdala, instead-- our normal

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.650
interpersonal distance of other
people's a few feet.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.540
People who have these
damaged--

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:45.420
they have no sense
of restriction.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.820
Similarly, there are kids with
Williams syndrome, which is a

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.180
genetic disorder, with this--

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.340
and they don't have a
sense of distance.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:57.940
So we have sense of a body and
involuntarily generated sense

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.450
of self, distance from other
people, sense of agency, sense

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:08.620
of body ownership, sense of that
we're thinking, agency

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.080
choice and causation.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.330
And I go into some detail.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.590
I really have time today
to go into it.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.090
Basically, these constitute
the cognitive mental

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.600
sensations that make up what we

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.260
experience when we're thinking.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.850
And the fundamental paradox
is that these involuntary

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.415
mechanisms give you a sense of
a unique, willful self in

00:27:29.415 --> 00:27:32.440
action, thinking, making
deliberate choices,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.450
determining causation.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.420
Now this is hard to swallow
at first glance.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.040
Because it goes against
everything we believe as

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.240
rational man.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.330
But the evidence is, in my mind,
is really staggering.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:47.915
So it's at least worth
considering.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:55.240
So if you think about it, what
do we experience when where we

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.900
experience thoughts from the
standpoint that I mentioned?

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.030
We have perceptions.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.490
We have emotions and moods.

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:04.400
That's it.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:10.700
And that is the tool that
is studying the mind.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.780
That is the mind that's trying
to study itself.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:20.130
And if you think about it from
a standpoint that you're

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:24.680
driving down the road of life,
we have what you might think

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.370
of as a mental dashboard.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:31.260
Some people are born skeptics,
like myself.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.440
And other people are
know-it-alls, who seem like

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.170
they have the answer
for everything.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.580
And we can argue that all the
personality traits that might

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.620
go into the difference.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.290
But the fact of the matter is
I don't get very often a

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.250
feeling of knowing.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.400
I know that even when I write
this book, and I think, oh,

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.160
isn't this clever.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.130
I pick it up the next day.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.550
And I say, is that right?

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:55.530
I mean, there's something
elusive about that feeling of

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.790
understanding that I don't
particularly have.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.500
Other people, I'm sure you've
heard them stand up here and

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.590
say, this is the way it is.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.070
And they dogmatically say,
there isn't any other

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.370
possibility.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.330
And we've always attribute that
to psychological maladies

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.430
and arrogance and so on.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:14.400
But the fact of matter is it may
well be at least in part,

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:20.080
if not primarily, because at
a different tweaking of how

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.570
strongly your mental sensations
various varieties I

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.830
mentioned come into play.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.810
Now you can think of this
from another standpoint.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:31.010
You think of optimism,
pessimism, risk-reward.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.690
Some people are risk aversives
Other people are not.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:38.470
And if you take the studies on
identical twins raised apart,

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:42.490
what you find out is that a good
percentage, over 50% of

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.360
the character traits are shared
irrespective of no

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:46.990
environment.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.200
So it's nature plus nurture.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.280
But there's a considerable
degree sharing

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.420
of personality traits.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:58.480
If you consider these
involuntary mental sensations

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.880
as of another form of
personality traits, you start

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.150
to see, get a picture, for each
of us is comprised of

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.260
different senses of agency or
your feelings of causation.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:13.420
For example, somebody takes
melatonin and goes to sleep.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.370
And they wake in the morning
and say, I got

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.350
this new wonder drug.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:18.570
It cures sleeplessness.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.950
Someone says, I took
melatonin.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:21.030
I went to sleep.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.430
I don't know if they're
related.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.390
And you always think, well, the
guy that made a conclusion

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.770
based on an n of
1 is an idiot.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.820
But it doesn't work
quite like that.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.520
They actually have that very
strong feeling that's how--

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.280
of causation.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.010
That a lead to b led to c, where
someone doesn't have it.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:45.200
So if you think about people in
general, each one of us is

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.860
a mixture of all of these
various traits in different

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.460
proportions.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.430
If you imagine we have dials or
different settings, we're

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.870
all different.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:56.340
And it explains some of the
enormous difficulty in

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.730
communication with each other.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:02.150
Because you have to be at the
same level of a certain thing.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:05.130
If you take a know-it-all and
the skeptic, they have nothing

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.440
to talk about.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.250
They just--

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.180
They can't communicate.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.590
So if you think about these
involuntary mental sensations,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:16.340
you come with a another way
of thinking about a lot of

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.140
different kinds of mental
illness also.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:22.860
For example, in people with
obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.360
they turn off the gas.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.015
They walk out the door and say,
whoops, I'm not sure I

00:31:28.015 --> 00:31:29.490
turned off the gas.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.735
So they come back in the room
turn off the gas again on the

00:31:32.735 --> 00:31:36.320
stove, do it four or five times,
10 times, 20 times.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.040
They can never be satisfied that
the gas is turned off.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.240
You say to them,
look, it's off.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.060
The dial is off.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:43.560
There's no--

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.630
And they can't stop.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.300
And what you realize is that
they have no sensation of

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.800
knowing whatsoever.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.260
They can't know it
Even though--

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.110
at the level of feeling.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.590
They know it at the level
of cognition.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:59.270
And it's this discrepancy that
you see in so many so-called

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.450
mental disorders.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.890
You see it in the opposite,
people with delusional states

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:07.000
that are convinced that
something's wrong or that the

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.640
Martian have tapped
into their Wi-Fi.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.920
It's very hard to dissuade them
because it's a feeling

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.830
of, on the other extreme,
a feeling of certainty.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:22.060
But even the body schema image
disorders, which we sort of

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.780
understand, but we kind of
attribute to psychological

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.370
factors, whether or not
that's true or not

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.050
--it may well be true--

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.990
but the bottom line is it ends
up as a problem of your

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.270
representational map.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.090
For example, a couple weeks
ago, they showed an

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:39.590
interesting study that if I walk
through a doorway when it

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:44.260
is only 25% wider that I am, I
will start to turn sideways

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.580
just to avoid bumping
into something.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.210
But people with anorexia
do this when it's

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.090
between 40 and 50% wider.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.370
They actually see themselves
as bigger.

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.310
And I was talking to a woman,
recently, who were--

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.330
bariatric surgeon.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.160
She said you can take the
weight off but you can't

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.490
change the body image.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:04.640
So you start to see is feelings
about the self are

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.800
deeply ingrained.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.720
And they are the starting point
for thinking of the mind

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.500
as an experience.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.950
Now as we go forward in
Neuroscience, we will--

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.886
brain will become progressively
unraveled.

00:33:20.886 --> 00:33:22.710
Our mind's unraveling for
different reasons.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:25.760
But I mean the knowledge
about the brain.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.810
But as concept it's--

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.800
whatever we think about the
mind is generated by these

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.590
experiences.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.320
That is part of the fundamental
problem.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.760
That's why I showed the first
slide of the mind trying to

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.560
conceive of itself.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.720
Because we've got involuntary
aspects of brain function that

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.250
are shaping the very way we
think about the mind.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:52.080
Now, I want to just give
you a quick example.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.720
When I asked you the question
before, is the brain, is the

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.220
mind just a brain, or did it
emerge from the brain?

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.350
Most people feel that it's
one or the other.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.200
And I think only a couple people
raised their hand,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.250
saying that it's more
than the brain.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.960
Now it's true that everything
we do emanates

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.179
ultimately from the brain.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.889
But if you think about
information, where it comes

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:17.429
from, perhaps it's greater
than the brain.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:18.330
How would you know that?

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:23.045
So let me just present one of
my curiosity speculations.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.360
Now I don't know how many people
realize this, but slime

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.630
mold loves oat bran
And two wonderful

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.600
studies have been done.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.580
One in which you take oat bran
and you paste it on the major

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.560
cities in England.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.020
And the slime mold, which has no
nervous system whatsoever,

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.639
will merge together from
individual little cells into a

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:52.750
multi-nucleated that single,
giant organism.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.850
And it will seek out
the oat bran in a

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:56.500
way that's most efficient.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.510
So they take a topographic map
of England, and the slime-mold

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:03.190
recreates the British
highway system.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:08.040
And they've done this for
Japan, same thing.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.290
They put on the major
cities at it

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.840
recreates the railway system.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.550
So they asked the one who did
the Japanese study, well does

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.520
mean slime mold's intelligent?

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.015
They have no nervous
system whatsoever.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.060
And the man said, the researcher
said, it depends

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.130
what you mean by intelligence.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.410
But he said from a mathematical
standpoint, it's

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.030
approximately the same degree
of complexity as a person

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:33.930
learning to ride a bicycle, same
degree of complexity as

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.620
in the cerebellum as
riding a bicycle.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:43.250
So let me present my second
example of what I'd like you

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.330
to at least consider.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.680
In the '20s there was thought
that there were

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.630
two types of locusts.

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:51.170
Solitary locusts, and in
academic jargon, they were

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:54.470
considered gregarious
if they swarmed.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.210
And solitary locusts
are vegetarian.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:01.060
They live by themselves, are
very finicky eaters.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:05.920
And normally live
lives like that.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.600
However, if they get into a
circumstance, such as in

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.060
Africa, where it rains,
they breed like crazy.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.420
And then the rain goes away, now
there are a lot of locusts

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.650
and there are no water.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:21.670
The locust changes to the
so-called swarming locust.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.570
You've all seen pictures
of them by the million.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:25.840
And the first thing they start
to do, where they make these

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.910
little marching movements
with their feet.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:32.880
And then they start eating
each other, eating

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.540
everything in sight.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.510
They're voracious eaters.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.450
They actually become
cannibals.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:41.040
What's interesting to me is
that their brain changes.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.920
Their visual cortex changes from
being primarily optimized

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:53.180
for solitary acquisition of food
to group hunting so for

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.690
group acquisition of food.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:59.280
So the entire cortex changes
it's higher hierarchy--

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.730
visual cortex.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.450
Their muscles in their
legs change.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.280
There's 30% more muscle bulk.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.210
Their color changes,
et cetera.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.680
Well it turned out about 10
years ago that there are

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.860
little hairs on the
back of locusts.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:17.090
And you stroke them, and
they release serotonin.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:19.540
And the serotonin levels in
the brain dramatically

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.470
elevated when you do this.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.490
And so they found that this
happens we get to a certain

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.330
critical density
in enclosures.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.070
And you can completely block
this warming effect by

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.980
blocking serotonin
in the brain.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:36.806
So here you have animals that
their brain changes in their

00:37:36.806 --> 00:37:39.910
group context.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:44.160
Yes, the impetus starts with
the individual body.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.900
But it's a part of a
group phenomenon.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.840
I won't occur on its own.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.520
Now I don't know how many of you
people have been in a rock

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.610
concert or something.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.810
And when you're leaving, there
are a bunch of people you

00:37:54.810 --> 00:38:00.268
start going like this no to hit
the guy in front of you.

00:38:00.268 --> 00:38:02.740
You say, I'm doing is not
the walk into the

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.020
guy in front of me.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.610
Well there's no way to know
whether you're doing it for

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.390
that reason or this is a group
phenomenon that occurs at a

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:10.570
rock contest.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:14.240
Now I don't really care about
what this means, personally,

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.080
in terms that walking.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.330
But it tells you something about
the feelings of agency

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.170
dictate how we think about the
mind in terms of doing the

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.400
studies we do.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.000
We want to study empathy.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.330
You put a solitary person in an
fMRI scan and you give them

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.620
empathy questionnaire
or you show a video.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.380
But what if empathy is
a group phenomena.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.370
You'd never see it in an fMRI
scan of one person.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.050
Now imagine, to me one of the
most onerous things of the

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:45.270
20th century was the Nuremberg
rallies, people on their own

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.260
act one way.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.440
And in a group they act
quite different.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.620
And you say, oh, they're
making choices.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.680
Well we don't know that.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.240
And we don't know how to study
that with present day

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:53.800
Neuroscience.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.240
Whether in the future that's
possible would depend on a

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.350
massive increase
in technology.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:02.390
But I mention this because the
way we think about ourselves

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:06.000
as individuals and how we
conceptualize the mind is

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.940
being restricted to that little
thing behind your

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.480
forehead is determined by
mechanisms in your brain not

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.400
by any fundamental higher
level reality.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.190
And it impairs how we actually
think about who we are, both

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.695
as individuals and
as a society.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:32.270
One of the things that's always
struck me is the sense

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.630
of uniqueness has particularly
extended to our

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.180
treatment of animals.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.690
I know that when I was in
medical school, they told us

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:41.800
we should take out the pancreas
of a stray dog, so we

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.870
could watch how it suffered when
it died from diabetes.

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:48.740
And nobody even considered the
fact that they were taking a

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:49.490
dog and doing it.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:50.740
I still have nightmares
about that.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:40:00.500
Even today though, some of the
best Neuroscientists, people I

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:04.160
really respect, are writing
books about the science behind

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.160
what makes us unique.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.760
Now we think we're unique
because we have these feelings

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.930
of uniqueness.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:13.360
So it's ironically it's our
biology dictates our sense of

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.590
uniqueness.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:17.170
The feeling tells us
that we're unique.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:21.140
But hey, that's no different
with Sarah Palin says.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.750
It's the same argument.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.860
And certainly, at some point,
we should start to consider

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.870
what these involuntary
sensations mean towards our

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.046
public policy, et cetera.

00:40:31.046 --> 00:40:34.910
And now on that not let me just
say that five years ago,

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:38.350
I gave you talk on
my last book.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:40.280
And I showed this slide.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.910
And I smugly said, this is an
example of how we feel that

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:49.640
top slide is longer than
the bottom slide.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.350
And I said, this is an example
of how we have a feeling of

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:53.570
knowing which is involuntary.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.350
Even I tell you the slide--

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:59.060
the two lengths are the same.

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.270
We still feel the other one.

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.520
So it's a feeling of knowing
at odds with our cognitive

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.470
understanding.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:06.940
And I thought wasn't
that clever.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:12.640
But what I didn't realize is
that this isn't just a matter

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.630
of our brains in the abstract.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.130
They've done studies now, which
came out within a year

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.940
or two ago, that they gave the
same pictures to different

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.670
kinds of cultures.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:26.250
From the so-called Western
technology, highly educated

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:33.980
kids, to tribes in Africa.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.140
Tribes in Africa don't
see a difference.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.380
They see no illusion
here whatsoever.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.740
And they've tried this
with other things.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.710
And the conclusion of the
authors is that something as

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:50.840
basic as our visual perception
can be changed by our culture.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.970
So you go back, you think
about the locust,

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.330
you think on this.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:42:00.002
We need to rethink how
Neuroscience thinks about the

00:42:00.002 --> 00:42:01.180
mind, not the brain.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.490
You can study the
brain without--

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.110
that's pure science.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.340
So I just--

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.470
so I leave some time for
questions, I want to emphasize

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.880
the study the brain
as pure science.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.280
I've no qualms with
that whatsoever.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.700
And there's no other way of
studying the world from the

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.340
point of view of facts.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.950
But conclusions about what the
mind is are storytelling.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.600
I can give you an argument that
we have a group mind.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.700
I can tell you that
we don't have one.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.835
But I don't have any evidence
to support that.

00:42:33.835 --> 00:42:35.650
That's pure speculation.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:36.750
I can tell you we're unique.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:37.870
We're not unique.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:39.710
I could tell you we're
studying altruism.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:43.580
Those are stories that you're
telling based upon the data.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.400
And so it's from my point, the
science of the mind is one set

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.400
of stories among many.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.760
Science uses data.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.310
Stories use plot
and character.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:57.940
And all I want to share
something with you.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.440
How many people think we all
know what this lovely young

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.070
lady is thinking through
Neuroscience?

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:08.150
Wouldn't it be great to be a
mind reader, to know what

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.700
animals are thinking?

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.020
But the fact of matter is if
you realize that we have to

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:17.610
have perfect understanding
what's going on in her brain,

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.020
and that she's got to
be able to tell us.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.620
So--

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.300
But there are other ways.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.450
In writing my books, I've
been kind of ignorant of

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.110
what came before me.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.520
And I thought I'd
close with this.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:34.450
Aristotle said, "Our desires
harbor a hidden judgment that

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:37.790
their ends are good." Basically,
2,500 years ago, he

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:43.000
was telling us that our
unconscious mind also is

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.290
making unconscious judgments,
such as

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.960
the feeling of knowing.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.230
And Dostoevsky was commenting
on conscious versus

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.230
unconscious though.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:57.760
"Soon he sank in the deep
thought, or accurately

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.600
speaking, into a complete
blindness of mind." This is

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:05.540
written in the 1860."

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.140
And for those of you who would
like to debate the free will

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.370
issue, I think Tolstoy
summed this up.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:12.790
"You say I'm not free.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:14.460
But I've raised and
lowered my arm.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.000
Everybody understands that
this logical answer is

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.900
irrefutable proof of freedom."
He understands the paradoxical

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.640
nature of any discussion
about free will.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.960
And as far as so-called
group mind.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:32.640
I'll leave you Charles
Bukowski's idea "If you could

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.200
separate what the public thinks
from reality, that's

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.490
all you need to know
to bet wisely."

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:42.550
And I think this is the state
of Neuroscience at present.

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:48.062
So I will now answer questions
or look stupid as best I can.

00:44:48.062 --> 00:44:55.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:58.220
AUDIENCE: If you could take
that slider that had that

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.630
sense of uncertainty about and
adjust it for you just once,

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.440
you only have one opportunity
to do this, how

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.160
would you do it?

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:11.290
Would you be more sure of your
inferences or less sure?

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:12.430
ROBERT BURTON: More
sure of my--

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.480
AUDIENCE: More sure of your
inferences and your thoughts

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.780
and ideas and you
come up or less?

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.270
ROBERT BURTON: I think that if
you don't have some certainly,

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.850
at least, to the extent of
feeling you got a hunch,

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:24.820
you're never going
to do anything.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:25.820
You're not going to
write a novel.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:26.880
Like, I've written
several novels.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.120
You've have to think, I'm
on the right track.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:34.120
But you can have so much
uncertainty that you think

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.430
that character has to do A or
B and can't do C, D, or

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.028
F, you follow me?

00:45:39.028 --> 00:45:40.860
So it's--

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.760
You need the middle road.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.160
How's that?

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.510
That's a simple way
of putting it.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.160
AUDIENCE: That's just
copping out.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:47.550
ROBERT BURTON: I know.

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:51.720
I think you have to
wear two hats.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.460
You wear an editor and
a non editor hat.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.290
In other words, when I'm writing
fiction, I say, leave

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.890
the editor at home.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.880
Try everything.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.070
And then I'm going to go back
and visit with my editor's hat

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:07.240
on and see if it makes sense.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.710
So I take no certainty is the
default position for trying to

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:12.780
create ideas.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:18.930
And then as much as I can do
certainty to try disprove

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.040
actually what I've written.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.180
AUDIENCE: So you want control
of the slider all the time.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:23.440
ROBERT BURTON: No.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.740
I want it on off for a while and
then go back and reach for

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.350
it if I can.

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:30.680
But you can't do that either.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.890
I know that.

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:33.270
You asked a tough question.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.930
You guys all do.

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:35.280
So go ahead.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.250
AUDIENCE: What is your attitude
towards the unknown,

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.190
for which we don't have the
tools currently to understand

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.670
within a scientific framework.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.830
ROBERT BURTON: Couple things.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:48.440
One is, that if I had an answer
for you, I would be

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.930
clairvoyant.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:52.550
By very definition, those people
who say, I think in '50

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.890
years or 20 years or 10 years or
next week or sometime we're

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.320
going to understand the mind,
they're making a prediction

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.130
based upon clairvoyance,
not facts.

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:04.790
And if I told you we weren't,
I would also be

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:05.970
basing it on no facts.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:06.600
So now--

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.970
so basically, I'm just
speculating.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:13.030
My own feeling is that there's
certain insurmountable

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:17.500
metaphysical questions that,
even if we were to get great

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.590
understanding of the brain,
which I have no doubt that

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:24.240
down the road the techniques
will be such that this will

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.290
look like primitive man.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:29.290
But really what it amounts to is
can we bridge that into the

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:32.480
subjective description.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.110
In other words, for example,
let's say your foot hurts and

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:37.890
my foot hurts.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:40.620
But we have a whole different
backgrounds,

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.460
for whatever reason.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.430
We would need to have perfect
information about each of us

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.620
for our entire lives, not
just for this instant.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.080
And then we would have to
have the same language.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.820
But even if we had the same
language, like I worked at a

00:47:55.820 --> 00:48:00.010
pain clinic at UCSF, where
people would say their

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.420
paying was a 10.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.690
But their 10 isn't the
same as your 10.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:06.800
So you have the problem of
qualia, or is you're red the

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.710
same as my red.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:11.950
Now do I think you
can solve those?

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:13.420
I like the idea of mystery.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.060
I know it's not going to be
solved in my lifetime.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.720
So I enjoy the idea
of mystery.

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.500
But I love the idea
of discovery.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.160
So it's sort of like
extended foreplay.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.160
This is not exactly--

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.370
AUDIENCE: So your attitude is
a curiosity and appreciation

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:30.890
for mystery.

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:34.600
ROBERT BURTON: Yeah, and If you
get to my age, and you see

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.110
the history of science unfold
in front of your own eyes,

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.530
during your lifetime, we've
made a zillion mistakes.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:43.500
Now to think that somewhere down
the road, we won't make

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.510
them is to misunderstand the
nature of human beings.

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:50.600
Science works in little steps,
little increments forward,

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.600
some steps backward, sideways,
with the idea of moving

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.190
inexorably towards moving
inexorably, but not towards

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:58.530
any final conclusion.

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:01.770
Now but that's speculation.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:04.280
And that's a novelist looking
at the fact that I like the

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.000
idea there are multiple
explanations.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.460
AUDIENCE: At the beginning you
showed a picture of the brain

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.840
studying the brain.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.460
And I think that this is kind of
part of a trend of looking

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:19.160
more at the history and further
back in the process of

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.430
what we're doing.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:25.240
So just acknowledging the fact
that we have these brains that

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.340
have flaws.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.220
And that's what we're
using to do it.

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:32.320
And then the next step that
I think about is using

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.440
evolution, so thinking about
the evolved brain

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.780
studying the brain.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.830
But I'm kind of a skeptic
towards evolutionary

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:39.700
psychology.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.170
I guess you might be
somewhat as well.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:44.360
Do you have any hope for
bringing evolution to this

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.450
picture more?

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:49.490
More so than just the very
simple things like, say, the

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:53.040
size of the visual cortex, but
more complicated things like

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.310
ability to do certain kinds
of computation,

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.820
or things like that.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.350
ROBERT BURTON: A
couple things.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.920
First of all, evolution
happened.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.615
But evolution isn't an entity
with an agenda.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.280
I don't know how many of you
people know Stephen J Gould

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.130
and the concept of standards,
but it's worth reading about.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:25.050
But we assign purpose to
everything but without any

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:26.070
knowledge that's so.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:29.340
So as far as computational
ability, if we're going to

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.370
survive, I think it's more
important we develop empathy

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.730
and compassion and getting
along with others than

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:35.770
computational ability.

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:39.800
Because unfortunately, my
concern, which is probably why

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.560
I've written these books, is
that we will get smarter.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.220
We will get more-- and whatever
tools we can get

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.410
personally--

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.940
let's face it, you guys
are and evolution.

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:55.850
If you have a PDA or a flash
drive, you can down--

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:57.850
when I was a neurologist, if
you could just memorize all

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:00.460
the diseases, and you could walk
around about the latest

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:01.810
literature, you were a genius.

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:03.380
Now you don't have to
do any of that.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.920
So in a way, that
is evolution.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.660
It's a different kind
of evolution.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.420
But it isn't making
us any better.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:12.300
It isn't solve any problems
in Congress Or

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.640
climate change or anything.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.340
So if I were to say, I think
that before we worry about

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:21.400
computational improvements in
the individual, we will have

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.690
them as a group mind,
an extended mind.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:27.860
But I don't know that that's
terribly helpful for what

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:31.210
really counts, which is to
understand that we're fallible

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.790
and that we have to be a bit
humbled that each of our ideas

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:37.840
comes from an idiosyncratic and
often irrational place,

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.470
even though it may be the best
we can do with science.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:42.200
We augment it with science.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.330
But we still have a lot
of in-built biases.

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.630
Now that's just a personal
sermon, not

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:48.890
a scientific comment.

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:49.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:54.880
I wonder if you can talk about
the connections between

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.850
Capgras' syndrome and
consciousness and whether

00:51:57.850 --> 00:51:59.460
there are--

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.950
we can describe such a thing as
defects of consciousness?

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:03.820
ROBERT BURTON: Let me--

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.620
there are a whole bunch of
so-called delusional

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.840
miss-identification syndromes.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.210
And actually it's--

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:14.600
in my first book, I cover this
at some length because what

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.430
really is of interest to me--

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.900
I'll give you an example
because maybe--

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:21.500
if you guys have time to stick
around, it's a quick--

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:29.000
I had a patient many years ago,
who had a very, very,

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.160
very, very, very small stroke
was recovered within a few

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.300
hours and was fine but
was an art dealer.

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.670
And he phoned me up
when you go home.

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:38.460
An he said something
horribles happened.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:38.800
I said, what's that?

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.430
He says, my desk has been
replaced by an limitation.

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:46.560
And what he had was a 12 foot
refractory desk, refectory

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.580
table, that you would you'd have
to take the doors off to

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:49.490
get it out.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:51.500
So it was pretty obvious that
hadn't been replaced.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.780
And he understood that.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:57.150
But when he ran his across the
table top, he said, yes, those

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.800
are the wormholes.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.470
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:00.680
and those are the scuff
marks and everything.

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.270
They're exactly like before.

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:05.480
But they don't feel familiar.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.090
They don't feel like
they used to.

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:10.400
I said, well, they're
the same size?

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.000
And he was in total agreement
as to the cognitive

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.630
aspects of that desk.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:16.470
But he could not convince
himself that it wasn't an

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:18.460
invitation because they
didn't feel familiar.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.180
And that case was one of the
ones that started me to think

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:26.090
about the discrepancy between
understanding, cognitive

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:27.850
understanding--

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:30.120
he understood that
it was a desk.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.865
But he couldn't grasp
that it was his.

00:53:34.865 --> 00:53:38.370
And so basically that
sensation is--

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:39.980
you say with consciousness.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.830
Consciousness for him was
a combination of the

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:43.810
intellectual knowledge.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:47.120
It came as a fact
and the feeling.

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:47.690
So yes.

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:51.200
The Capgras syndrome those
delusions are a form of

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.860
disorders of involuntary
mental states which are

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:58.480
reflected in consciousness, if
that answers your question.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.770
AUDIENCE: Well, more
specifically, do you think

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:03.860
that we can understand
consciousness as sort of a

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.620
continuum that can
be degraded.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.880
You can measure the level
of degradation

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.350
based on certain defects.

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:11.570
ROBERT BURTON: Oh, there's
no question.

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:14.540
If it's like consciousness
goes like that, if

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:15.030
that's what you mean.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.340
Yes.

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:18.646
And you're aware of this,
out the periphery, and

00:54:18.646 --> 00:54:19.980
then it drops off.

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.020
And I suppose all these are
elements-- yes, if you got

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.600
them all together, you'd have
a better idea of what

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.010
consciousness is.

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:29.010
AUDIENCE: So it just reminded
your question on this mind

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:30.390
versus brain [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.970
So there in Buddhism
there is this--

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.500
Buddha has this-- there is a
story about Buddha that were

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.440
14 question, if I remember
correctly, that he was never

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.900
ready to make any
answer about.

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.530
So one of them was
something like--

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:48.260
I think these three questions
were exactly among these 14

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.540
question that Buddha
was never--

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.730
So when he was asked this
question, he was just--

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.150
didn't say anything.

00:54:55.150 --> 00:55:00.380
So I just wondered whether your
attitude is more like--

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.630
is something that is not
meaningful question?

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:06.100
Of is it something that--

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.900
so that it's inherently a
stupid question or is it

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.340
something that maybe answered
in the future?

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.410
ROBERT BURTON: There are
different kinds of questions.

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:17.370
There are some that are
meaningful but seem like

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:18.450
they're very difficult.

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:21.920
Obviously, it's meaningful ask
what is consciousness.

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.840
On the other hand, to ask what
is free will is a different

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.450
kind of question.

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:28.900
Because, to me, free will,
the very question--

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.340
first of all, the word free
will doesn't make sense.

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.500
Because what kind of will
would there be?

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:35.270
And you think, well, how is it
that everybody writes books on

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:38.070
free will without even saying
what does that word mean?

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:41.440
Now if you go back and think
about it from a historical

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.960
perspective, it was really
pounded into the public mind

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.250
by Augustine in the year 300.

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:51.300
Now why is it that 1800 years
later, we're still debating

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.120
it, when after 1800 years, you
haven't got an answers?

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.840
So to me, one possibility
is maybe the

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.590
question makes no sense.

00:55:56.590 --> 00:55:59.730
But then it gets down to how you
think about determinism,

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.990
and various levels of
determinism versus emergent

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:04.770
behavior, and then you guys
standing here talk about

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.820
compatiblism which
makes no sense.

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:10.560
But what it amounts to is the
original question doesn't--

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.160
for example, what came
before the beginning?

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.600
Well, that's a language
question.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.280
It's like it Wittgenstein
once said, it is

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.660
afternoon on the sun.

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.580
Now I you have to laugh
when you hear that.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.460
You go, that's a
great sentence.

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.950
We should learn from those
kind of nonsense things.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:30.290
And this book, How Something
Comes from Nothing--

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:32.600
all the latest physics--

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:38.320
well, that again is an attempt
to distort a paradox.

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:41.330
So those questions that are
really meaningful, the really

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.300
hard to grasp, like
how does the brain

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.920
create subjective response.

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.580
And there are just like, huh?

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.420
Why bother to ask
that question?

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.240
So it runs the gamut.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.220
But that's my cynicism.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.080
That's not skepticism.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.250
That's cynicism.

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:56.500
They're closely allied.

00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.080
AUDIENCE: [CHEERS]

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:04.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.430
ROBERT BURTON: Thanks.
