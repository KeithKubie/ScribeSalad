Okay, we would expect this to be a loss

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.080
of function. Think about it. We actually went from a

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.860
protein that's able to detect red light and send

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.530
that signal on to a protein that can't even get,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.920
make it to the membrane if at all, and

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.260
can't detect anymore. It's lost its function. It hasn't gained

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.990
any new function. And we know that there's no

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.900
change because obviously now we can't detect that red light.
