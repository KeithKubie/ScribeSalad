00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.590
Just like out cheeses, if we have just one copy of the T allele, or in this case

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.070
the plus sign allele, it's like our cheddar. And

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.630
it's going to be strong enough to show the

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.530
phenotype. So obviously the homozygous condition will show the

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.690
lactose tolerance, but so will the heterozygous condition. Only

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.390
one allele is all you need to actually be

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.850
able to digest some lactose. For the mozzarella flavor Or

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.440
the C allele in this case, the minus minus, needs to be in

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.159
homozygous condition before you see the trait

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.730
of lactose intolerance show up. Very briefly

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.010
note the fact that one homozygous and one heterozygous scenario gives you the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.230
same phenotype. Whereas the other homozygous genotype,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.930
or combination, gives you the other phenotype.
