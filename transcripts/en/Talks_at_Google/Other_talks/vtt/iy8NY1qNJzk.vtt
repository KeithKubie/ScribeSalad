00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.580
&gt;&gt;As we all know one of the things that we
really enjoy working with

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.280
over here at Google are very large data sets,
very complex problems.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.150
You know, lots and lots of bits coming through.
And nowhere is that more true than in the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.120
astronomy world, where each night on a telescope
run, we have terabytes and gigabytes of data

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.580
coming through.
And all that has to be sorted, you know, the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.780
signal-to-noise ratio adjusted and processed.
It's a really large and complex issue.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.070
And that's why we really enjoy working with
our friends at NASA and throughout the astronomy

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.590
community. And so today we're very pleased
to be joined by our friends from the Keck

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.890
Observatory down in sunny Hawaii.
So I can definitely say aloha to that. I was

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.210
really pleased to get my lei today.
I've never been to Hawaii but now I really

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.269
have to go even more
seriously than before.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.870
So we're pleased to be joined by a Dr. Taft
Armandroff.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.420
He is the director of the Observatory.
And he's going to talk to us today about some

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.019
of the new innovations that are going on at
Keck,

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.629
and how, you know, we work those large data
sets.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.980
And really just make astronomy even more accessible
to the general public.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.940
So just want to give you some quick background
on Taft as well.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.010
So he graduated from Wesleyan and earned his
graduate work in Yale, all in astronomy, of

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.690
course.
And he's authored over 41 refereed journals

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.400
and review, review papers. And his research
areas not only focus on managing these large

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.700
mass of telescopes from, you know, Arizona
to Hawaii and beyond.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.920
But more specifically in dwarf and spheroidal
galaxies,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.650
and stellar proportions and the Milky Way
galaxy and nearby

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.880
galaxies.
As well as globular clusters, the chemical

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030
evolution of
galaxies and dark matter.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.210
And so he joined Keck in 2006.
And he will be very pleased to show us the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.030
latest innovations.
We'll have time for Q&amp;A at the end and I'll

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.990
have a mike.
So without further ado, please join me in

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.430
welcoming Taft.
Thank you very much.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.540
[applause]

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.789
TAFT ARMANDROFF: Thank you very much, Cliff.
It's an honor to be here at Google today.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.799
And there's so much we have in common here
at the center of the information revolution.

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.489
Cliff did a great job talking about the complex
data sets and algorithms that I think both

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.310
of our organizations are really interested
in.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.010
Information is an absolute key in astronomy.
And just as a small sample of what we have

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.200
in common,
we're all thrilled with Google Sky, for example.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.540
That's a real tool both for our community,
and for the general public in learning more

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.139
about the universe.
So let me tell --

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.349
let me begin by telling you a little bit about
the Observatory.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:55.980
These are the two telescopes, opening up for
another night of fabulous discoveries atop

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.069
Mauna Kea in Hawaii.
These are the two largest optical infrared

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.230
telescopes that are
steerable.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.049
You know, that can point to different places
in the sky

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.930
that are in operation today.
So 10 meters, 400 inches across the primary

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.109
mirror.
Before they came online, the largest telescope

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.819
was the venerable 5 meter or 200-inch telescope
at Mount Palomar.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:31.749
We have a very advanced suite of instrumentation
that sits behind the telescopes that produces

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:36.010
the data.
And we have an incredible site atop Mauna

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.370
Kea here.
It's a dormant volcano, of course.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.329
14,000 feet elevation.
So only 60 percent of the atmosphere is above

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.139
us at 14,000 feet.
40 percent of the atmosphere is below us,

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.840
so that's that much less light to interfere
with the observations.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.230
They're --
astronomers love data, so we've surveyed just

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.250
about every mountaintop on earth that could
be good

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.409
for astronomy,
and Mauna Kea has come out as number one.

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.609
The reasons for that are several, but let
me cite the two most important.

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:18.949
One the sky is incredibly dark in Hawaii Island.
You know, we're mostly surrounded by ocean.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.250
We have a rural economy.
Population is very low.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.720
We have a very progressive lighting ordinances
to keep the light

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.449
focused on the ground instead of shooting
up into the sky.

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.900
So we're working on incredibly faint objects.
And we cannot detect them against a bright

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.400
background, of course.
So that's one.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.800
The other is that the air is just very stable
above Mauna Kea.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.330
The air has been traveling across the Pacific
without running into other mountain ranges

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.150
or very heated up areas and causing it to
become turbulent.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.569
So it's a very smooth-shaped volcano, so we
get a very smooth laminar flow of air.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.419
And so that's the area that Mauna Kea is absolutely
exceptional of.

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.570
It's the mountain that has the lowest level
of turbulence in the

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:14.069
atmosphere above it on earth.
Here's a view of our telescopes.

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:19.909
This is the primary mirror.
This is the collecting area for photons coming

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.090
in from the universe. So you can think of
it this way:

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.389
Imagine you were a photon that had travelled
from a galaxy for ten billion years.

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.652
This is the view you'd see before you gave
yourself up for the

00:05:31.652 --> 00:05:34.729
benefit of science.
The --

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.159
you can see we do everything we can to give
a clear path to the primary mirror.

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.580
And the primary isn't monolithic.
The traditional way to make telescopes was

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.520
to make one very large
mirror.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.009
There's probably an analogy to computers here
for all you Googlers.

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.300
So the tradition was you make one very large
mirror.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.199
And you have to make it thick enough so that
it's stable against gravity as you point it

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.229
at different places in the sky.
Well that --

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.129
you could only scale that so far because of
the thermal stresses.

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.659
When you cast the mirror, they would crack
as you made them larger and larger.

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.550
So the project scientist for the Observatory
when it was just getting

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.879
underway, Jerry Nelson, came up with this
concept,

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:26.259
that you could have 32 segments instead, 32
hexagonal segments.

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.909
And each of them would have its own active
control.

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:33.129
So they're --
the backs of them have a --

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:38.000
and the sides have a lot of censors on them.
They feed their positions back to computers.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.500
And they're controlled very accurately.
We have to keep the surface of this mirror

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.940
within form to a 20th of the wavelength of
light that we detect.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.620
So the shortest wavelengths of light that
we detect at the observatory about a third

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.069
of a micron.
So we have to keep that surface within speck

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:03.719
to a 60th of a micron.
So it's pretty incredible technology.

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:09.199
And it wouldn't be possible without distributed
computers and censors, which didn't really

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:16.240
exist before the Observatory came online in
1993. So you can see a person there to give

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.500
you a sense
of scale.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.919
So the light is collected by this primary
mirror, it's

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:25.000
reflected back up to the secondary mirror
and concentrated.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.789
And then it bounces off the tertiary mirror
right there into one of the

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:33.889
instruments.
The telescope is used for all areas of astronomy.

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:37.740
I'll give you a sampling of some of the science
that we're working on today.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.409
Just a small sampling.
But we study everything from the moon if you

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:46.449
can believe it, to the farthest edges of the
universe.

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:51.409
13 billion, where light has been traveling
for 13 billion years today. And the sense

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:58.610
that we're kind of cosmic archeologists studying
galaxies as they existed long, long ago.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.479
This is another view of the telescope so you
can again see the primary and the tertiary

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:07.590
but this is where the information is produced.
It's produced at the instruments and this

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:13.710
is our Deimos Spectrograph. It can produce
spectro of optical multi-object spectrograph

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:22.229
on the planet today.
It's about the size of a small car.

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:26.650
And it costs about $10 million and takes a
number of years to develop,

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.509
maybe, you know, 3 to 5 years to develop one
of these things from

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:35.300
concept to being -- to being implemented.
So what's our mission?

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.430
What do we do at the observatory?
How do we grade ourselves?

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.229
We have a broad mission.
World leadership in ground-based astronomy.

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:47.800
And what we specialize in are the following
technical areas.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.800
One of them is triangular resolution astrophysics.
That's getting the finest spatial detailing

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.790
we can get in the sky.
As your telescopes get larger and larger,

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:04.990
once you correct for the finer and finer spatial
detail, higher angular resolution.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:13.720
We do a lot of spectroscopy of the light.
So that's going beyond imaging, of course.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.120
For every object that we study --
and you just need to collect a lot of light

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.529
to be able to slice and dice it into spectra
 --

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:25.500
so having the world's largest telescope is
very enabling

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.070
in that.
And so we do spectra on faint objects.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.000
We do very high precision spectroscopy on
brighter objects.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.440
And we do highly multi-spectroscopy.
So being able to get spectra of, you know,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.040
between ten and a thousand objects in a given
field of view.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.700
We're a fairly small organization and a fairly
young organization.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.670
So one of our missions is to exploit emerging
opportunities.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.410
That ranges from time scales of --
during of night, if we find out that something

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.339
really
exciting has happened that night, like a gamma

00:09:59.339 --> 00:10:02.360
ray burst has gone off
somewhere in the universe and has been detected

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.240
by a satellite,
we need to have the flexibility to get on

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.350
that and understand it.
But more broadly, we have to be very flexible

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.600
to emerging trends in astronomy.
Because of our size, because we're not a big

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.670
federal or international
bureaucracy, we can kind of turn ourselves

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.230
around to these problems and
be much more flexible.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.779
And we're all about training the future leaders
in the field.

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:32.870
As you'll see in the next slide, we're very
closely associated with a number of universities.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:38.699
And we have a lot of students and post-Docs
deeply involved in our research and becoming

00:10:38.699 --> 00:10:43.930
the next generation of leaders.
This is our metric how we judge ourselves.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:51.600
I imagine you have a number of metrics at
Google, but our metric is

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.720
publications in top refereed journals per
year.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.380
So we first started publishing scientific
results in 1996.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:06.079
And you can see, we're on a nice upslope in
terms of the number of scientific results

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:10.959
we publish each year.
The productivity of the telescopes keeps increasing.

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:16.570
We also measure by citations, of course, by
how influential each paper

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.459
is.
And so we lead the world in terms of ground-based

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:24.130
observatories
both in the number of papers published per

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.060
telescope, and in the impact
of our research, the numbers -- the numbers

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:34.190
of citations.
So our partners are very important to us.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.040
Cal Tech and the University of California
are our founding partners.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:44.209
I don't know if we have any UC or Cal Tech
alums in the crowd today? But each of them

00:11:44.209 --> 00:11:49.560
control thirty-six and a half percent each
of the observing time in the telescope.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.490
So they each have thirty-six and a half percent
of the opportunities to carry out experiments

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.240
in the telescopes.
NASA is a one-sixth partner, and receives

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.360
fourteen and a half of the observing time.
And the University of Hawaii, while not a

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.700
financial partner, they provide us access
to this very special site on top of Mauna

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.290
Kea
and thus gain access to twelve and a half

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.240
percent.
Private philanthropy is a major partner of

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.160
us.
The Keck Foundation gave us the capital, most

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.800
of the capital to build the Observatory to
start with.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:30.269
And private philanthropy supports about 56
percent of our new development,

00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:34.029
our building of new instruments,
and what we'll talk about as adaptive optics

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:38.839
systems.
And this gives us some freedom from the government

00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:46.270
development cycle that can be a little slow.
So let me go from the budget of the Observatory

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.430
to the mass budget of the universe.
Just to give you a sense of what we're learning

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.199
about the universe and how quickly we're learning
things.

00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:58.540
And perhaps how ignorant we were until very
recently.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:07.380
One of the top results in the Observatory's
history was the discovery of dark energy by

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:13.130
using distant supernovae as standard candles
and beacons.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:18.040
The universe, we all know, is expanding after
the Big Bang.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:25.611
And astronomers were using a supernovae, so
exploding stars, with Keck Observatory.

00:13:25.611 --> 00:13:33.880
And there are two groups.
One out of the Australian National University

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:39.170
led by Brian Schmidt. They had a number of
University of California colleagues. And another

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.769
led by Saul Perlmutter.
And what they were both trying to do with

00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:45.639
Keck Observatory,
and these distant supernovae, is the peak

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:49.970
brightness of type 1A
supernovae had been calibrated so that could

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:55.139
be a standard candle.
So if you could find a type 1A supernovae

00:13:55.139 --> 00:13:59.899
anywhere in the universe,
and you can get its spectrum, you would know

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:04.040
what its absolute brightness is.
So you measure its brightness with the telescope

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.519
and between the
two of those, that gives you the distance.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:12.519
You also know its redshift.
And going back to way back to Edwin Hubble,

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:16.080
the further an object is
away, the higher the redshift.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:23.339
It's much like in an expanding universe.
You can go to the analogy of raisins in a

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:27.880
loaf of raisin bread.
As the yeast is causing it to rise, and if

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.610
you're on any one raisin, you see all the
other raisins moving away from you.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:38.279
And the further a raisin is from you, the
faster its expansion is seen to be,

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:45.110
because the total amount of dough along that
line of sight is larger. So the expansion

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.829
is larger.
So there's a linear relation between distance

00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:51.649
and redshift.
Now if --

00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:57.160
that's all left over from the Big Bang and
the exploding expansion of the universe.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:04.290
So what these groups were trying to do was
to see if they could see the deceleration

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.399
in this expansion.
As all the galaxies in the universe feel their

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:14.050
collective gravity, that should, if it's strong
enough, it should appreciably slow down this

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.100
expansion.
Well, the shocking result that came out of

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:22.560
this was that they were
seeing an acceleration in the expansion instead

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.610
of a deceleration.
So something was driving this, this acceleration.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.579
The universe wasn't slowing down.
The expansion was speeding up.

00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:40.190
And this goes back to Einstein.
This result was the 1998 Science Magazine

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:44.170
result of the year, which it's very rare for
astronomy to be the Science Magazine

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:48.639
result of the year to start with.
But we were particularly thrilled to have

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:51.500
a result that had --
where the Keck telescopes had played such

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.300
an important role.
And Einstein, of course, had a term that he

00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:00.561
eventually dismissed in his equations for
the behavior of the universe.

00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:06.300
It was the cosmological constant that showed
a constant acceleration term.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:11.110
So this has become dark energy.
And it's become one of the top problems in

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.230
theoretical physics today,
and in high energy physics,

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:19.850
to find the source of this dark energy that's
creating the accelerating expansion of the

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.670
universe.
So the mass budget of the universe now, the

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:28.579
best estimate is
it's 73 percent dark energy; 23 percent dark

00:16:28.579 --> 00:16:34.269
matter; 3.6 percent as
you see, intergalactic gas that hasn't condensed

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:40.220
into galaxies or stars;
and only .4 percent stars and planets and

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.680
us.
So you don't feel terribly significant in

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.370
this, in this pie diagram. And it shows how
much we have to learn about the universe still,

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:57.810
and how we're very much on the frontier about
knowing what our universe is made of.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.610
So what are we working on this year?
I went through all of the programs we're working

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:09.569
on this year to just find a few that are representative
of what's the cutting edge in astronomy today.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:13.400
Oops. Did I?
Looks like I did something there.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.480
We're back.
So one is what are the internal structures

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.100
of planets having Earth-mass to Saturn-mass
caused by the

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.339
various mixtures of rock, water, ice, hydrogen,
and helium gas?

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:31.760
So we're now able, as I'll say a little bit
more about, to explore solar planets to get

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:37.090
beyond our own solar system in terms of studying
planets.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:43.010
And we're really -- the question originally
was are there planets around other stars?

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:50.090
That's a really challenging technical problem
that has now been solved. But now in the last

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:55.390
15 years, this field has just exploded and
we're talking about in --

00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:01.990
investigating with the telescope, what really
makes the internal structures of planets different

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.000
when planetary systems form.
So I find that amazing.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.980
The second question that's getting a lot of
attention this year is: How do galaxies lose

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:17.280
their interstellar medium and transition from
star-forming galaxies to galaxies that aren't

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.289
forming stars?
We call them quiescent.

00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:23.530
So a galaxy is born with a lot of gas over
its lifetime.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:30.039
It turns a lot of it into stars.
But galaxies lose their gas for various reasons

00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:34.390
and stop forming stars. What are the dominant
physical processes that control this?

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:40.929
The third question that I'd picked out is
do the fundamental physics "constants" --

00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:48.110
you all remember the various constants from
your physics classes in college or high school.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:53.530
Do they vary over the lifetime of the universe?
And some clever astronomers have found a way

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:59.630
to look at the spectra of quasars and look
at and determine whether the fine structure

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.860
constants that we use all the time in atomic
physics,

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:10.760
whether those constants are truly constant.
Or whether -- whether the word constant is

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.950
a misnomer.
So it's a very exciting brew of science questions

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:22.700
that we get to look at each year.
Let me spend a little time on exoplanets because

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:28.330
this is an area that's just changed immensely
over the last decade.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:34.260
But I want to go way back.
I want to go back to the late 1500s and quote

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:40.030
Giordano Bruno, who was a monk in that era.
He said, "There are countless suns and countless

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:45.720
earths all rotating around their suns in exactly
the same way as the seven planets of our system.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.809
We see only the suns because they are the
largest bodies and are luminous, but their

00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:54.060
planets remain invisible to us because they
are smaller and non-luminous.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.440
The countless worlds in the universe are no
worse and no less inhabited

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.870
than our Earth."
And he really set the stage for what we're

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:07.179
doing today, but he did it based on pure thought.
He was completely right.

00:20:07.179 --> 00:20:13.740
There are planets around other suns.
And we can't see them because they're not

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.630
emitting very much energy,
and they're so small compared to the stars

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.850
that they don't reflect much energy as seen
from earth.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:27.360
I mean, they can easily be a million to ten
million times fainter than the star.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:34.880
So the best analogy is like trying to see
a firefly just outside of a searchlight as

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:40.570
you're looking into the searchlight.
So he came up from this from pure thought.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:47.880
But astronomers have been trying ever since
to find extrasolar planets. In that era, astronomy

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.890
was a high-risk profession.
He was put to death and tortured for these

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:57.150
thoughts, if you can believe it.
They seem very innocent today.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:02.280
And it turns out that they were true.
But challenging the dogma at the time was

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.929
not encouraged.
So what have we learned since Bruno wrote

00:21:06.929 --> 00:21:11.400
those words?
When I was in graduate school no planets had

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.890
been detected around other
stars.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:17.690
We only knew the planets in our own solar
system.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.919
And we can debate about whether Pluto's a
planet or not.

00:21:20.919 --> 00:21:27.400
But certainly it's not a very rich data stream
to only know about the the planets in our

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.590
own solar system.
So astronomers have been working very hard

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:36.600
to find planets around other stars
and Keck Observatory has played a really big

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.000
role in this.
And the first way that planets have been found,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.630
and the dominant way, we're now --
the first planets were found, you know, about

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:50.659
a dozen years ago around other stars.
And the way that it's done, primarily is as

00:21:50.659 --> 00:21:58.429
 -- as a planet goes around a star, the star
doesn't just sit absolutely constant in space.

00:21:58.429 --> 00:22:03.990
Going back to physics 101 again, for every
action there's an equal and opposite reaction.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:11.419
So say as Jupiter goes around our sun in a
very long arc, the sun doesn't stay precisely

00:22:11.419 --> 00:22:15.570
still.
Of course, the sun is doing a little minuet

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.799
compared to Jupiter's long arc.
It does a very small orbit.

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:25.910
And the characteristic size of its orbit is
very similar to the diameter of the sun.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.720
So it's just as Jupiter goes from one side
around, it's just

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.390
doing this little arc that goes around the
very center of the system,

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.770
the center of the mass of the sun/Jupiter
system.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:44.799
So if we're looking at our sun from another
star, as Jupiter does this arc, we'd see very

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:52.980
small velocity changes in the sun's radio-velocity.
The velocity along the line of sight.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.230
Conversely, we can look at other stars and
monitor their velocity.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:01.620
If their velocity is dead constant, they probably
don't have planets around them.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:09.150
But if we see periodic motions in their velocities,
it means that a planet is orbiting around,

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.710
around that star.
And that its gravitational influence has caused

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:19.960
the star to do a small orbit.
So this is an example of this kind of data.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.200
The velocities that you have to be able to
measure for this are measured in meters per

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.530
second.
So you know you can walk a few meters per

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.620
second.
So we're able, we're able with Keck Observatory

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.440
to measure velocities
to one meter per second on stars that are

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.200
typically 20 or 30 light
years away.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.030
We have a very complex, very high dispersion
spectrograph

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:48.179
called high-res that takes the light of a
nearby star, it divides it

00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:54.360
extremely finely.
And it gets the spectrum of the star.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.640
And then we can cross-correlate that spectrum
to determine the doppler shift.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.929
So this is the lowest mass planet found so
far by Keck.

00:24:03.929 --> 00:24:10.660
The bigger the mass of the planet, the greater
the velocity change it will cause in its parent's

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.669
star.
So the most massive planets that are the closest

00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:19.799
to their parent star are the easiest to detect,
because they have the largest gravitational

00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:24.080
influence on the star.
We're most interested in things like planets

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.020
approaching earth mass. Well, we're interested
in all planets, of course, but the Holy Grail

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:33.200
would be to find an earth-mass planet around
a nearby star.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.270
So this is as close as we've gotten.
It's a 22-solar mass planet.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:45.860
And these are the velocities that when they're
phased together show that this planet is,

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:51.020
has an orbit around the star.
And this is the motion induced in the star

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:57.690
by the planet.
And instead of having a 365-day period like

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.390
the earth, a year on this planet is only 2.6
days.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:08.260
So there's not much time to achieve your annual
goals on this planet. And we're constantly

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:15.380
pushing to lower our radio-velocity accuracy,
and -- to get to lower and lower mass planets.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.760
And we're monitoring hundreds of planets.
This is the work of Jeff Marcy at UC Berkley

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.870
and Steve Vote at UC Santa Cruz, and all their
colleagues.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:31.130
So there's about 400 planets that have been
found by this technique. More than half of

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.980
them have data from Keck Observatory that's
contributed to that.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:41.230
So this is an artist's conception of what
that planetary system would look like.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:48.780
I said the planet had a much shorter orbital
period so it's quite close in to the, to that

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.710
star.
And we can get more information than its mass

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.649
because we're very lucky in the case of this
planet.

00:25:54.649 --> 00:26:00.669
Along our line of sight to this star, the
planet's orbit just happens to go right across

00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:04.300
the face of the star.
So when it goes across the face of the star,

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:09.159
we can monitor the brightness of the star.
And as the planet goes across, the star just

00:26:09.159 --> 00:26:13.630
gets ever-so-slightly fainter.
You know on the order of a percent or a half

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.429
a percent.
Because it's a darker surface that's replacing

00:26:17.429 --> 00:26:22.169
the very hot surface on the star, so less
energy reaches the earth.

00:26:22.169 --> 00:26:27.970
And we can time how long it's getting fainter
along the edge and that gives us the radius

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.159
of the planet.
So we have the mass of the planet from using

00:26:31.159 --> 00:26:35.549
Newton's laws and the velocities.
And we have the radius of the planet, so that's

00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:42.039
gives us a density. And we're able to get
a few other clues as to the properties of

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:45.120
the planet.
So we can start to talk about what the planets

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:51.850
are composed of because density changes dramatically
if you make something out of hydrogen and

00:26:51.850 --> 00:27:01.470
helium gas versus making it out of iron.
So we can try different kind of density mixtures

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:07.149
of the types of the substances that are common
in our solar system and see if they're stable,

00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:13.899
and see if they give the right radius.
And we believe that this Gliese 436b is made

00:27:13.899 --> 00:27:20.059
of a small rocky core. And that its quote/unquote
mantel is made out of water

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:24.789
compressed into solid form.
And then it has a thin outer envelope of hydrogen

00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:28.440
and helium gas.
So I think it's thrilling that we've gone

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.180
from the era where there was a big debate
about whether there are planets around other

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.399
stars,
to the point where we can talk about what

00:27:36.399 --> 00:27:42.539
the planets are composed of
and really do kind of differential planetology

00:27:42.539 --> 00:27:48.190
between the 400 planets that we know of.
And try to get to the fundamental questions

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:55.549
of what causes some solar systems to form
many planets, what causes Jupiter-mass planets

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:59.809
to be where they are in our solar system yet
there's some other solar systems where they're

00:27:59.809 --> 00:28:05.840
much closer in.
And to understand the physics of what's going

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:11.690
on in this situation. The thing that limits
the Keck telescopes the most is the

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.030
atmosphere.
I told you we're above a lot of it but still

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:19.169
we have to deal with the remainder.
So we cope with this with adaptive optics

00:28:19.169 --> 00:28:23.539
and Keck was the first large telescope to
have an adaptive optic system.

00:28:23.539 --> 00:28:28.059
So this the schematic of how an adaptive optics
systems works to remove

00:28:28.059 --> 00:28:31.610
the turbulence in the atmosphere which causes
that kind of twinkling

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.450
or shimmering of the stars.
The light comes into this system, and this

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:40.510
is a deformable mirror.
It can change its shape 2,000 times a second.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:46.381
And this is a wavefront censor,
and it says what optical affects the atmosphere

00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:51.919
has induced into the images of the star.
So you can see the star's jittery from the

00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:55.149
atmospheric motion.
The atmospheres introduces defocus.

00:28:55.149 --> 00:29:00.090
It introduces astigmatism, coma.
And here are you have imperfect wavefronts

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.700
coming in from the -- because the atmosphere
has distorted them.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:10.409
The wavefront censor is like going to a optometrist.
It says you have this much astigmatism, this

00:29:10.409 --> 00:29:13.559
much coma, and it rapidly changes the shape
of the mirror --

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:20.269
this mirror to exactly to exactly counteract
the optical aberrations that have been introduced.

00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:25.789
So it's like getting a new prescription of
glasses that correct the distortions.

00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:30.769
But you have to do this very fast.
The characteristic time in the atmosphere

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:34.970
is about 1000th or a 2000th of a second on
Mauna Kea.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:42.070
We so need to understand every 2000th of a
second what aberrations have been introduced

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.149
by the atmosphere.
We then have to send signals to this deformable

00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:51.710
mirror that has thousands of actuators on
its back and is about the size of say a dinner

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.070
plate.
Change the shape of that mirror, and then

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.570
repeat that cycle.
So maybe this is an area where we actually

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:04.350
have an interest in computer speed that maybe
approaches what you do at Google.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:09.029
We need really fast processors for this kind
of a operation.

00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:14.980
But the technology is absolutely revolutionary.
For the first time, large telescopes on earth

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:20.480
are largely freed of the distortions induced
by the atmosphere.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.169
This has a lot of other applications as well.
You can imagine.

00:30:25.169 --> 00:30:30.830
Just to being able to do better imaging through
the atmosphere period. But its absolutely

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:37.100
revolutionary for astronomy.
So we get a gain in spatial resolution using

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:43.350
the Keck telescopes with adaptive optics on
versus adaptive optics off of between 10 and

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:50.940
20, depending on the atmospheric conditions.
Typically, on a reasonable night on Mauna

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.840
Kea if we don't --
if we're not using adaptive optics the characteristic

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:02.750
size of an image is a half an arc second.
So 1/3,600th of a degree.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.519
In California here maybe it would be one and
a half arc second, one arc

00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:11.929
second.
We can get down to resolutions of .15 arc

00:31:11.929 --> 00:31:17.420
second using adaptive optics on Keck.
That's better than the resolution you get

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:23.950
in the optical with Hubble space telescope.
So we're -- we're liberated at infrared wavelengths

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:29.460
where this works and going into red wavelengths
from the expense and complexity and risk of

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.570
launching telescopes above the earth's atmosphere.
We can build them on earth.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.090
We can build them bigger.
We can build them cheaper.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:42.929
They can become more adaptable over their
lifetime as new technologies come available.

00:31:42.929 --> 00:31:48.080
And this is all thanks to adaptive optics.
So how -- what do we apply this to?

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.539
Let me give you a sense of the scientific
questions that are really --

00:31:52.539 --> 00:31:58.649
been opened by adaptive optics.
So the center of our galaxy is an area very

00:31:58.649 --> 00:32:02.139
different from, from where we live in the
galaxy.

00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:05.370
It's 25,000 light years from earth so we're
 --

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:10.830
where the earth and the sun are, we're kind
of out in the suburbs of the galaxy.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:17.590
And the galactic center is very much Manhattan
or London, take your pick.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.510
The -- just the density is a lot, is a lot
higher there.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:28.210
But astronomers until they had adaptive optics
weren't really able to study it very well.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.960
It's -- we're looking through the plane of
the galaxy, the plane of the

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:37.120
Milky Way to get to the galactic center.
There's a lot of absorption by dust so we

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:44.809
have to work in the infrared because astronomical
dust very much scatters and obscures optical

00:32:44.809 --> 00:32:49.090
light.
But it's much less of a problem in the infrared.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:56.159
And this is the inner -- this is a view of
the galactic center determined using the Keck

00:32:56.159 --> 00:33:00.230
telescopes by a group led
by ANDRE GAST.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:07.100
And you can see it gives a beautiful image.
This is the inner one arc second of the galaxy.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.610
So it's a tiny area.
Without adaptive optics, this would just be

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.710
a blur.
Now we always knew this was a very interesting

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:21.470
place going way back, because one of the brightest
radio sources in the galaxy is at the galactic

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.880
center.
But there was very little known about the

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:31.169
stars right at the very center of the galaxy
until -- until adaptive optics on the Keck

00:33:31.169 --> 00:33:37.169
telescope started probing this area at very
high resolution, led by Andre's group.

00:33:37.169 --> 00:33:44.680
And then I'm going to show you what the motions
of these stars are like with adaptive optics,

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.120
this is a cartoon.
This is the year the data was taken, and it's

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:56.640
extrapolated somewhat beyond the present.
So each star moves along one of these orbits.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.929
And this is the very center of the galaxy,
you can see.

00:33:58.929 --> 00:34:05.059
This is a tiny area, only .1 arc seconds.
Now watch the stars as they go close to that,

00:34:05.059 --> 00:34:12.630
to the very center on their elliptical orbit.
They're accelerated to huge, huge velocities

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:18.350
in accelerations as they go close in.
You can see them just whipping around there.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:25.200
This will just -- this will just replay.
And this star here is -- they're all extremely

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.080
interesting at these velocities or this fast,
but the star that's most interesting is this

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:35.560
one here.
It goes very close to the center of our galaxy.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:42.170
It goes within 90 times the distance between
the earth and the sun of the very center of

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:47.690
the galaxy.
Now, astronomers have always used the motions

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:53.760
of stars and Newton's laws to infer masses.
So we use the motions of the planets within

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.360
the solar system to get the mass of the sun.
So we can use those same kind of techniques

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:03.480
to use, you know, four sequels mass times
acceleration,

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:09.110
and the gravitational attraction law to get
what the mass is at the galactic center.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:16.580
So within the orbit, within the closest approach
of this star, there is four million times

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:23.280
the mass of our sun.
So imagine that's all in stars.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.840
This would be the brightest region of the
galaxy.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:31.700
But you don't see anything there.
So -- and you really can't put four million

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:36.710
stars into that -- of the sun's size into
that kind of region.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:41.500
So this is a black hole.
And you know, a discontinuity in space/time.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:46.850
And we have other evidence with the Keck telescopes
that this is a super massive black hole.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:54.090
We can see flashes of material as they get
accelerated and make their final orbit into

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:59.210
the black hole.
So this is the strongest gravity location

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:03.430
in our galaxy.
So it's a wonderful laboratory for physics

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:07.500
and astronomy.
And we didn't even know about it, you know,

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:15.040
before the Keck telescopes started looking
at this area of the sky with adaptive optics.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:22.010
So it's probably the best place that we have
to test the theory of general relativity and

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:27.290
the strong gravity limit.
It's a wonderful place to understand the properties

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:33.630
of black holes. And after this discovery,
astronomers started looking at other large

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:40.950
galaxies to better understand the demographics
of black holes in other galaxies.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:46.020
We can't get this exact kind of data, but
we can get more crude data that talks about

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:50.260
the motions of these stars from just a spectre
of the whole area.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:57.990
And indeed, every respectable-size galaxy
has a super massive black hole in its center.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.720
And in fact the larger the galaxy, the bigger
the black hole.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.520
So there's galaxies that are much larger than
our galaxy, and

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:14.220
they have much larger black holes.
So it's raised some of the most, most interesting

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.650
questions.
In one of the most questions in astronomy

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:23.070
today.
How did something that's the size of the galaxy,

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.651
you know, the
whole huge galaxy, you know --

00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:32.610
for example our star takes 250 million years
to orbit the galaxy, where some of these stars

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.240
take less than a
decade.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.550
So we're talking about very, very different
scales.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:41.100
How do these two scales know about each other
to have those things so

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.620
correlated?
Is this nature or is this nuture?

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:50.051
You know, did you start out with black holes
very early in the lifetime of the universe

00:37:50.051 --> 00:37:55.050
and they were very important to pulling in
a lot of other material that became the galaxy?

00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:01.470
Or did you have galaxy collisions so often
in the early universe that if you started

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:06.880
out with the small black hole at the center
of a galaxy it would just naturally get larger

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.940
and larger from all the merging activity that
happens?

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:17.390
So there's a lot of modelling and a lot of
other investigations going on to further explore

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:22.240
this question.
We've had another amazing discovery using

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.760
adaptive optics just in the last year.
In November 2008, this was announced.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:34.060
I was telling you how we now know of 400 extrasolar
planets but we know

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:41.590
about them indirectly from this --
from looking at the motions of their, of their

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:47.270
parent star as the planets orbit.
But that's not a direct detection and astronomers

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.790
have wanted to get a direct detection of planets
for hundreds of years.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:39:01.661
And so for the first time in late 2008, this
star, HR 8799, was imaged with Keck Observatory.

00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:09.780
And the idea is to use adaptive optics to
make the image of the star as small as possible.

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.760
So that you're -- so that it's -- and then
try to block it out,

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.470
so that you've removed the source of glare,
and you can see the

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:22.660
planets around it much more accurately.
And we succeeded.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:29.270
These are three planets around this star.
They're -- they're big planets.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.630
You'd expect that we'd find the biggest ones
first, right?

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:35.780
They're the easiest to detect.
They're ten, ten, and seven times the mass

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:40.860
of Jupiter.
And there's in the outer parts of this exoplanetary

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.160
system.
So they're -- in terms of the separation between

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.700
the earth and the sun,
the earth/sun separation, they're 24, 37,

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:56.250
and 67 times further than the
earth is from our sun.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:00.930
This is the work of KRISTA MARAW, BRUCE MACINTOSH
and colleagues.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:05.250
But I think this is the beginning of a revolution
in exoplanet astronomy.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:10.950
And I think we live at a very special time.
You know we're living when the first extrasolar

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.540
planets were found indirectly within the last
dozen years.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:20.530
And we're also living at the time when it's
the first time we can take images of these.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.430
Once you can take images of these, the next
logical step is to get spectra.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:28.020
Once you get spectra, you can start to understand
what's in their atmospheres.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:33.670
So play this -- take this technology and play
it forward with much greater capability.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:39.710
Imagine being able to image an earth-mass
planet around another star. Let's say you

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.040
could do that.
That would be a huge achievement.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.710
And then let's say you could take a spectrum
of an earth-mass planet. If you could take

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:52.980
a spectrum of our atmosphere, you'd be able
to detect that's there's quite a bit of oxygen

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.810
in our atmosphere.
You can't -- you don't have oxygen without

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.490
some sort of biological processes going on,
right?

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:03.280
Because it would all oxidize with everything
else, form things like rust, etc.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:11.810
So you need something to replenish the oxygen.
You could probably detect a spectral feature

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:16.170
in our atmosphere.
It's called the red edge of chlorophyll.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:25.450
So this is absolutely fundamental step on
the way to being able to probe for life in

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.870
the atmosphere, signs of life in the
atmospheres of other planets.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:37.150
I think this is absolutely incredibly exciting.
We have another discovery of this sort that

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:45.760
was made in 2009 with Keck Observatory.
Methane was detected for the first time being

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:53.460
released in Mars in the northern summer.
This is a map of methane on Mars -- with methane

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.200
concentration, is here.
So this is -- this is incredibly exciting.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:03.250
Let me show you how we do it.
You take a spectrum in the near infrared.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:08.080
And there's methane lines in the near infrared.
It's kind of tricky cause there's methane

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.220
in the Earth's atmosphere. So again we make
use of this Doppler shift.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:20.080
You find a time when Mars is moving relatively
rapidly along the line of sight with respect

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.430
to Earth.
So its spectral features are at a different

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:30.750
wavelength than the ones in earth's atmosphere.
This is the work of MIKE MAMA from NASA Goddard

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:36.880
Space Flight Center and colleagues.
And Keck has a very high precision, high resolution

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.520
near infrared
spectrograph.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:44.950
That's one of the few instruments that has
the resolution to be able to detect methane

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:49.270
so well.
So here's Mars, and this is a slit.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:55.170
The way we get spectra is we have to put a
slit, a one-dimensional slit, on an image.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:59.620
So this goes across the disk of Mars.
And this is sort of a busy plot, please forgive

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:04.090
it.
But this shows the density of methane along

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:11.950
that disk in the northern summer and then
shows it in January 2006.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:16.900
So the amount of methane has changed dramatically
over, over that time period.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:24.290
So March 2003 was summer on Mars.
And when you go to look at where these emissions

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:31.370
of methane are from, they correspond to specific
geological regions on Mars that have

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:39.170
a lot of cratering and what looks like vents.
And so the hypothesis is since methane gets

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:45.140
broken down in Mars' atmosphere --
remember Mars doesn't have as protective a

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:50.790
layer as in its atmosphere as the Earth does,
that methane gets broken down from ultraviolet

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.490
radiation.
Mars doesn't have nearly as much surface gravity

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:59.370
as Earth does, so gases can escape.
So if you see something in the atmosphere

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:05.420
coming and going it has to be replenished.
So the hypothesis is that it's sort of like

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:13.230
hydrocarbon seeps on Earth. That there's vents
on the surface that go very deep, and when

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:17.220
the surface icing thaws in the summer, there's
out gassing.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.970
And then when you go into winter period these
vents ice back up, so there's no more out

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:25.050
gassing.
So there's methane on Mars.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:29.880
It's -- it's being replenished and the really
interesting thing is what's the source of

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.480
this methane?
We know there's geophysical ways to create

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.060
methane on Earth.
And we also know that there's biological ways

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:43.310
to create methane.
So the big question now is, is it possible

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:48.100
this methane is being created by biology on
Mars?

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:52.060
We know on Earth that there's microbes that
create methane that are

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.760
subterranean.
It's warm enough for them to exist because

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:02.180
the heated -- the heated crust from radioactivity.
So it's impossible to tell right now whether

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:07.831
it's, you know, geochemical or biological.
But we're, we're really attack --

00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:11.850
it has been very exciting to our community
 -- and we are really attacking this with

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.070
Keck.
The first thing we're trying to do is from

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:21.330
the spectra, we can also place limits so far
on how much ethane and formaldehyde and other

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:26.450
related molecules there are.
So we're going to push much harder on that.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:32.700
In the time period coming up to try to --
cause you may be able to trace whether it's

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:38.090
geochemical or biological by the relative
amount of these other trace materials that

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:42.100
are produced.
But, we haven't used adaptive optics on this

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.850
yet.
And we've modified our adaptive optics system

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:48.040
so it will work at the wavelengths of methane
now.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:53.790
So we're going to be able to get 10 to 20
times better resolution on where the methane

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:58.710
is being emitted.
So we're going to be able to understand where

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:02.540
the sources are to an
accuracy of about 50 kilometers.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:07.360
So, you know, for us that's about the size
of Hawaii Island or even smaller.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:13.010
So if you can localize it to an area like
that, NASA could put a spacecraft into there

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:16.050
someday.
And NASA is incredibly interested in this.

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:24.690
So stay tuned for what's -- what's the verdict
on whether the methane on Mars is biological

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:28.490
or geochemical.
It would be an amazing discovery if there's

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:33.160
really biological life on Mars.
And it would really, I think, change the way

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:40.800
that we envision ourselves here on Earth.
So what about the future?

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:45.490
This is an image of -- for our adaptive optics
system with Keck.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:52.470
We actually launch a laser into the sky.
Originally what we'd have to do is do adaptive

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:56.580
optics near bright stars.
And that's what fed the wavefront censor but

00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:00.210
bright stars aren't that much common, aren't
that common.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:03.230
We want and need to be able to use adaptive
optics everywhere.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:07.740
So we developed a laser technology that excites
the sodium atoms in

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:11.810
very upper atmosphere.
And that creates an artificial star, so we

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:19.100
can create an artificial beacon near any place
that we want to do adaptive optics on the

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.280
sky.
And so I've -- this is, this is a recent technical

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:27.750
highlight and enabled a lot.
And I'd like to talk a little bit about the

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:34.410
future in astronomy and at the Observatory.
We're continuing to push on adaptive optics.

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:37.740
The current systems only use one laser guide
star.

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:44.490
And we're designing a new system that uses
multiple laser guide stars, perhaps nine.

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:50.710
So that we can do tomography of the whole
of the turbulence, and the whole volume of

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.241
atmosphere above the telescope.
No one has done that yet.

00:47:53.241 --> 00:47:59.700
That will effectively give as high resolution
images as you can possibly get out of a ten-meter

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:03.300
telescope.
And it will allow the full attainment of the

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:08.800
Keck telescopes.
It's going to allow a lot of new kinds of

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.940
science like watching planetary systems in
formation.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:20.260
This is a simulation of a solar system forming,
and how we can see it in its early days.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:24.951
This is a simulation of the galactic center.
This is Keck's current AO system.

00:48:24.951 --> 00:48:29.440
And you can see it's kind of blobby in the
center, but we can break it better into individual

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:35.000
stars to understand those orbits with the
more sophisticated adaptive optics system.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.800
So we're working very hard on that right now
and that's our number one technical priority.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:47.990
So in wrapping up, what does the future look
like for ground-based astronomy and Keck Observatory?

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:53.860
The Observatory's been really productive in
terms of the scientific papers and scientific

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.440
results.
I hope I've given you a taste of that with

00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:03.570
the work on understanding exoplanets and with
the amazing discoveries at the galactic center.

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:07.800
We'll continue to lead the Observatory's very
dynamic work.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:13.800
Extremely committed to bringing on new technologies
and new instrumentation and adaptive optics

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:18.440
systems to allow the Observatory to do more
each year and discover more.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:23.670
And some of you may have heard that we're
coming to the time period in astronomy where

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:28.480
people are starting to think about mirrors
that are even bigger than ten meters.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.540
So what are we going to do with our ten meter
in that era?

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.720
We'll -- one way we'll shift is we'll enable
very large observing

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.350
programs.
You have to work really, really hard right

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.240
now, and have an
incredibly bright idea to get a few nights

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.310
in the telescope.
But we'll start to open it up so the people

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:50.950
with the best ideas will maybe be able to
get a month of telescope time.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:57.270
And just create incredible data sets that
we can't even imagine today. There's some

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:04.290
very large imaging surveys the large synoptic
survey telescope, and Pan-Starrs are two projects

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:08.210
that are envisioned coming online.
And I understand maybe there's some Google

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:13.230
involvement on the large synoptic survey telescope.
But these systems will be able to map the

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.840
sky with a time scale of a
few nights.

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.010
So you can map the entire sky in a few nights,
then go

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:23.180
back and map it again and map it again and
see what's changing.

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:29.520
So look for stars that are varying, flashes
in the night that we wouldn't even be sensitive

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.430
to right now.
So that will be these amazing imaging data

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:36.850
sets.
We really want to optimize Keck to follow

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:41.050
up on those spectrascopically.
Because spectra really give you so much more

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.950
information.
It really gets much more the physics of what's

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:46.990
going on.
So we're going to be -- as these imaging surveys

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:51.650
come online, we're going to be optimizing
our instrumentation and our observing procedures

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:55.190
to really be able to leverage them really
well.

00:50:55.190 --> 00:51:00.180
And to learn a lot more about time-sensitive
phenomena,

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:05.330
monitor time-sensitive phenomena that have
been found with the surveys spectroscopically.

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:10.600
These very large telescopes will be very expensive
and very project management intensive.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:16.560
So they won't be able to take a lot of risk.
But we'll remain small and nimble so I see

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:22.810
us moving to higher risk, higher reward kind
of instrumentation and adaptive optics.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:28.090
And being a real proving ground for those
kind of innovative instrumentation concepts.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:32.140
That you can't afford to take the risk for
on the large telescopes, the

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:36.910
very large telescopes, that will migrate there
eventually.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:42.080
But I have a prediction and that's that with
the adaptive optics now fully developed, our

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.800
community really using the telescopes and
partnering with us so well,

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:52.450
that the next ten years before these extremely
large telescopes come online, will be the

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:55.360
most productive in the
Observatory's lifetime.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.660
And that will be the real legacy discoveries
that keep us in the astronomy books that are

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.930
published a hundred years
from now.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:08.310
So I want to thank you all for coming today.
And thank you for your interest in astronomy.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:13.120
And if any of you are out in Hawaii ever,
we'd love to show you the Observatory.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.210
And it would be great to do more with Google
and all you Googlers. Thank you.

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:27.770
&gt;&gt;So we have time for a few questions.
I have a mike over here if you're able to

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:29.020
get in range.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:38.170
&gt;&gt;I have a question about the adaptive optics
mirror that changes so

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:43.740
quickly.
What kind of material do you use to do that?

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.890
What's the mirror made of?

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:49.190
TAFT ARMANDROFF: It's -- I'm trying to think
of the exact substance.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:54.140
But it's a -- it's a rubber -- I'll get real
technical.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:59.060
It's a rubbery kind of substance that you
can place an aluminum coating over.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:05.440
So it's -- you know, a very flexible ceramic.
And then there's piso-electric actuators behind

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:11.040
it that do the changes.
We're moving to new technologies there with

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:17.850
micromachine devices.
So that's the MAMS are really the future in

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:22.220
this area in terms of being able to get a
really high actuator cap.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:29.760
&gt;&gt;Well, I was wondering if you could talk
more about the outreach that

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.140
Keck does to, you know --
like talks like this are awesome but do you,

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:38.240
you know, diversify this knowledge through
the community?

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.840
TAFT ARMANDROFF: Yeah, great question.
You know we're really blessed that so many

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:47.720
people are interested in astronomy.
So it makes outreach really easier in astronomy,

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:52.110
I think, than in a lot of fields.
So we have monthly lectures at our headquarters,

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:57.080
where we have mostly
astronomers who are doing scientific research

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.160
give the lecture.
They're all podcast.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:05.270
So if you go to our --
if you go to our Observatory website, KeckObservatory.org,

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:10.550
you can get at those podcasts.
We sometimes have lectures about new technical

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:14.070
things we're doing but it's mostly science
results.

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:20.430
We publish an e-magazine that comes out approximately
quarterly called Cosmic Matters.

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:26.790
We have astronomers and engineers who go into
the classrooms in Hawaii Island and communicate

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:30.760
with the the schoolchildren about the excitement
of astronomy.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:37.350
And we participate in the visitor center on
Mauna Kea where people who are visiting Hawaii

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:42.670
or locals can go and look at the stars
at night on this amazing dark site.

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:45.090
I'm sure there's more but that's what comes
to mind immediately.

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:53.700
&gt;&gt;Can you tell us a little bit about how Keck
can be used to observe or

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.040
indirectly imply dark matter?

00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:01.610
TAFT ARMANDROFF: Yes.
Dark, dark matter is one of the -- one of

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:07.290
the most exciting areas in astronomy, I think.
And let me just say, just introduce dark matter

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:11.520
with a word.
Sometimes I create confusion by showing that

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:17.680
pie plot of the dark energy and the dark matter.
But the dark matter is where we just see the

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:23.590
gravitational signs of matter but we can't
explain it with stars or planets or other

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:29.730
baryonic matter.
So I'd say the laboratory we're doing the

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:34.850
most on dark matter,
and right now is, the Milky Way has a number

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:42.080
of small dwarf satellites. So these are galaxies
that have, you know, on the order of a million

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.860
solar masses.
A million to ten million.

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.780
And we can infer that from the motions of
the stars in the galaxy.

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:56.141
It turns out that these are some of the dark
matter richest objects that are known in the

00:55:56.141 --> 00:56:02.810
universe.
And so we're -- we're really probing the numbers

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:07.260
of these, their dark
matter content, how the dark matter is distributed

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:11.560
within them.
Cause they give us the best information about

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:16.620
the clustering length of the dark matter.
Different forms of dark matter will cluster

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:20.990
on different scales.
And by, by having dark matter cluster on a

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:28.870
rather small physical scale, it rules out
a number of different types of dark matter,

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:32.200
different types of particles that could make
up the dark matter.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.810
And we're very much involved in exploring,
with these dwarf

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:43.850
galaxies, the theory of a large galaxy formation.
The hierarchal structure formation theory

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:48.330
that says there were --
there was a lot of aggregation of dark matter

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:52.100
into these dwarf galaxy-sized chunks early
in the universe.

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:59.350
And that big galaxies formed by aggregating
or merging, you know, these small dark matter

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:03.130
clumps.
So we're testing that theory in great depth

00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:08.380
around the Milky Way and around M-31.

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:15.620
&gt;&gt;Yeah, you're -- the animation of the galactic
center was really very

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.370
fascinating.
I believe I've read that in recent weeks and

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:29.790
months a couple of teens have think they've
observed a halo around the -- on the galactic

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:33.040
center.
And they were in the radio?

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.491
TAFT ARMANDROFF: Yes, in the --

00:57:34.491 --> 00:57:41.250
&gt;&gt;And in the gamma ray range.
And the more courageous astronomers are speculating,

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:46.890
looking over their shoulders --
gee, could this be the dark matter particles

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:53.220
colliding in the forming electron positron
clouds?

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:58.440
Anyway, it's really early on.
But is that -- is this the kind of thing that

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:05.130
infrared astronomy might be able to help with?

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:07.760
TAFT ARMANDROFF: It's a great question. I
heard --

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.030
&gt;&gt;You're seeing it at gamma rays and you're
seeing it at, you know,

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:13.030
microwaves.

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:18.600
TAFT ARMANDROFF: It seems very sensible that
that we should go and look

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.800
for this.
I have to admit I heard the discussion at

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.340
radio wavelengths.
And I simply haven't followed up with our

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.270
experts to understand what
we're doing about it.

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:35.020
So I'll get on that when I get home.

00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:39.570
&gt;&gt;Hi, so when you -- when you're doing the
measuring, you're probably

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:42.740
feeding the light straight into a spectrometer,
right?

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.900
TAFT ARMANDROFF: Yes.

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.510
&gt;&gt;So when you do CCDs, you had to do a lot
of calibration like flat

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:52.600
frames and bias and all that.
Do you have to do the same with spectroanalysis

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.600
or --

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:57.230
TAFT ARMANDROFF: Absolutely. And we call it
removing the instrumental

00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:58.230
signature from the --

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:02.900
&gt;&gt;And so are you doing that in real time?
Because usually what I do is, you know, I

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.370
capture light, and then I capture the dark
frames.

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:10.480
I'm wondering how you do it in real time and
stack it in real time?

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.670
TAFT ARMANDROFF: I think we could improve
how we're doing.

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:19.400
But what we typically do is we take a lot
of the calibration data in the afternoon,

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:28.090
the biases and then -- and then we --
we initially start with creating the flats

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:33.430
by the data that have been taken so far during
the night or flats we've been able to take

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:38.460
during the afternoon.
So we try to, over the night do quick look

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:43.080
reduction.
But often the final data reduction product

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:47.410
has to wait until the next day,
when we can look at all of the data from the

00:59:47.410 --> 00:59:51.890
night.
Particularly if it's very, very faint work,

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:57.900
and we need to make say a super flat from
the -- all the objects during the night with

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.510
the stars and galaxies removed.

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:03.920
&gt;&gt;So one additional question I had.
So the adaptive optics, right now there's

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:09.230
some products available for a couple of thousands
bucks for amateurs, right?

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:15.110
This is based on refraction and lens movement.
Adaptive optics elements, right?

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:17.190
Do you know anything about them or?

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:22.801
TAFT ARMANDROFF: I'm afraid I don't.
All of the products that we have are kind

01:00:22.801 --> 01:00:28.090
of custom-made for the -- I mean, we buy the
deformable mirrors commercially.

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:35.540
And we're trying to get a source of commercial
lasers that's reliable. But I -- I don't know

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:39.410
almost anything about the off-the-shelf products
for amateurs.

01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:43.350
I think it's really exciting, you know, that
that could be applied to other telescopes.

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:49.060
Kind of the democratization of astronomy,
with people being able to buy their own telescopes

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:54.600
and their own CCD cameras has been wonderful.
So I see the availability of adaptive optics

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.830
system, you know, to others than really major
observatories,

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:03.750
just a continuing of this democratization
and really cool.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:06.420
&gt;&gt;So one final question, the optics themselves,
its design are RC

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:09.980
design, I believe. Right? The Keck? The ten-meter?

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.620
TAFT ARMANDROFF: Yes.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:22.210
&gt;&gt;I think we have time for one more question.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:25.810
&gt;&gt;Thanks. That was inspirational.
You mentioned one thing early on which I'm

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:29.200
curious about.
What did you look at on the moon?

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:33.270
TAFT ARMANDROFF: Oh, yes.
The, you know, I was hoping that the data

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:40.130
analysis in this project would be done.
Cause earlier this fall we observed a NASA

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:43.260
experiment on the moon.
And let me back up just one step, we don't

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:48.510
usually observe the moon. So we had a NASA
had to allocate a special observing run where

01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:52.790
we could just make sure we could track and
guide on the moon cause it's so -- you know,

01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:59.920
it's such an unusual thing to observe with
a large telescope. So the -- NASA crashed

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:05.820
two rockets into the moon, with the idea that
it would bring up some of the subterranean

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.300
soil.
It's called the L Cross mission.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:14.450
And Keck and another -- a number of observatories,
but I think we got some of the best data,

01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:24.620
looked at the material right after this impact
with an infrared spectrograph tuned to the

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:29.390
wavelength region where water vapor would
be detected very well.

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:33.630
And the astronomers who took this data --
it's embargoed right now.

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:40.460
And they're working really hard on it to see
if water vapor was detected with Keck and

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:45.570
that same spectrograph that determined the
methane called the near speck spectrograph.

01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:52.810
The -- and NASA's long rage interest in this
beyond science is if they were establish lunar

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:56.230
bases, you know,
could they have some apparatus that just went

01:02:56.230 --> 01:03:00.960
a little into the soil and got the water.
So we're all eagerly awaiting the result.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.720
And we'll, we'll disperse it through our,
through our networks.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.070
By the way, it all --
I'd encourage you all to sign up on our website

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:15.010
to get news from the Observatory, when we
do have media releases about things like determining

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:17.070
whether there's water on the moon.

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:20.590
&gt;&gt;Well, Taft and our friends from Keck, thank
you very much for coming.

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:22.040
This is an amazing talk. Thank you.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.390
TAFT ARMANDROFF: Thank you so much.
