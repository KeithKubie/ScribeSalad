1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.370
The Joe Rogan experience.
You know,
I was tripped out by man that,
uh,

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.330
that underwater treadmill jammy.
Is it an amazing did you want on it?

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.910
You gotta do it?
It's sick.
I was,
I was wearing my clothes.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.730
I wasn't gonna jump in there,
but I was like,
what?
Look at,
this is crazy.

5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:18.210
This thing.
It's sick man.
You do it.
Yeah.
Did it a few times.
What does it,

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.870
is it good for your cardio?
Uh,
it's,
it's low impact on the joints,
right?

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.140
So like it's Oh yeah,
you'll,
you'll get it real good cardio.

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.060
Really real good cardio push on it because there's jets blowing at you and the,

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.010
the treadmills on the bottom.

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.080
So you're trying just to not your run it against the water.
Oh Wow.

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.340
And so like,
depending on how deep you go,
your arms,
that's all resistance.
Oh,

12
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.740
sure.
You can go just waist level and it's a little bit easier,

13
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.920
but the lower you go,
the harder it is.
Wow.
Good Cardio.

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.770
Did you do the zero gravity?
I didn't do any of the things there.

15
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:52.780
I just looked at him.
That's just keeping the door.
Forrest Griffin,

16
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.240
he gave me the four one one.
Yeah,
they've done a lot of,

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.250
when's the last time zero gravity?
It's been awhile maybe.

18
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:01.080
Or what was the zero gravity?

19
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.700
So there's a treadmill and you put these pants on and then you just slip into

20
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.310
this,
like you zip into it.
Oh,
I did see that.

21
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:13.311
And then you turn it on and it fills up with this air and then you can run up to

22
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.120
like 10% of your body weight.
So it's just like,
it's another zero gravity,

23
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:22.840
like the treadmill.
It's not low impact,
low impact,
super low.
And you can go off.

24
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.880
So you're just like tippy toes just like,
oh,
that's so weird.
Yeah.

25
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.230
Yeah.
That's really weird.
Yeah,
they got a lot of cool stuff,
man.

26
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.660
While they're at the forefront of all recovery methods and training methods and

27
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:40.020
Tricia.
Yeah.
And see what they're doing for us on fight week.
What are they doing?

28
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.770
So this last fight,
um,
they were like,
Hey,
do you want any help?

29
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.560
Do you have your meals prepped or anything like that?
I was like,
no,
I don't.

30
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.360
So I guess for people that are fighting within us for now,
um,

31
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.180
they'll,
they'll prep and make everything for,

32
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.290
for fight week when you're cutting weight and I'll make sure,
wow.

33
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.320
Like you stay in contact with with the guys,
Clinton,
them and they'll uh,

34
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.490
check your weight and then they'll make meals according to you,

35
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:08.970
like whatever you need,
deliver them to your room.
[inaudible] it was,

36
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.950
it was the best.
And then the recovery afterwards,

37
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:15.420
they give you these drinks all like Usada approved,
all that stuff.

38
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.010
It's like no problems.
They help,

39
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.700
they help so much with that last weight cut and uh,
and rehydration,

40
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.030
how much do you cut this fight?
I cut

41
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.520
19,
19 pounds and that's a lot.

42
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.880
Usually I usually cut maybe four to seven pounds.
Wow.

43
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.120
The last couple of fights I've Jay,
I would just coast it,

44
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.470
but when I went to Thailand,

45
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.930
there's a lot of sugar and a lot of stuff that I was eating out there cause I

46
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:44.310
really what it was.
Yeah.

47
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:48.240
When I was in Bangkok for a long time and it's just a lot of street food,

48
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:52.320
a lot of fried food and stuff,
and I was just there and I'm like,

49
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:54.630
I'm going to try everything.
So once I got to Paquette,

50
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.900
they actually have like health food stuff,
Vegan stuff.

51
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:00.310
They have a lot of tourists there,
especially on the street.

52
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:05.110
So that the street that Tiger's on all gyms,
it's like five or six crossfit gyms,

53
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.100
maybe 10 restaurants,
the health,
food,
restaurants,
everything.

54
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.660
So I was able to stay on track there.
So just,
I was just back just a few weeks.

55
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.460
Yeah.
But I still may weight,
so that's good.
That's a lot of weight to cut though,

56
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:21.910
right?
Yeah.
You like to cut like about five or six is that what you mean?
Yeah,

57
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
yeah,
yeah.
No more than eight.
Like eight is pushing it for me.

58
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.330
So what difference do you feel?
Uh,

59
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.740
the day after I didn't with their rehydration method,
I felt amazing.

60
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.430
Usually cutting that much.
I'd feel a little bit bloated,
low,
heavy sleep,
beer,

61
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.710
all that stuff.
But this,
when do you talking,

62
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.450
did you ever do IB or would you did do ivy?
Yeah,

63
00:03:41.451 --> 00:03:45.700
and when I used to fight in the RFA and,
um,
at one 85,
I used to fight when?
85.

64
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.530
Oh my God.
Yeah.
That's hours.
How much do you got?
Oh,
I used to cut from,

65
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.850
I try to get as close to 200 as possible and then cut.
Wow.

66
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.920
The 15 super skinny,
200,
two terrible.
Oh,
ugh.
Terrible.

67
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.060
I'm struggling to make two oh five nine not struggling,
but like,

68
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.720
it hurts to make two oh five now.
So I couldn't even imagine like,
oh,
it sucked.

69
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.870
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
