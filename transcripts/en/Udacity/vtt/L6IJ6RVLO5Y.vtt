00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome back to our course on debugging.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today's topic is tracking origins,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
meaning how to start with a failure

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and track back origins of the failure until you find the defect that causes it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But before we get there, a bit of a story.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you may recall this famous scene in "A Scandal in Bohemia."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here we have Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes sitting by the fireplace.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They haven't seen each other for some time,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and Sherlock remarks that Watson has put on 7-1/2 pounds since they last met.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And Watson says, "How do you know?"

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And Sherlock answers, "I see. I deduce it."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Not only does Sherlock find out that Watson has put on 7 pounds,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
he also remarks that Watson has been getting very wet lately

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and that his servant girl is clumsy and careless.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Again, Watson asks, "How on earth did you find that out?"

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
"Oh, it is simplicity itself," Sherlock says.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What Holmes sees is that on the inside of Dr. Watson's shoe

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
there is a small number of scratches,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
which he can see in the firelight.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
He deduces that these scratches have been applied by somebody

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
who very carelessly tried to clean the shoe,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
possibly Dr. Watson's servant.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And since the shoe had to be cleaned with such a rough device,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
this likely came from mud through which Dr. Watson had to run

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
while getting very wet.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is how Sherlock Holmes, from a single observation,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
can deduce all the events that led to this observation.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I should add that, faced with this explanation,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Dr. Watson exclaims, "When, Sherlock, I hear you give your reasons,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that I could easily do it myself.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Though, at each successive instance of your reasoning,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I am baffled until you explain your process."
