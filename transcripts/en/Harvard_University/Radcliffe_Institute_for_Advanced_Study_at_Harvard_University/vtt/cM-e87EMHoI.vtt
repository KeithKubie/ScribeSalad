00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.390
- Well, thank you so much for
the generous introduction--

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.470
generous and pretty
comprehensive.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.270
And thank you all
for coming out.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.370
Thank you for showing up
if you already know me,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.210
and I hoped you would show
up for validating my hope.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.950
And thank you for
showing up, especially

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.820
if I didn't know you'd be here
because that's an extra treat.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.560
So the presentation I'm
giving has three parts.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.370
The first part is
called departures.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.560
It deals with how I get started.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.840
The second part is
about itineraries--

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.170
what I am touching on, where
I'm landing in this research

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.980
project.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.100
And the third part I'm
calling intersections,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.370
because it's where the
subjects of my research

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.430
converge with other
disciplines and diverged

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.010
from disciplinary currents
to meet up with others.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.050
This presentation is dedicated
to the memory of my late friend

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350
André Lancaster,
who was a black,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.850
gay playwright who wrote plays
and musical works and helped

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.570
produce and workshop dramatic
works by black playwrights

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.580
on fantastic and science fiction
and Afro-futurist themes.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.660
André Lancaster is really an
influence without whom I would

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.620
not do the kind of work I do.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.265
I was not about to
be the only black,

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:25.140
gay André who did work
on speculative fiction.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.510
And I think he would be
really excited to talk

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.300
about dramatic performance with
me as this project proceeds.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.940
I'm glad that he will be
able to see it somewhere.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.340
In 2016, I published
my first book,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.620
Speculative Blackness--
the Future of Race

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.180
in Science Fiction.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.120
This book is the culmination
of about a decade of research

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.960
starting in graduate school
into phenomena that demonstrate

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.550
the workings of two
categories that I

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.090
think are really central to
literature in popular culture--

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.160
race and genre.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.780
Like most academics,
my research is in part

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.810
the process of self-discovery.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.910
The texts that are
integral to this project

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.760
are among those that define
me as a black professor,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.780
a scholar, and a fan of science
fiction and fantasy narratives.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.670
The archive of
Speculative Blackness

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.460
reveals a lot about me
insofar as it shows you

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.830
what I paid attention to
in the course of setting

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.350
my agenda as a
researcher, and what's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.360
left out of it is as telling
as how it's put together.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.610
This is the table of contents.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.900
And if you recognize some
of the titles on this list,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.520
one thing you might notice
is that there is not too much

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.860
direct engagement
in the analysis

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.860
of conventional literary texts.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.440
But there is a
fairly broad range

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.530
of media in the
scope of what I call

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.310
and what lots of other scholars
call speculative fiction.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.950
To be succinct about
it, speculative fiction

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.730
is a $10 word for a $5 concept.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.880
It's an umbrella term for
science fiction, fantasy,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.670
and horror, sometimes
mystery, sometimes things

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.890
called cyberpunk and slipstream
and the grim and the weird--

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.900
all of those things.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.320
It includes time travel, space
flight, robots, vampires,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.070
aliens, and ghosts, as well as
the other worlds and utopias

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.960
envisioned in the distant
past, alternative histories,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.660
and possible futures.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.160
I analyze these
narratives in some

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.920
of their most well-known
and influential iterations

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.500
and some that are just my
favorites-- the various TV

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.140
series and the Star
Trek franchise,

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.300
the X-Men comic books
and independently

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.120
published comics
from Milestone Media,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.240
and fan cultures, including
fanzines distributed

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.280
on the amateur
publishing circuit

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.110
and the informal
networks that gave rise

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.960
to today's world science fiction
conventions and Comic Cons.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.630
Some of the fiction writers
that you might recognize

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.340
who are involved in this
study include AE van Vogt,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.760
Paul Anderson, Harlan Ellison,
Robert Silverberg, Suzy McKee

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.460
Charnas, Jewelle Gomez, Wilmar
Shiras, Charles Saunders,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.930
Steven Barnes, and JK Rowling.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.700
But there are two conspicuous
absences from this catalog,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.950
and they're really
the most prominent--

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.330
for a while, the
only prominent--

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.190
African-American
writers to contribute

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.380
to the science fiction
and fantasy traditions

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.780
and make their
livelihood doing so.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.500
Many have tried, not all succeed
in commercial or in prestige

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.730
terms--

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.900
Samuel R. Delany
and Octavia Butler.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.346
My reasons for omitting
these authors from the book

00:04:42.346 --> 00:04:43.470
are pretty straightforward.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.303
Other critics have
written enough about them

00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:47.490
to bring their work to
the attention of scholars

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.290
and casual readers.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.390
Delany, the first
African-American author

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.420
to win the Hugo award for
outstanding achievement

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.420
in the fantastic genres,
is among the living authors

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.060
recognized by the Science
Fiction Writers Association

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.480
as a grandmaster for his
contributions to the field.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.150
He's written dozens of
novels and short stories,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.860
autobiographical
works, including

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.950
a memoir in graphic novel
form, literary essays

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.000
and social criticism,
pornography, published diaries,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
letters, interviews, a few
issues of Wonder Woman,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.100
and reflections on writing.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.560
A radio play based on
his work is the subject

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.670
of this presentation.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.760
The late Octavia Butler was the
first science fiction author

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.370
to win the MacArthur
Foundation Fellowship--

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.920
the "genius grant."

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.450
And her writings are
especially instructive today

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.070
as we live through the
political, environmental,

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.340
and economic
developments foretold

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.890
in her novels Parable
of the Sower and Parable

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.540
of the Talents.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.880
Her works appear in
numerous anthologies,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.970
and they continue to provide
inspiration to readers,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.310
artists, and activists,
especially black women,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.280
as demonstrated by the artistic
collaborative Black Quantum

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.450
Futurism and Adrienne Maree
Brown's Emergent Strategy.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.460
While I might have discussed
these two luminaries and any

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.320
of a number of other
authors to supplement

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.390
the material in
Speculative Blackness,

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.970
I'm turning to them now as
part of a book-length study

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.310
with a really different scope.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.200
As you can see from
the divergent objects

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.170
in my research so far, I
don't conceive of genre

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.960
as a medium specific category.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.090
So accordingly, I
consider what happens

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.960
at the intersection of race and
genre meaningful across a range

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.220
of popular media in literature,
as well as in popular culture,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.660
in written forms as well as
orally, in forms that we hear.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.510
Examining popular culture
through the lens of genre

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.450
entails making connections
between disparate narratives.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.880
It means finding patterns
in different materials

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.750
and identifying the problems and
tropes that link them together.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.090
The organization of my
first book, for example,

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.610
reflects a concern with
the movement from margins

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.000
to mainstream, the interplay
between consumer practices

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.430
and professional
creativity, and the tension

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.216
between ideological capture
and utopian possibility.

00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:02.590
In my current
project, I'm trying

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.860
to maintain one more
or less coherent object

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.890
within the focus of my
analysis and exploded

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.170
into several dimensions.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.290
The object in question is the
science fiction radio play,

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.350
an art form I've never
studied until now.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.300
In addition to
the curiosity that

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.910
draws my attention to
works in this tradition,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.890
I'm interested in
texts that allow

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.010
me to return to the familiar
ground of blackness and science

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.350
fiction while learning
new lessons to share.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.410
And appropriately,
this investigation

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.320
starts where I left off
with Delany and Butler.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.590
The works by these authors
that I've tasked myself

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.260
with studying this year have
some significant qualities

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.500
in common.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.650
They both originated
as print fiction texts

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.720
before they were
adapted for listening

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.050
audiences in radio formats
unique to their respective

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.700
historical moments.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.430
This pattern doesn't hold
true for every radio play that

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.030
would be subject to my analysis
in the book project I foresee,

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.180
but it's instructive as a
demonstration of the role

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.340
that literary adaptation
brings in to drawing together

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.150
different segments of the public
to interpret, to learn from,

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.660
and to apply the knowledge
explored in different stories.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.140
Before delving into detail
about one of the examples

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.820
that I've mentioned
today, let me

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.700
offer an overview of some of
the contents of this new project

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.350
that I've named audiofuturism.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.750
The Star Pit by Samuel
Delany is a novella

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.600
that first appeared
in the February 1967

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.799
issue of the science fiction
magazine Worlds of Tomorrow.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.620
Delany would include the story
in the first collection of his

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.090
fiction Drift Glass in 1971,
but first he adapted it

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.670
for a performance that
was recorded and broadcast

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.960
on 99.5FM in New York City.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.750
The Star Pit is a slice of
life reflecting the experiences

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.210
of an Earth-born,
heavy drinking,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.930
African-American spaceship
mechanic named Vyme

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.840
as he moves through radically
different but intersecting

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.180
social circles on the
space colonies that

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.360
have become the home of the
human race in the future.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.880
The Star Pit is a place.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.310
The other exemplary
topic for this study

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.750
is Kindred, a 1979 novel by
Octavia Butler with a truly

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.970
terrifying premise.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.040
The protagonist, an
African-American woman

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.710
named Dana, who
lives in California,

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.340
is pulled back in time to
19th century Maryland, where

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.980
she must bring about the
circumstances leading

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.530
to the birth of one of
her enslaved ancestors.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.890
Kindred was produced
as a radio play in 2002

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.350
for a web-based
internet radio program

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.381
launched by cable's
science-fiction channel, Sci

00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:43.880
Fi.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.350
These works by
African-American authors

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.570
represent touchstones
for the relationship

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.270
between racial discourse,
speculative fiction,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.934
and popular media.

00:09:54.934 --> 00:09:56.600
Either of them might
have been the basis

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.450
for a chapter of Speculative
Blackness, but neither of them

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.800
was.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.430
In this new phase
of my research,

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.640
they're equally important
alongside other works that

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.520
demonstrate different facets
of what makes radio drama

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.360
such an enduring tradition.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.330
Even as the way we
read and the way we

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.890
listen changes, as science
fiction becomes science fact

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.790
or more often as we ignore
the warnings of the Cassandras

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.720
and Jeremiahs among
us, a combination

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.030
of nostalgia and
innovation keeps

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.770
radio drama alive as a venue for
imagining unseen possibilities.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.720
If we look further
afield, we encounter

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.430
the prototypical science fiction
narrative as a radio play--

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.730
the 1938 broadcast of an
interpretation of HG Wells' War

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.910
of the Worlds.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.090
This story of an invasion
from Mars originally published

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.510
in 1898 is one of the
most adapted and widely

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.230
translated texts in the history
of modern science fiction.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.060
But its movement
across the Atlantic

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.570
and across media in the early
decades of the 20th century

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.210
are what make it
truly evocative.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.880
As always, I'm most
interested in this narrative

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.730
and in the renditions it's
gone through because it takes

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.550
on questions with world
historical significance,

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.180
questions like, are we
alone in the universe?

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.830
Why do we want to explore space?

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.490
And this question, which I think
is not posed nearly enough, how

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.090
have the colonial legacies of
the modern world, especially

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.510
the captivity and
enslavement of my ancestors,

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.300
set the stage for the way
we comprehend what it means

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.840
to live on the same planet?

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.990
The War of the Worlds
situates these questions

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.340
within the plot of a
thrilling adventure.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.480
It propels them forward,
but its frequent revisions

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.950
and translations also
preserve previous generations'

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.660
encounters with the problems
of life on Earth and Mars.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.390
The novel by Wells
models speculation

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.260
by bringing recent telescope
observations of the red planet

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:54.950
to life.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.160
It also stokes the fears
of an empire in decline

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.250
by twinning the constant
threat of rival colonial powers

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.670
with newly articulated
racial anxieties that assume

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.860
the shape of yellow peril.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.570
The alien sounds of
The War of the Worlds

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.840
are engrossing in and of
themselves, but to me--

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.240
and therefore for
our purposes today--

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.000
there are no stories with
global significance, especially

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
this one, that we can
separate from the genealogy

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.260
of modern white supremacy
and its consequences.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.170
With that in mind, I'll
bookmark the other chapters

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.890
of audiofuturism before moving
on to the preliminary treatment

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.950
of Delany that I have
devised to share.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.430
One chapter will regard
a science fiction

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.640
farce, The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.450
In March 1978, BBC Radio
aired the first installment

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.260
of an ambitious radio drama that
would become a cult classic.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.770
The novel first appeared
in print in September 1979

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.760
after the radio play.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.150
In 2005, African-American
rapper and actor Yasiin Bey,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:03.140
then known as Mos Def, costarred
in a US-based film adaptation

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.320
of the saga as the
protagonist alien confidant,

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.810
the man who was supposed to
be an alien assuming the form

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.050
of an everyman, a best
friend to any earthling--

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.910
Ford Prefect.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.100
A new sixth
installment in the saga

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.820
is being broadcast this year.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.040
The most unwieldy chapter
I'm likely to write centers

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.550
on a performance
first staged in 2014.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.560
Jace Clayton, a
black American sound

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.500
artist who employs the
persona DJ Rupture,

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.070
created The Julius Eastman
Memorial Dinner preserved

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.480
in recording as The Julius
Eastman Memory Depot,

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.380
an interpretation
of provocative works

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.650
by the black, gay experimental
composer Julius Eastman,

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.930
who died in 1990.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.200
The performance is strung
together by a speculative radio

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.380
drama set in the near future,
in which Clayton plays

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.950
a character auditioning for
the role of a Julius Eastman

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.570
impersonator.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.550
I intend to return
to subject matter

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.810
close to home with the last
chapter of the project.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.890
It will focus on black
British playwright

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.700
Patricia Cumper's adaptation
for BBC Radio of Toni Morrison's

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.650
haunting novel Beloved.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.580
This program was
first aired in 2016.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.370
At each site on the
itinerary of audiofuturism,

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.070
I hypothesize that
something weird

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.180
happens when speculative fiction
gets translated into sound

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.160
or gets translated from
sound back into print.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.730
Sometimes I'm concerned
with the reproducibility

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.360
of textually prescribed
sounds in a script,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.700
like the infantile
stream of consciousness

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.100
in which the title
character of Beloved

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.260
voices anguish from
beyond the grave or--

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.480
[BUZZ] a Martian heat ray.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.710
In addition to these
genre-specific sounds that

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.380
rehearse tropes of fantasy
and science fiction,

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.860
I'm also concerned with
verbal and nonverbal sonic

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.010
elements that stage real
and imagined interventions

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.640
in racial discourse.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.190
These strange
sounds are my point

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:15.380
of entry into discussing Star
Pit now and Kindred later.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.750
The most valuable resource
for the radio play

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.150
based on The Star
Pit that I've found

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.120
is an essay written
by Samuel Delany.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.130
I came across the
essay online while I

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.190
was revising the manuscript
for Speculative Blackness,

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.720
and I didn't know what to do
with it until years later.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.630
In "Notes on The Star
Pit," the essay, Delany

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.400
recounts his
novella's publication

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.670
in Worlds of Tomorrow magazine
and the subsequent casting,

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.880
recording, editing, and
broadcast of the radio play.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.740
I followed the
leads in his writing

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.230
to the Pacifica
Radio Archives online

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.000
where the radio
institution disseminates

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.550
the product of a
Grammy Foundation grant

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:56.410
to preserve recordings they
produced from 1966 to 1969

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.310
through the 99.5 Radio
Theater in New York.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.860
The Internet Archive
at archive.org now

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.170
hosts digitized versions
of the recordings

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.410
from WBAI's archives,
including The Star Pit,

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.380
along with other
programs in the series.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.270
The recordings
include original works

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.550
on contemporary and
historical themes,

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.930
both fact and fiction, poetry
and experimental wordplay,

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.360
dramatized readings of
historical documents

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.230
like the letters of Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.960
and adaptations of other
speculative fiction texts

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.490
by Theodore Sturgeon, Arthur
C. Clarke, and Mervyn Peake.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.620
So Delany's novella
fits comfortably

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.600
into their repertoire.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.440
To my mind, the most salient
image in The Star Pit

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.620
is an unspoken word.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.870
To get to the moment
when it's enunciated,

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.580
we can start at the beginning.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.680
The program opens
with an announcement

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.720
of the title and
provenance of the material

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.850

The narration is by the author.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.569
The music for The Star Pit
is composed and performed

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.790
by Susan Schweers.

in Worlds of Tomorrow,

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.741
published by the Galaxy

time we'll hear his voice.

The next sound we
hear is non-diegetic.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.710
According to Delany's
recollections,

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.740
it's a flute overture created
by Susan Schweers that

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.640
was played on what he describes
as "an instrument made

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.620
of industrial
hosing with an inch

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.070
and a half bore, and arbitrarily
cut-in finger holes."

[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.010
This sound signals
a shift from reality

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.020
into the fictitious
world of the narrative,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.130
and it's not the last
time we'll hear it either.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.410
The first voice we hear
within the narrative

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.290
is that of the author who plays
the role of the first person

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.230
narrator named Vyme,
and the first thing

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.190
he populates the narrative
with is an object

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.430
containing non-human life.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.830
What will it be?

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.984
Aliens, sea monsters,
killer robots?

with dirt in between

and little tunnels from cell
to cell, when I was a kid,

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.168
I had an ant colony.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:21.064 --> 00:19:23.760
- Ant colony.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.160
As the overture trails
off in the background,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.050
the first words
spoken in The Star Pit

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.540
literally frame a
world within a world,

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.690
the self-contained
biosphere of an ant farm.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.050
This motif recapitulates itself
several times over in the story

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.500
as ecospheres-- big ones as
large as a playground jungle

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.980
gym full of animals, small
ones that are wearable behind

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.930
a magnifying glass with little
microorganisms in them worn

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.580
on a dangling pendant--

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.320
To the ants from
Vyme's childhood,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.700
the size of the earth
is unfathomable.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.180
But he lets us know that much
greater mysteries revealed

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.680
in his lifetime helped make
our entire planet seem quaint.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.280
A flashback, which is set apart
from Vyme's adulthood travails

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.890
by another flute
interlude, finds

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.430
us remembering his
formative years

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.930
at the beginning of a space age.

[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.780
- I was born in
a city called New

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.800
York on a planet called Earth.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.099
Luna is its one satellite.

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:26.640
You've heard of the
system, I'm sure.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.620
That's where we all came from.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.560
A few other things
about it are well known.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.310
Unless you're an
anthropologist, though, I

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.706
doubt you've ever been there.

00:20:33.706 --> 00:20:35.580
It's way the hell off
the main trading routes

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.330
and pretty primitive.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.570
I was a drive mechanics
major, on scholarship,

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.400
living in and studying hard.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.840
All morning in
Practical Theory--

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.730
a ridiculous name for
a ridiculous class,

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.810
I thought then--

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.200
we'd spent putting together
a model keeler-intergalactic

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.280
drive.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.060
Throughout those dozens
of helical inserts

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.240
and super inertia
organus sensitives,

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.260
I'd been silently cursing
my teacher thinking

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.409
about like everybody
else in the class,

00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:58.950
"So what if we can
fly these jalopies

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.700
from one galaxy to another?

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.499
Nobody will ever be
able to ride in them--

00:21:02.499 --> 00:21:04.290
not with the psychic
and physiologic shells

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.500
hanging around this
cluster of the universe."

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.960
Back in the dormitory,
I was lying on my bed,

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.760
scraping graphite
lubricant from my nails

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.950
with the end of my slide
rule and half reading

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.860
a folded back copy of The
Young Mechanic when I saw

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.290
the article and the pictures.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.080
Through some freakish
accident, two people

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.880
had been discovered
who didn't crack up

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.700
at 20,000 light years
off the galactic rim, who

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.470
didn't die at 25,000.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.510
- At the time The Star
Pit was written in 1967,

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.120
we were overcoming obstacles
to human spaceflight

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.340
by relying on
chemical propulsion

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.010
and the work of human
computers like the black women

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.100
depicted in the
film Hidden Figures.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.960
Within a couple of
years, astronauts

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.810
would land on the moon and
return safely to Earth.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.720
As humans reckoned with
the possibility of escaping

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.750
Earth's orbit for the
first time in real life,

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.020
Delany imagined the
fictitious mechanic, Vyme,

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.420
working on flying machines
that would confront us

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.780
with new hazards.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.970
The model keeler-intergalactic
drive, to which he refers,

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.060
would be the engine for a new
spacecraft intended for travel

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.040
beyond the Milky Way.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.630
The moment he is remembering
doesn't refer to its invention,

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.130
though.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.590
It was technically
possible to build it.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.520
Instead, it marks the discovery
of the new explorers among us

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.380
who would be able to fly it.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.990
In the guise of the head of
some commission that Vyme

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.700
is remembering from his
youth, Baird Searles' voice

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.130
re-enters the
broadcast to explain

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.990
why the few individuals capable
of movement between galaxies

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.854
are so exceptional.

00:22:45.854 --> 00:22:46.520
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.630
- --stellar travel has been
with us for three centuries.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.000
Intergalactic trade has
been an impossibility,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.730
not because of
mechanical limitations,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.370
but rather because of barriers
that till now we have not even

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.140
been able to define.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.810
Some psychic shock causes
insanity in any human,

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.080
or for that matter,
any intelligent species

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.810
or perceptual
machine or computer

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:11.690
that goes more than 20,000 light
years from the galactic rim--

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.900
then complete physiological
death, as well as

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.800
recording breakdown in computers
that might replace human crews.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.080
Yet, just when we had
to face the black limit

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.500
of intergalactic space, bright
resources glittered within.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.080
Some few of us whose
sense of reality

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.020
has been shattered by infantile,
childhood, or prenatal trauma,

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.150
whose physiological and
psychological orientation

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:38.200
makes life in our interstellar
society painful or impossible--

of these golden--

static or the gentleman

- --can make the

sans noun, stuck.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.395
- This moment represents the
crux of my interest in The Star

00:23:58.395 --> 00:24:00.910
Pit for several reasons.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.180
One reason is that Vyme
tells us in the print

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.030
version of this story
that he remembers

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.580
learning to use
the term "golden"

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.760
to refer to people
who can withstand

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.080
intergalactic travel
from hearing it

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.760
in the voice of an
authority figure.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.210
The radio production
reinforces the significance

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:22.140
of hearing credible information
in an authoritative voice

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.960
by recreating that
moment for the listener,

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.910
placing us in the
position we're meant

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.940
to imagine Vyme was in when
he hears it for the first time

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.640
more than 300 years
into the future.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.390
Another reason this
moment is compelling--

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.690
and here is in the grammar
of this fictitious term

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.510
of identification for
potential space travelers,

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.880
these so-called "golden."

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.900
According to Vyme's
recollection,

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.870
he's not sure whether there was
static or the gentleman coughed

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.450
between using golden
as an adjective

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.690
and continuing his locution with
the predicate of the sentence--

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.610
"not all, but a
few of these golden

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.660
can make the
crossing and return."

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.750
In the broadcast, Delany
and his interlocutors

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.750
conspire to reproduce the
ambiguity around whatever

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.720
prevented Vyme from
hearing the word modified

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.120
by that adjective, golden.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.400
The spokesman was
already a bit congested

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.220
when he began reporting
the discovery of golden,

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.230
and he clears his
throat a few times.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.870
Then, as if to double
the uncertainty,

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.780
the sounds of a
coughing fit and static

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.500
compete with the voice of
Vyme, saying the lines,

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.900
"there was static or
the gentleman coughed."

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.110
Even though the story takes
place in the far future,

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.300
the community depicted
in The Star Pit

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.390
finds out about the possibility
of intergalactic travel

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.620
for the first time by listening
to some sort of radio.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.600
An interference of an
indeterminate nature

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.810
prevents them from knowing
exactly to whom or what

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.920
golden initially refers
apart from the example set

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:06.090
by the persons to whom the term
applies and what they can do.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.750
In this radio play, in its
fictitious future world,

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.730
the content of being golden--

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.580
being able to travel
between galaxies--

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.860
is literally unspeakable.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.700
I'm fascinated by this problem
because The Star Pit also

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.270
revolves around the prejudice
that Vyme and his peers

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.780
feel toward people
who are golden.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.630
Virtually, all the characters
we meet in the story

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.860
regard golden with a mix
of envy and derision.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.430
The plot is driven
principally by a scenario

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.030
in which one of Vyme's
friends invites certain death

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:46.440
by pretending to be golden when
he actually isn't, so that he

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.250
can steal away on a ship
headed out to deep space

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.310
where he, like any
person who isn't golden,

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.700
will lose his mind.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.520
The epigraph to the magazine
version of The Star Pit,

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.930
which never appears beyond the
title page of the printed text

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.970
and is never spoken
in the radio play,

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:08.030
reads, "We were trapped in the
tiny, billion-star backyard

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:13.970
of our own galaxy while the
golden roamed the universe."

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:18.230
For the most part, the actions
of golden within the text

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.980
consist of anti-social
behavior and willful ignorance

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.960
regarding their privilege.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.610
In light of the
extraordinary liberties

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.010
they enjoy, it's hard
not to sympathize

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.980
with the protagonist's opinion
that golden are alternately

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.040
mean and stupid.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.320
The first direct
confrontation that Vyme

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.130
has with a golden character in
the text affirms this attitude.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.740
When he narrowly
avoids a collision

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.550
with an intergalactic
spaceship whose pilot as a rule

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.850
has to be golden, we
begin to understand

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.030
why they attract such an
odd, unnameable resentment,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.820
something that can't be
spoken to any other way.

00:28:00.194 --> 00:28:00.860

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.630
I'd never heard of

We came this close to
ramming another ship.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.250
Consider how much
empty space there is.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.559
The chances are infinitesimal.

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:13.100
And on top of that,
every ship should

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.780
be broadcasting an
identification beam

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.600
at all times, but this big
bulbous keeler-intergalactic

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.292
slid by so close I could see
her through the front viewport.

00:28:20.292 --> 00:28:21.500
Our inertia system went nuts.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.720
We jerked around in the
stasis whirl from the keeler.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.295
I slammed on the video intercom
and shouted, "you great

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.480
the commonality here reminds
me that in the flashback

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.300
to his youth, Vyme recalled
the discovery of the first two

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.670
golden by using the epithet,
"a little Oriental girl,"

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.950
to identify one of them.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.100
This superannuated
vocabulary of racial identity

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.100
in the story reiterated
during the broadcast

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.860
intensifies my
attention to what goes

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.230
unsaid in the fictitious
language community The Star

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.160
Pit represents.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.530
While any number of more
benign and less loaded

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.900
words for racial
identities assigned

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.210
to people with African
and Asian origins

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.580
are available at the time
the story is written--

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.450
the word Negro, for instance,
appears in the radio play--

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.990
the presence of
these outmoded terms

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.880
engenders a stark
contrast with the absence

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.300
of a referent for golden.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.960
Immediately after his run-in
with the intergalactic pilot,

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.180
Vyme struggles to
articulate what's

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.960
happened because there are no
words to characterize golden

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.010
except "golden."

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:05.676
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:30:05.676 --> 00:30:07.430
- I slammed on
the video intercom

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.440
and shouted, "you
great big stupid--

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.660
stupid--" The other
pilot came bellowing

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.220
from behind the sleeper curtain
and started cursing me out.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.180
"Damn it, it was one of those--"
and I lost all the profanity

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.890
I knew to my rage-- "golden."

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:19.772
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.770
- Delany, the author, is as
adept at using profane language

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.380
as he is at crafting metaphors.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.710
But when it comes to creating
a voice and a vocabulary

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.860
for this character, the
speaker and narrator,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.960
the antagonism that
golden represents

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.300
has to be utterly unspeakable.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:46.460
golden is a new, unnamed form
of difference within the human,

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.330
as well as a new heretofore
inconceivable relationship

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.710
between the human and space.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.390
It's tempting to
say the term golden

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.260
is tantamount to
profanity all by itself,

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.400
although being golden confers
an absolute maximum potential

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.670
for mobility across
far-flung galaxies.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.610
And because they're so integral
to intergalactic trade,

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.710
the basis of the
economy of the future,

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:15.560
they must enjoy social
mobility in society.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.550
It also coincides with
certain disadvantages

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.640
in psychological and
emotional well-being that

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.030
limit the life chances
of the larger group

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.940
to which all golden belong.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.920
As the head of the
commission said,

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.420
golden are a fraction of that
segment of the population whose

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.720
physiological or
psychological orientation

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.340
makes life in their interstellar
society painful or impossible.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.310
The suggestion here, quite
contrary to the epigraph

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.880
that occurs as an editorial
supplement to the story

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.820
but whose words are never
spoken within the text,

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.640
is that what it
means to be golden

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.550
is bound up with what
it means to inhabit

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.110
a status of disability.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.720
With this hypothesis
in mind, I want

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.870
to shift our interpretation
of the imagery in The Star Pit

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.620
away from the abstract,
the far-fetched,

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.130
and back toward more
familiar concerns.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:19.160
Golden is not an allegory for
human difference in general

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.620
because there is no such thing
as human difference in general.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.610
There are only differences.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.570
Golden doesn't refer
to any of them.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.840
It's a metaphor that doesn't
have a referent of its own--

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.020
in literary terms,
a catachresis.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.600
As Lisa [? Frankel ?]
defines the term,

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.750
it's the use of a borrowed
word for something that

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.820
doesn't have a name of its own.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.990
Catachresis invokes a world
whose contours and contents

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:51.250
are already shaped but
not named by language.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.340
This is a world that comes
to us already articulated

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.540
in process by trope, a
world chewed up by language

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:03.690
before we meaning makers
even arrive on the scene.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.270
A great deal of interest
in speculative fiction

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.400
emanates from its
potential to illuminate

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.070
power dynamics in the
actually existing world

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.930
through metaphorical figures.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.050
Elves bring us face to
face with enslaved Africans

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.060
or oppressed workers.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.580
Men experience the
subordination that women

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.590
suffer due to patriarchy.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:27.600
Exoplanets provide the staging
ground for colonial encounters.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.940
Yet frequently I observe
the most valuable insights

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.910
a story has to offer about
systems of social advantage

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:37.980
and exploitation occur
in familiar forms.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.740
Trying to explain
why people like Vyme

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.040
resent golden, according to the
internal logic of the story,

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.020
only takes us so far.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.950
Racial difference persists into
The Star Pit's imagined future.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.770
It hasn't been replaced
or superseded by golden.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.560
Likewise, the presence
of golden in their ranks

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.440
hasn't supplanted
prejudice against people

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.860
whose physiological and
psychological orientation

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.410
makes life painful
or impossible.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.420
It just constructs
a single quality

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.489
that they're
predisposed to possess,

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:12.880
namely the capacity to
endure intergalactic travel

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.920
without cracking
up, as something

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.350
desirable within
certain situations.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.960
The rarity of this
quality is part of what

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.360
makes it a source of intrigue.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.760
It inspires the search
for golden prospects

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.060
throughout the population,
which underscores their presence

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.980
across all putative racial
groups, all sexes, all genders,

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:38.690
on all planets, and implicitly
at many, if not all, ages.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:42.020
The demand for what golden can
do in the future envisioned

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.290
by The Star Pit changes the
valuation of the symptoms

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.690
they share with
their peers, symptoms

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:51.350
that present themselves as
disabilities to the point

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.860
that characters appear in
the story having matured

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.040
under circumstances that
inculcates psychosis where

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.050
it wasn't present before--

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.680
that is, they acquire the
precipitating conditions

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.290
for being golden
on the off chance

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.260
that, in a population
with a greater

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.970
proportion of
psychotics, there will

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.350
be more intergalactic explores.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.940
Within the
protagonist's lifetime,

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.640
in the duration of the
story, being golden shifts

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.480
from a possibility that's been
discovered to a probability

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.090
influenced by intentional
manipulation of variables

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.710
that include the viability
of human life itself.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.130
It's a form of madness induced
within a minority in order

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.340
to spare the majority of people
from experiencing anything

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.190
like it.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.960
How are we supposed
to make sense of this?

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.470
In The War of the Worlds, it's
the microbial life on Earth

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.740
that spells death for
the invading martians.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.650
No adaptation, no
resistance, no intention

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.530
spares humanity from
the conquering violence.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.140
Human survival is
an ancillary benefit

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.260
of a massively disrupted
ecosystem brought back

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.680
into what passes for equilibrium
by unforeseen, largely

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.460
invisible interactions.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.540
There's nothing unique about
the world inside of HG Wells'

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.360
imagination that resolves
the problems he's

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.040
created in the story.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.960
Ultimately, the
reader or listener

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.210
has to borrow knowledge
from the world

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.820
that's taught us everything
we know, which also taught

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.070
Wells everything
he knew, in order

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:24.160
to understand what happens.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.880
In order to learn from the
way that The Star Pit uses

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:32.260
catachresis to name something
that's simultaneously like

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.410
and also unlike
actually existing

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:38.260
socially meaningful
differences, we

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.260
need to think critically about
what aspects of the world

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:47.150
as we know it make the idea
of being golden meaningful.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:50.100
What do we know about
the traumatic situations

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.470
that make life
painful or impossible

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.690
for some members of society?

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:56.370
How do we know that?

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.500
What kind of
stories let us know?

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.750
Stories about life being
painful or impossible

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.260
for some members of society
are often tragedies,

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.490
but they don't have to be.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:13.000
Tragedy is a genre, just like
science fiction, romance,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.990
and horror are genres.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:17.890
They are subject
to interpretation.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.980
The Star Pit relies on the
audience's understanding

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.110
that congenital
and early childhood

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:26.380
conditions can precipitate
traumatic experiences

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.100
in mental health.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.360
However, I think people
keep tuning in to stories

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.790
that could be
tragedies or that just

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:36.970
seem easy to place
within a tradition,

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.280
based on the tropes
they employ, in order

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.250
to find out whether every
instance of storytelling

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.100
in the genre will
be a known quantity

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.890
or whether it will turn
out to be something else.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.920
So just because the
kind of person you are

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.020
has been the
protagonist of a tragedy

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.210
doesn't mean that's
what your story will be.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.690
What do we know about the
narrow range of situations

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:03.860
in which symptoms of trauma
that are typically constructed

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:08.570
as disabilities appear to
confer competitive advantages

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.000
or adaptive strategies?

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.860
What are those stories like?

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.720
Whose stories are they?

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.280
Who tells them?

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.950
The Star Pit is in part
one of these stories,

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:23.300
but it's not the only one.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.180
It's not even the best one.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.780
Some of these narratives
are animated by the figure

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:32.530
of the savant, sometimes
constructed medically

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.290
as a person with
savant syndrome,

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:41.120
or in much less benign language
in the time Delany was writing.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.900
Depending on how we regard such
figures and how we interpret

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.770
their stories, we bear witness
to a range of solidarities--

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:51.890
to empathy, to
prejudice, to envy,

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.170
to ignorance and to
other relations--

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.670
that provide the
frame of reference

00:38:55.670 --> 00:39:01.560
for what it's like to be
golden and what it's not like.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.110
Given what we know
about the way society

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.990
marginalizes people
with disabilities,

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.390
what do we know about
the way other forms

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:13.050
of social marginalization,
such as racism and poverty,

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.390
influence the meaning
of disability?

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.940
If golden belonged
to a population

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.720
among whom every
member experiences

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.820
painful or impossible
circumstances

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.330
due to their physiological
and psychological orientation,

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.360
how can we use our
knowledge about what

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.510
influences the
experience of disability

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.330
to make sense of that?

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.240
Disabled people of color tell
the most interesting stories

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.150
in this regard and the
most informative stories

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.450
because they live at that
intersection of forces

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.030
in a way that requires
them to access,

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:52.220
to produce, and to disseminate
knowledge about it.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.170
These are some of
the sources I'm

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.840
using to demystify
the role of race

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.170
in science fiction radio drama.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.830
And this is where
I have to ask you

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:04.820
in joining me to take a leap
away from sorting knowledge

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.910
into disciplines and back
toward the establishing ground

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:11.360
of the way we think
about race and genre.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.510
The Star Pit is a
science fiction story

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:15.460
among other things,
and my research

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.610
is as much about stories in the
fantastic genres and the way

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.070
they're told as it
is about the story

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:25.000
that science fiction tells
itself about its history.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.760
As I work to understand the
integral part that radio

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.940
has played in propagating
speculative fiction,

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.360
I'm also working to comprehend
how that mode of storytelling

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.370
takes place in a world where
distinctions of medium, genre,

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:44.100
and methodology are not the most
important kind of difference.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.530
Stories like The
Star Pit use language

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:51.060
to depict a changed world with
new differences that matter,

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.460
yet they're told in this
world where people see, hear,

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.090
and imagine things that are
imprecise and unspeakable.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.970
The way we learn about
these unspeakable things

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.310
makes a difference
in whether and how

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.530
we understand what
they mean, even

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.940
though they can't be named.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.400
Audiofuturism is about
the difference made

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.430
by stories that come to
us through the radio,

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.640
but it's also about
listening to black people

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.470
and finding out what
kind of stories resonate.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.230
Thank you.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.130
