00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.410
Based on the data below,
which student's score improved

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.960
the most between the
midterm and final exams?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.000
And so they give us
this data in terms

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.110
of a bar graph for each student.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.340
We actually have two bars
that show the midterm in blue

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.790
and then the final exam in red.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.760
And they tell us that here--
midterm in blue and final exam.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.560
And sometimes this is called
a two-column bar graph

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.850
because for each student here
you have two columns of data.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.990
So if you were to actually
look at the data itself,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.830
you have the midterm
data and then

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.040
you have the final exam data.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.140
Now, they're asking us which
student's score improved

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.980
the most between the
midterms and the final exams?

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.944
So if we look at
Jasmine right over here,

00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:42.610
might as well start
with her since she's

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.950
the most to the left.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.059
It looks like she definitely
did improve from the midterm

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:47.600
to the final.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.600
It looks like in the
midterm, if I had to guess,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.220
this looks like about
a, I don't know,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.530
it looks like she got
maybe about a 72 or 73

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.250
on the midterm.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.700
I'm just guessing because I
don't know the exact number.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.116
And then it looks like on the
final she got, I don't know,

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:03.632
that looks like maybe a
77 or 78 approximately.

00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:05.590
So she improved a little
bit, about five points

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.922
from the midterm to the final.

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.880
The way that they've
given us this information,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.150
we don't know the exact
numbers because it's not

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.194
super precise in terms
of marking off the bars,

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:14.610
but hopefully it'll
become obvious

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.000
when we look through
everyone's scores.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.030
Let's look at Jeff.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.960
So Jeff actually did worse from
the midterm to the final exam.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.560
He got looks like over
an 85 on the midterm

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.150
and then on the final he
got about 84 or an 85.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.280
So he actually went down.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.520
So it's definitely not Jeff.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.300
He definitely did
not improve the most.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.000
He actually went down.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.790
Next, if you think
about Nevin, it

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.990
looks like Nevin actually
improved about the same amount

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.950
as Jasmine.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.850
On both scores, I don't know if
Nevin is a boy or girl's name,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.130
this person on both tests, this
person did better than Jasmine,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.680
but it looks like the actual
improvement is about the same.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.520
Looks like they went from
about 83 to, I don't know,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.850
about an 88.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.730
I'm just estimating
it, just trying

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.640
to look at this axis
right over there

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.997
and estimating what
those scores are.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.580
So Nevin and Jasmine right now,
based on the three we've seen,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.250
are tied for the lead.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.870
Now let's look at Alejandra.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.430
Now Alejandra-- OK,
so this jumps out.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.110
She definitely improved
dramatically from the midterm

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.140
to the final exam.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.660
It looks like on the midterm
she maybe got an 81 or an 82.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.330
So maybe this was an 82
she got on the midterm,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.879
and then on the final, it
looks she got about a 95

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.420
on the final.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.950
So there's dramatic improvement.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.900
So right now Alejandra
is the leading contender

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.690
for most improved from
the midterm to the final.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.240
And then finally
Marta, right over here,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.120
it looks like she actually
got worse from the midterm

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.750
to the final.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.630
She scored in the mid-90s
in the midterm and then low

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.710
90s in the final.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.010
So she's definitely
not the most improved.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.050
So the winner here is Alejandra.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.750
Alejandra is the most
improved between the midterm

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.991
and the final exam.
