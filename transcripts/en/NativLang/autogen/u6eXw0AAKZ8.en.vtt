00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.600
Time ticks forward in English, but did you
know in Mandarin earlier is up

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.240
and later is down?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.930
Or that the Yucatec Maya have no word for
before or after?

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.759
These sound like the kind of fun facts you
share with a friend and move on.

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.439
But for linguists, time is at the center of
a major debate: are there languages where

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.000
time just doesn't work like we think it does?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.290
There's a linguist who's spent his entire
career documenting and trying to understand

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.860
one language: Hopi.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.230
After four years of fieldwork in Arizona,
on the Third Mesa, surely he has real insights

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.440
to share about every aspect of the language.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.070
And yet in this long book he focuses on just
one: Hopi Time.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.350
Over 600 pages of Hopi Time, with example
after example of how, just like English, Hopi

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.840
has words for time, like "later" or "temporarily".

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.010
The Hopi count days.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.850
They use terms like "over there" as spatial
metaphors for time.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.930
And their verbs have tenses: they can mark
the future with -ni.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.520
Time, time, everywhere time!

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240
Ok, so the Hopi can tell time.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.600
What's the big deal?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.499
Well, it must've mattered to someone, because
linguists and psychologists and people who'd

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:27.920
never heard a word of Hopi in their lives
grabbed the book and held it high as proof

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.810
that time was universal for humans.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.030
And then they cursed the name of Whorf.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.159
Whorf was wrong!

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.880
Whorf was a charlatan!

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.590
Whorf was a con man!

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.700
Hold on, what's the fuss?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.560
Who ever said that Hopi doesn't think about
the past, present and future?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.840
Plus who's this Whorf and why is he getting
picked on so much?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.189
Whorf was a fire inspector.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.779
But one with a unique hobby: Uto-Aztecan languages.

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:03.600
This curiosity led him Sapir, who took Whorf
under his wing.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.649
Psst, hey, I've got some literature that'll
blow your mind.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.080
See, Humboldt and Boas taught us how different
cultures subconsciously categorize the world

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.349
based on language.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.970
But I think there's more.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.560
I think people are at the mercy of language.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.330
We're not living in the objective world, man,
we're living through our language.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.730
Hah, what an odd idea.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.430
But as Whorf turned to another Uto-Aztecan
language, he started to see it.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.290
Hopi seemed so un-European to him in the way
it handled time.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.069
There was no substance called "time".

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.040
No timeline that could be cut and counted.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.530
No space as a metaphor for time, as if you
could move through time.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.170
Not even a past, a present or a future tense.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.840
The more Whorf studied Hopi, the more he concluded
that the arrow of time isn't something that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.569
exists in our objective world.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.610
Instead, we think about time this way because
we speak Standard Average European.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.900
The Hopi don't share our concept of time because
they speak Hopi.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.360
How do the Hopi live without tense?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.469
Well, for Whorf, Hopi time is about cycles,
rituals, mental preparation for key events.

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.900
Above all, they have no objective time.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.500
Sapir died at age 55 and Whorf joined him
a couple years later, aged 44.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.000
But his ideas were captivating: do people
think about time

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.280
differently in different languages?

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.750
Does your language shape your concept of time?

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.120
Does the language you speak determine whether
or not time even exists for you?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.579
These claims, from weak to strong, got the
nickname "Sapir-Whorf", which I often hear

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.800
pronounced "SA-pir Whorf".

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.260
Hopi Time became its poster child.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.220
And an ever-growing big fish tale.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.220
Hopi is innocent of a category for time.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.120
No, worse, our concept of time would be incomprehensible
to them.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.580
Better yet, the reason you have clocks and
watches is because you aren't Hopi.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.150
Hah, and my favorite, Hopi time makes for
better family therapy than the Aristotelian

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.200
reality Western parents are stuck in.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.100
So now do you see the power of these 600 pages
spent vanquishing Whorf

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.000
and mainstreaming Hopi?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.660
Linguists had had enough.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.620
Many of them wanted to focus on what made
language universal and innate to all of us.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.810
Stop parading Hopi around as an exotic oddity.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.500
We all think the same way, we just express
ourselves with a little linguistic flair.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.800
So then, time is time is time.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.300
It's settled.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.060
Not quite.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.700
Dot-dot-dot.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.650
Years after Hopi Time, researchers claimed
they'd found new evidence showing Whorf was

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.210
right about time all along.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.910
Like this set of experiments playing on the
difference between how English and Mandarin

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.900
speakers use space to talk about time.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.500
"Earlier" is to your left and "later" to your
right in English, but in Mandarin things get

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.930
vertical: "earlier" is up and "later" down.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.190
Even though these experiments were conducted
entirely in English, native Mandarin speakers

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.300
were quicker to answer simple questions about
earlier or later after being primed with vertical

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.639
cues, while native English speakers were faster
after horizontal cues.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.000
Thinking about time, it seemed, was shaped
by language.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.169
The masses were intrigued, myself included.

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.200
Someone passed me a link to it in my work inbox years ago,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.600
and I wasn't even with linguists.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.440
But in the comments of my old video about
Whorf, a researcher did mention having trouble

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.510
replicating these results.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.900
From what I've read since then, that commenter
isn't alone.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.020
Still, it was just one of the many Whorf-like
effects that kept making the news, some from

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.600
scientific tests in the lab, others from fieldwork
on the ground.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.870
So in the Central Andes, there's a language
spoken by millions called Aymara.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.000
In Aymara, your nayra, your "eye" is in front
of you, and your qhipa, your "back"

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.669
is behind you.

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.360
That's normal, but this isn't.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.879
When talking about time, the Aymara speak
as if they face the past, but they have their

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:17.861
backs to the future.

00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:22.500
They even point behind their backs to gesture
into the future.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.300
So their eyes are exactly where your eyes
are,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.690
but their past is not where your past is.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.020
Rare.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.360
Unique.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.250
But there's something else about Aymara...
and Hopi.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.700
At second glance, some linguists tell us both of them are best viewed as tenseless.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.190
Wait, there are timeless languages out there?

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.870
Well, kind of.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.000
Tenseless.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.250
It's not as odd as it first sounds.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.970
We already know of languages that are uncontroversially
tenseless.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.200
Take Yucatec Maya.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.050
Not only are they missing a past, present
and future tense, they even lack words like

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.919
"before", "until" and "after".

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.800
How in the world do they talk about time?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.000
Well, strategies.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.400
Complex strategies like context and aspect.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.200
It could make a fun followup to dig into the mechanics of

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.860
how tenseless languages talk about time.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.000
But good luck proving any of this makes them experience time

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.560
in a fundamentally different way.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:31.520
Yucatec speakers do fine in experiments about
linear time, and any effects are subtle.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.379
See, if you read the research and not the
breaking headlines, "strong" ideas of language

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.979
determining time, those are out.

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:44.770
Any ongoing debates are about subtler influences.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.069
In the end, languages do talk about time differently,
but it's harder to get speakers to behave

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.500
differently based on their language.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.600
But I'll level with you.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.620
I get the sense that trivia about time and
tenses was never the point.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:03.040
Hopi time became a mascot for a grander idea:
linguistic relativity.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.949
Or as Sapir put it, different societies live
in distinct worlds, not merely the same world

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:11.430
with different labels attached.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.789
That's an idea I suspect we'll run into again
in the future.

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:19.000
Until then, stick around and subscribe for
language!
