00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.160
Welcome to Crash Course Economics. I'm Adriene Hill.
And I'm Jacob Clifford.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.980
Now, believe it or not, we actually read
many of your comments on YouTube!

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.000
First!
Some are productive, and others, not so much.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.940
This guy looks like Mark Cuban,
but not as attractive or rich.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.880
We've noticed that some people are disappointed we haven't covered the different economic ideologies.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.720
You're ignoring the Austrian School! What is this Keynesian trash?

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.720
Well guess what, today we're gonna talk about other schools of economic thought.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.720
[Theme Music]

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.460
To understand these economic theories, we're gonna have to jump into a little bit of history.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.880
In 1798, a British economist named Thomas Malthus argued that population growth would outpace food

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.780
production, so, eventually, humans
will run out of food and starve.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.400
You wonder why some people call economics the "dismal science..."

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.640
Well, Malthus was wrong. Dismally wrong.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.840
The world population has grown from one billion in his time to over seven billion today.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.660
And it turns out that the famines we have seen are largely manmade disasters

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.320
that have very little to do with
our ability to produce food.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.100
But Malthus was writing at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution;

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280
he didn't factor in advancements in technology,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.560
agriculture production, or transportation.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.480
So with the information he had, he was kinda right.
But he was still wrong.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.760
Economic theories are constantly being proven, disproven, and revised. The problem is,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.900
when these theories are wrong, millions of people can be adversely affected.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.660
Take Malthus. Some scholars combine his ideas with those of Charles Darwin and concluded that giving

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.020
assistance to poor people and social programs like welfare are actually immoral.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.880
This is called Social Darwinism, and it's completely wrong.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.540
Now, economics is not an exact science.
It aims to draw conclusions about human behavior

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.780
without the benefits of labs or perfect control groups. Economic theories reflect different attitudes about

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.680
human nature and those are likely to change over time.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.140
The founder of modern economics was
a Scottish philosopher named Adam Smith.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.500
In 1776, his book, The Wealth of Nations, was published.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.460
It was an organized discussion about production, markets, and economic theory.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.080
And it was tremendously influential.
Smith introduced the idea that a person

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.680
following their own self-interest could end
up serving the common good.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.600
He also advocated free trade.
Many countries at the time

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.460
had heavy tariffs which protected their domestic manufacturers at the expense of trade.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.140
A generation later, British economist David Ricardo
expanded on Smith's ideas by introducing

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.520
the theory of comparative advantage: the idea that two people or countries can both benefit from trade,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.460
even if one of them can produce more of everything.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.800
When both focus on what they're best at and then trade, everyone benefits.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.040
Anyway, the field of economics grew, advancing
ideas like private property and free markets

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.040
and then along comes the Communist Manifesto
in 1848. Rather than examining individual behavior,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.300
German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
looked at economic classes and argued that

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.080
history was explained by the conflict
between workers and property owners.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.720
This process would inevitably lead workers
to overthrow their bosses, ushering in a new

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.260
stateless and classless system called communism.
Marx followed this up with Das Kapital.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.540
Political movements spawned by Marxist
economics challenged Adam Smith's view that

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.500
individual self-interest serves the common good.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.740
The end result was two main camps:
free market capitalism supporting private property,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.860
and communism, advocating collective
ownership of the means of production.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.040
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Despite Marx's challenge,
market-based economic theory continued to dominate

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.460
through the end of the 19th century with contributions from French, British, and American economists.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.060
This body of thought is called classical economics,
and it was embodied in a book called

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.280
Principles of Economics, published in 1890
by English economist Alfred Marshall.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.660
Marshall organized into fine concepts we still use today,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.860
like supply and demand and marginal utility, which we're gonna get to soon,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.460
but as capitalism was expanding around =
the world, Marxist movements were, too.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.420
By the early 20th century, this battle for hearts and minds, along with political and social unrest in Europe,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.400
led to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.000
As communism was maturing in the Soviet Union,
the Great Depression crushed the market economies

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.660
of the world's richest countries.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.200
It also dealt a devastating blow to classical economics.
The theories of Smith and Marshall

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.220
didn't have much to say about how something
like this could happen or how to fix it.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.680
The British economist John Maynard Keynes
proposed new answers in his 1936 book,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.820
A General Theory of Money, Interest, and Employment,
which basically launched the field of macroeconomics.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.980
Along with John Hicks, Keynes argued that
market economies don't self-correct quickly

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.280
because prices and wages take time to adjust.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.400
They claimed that during recessions it is necessary for the government to get involved using monetary and

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.480
fiscal policy to increase output and decrease unemployment.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.860
Keynes wasn't supporting communism, but his
views directly challenged classical economists,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.040
who saw government intervention as universally harmful for the economy.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.300
Now, eventually, Keynesian economics became
part of mainstream economic theory.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.000
See, I told you, economic theory changes over time!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.040
And all it took in this case was a catastrophic global depression.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.480
Keynes' ideas, combined with the ever-present Marxist critique, opened the door to more and more government involvement.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.480
Since the Great Depression, many nations have pursued a political and economic ideology called socialism,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.620
although socialist ideas and policies have been around since the 19th century.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.520
In most cases, these economies allow for private property and markets,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.800
but also have government ownership of industry,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.300
significant regulation, and big public programs like universal health care.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.980
The Scandinavian countries, like Norway and
Sweden, they love these socialist policies.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.880
Now, the US has rejected many of these socialist ideas,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.280
but the US government, or at least the economists that advise politicians,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.440
are clearly in favor of using Keynesian economic
policies when the economy is in trouble.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.780
But as socialism and Keynesian economics expanded,
other groups continued to forcefully push

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.660
for private property and free markets. The most
vocal was often the Austrian School of economics.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.140
They also have a very vocal fan base in our comments section. Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.740
who were, unsurprisingly, from Austria,
argued that heavy state involvement

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.100
has never produced the results it promised,
and that regulation and government tinkering

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.400
is actually a problem, not a solution.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.020
Rejecting nearly all forms of fiscal and monetary policy,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.860
the Austrian School today argues the economy's
just too complicated to manipulate.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.560
This backlash against government intervention
was carried forward in the US by Milton Friedman.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.720
Like the Austrians, Friedman advocated privatization of many functions that have been assumed by government,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.600
famously proposing school vouchers and deregulation of the economy.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.300
He also concluded that the Great Depression could be blamed on botched monetary policy,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.780
rather than some inherent fault of capitalism.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.720
The theories of Friedman and his followers
at the University of Chicago came to be called

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.680
the Chicago school of economics.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.760
Friedman's views got a huge boost in the 1970s.
At that time, inflation soared while output stagnated.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.240
Remember stagflation? A combination that Keynesian economics had trouble reconciling.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.980
Some macroeconomists drew on the insights of the Chicago school

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.980
to claim that these events disprove Keynesian economics.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.140
Building on the ideas of Friedman, another theory of economics gained traction: monetarism.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.960
Whew, Stan! So many -isms!

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.960
Monetarists focused on price stability and argue the

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.420
money supply should be increased slowly and

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.340
predictably to allow for steady growth.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.240
At about the same time, another theory called

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.520
supply-side economics, or sometimes called trickle-down economics, entered the mainstream.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.700
Supply-side economists advocated deregulation

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.900
and cutting taxes, especially corporate taxes.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.500
Mainstream economics today takes ideas from both

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.820
classical economics, including monetarism, and Keynesian economics.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.040
This unified theory is sometimes called the new neoclassical synthesis,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.900
and, yeah, economists are bad at naming things, too.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.480
But debates about how and when to implement policies continue,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.320
and, remember, these are more than just intellectual classroom spats.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.200
These policies affect millions of people.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.580
The different reactions to the global recession in 2008 are a good example of this.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.300
Some economists suggested using Keynesian policies, namely deficit spending.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.840
Other economists suggested the more classical approach of reining in excess spending

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.780
to reduce budget deficits, something called austerity.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:25.680
Believe it or not, economists are still fighting about which of these policies is the right approach and when to use them.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.100
We can all agree that Keynes was right
about at least one thing: when he said,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.880
"Ideas shape the course of history."

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.700
So, where are all these economic ideologies and theories gonna take us in the future?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.440
Most countries that once supported strict communism
like China and Cuba have moved toward capitalism.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.580
The only country that's really sticking with it is North Korea,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.040
but they're too isolated to be a real test case for an economic system.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.200
But this doesn't mean that Marxism is dead.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.940
Many capitalist countries have adopted socialist looking programs.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.900
It appears the world's economies are converging towards the middle.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.160
But in the end, it turns out it's just
really hard to predict the future,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.460
especially when we're talking about something
as complex as the world economy.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.540
Remember Malthus' belief that we're all gonna starve?

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.620
Well, like Malthus, we don't know what kind of
changes humanity's gonna face in the future.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:23.240
If history has proven anything about economic thought, it's that we should expect surprises that will upset

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.580
our current economic models. Just like Malthus
couldn't imagine that we'd all be alive today.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.580
