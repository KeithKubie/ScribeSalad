00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:03.409
&gt;&gt;Marco: Good afternoon.

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:04.850
Hello, I'm Marco Tempest.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.840
Thank you very much for coming to my short
presentation.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.830
I am a cyber illusionist.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.930
And today I'm going to show you some of the
secrets behind creating magic.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.390
Cyber illusionist, what does that mean?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.330
It means I combine magic and science to create
illusions.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.710
Arthur C. Clark said that "any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.710
magic."

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.210
That is true and we magicians have known this
for over two thousand years.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.899
Around 150 BC, Hero of Alexandria described
how the temples of Ancient Greece were filled

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.640
with magic.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.950
Others burst into flames.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.010
Door mysteriously opened.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.790
Musical instruments played as if touched by
the gods.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.059
Hero, a mathematician, also explained how
these miracles were accomplished.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.860
They were all magic tricks--applications of
the little-known sciences of hydraulics, pneumatics,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.700
and chemistry.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.400
But to the temple visitors, this was magic.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.979
Now, magic as an entertainment form has long
separated itself from the gods and superstition,

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.229
but it has always maintained its relationship
with science.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.250
Magicians are somewhat the original early
adapters of technology.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.030
Whenever we hear about a new development in
science, whether it's physics, optics, chemistry,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.760
or even psychology, we figure out ways to
use it in our magic, keeping one step ahead

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.190
of the public and following Arthur C. Clarke's
dictum, "in disguising science as magic."

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.980
Magic that we now accept as part of the world
of entertainment.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.899
Now, magic is a very introverted field.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.560
While scientists regularly publish their latest
research, we magicians do not like to share

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.020
our methods and secrets.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.220
That's true even amongst peers.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.260
But if we look at creative practice as a form
of research, or art as a form of R and D for

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.240
humanity, then how could a cyber illusionist
like myself share his research?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.000
Now my own specialty is combining digital
technology and magic.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.140
And it's about three years ago, I started
an exercise in openness and inclusiveness

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.360
by reaching out into the Open Source software
community to create new digital tools for

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.570
magic--tools that could eventually be shared
with its other artists to start them off further

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.730
along in the process and to get them to the
poetry faster.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.910
I'd like to share with you something that
came out of these collaborations.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.110
It's augmented reality projection tracking
and mapping system.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.240
And I brought it with me.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.870
So, let's have some fun with it.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.790
Let me start it up.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.740
[New Age music]

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.740
Wonderful.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.740
Alright.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.400
Now, my creative process always starts with
a blank canvas, which is equally frightening

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.360
and equally exciting.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.740
Frightening because of the endless possibilities
and exciting for the same reasons.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:24.000
But once I commit my first stroke, the adventure
begins.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.610
[drum beats]

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.410
[scratching]

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.020
[synthesizer notes]

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.830
[crash]

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.360
Forgot the floor.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.320
Sorry about that.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.630
[scratching]

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.950
Alright.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.270
Hey.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.910
Over here.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.540
Ah, no.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.180
This way.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.130
[upbeat synthesizer notes]

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.450
[scratching]

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.770
Please.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:40.590
OK, I know what you want.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:49.380
How about here?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.310
OK.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:06.970
OK, he got the hang of it.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:15.090
[laughter]

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:31.330
[drum beats]

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:47.570
[synthesizer notes]

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:55.690
OK.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:03.810
[crash]

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:21.350
OK, let's try this.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.050
[scratches]

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:35.440
Come on.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:53.400
Got that at the micro-kitchen.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.990
[laughter]

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.590
[flapping]

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.180
[bubbles]

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.780
Hey.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.030
Go for it.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.770
[kissing noise]

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.650
[laughter]

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.400
Bye, bye.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.300
Thank you.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.210
[applause]

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:36.290
So, in the spirit of a truly open source magician,
I wanna give you a sneak peak on how the system

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.380
actually works.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.729
In front of me is a small projector.

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:45.040
Mounted on the projector is high-speed camera.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.840
And the camera has an infrared pass band filter
attached to it, which enables the camera to

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.650
see infrared tracking markers, which are embedded
in the corners of this canvas.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:01.330
We can add a cookie from that micro-kitchen.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.350
I have a remote control that goes through
a playlist system.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:09.100
I'm tracking the position of the canvas about
80 to 90 times every second.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.270
And I have this thing, which is the peripheral
illumination, which is very cool.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:17.949
So, I have a virtual follow spot which illuminates
me but does not interfere with the video image.

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:26.139
I also have a drawing system, a 2-D particle
system, which can sprites and 2-D box physics.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.490
There's a 3-D model loader.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.490
There's like, various things.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:35.320
So, the tool is very extensible and very easy
to use for different type of productions.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:42.079
It can be used for projecting onto masks,
pieces of scenery, buildings and such.

00:08:42.079 --> 00:08:45.490
It's all created in a tool which is called
Open Frameworks.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:52.149
It's a C++ library for people who love to
play with multimedia and new media.

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:54.459
Thank you.

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:56.769
[applause]

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:02.580
It may be worth saying something at this point
about the nature of magic.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.580
What is magic?

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.100
And why do magic tricks fool us?

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.769
Now, magicians are often thought of as being
masters of sleight of hand.

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:13.050
The quickness of the hands deceives the eye.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.540
But that is not true.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.980
Magic does not depend on deceiving the eye.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.399
It depends on deceiving the brain.

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:22.390
The tricks of magicians are not designed to
fool the eye.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.230
The eye observes whatever is put in front
of it.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.949
It's the brain that translates the scene into
information.

00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:31.899
And the brain loves to look for patterns in
the environment.

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:37.600
The brain recognizes elements and assumes
that the things he sees now are exactly the

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.699
same as the things he has seen before.

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:45.579
Now we magicians take advantage of the brain's
lazy thinking because in a magic trick, nothing

00:09:45.579 --> 00:09:47.920
is ever as it seems.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.050
Magicians carefully design their tricks so
everything about them seems familiar.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.459
The props seem ordinary.

00:09:54.459 --> 00:09:57.100
The magicians actions above suspicion.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.949
Even the words we use seems straight-forward
and unambiguous.

00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:04.790
But this veneer of ordinariness covers many
deceptions.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.679
So, the eye sees everything, but the brain
is being fooled.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:12.200
Now, let me show you a card trick.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:19.149
And to make sure that I don't use any sleight
of hand, I'm gonna use some very big cards.

00:10:19.149 --> 00:10:22.730
And this is something we can all play along
together.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.490
And if you already know the outcome, play
along anyway.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.610
So, I've prepared five virtual playing cards.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.179
I want you all to remember one of these five
cards.

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:35.189
Remember the suit and remember the value.

00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:37.689
And make up your mind now, OK?

00:10:37.689 --> 00:10:39.009
Don't forget your card.

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:44.660
We gonna mix up the cards through some magical
touch screen technology.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.779
Yeah, OK.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:49.850
And I'm gonna remove one of the cards.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:50.950
How about this one?

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.140
This one.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:57.319
Now, if I was right, then your card is now
gone.

00:10:57.319 --> 00:10:58.319
Yeah?

00:10:58.319 --> 00:10:59.529
Did that work?

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:01.029
Well, don't worry about it.

00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:04.230
Mine actually disappeared, too.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.769
[laughs] Alright.

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:08.209
I'd like to show you another card trick.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.480
I brought something with me.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.470
I'm fascinated with card tricks.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.149
And there's always this dual reality.

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:19.850
That's what goes on for you guys out there.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:26.459
And then, there's what goes on in the mind
of cyber illusionists if he does something

00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:28.740
as simple as a trick with playing cards.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:35.540
So, I rigged up this contraption, which hopefully
will give you a glimpse.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.430
It can talk too.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:44.139
Which will give you a glimpse into the mind
of a techno magician when he does something

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:46.350
as simple as a trick with playing cards.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.829
I'm not sure I have enough light.

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:53.339
Is this all the light we had in the rehearsal,
or is there another level of light?

00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:54.420
Let's see.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.689
Otherwise, I'm gonna do a little bit of adjustment.

00:11:59.689 --> 00:12:02.449
To speed things up, so I have a deck of cards.

00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:05.800
I gonna select a card.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.060
Let's take one from the middle just like this.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.399
And then to make sure, this is perfect, thank
you.

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:17.279
And to make sure that we recognize it when
we see it again, I gonna mark it on the front

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:20.130
of the card just like this.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.660
Alright.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.589
Gonna put the card somewhere in the deck just
like this.

00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:31.730
And give the cards a quick cut, which is like
this.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:32.730
Alright.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.670
Now, for those of you don't play cards, a
deck of cards is made up of four different

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.620
suits.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.579
[pause]

00:12:43.579 --> 00:12:46.800
You know what?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.369
I cannot start this now.

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:56.129
I'm terribly sorry about that.

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:57.489
[pause]

00:12:57.489 --> 00:13:02.230
While this starts up, this is also created
in Open Framework.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:08.410
And I'm purposely using a super cheap camera
on this, which is a PlayStation 3i toy, like

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:18.799
a 30 dollar camera because I have quite a
few very enthusiastic fans which I love to

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:26.299
recreate the kinds of things I do and using
an inexpensive camera makes it much more possible

00:13:26.299 --> 00:13:27.499
for them.

00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:28.569
Alright.

00:13:28.569 --> 00:13:30.709
Let's see.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:31.779
OK.

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:37.749
So, for those of you don't play cards, a deck
of cards is made of four different suits.

00:13:37.749 --> 00:13:49.869
There's hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades.

00:13:49.869 --> 00:13:56.970
[female computer voice]

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:01.720
Performing magic is always about this multiple
layers of reality combining.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:12.350
Now, each of the four suits corresponds to
one of the four seasons.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:19.350
There's spring, the summer, fall, and winter.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.139
Mine, too.

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:29.149
Like magic, winter involves visual wonder,
drastic change, and delicate balance between

00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:31.999
its physical states.

00:14:31.999 --> 00:14:50.709
In each of the four suits--cut--is a total
of 13 cards, which is very interesting.

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:55.850
Over here we have low tides and then over
here, we have high tides.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:02.239
And then, in the middle, we have the moon.

00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:05.920
Hee, hee, hee.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.149
[laughter]

00:15:07.149 --> 00:15:09.499
There's two colors in a deck of cards.

00:15:09.499 --> 00:15:16.290
There's the color red and the color black.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:27.100
And they represent the constant changes from
day to night.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.480
In a complete deck of card, there's a total
of 52 cards.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:38.110
They represent the 52 weeks of a calendar.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.879
One more cut.

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:45.649
Three, six, five.

00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:59.040
OK, it's 364 plus the Joker makes it 365,
which is the exact amount of days between

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.609
our birthdays.

00:16:03.609 --> 00:16:05.929
And what else could I say?

00:16:05.929 --> 00:16:06.929
OK.

00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:07.929
Get rid of this.

00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:11.589
Now so, the cards are somewhat an ancient
calendar.

00:16:11.589 --> 00:16:20.540
And with this calendar, I have traveled around
the world, entertaining boys and girls, man

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:26.689
and woman, husbands and wives, kings and queens.

00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:27.850
And sometimes--.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:36.319
Now these guys can be real hecklers.

00:16:36.319 --> 00:16:37.319
Watch.

00:16:37.319 --> 00:16:38.319
Wake up.

00:16:38.319 --> 00:16:39.319
&gt;&gt;Joker: Woah.

00:16:39.319 --> 00:16:43.399
&gt;&gt;Marco: Are you ready?

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:44.399
&gt;&gt;Joker: Ready.

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:45.499
&gt;&gt;Marco: Let me see what you got.

00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:48.499
&gt;&gt;Joker: Presenting my pogo stick.

00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:50.910
&gt;&gt;Marco: Hey, watch out.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.910
&gt;&gt;Joker: Woah, woah, woah, woah.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:54.910
Ow.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.959
&gt;&gt;Marco: But today, I'm performing for a different
kind of audience.

00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:59.929
Today, I'm performing for you.

00:16:59.929 --> 00:17:01.730
Let's put this here.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.399
Sometimes people ask me, "Hey, Marco.

00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:08.300
To do magic, can you just work from nine to
five?"

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.300
Of course not.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.230
I work like everybody at Google.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:14.350
OK.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:21.430
24/7 might be a little bit of an exaggeration,
but it does take a lot of time to create magic.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.140
Now, some people will say, "Hey, magic.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:29.620
That's the work of some supernatural, evil
forces."

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:34.130
[laughter]

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:38.650
OK.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:45.450
No matter how this looks, to this, I just
say no, no.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.940
OK, in Swiss German, it's nein, nein.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.940
[laughter]

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.631
It's really not that intense, but I have to
warn you.

00:17:52.631 --> 00:17:59.540
If you ever play with somebody who is so good
with cards, don't play for money because even

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:06.440
if you receive a decent hand, they will be
prepared.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.570
[laughter]

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:14.520
And that leaves me with the last and most
important card of all.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.600
Let's see.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:35.810
This is, without a question, the real thing.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:36.810
Thank you.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.160
Thank you very much.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.450
[applause]

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.750
OK.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:52.490
This, again, uses a lot of fancy tracking
and stuff, so if any of you after the presentation

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.800
are interested to see a little bit behind
the screens, I'll hold the d-box screens open

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:03.040
and you're welcome to come up here and check
out how the tracking works and all the illusion

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.970
and making things disappear into the table
and such.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.450
I'd like to show you one last thing.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.630
It's a piece of software I've been working
on which synchronizes videos across multiple

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.220
screens of mobile devices.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.540
It's free.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.040
It's available at the App Store.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:26.810
Unfortunately, as of today, only on iOS, but
we're working super hard making this work

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.570
on Android devices.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:33.630
I brought these three iPods with me to show
you how it works.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:39.190
And I'm gonna use them to tell you a little
bit about my favorite subject, which is deception.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:45.940
Let's keep this up.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.620
OK.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.310
[laughter]

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.000
Yeah.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.680
Deception.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.950
One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:03.770
He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush
would bloom right in front of your eyes.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:09.070
But it was his production of a butterfly that
was the most beautiful.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:14.560
Ladies and gentlemen, the creation of lights.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:21.110
[children cheer]

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:28.780
When asked about deception, he said this,
"Magic is the only honest profession.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.810
A magician promises to deceive you and he
does."

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:36.500
I like to think of myself as an honest magician.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:43.410
I use a lot of tricks, which means that sometimes,
I have to lie to you.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.400
I feel bad about that.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.400
[laughter]

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.070
But people lie every day.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.070
[phone rings]

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.590
&gt;&gt;Woman: Hey, where are you?

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.370
&gt;&gt;Marco: I'm stuck in traffic.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.820
I'll be there soon.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.280
We've all done it.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.380
&gt;&gt;Woman #2: I'll be ready in just a minute,
darling.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.490
&gt;&gt;Man #1: It's just what I've always wanted.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.110
&gt;&gt;Woman: You were great.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.110
[laughter]

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.980
&gt;&gt;Marco: Deception.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.680
It's a fundamental part of life.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:20.520
Now, polls show that man tell twice as many
lies as a woman, assuming the woman he asked

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.670
told the truth.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.410
We deceive to gain advantage.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.410
And to hide our weaknesses.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:35.580
The Chinese General Sun Tzu said that all
war was based on deception.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.140
Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.730
Some people deceive for money.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.940
Let's play a game.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.110
Three cards.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.950
Three chances.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.400
One five will get you ten.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.870
One ten will get you 20.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.270
Now, where's the lady?

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.240
Where is the queen?

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.490
This one?

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.370
Sorry, you lose.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.370
[laughter]

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:03.820
I didn't deceive you.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.970
You deceived yourself.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:08.460
Self-deception.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:13.391
That's why we convince ourselves that a lie
is a truth.

00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:18.860
Now, sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.190
Compulsive gamblers are experts in self-deception.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.270
They believe they can win.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.180
They forget the times they lose.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.200
The brain is very good at forgetting.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.420
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:42.440
Bad experiences quickly disappear, which is
why in this vast and lonely cosmos, we are

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.850
so wonderfully optimistic.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.250
Our self-deception becomes a positive illusion.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:55.650
Why movies are able to take us on extraordinary
adventures.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.430
Why we believe Romeo, when he says he loves
Juliet.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:08.230
And why single notes of music, when played
together, become a sonata and conjure up meaning.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.930
That's Claire de Lune.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:17.500
It's composer Claude Debussy said that art
was the greatest deception of all.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:26.240
Art is a deception that creates real emotions--a
lie that creates the truth.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:41.400
And when you give yourself over to that deception,
it becomes magic.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.370
Thank you,

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.350
[applause]

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.520
We have already reached the end of my short
presentation.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.830
Thank you very much for coming.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.010
If you have any questions, we have two microphones
which are open right now.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:02.530
I'm glad to answer most of the things you
might wanna ask.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:06.610
Also, if you're interested in some of the
technology, I have the stuff up on stage so

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.570
that you can play with it as well.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.570
Thank you.

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.050
Any questions?

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.570
Alright.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.160
Well thank you very much.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.160
Thank you.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:16.161
[applause]
