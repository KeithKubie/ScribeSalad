00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.865
- [Voiceover] In the
video on the second law

00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:04.210
of thermodynamics I talk
about how the entropy

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.868
of the universe is constantly increasing,

00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:09.318
that it's not going to decrease.

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:12.261
And another way of thinking
about it is that the energy in

00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:15.971
the universe, more and more of
it is going towards entropy,

00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:18.227
it's becoming less and less useful.

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:21.150
And the argument that I
use, even in our every day,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.408
I talk about hey, while I'm
making this video, my body's

00:00:23.408 --> 00:00:26.963
generating heat, and that
heat is leading to entropy,

00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:30.056
it's leading to more
entropy in the universe.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:34.682
And a reasonable question is,
how does heat lead to entropy?

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:39.027
Remember heat is a
transfer of thermal energy,

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.867
and entropy, this is
a state of the system,

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:43.236
it's the number of,

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:46.518
it's the amount of disorder
we have, it's the number

00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:49.598
of states that a system
could actually take on.

00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:52.436
So let's have an example here,
let's assume that this is an

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:55.950
ideal, closed system, this
little white square here.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.104
And these molecules are bouncing
around at some temperature,

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:01.182
so they have some average
kinetic energy, each molecule

00:01:01.182 --> 00:01:03.803
will be doing different things,
and I always draw it as this

00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:06.956
translational kinetic energy,
but they could be rotating

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:09.790
and oscillating, and doing
all sorts of other things.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.584
So they could be doing
other things as well,

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:14.724
but the translational kinetic
energy is a little bit

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:17.463
easier to actually visualize.

00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:20.756
But now let's transfer
some heat into the system.

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:25.214
So we have a transfer of thermal
energy, which we call heat,

00:01:25.214 --> 00:01:28.480
let me pick a color for
that, I will use orange,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.171
and we use the letter Q to denote heat.

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.085
So we have a heat
transfer coming into this,

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:36.089
and then because of this, the
temperature of this system

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:39.488
goes up, the average
kinetic energy goes up,

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:43.339
these things start bouncing
around with more momentum,

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:45.124
with more velocity.

00:01:45.124 --> 00:01:46.932
So why does this system have entropy?

00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:48.597
You might say, well
look, you know there's,

00:01:48.597 --> 00:01:50.286
they have the same number of molecules,

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:53.184
I have the same amount of volume,

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:55.380
I'm looking at a
two-dimensional, looks like area,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.975
but we could imagine the
same amount of volume

00:01:56.975 --> 00:01:58.873
that it's filling up, it
feels like there's the same

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:01.491
number of places that the
actual molecules could be.

00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:05.346
But our state is not
dictated purely by position,

00:02:05.346 --> 00:02:08.045
not purely by where the
different things are.

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:10.597
The state is everything
about the system that

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.334
you could use to predict
what's going to happen

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:14.772
next to the system, so
the state also includes

00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:17.932
the various velocities of these particles.

00:02:17.932 --> 00:02:19.592
So when you have a higher temperature,

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:22.472
you have a larger number
of potential velocities

00:02:22.472 --> 00:02:25.223
that you might be able
to actually take on.

00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:27.647
And also when you have
this higher kinetic energy,

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:31.792
remember all of these molecules,
at the end of the day,

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:35.641
they're made up of atoms that have nuclei

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:37.971
and they have electrons
buzzing around them.

00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.369
And as they, if they don't
have much kinetic energy,

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.141
they might not be able to get too close.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:44.963
So let's say this is the
outer electrons of one,

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:47.318
I'll just say atom, and
let's say that this is

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:49.936
another one right over here.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.505
If they're going with only
a reasonable kinetic energy,

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.598
if they go with a
reasonable kinetic energy,

00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:56.804
they might be able to get, maybe they're

00:02:56.804 --> 00:02:58.591
going to be able to get that close.

00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.805
But if they were running, if
they were hitting each other

00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:04.268
much faster, they might be able
to get a little bit closer,

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:07.718
they might kind of smush into each other,

00:03:07.718 --> 00:03:10.127
if you imagine kind of two
balls hitting each other

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:13.031
much faster, they're going
to push on each other

00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.052
a little bit harder, and
so there's actually more

00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:16.932
possible states you can take on

00:03:16.932 --> 00:03:19.013
when you have higher kinetic energy.

00:03:19.013 --> 00:03:21.771
So this is, these things came in really,

00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:23.859
really fast and smushed into each other,

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.292
while these were nice and polite,

00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:28.502
and came it at a nice gentle velocity.

00:03:28.502 --> 00:03:31.552
So you could actually even
have more positional states,

00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:35.449
more different configurations
in three-dimensional space.

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.906
So that's why heat is
actually leading to entropy.

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.895
Now I know what some
of you might be saying,

00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:45.603
well heat doesn't only
cause disorder, in fact,

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:48.230
heat can be used to do work.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.002
In fact, that's the whole basis, in fact,

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:51.658
a lot of the basis of the
Industrial Revolution,

00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:53.209
steam engines, combustion engines,

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.766
the combustion engine in
your car that uses heat,

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:58.449
uses a combustion reaction to expand,

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.803
to push up a piston, which
is used to do actual work.

00:04:02.803 --> 00:04:05.965
And that is, of course, true.

00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:08.778
And over here we have an
example of that happening.

00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:12.504
So I have some molecules
in here buzzing around

00:04:12.504 --> 00:04:15.183
with some temperature, and
then I'm going to apply,

00:04:15.183 --> 00:04:17.610
I'm going to add some heat to the system.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.992
So let's add some heat to the system.

00:04:21.992 --> 00:04:25.628
And in this system, I don't
have just a closed boundary,

00:04:25.628 --> 00:04:27.642
these things start buzzing around more,

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.906
they can take on more states
and all of that type of thing,

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:32.658
but they can also use
to expand the container.

00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:35.538
So what we see happening here
is they push this piston,

00:04:35.538 --> 00:04:38.610
they push this piston open,
you actually have work,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.351
let me do work in a different color.

00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:44.229
You actually have work being done.

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.138
I'll do it smaller.

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:49.973
You actually have some work being done,

00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:51.214
and how is that work being done?

00:04:51.214 --> 00:04:52.887
Well as these things bounce around,

00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:55.543
we're talking about a lot of molecules,

00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:57.026
every now and then one of these molecules

00:04:57.026 --> 00:04:59.217
is going to bump there
and then bounce off,

00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:01.541
but that's going to provide
some force for a very small

00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:04.267
amount of time, that's going
to push it up a little bit

00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:06.089
and but you have so
many of these molecules,

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.202
I've only drawn a handful
of them, but in any

00:05:08.202 --> 00:05:10.632
real thermodynamic system,
you're going to be talking

00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:13.197
about many millions and
millions and millions,

00:05:13.197 --> 00:05:15.656
you're talking about things on the,

00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:19.144
multiples of Avogadro's
number, number of molecules.

00:05:19.144 --> 00:05:21.076
And so at any given moment,
a lot of them are going to

00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:22.947
be bouncing right off this
thing, and they're going to be

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.711
doing work, they're going to be pushing,

00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:27.608
they're going to be displacing
this piston in the direction

00:05:27.608 --> 00:05:29.801
of the force, or part, a
component of their force is going

00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:33.955
to be pushing this piston
actually up, and doing work.

00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:37.966
But no heat-based, I guess you could say,

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:41.109
system or engine can be 100% efficient.

00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:43.954
So some of this can be used to do work,

00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:47.164
but a lot of it is going to
be used to add to the disorder

00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:50.364
of the system, to increase
the number of states

00:05:50.364 --> 00:05:52.170
that the system could take on.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.627
One way to think about it,
and this has always helped me,

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:57.506
is heat is transfer of thermal energy,

00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:59.480
that happens at the
boundary of the system,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.407
this heat could be you
know, maybe there's a,

00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:03.966
maybe there's a flame down here,

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:05.685
and at the boundaries this
thing might be able to,

00:06:05.685 --> 00:06:08.035
if this wasn't a fully-closed
system, it could release heat

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:09.899
at the boundaries of the system.

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:13.598
But within the system, the
heat is just leading the

00:06:13.598 --> 00:06:17.299
increased thermal energy is
just leading to more entropy.

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:19.871
Now work also happens at
the boundary of the system,

00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:22.509
so up here, there's probably
some heat being released,

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:24.768
but it's also able to do work.

00:06:24.768 --> 00:06:26.802
So heat and work, these
are happening at the

00:06:26.802 --> 00:06:29.710
boundaries of the system,
but a lot of that energy

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.484
goes into the inside of the
system, and that is just,

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:34.619
things are just gonna, you
know, it's like a big mosh pit,

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:36.632
these things are going to run
into each other much faster,

00:06:36.632 --> 00:06:38.818
and way more states
that they could take on.

00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:40.874
And so that's why, when
I talk about you know,

00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:42.798
if I move around and I'm
walking on the floor,

00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:44.933
just the friction of the carpet
is going to generate heat.

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:47.126
That's going to contribute
to entropy in the universe.

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:50.097
Just me existing, the
cellular processes in my body

00:06:50.097 --> 00:06:53.089
that generate heat, it
increases the entropy of the

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:55.419
universe that makes the
total energy of the universe

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.699
less useful, that's why it's happening.
