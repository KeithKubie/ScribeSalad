SHERYL SANDBERG: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:07.409
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:08.950
SHERYL SANDBERG:
I'm Sheryl Sandberg.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.326
This is Susan Wojcicki.

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:11.534
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:12.534
Welcome.

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:13.950
SHERYL SANDBERG:
So I think we all

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.420
know, all the Google
people watching worldwide

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.250
and potentially our
Google Video audience,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.240
that Google's a
really special place.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.060
And we have had,
for a long time,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.500
a series called Authors@Google
where we've invited authors

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.280
to come share their thoughts.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.300
In addition, we've had
our Tech Talk series

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.850
where we've had people from
all over the world come

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.780
to share their
ideas with us here,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.900
very much in keeping with our
mission of bringing the world's

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.970
information out to the world.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.600
Today, we are starting off our
inaugural Women@Google talk

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.760
series.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.625
There could be no--

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:50.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.140
The idea behind this
series is very simple.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.739
We want to bring the most
fantastic women in the world

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.870
here to share their ideas with
Google and through the Google

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.030
video product with the world.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.910
Eric Schmidt, our CEO, has
been dedicated to this,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.040
has been the leader of this, and
has made this place a fantastic

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.500
place to work for
women and hopefully

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.780
now, a fantastic place
for women to help

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.720
get their ideas to the world.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.305
Eric.

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:26.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
wonderful to be here

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.420
to introduce the new
series about women

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.510
and about the changes
that are going

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.360
on in our lives every day.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.260
I can think of no
two better people

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
to participate in this
conversation than the two

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.950
people to my left, neither of
whom needs an introduction,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.290
but I'll do my best.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.940
After 40 movies, there's nothing
more to say about Jane Fonda

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.980
as one of the tremendous
talents in the world today.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.700
What I like though,
most about her

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.710
is that she's much
more than that.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.360
She wrote a book that I have
actually read called, "My Life

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.040
So Far."

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.570
And if you have a stereotype
about folks in the media,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.290
and actors and actresses,
this book and the things

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.380
that she talks about
completely change that.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.501
And I want to read just
one or two sentences

00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:21.000
to give you a sense
of it, because I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.140
think it's quite relevant
to this audience.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.530
"I feel that the very
changing nature of my life

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.870
helps to make my story
relevant to other people

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.760
and also to this modern era.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.400
Everything about our
world today speaks

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.280
to the need for flexibility
and improvisation.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.320
Yet young people still feel
pressured to do life the way

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.630
their parents did,
deciding early

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.530
on what they want to
be when they grow up

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.780
and committing to it.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.830
They feel there must be
something wrong with them

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.180
when it doesn't
work out that way.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.510
We're brought up waiting for
closure-- when I graduate, when

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.051
I get married, when I know what
to do and become a grown up--

00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:52.610
and we expect
contentment to follow.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.590
Youthful dreams then
gave way to reality,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.750
and we succumb to what is rather
than striving for what if.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.790
Consistency can be
a trap, especially

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.540
if it leads to being
consistently wrong

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.870
rather than stopping,
admitting your mistakes,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.630
and changing course."

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.520
She refers in her book
to this as the beginning

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.170
of the third act of
a tremendous life.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.690
What I think is extraordinary
about Jane Fonda

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.960
is it's such a human story
laid out so well here.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.600
And we'll hear more about that.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.470
Take a minute.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.060
I want everybody to look
around here in the audience.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.810
Look to the left.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.570
Look to the right.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.584
Look behind you.

00:03:30.584 --> 00:03:31.715
Do you see anything odd?

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.034
Women.

00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:41.680
[CHEERING]

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.115
I have actually
studied business.

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:46.750
And in the '40s and
'50s, businesses

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.400
had all the same problems that
a company like Google has,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.660
and everyone in this audience 50
years ago would've been a man.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.290
There is a person
who's responsible

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.470
for this wonderful change.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.908
It's Gloria Steinem.

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:03.366
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:11.100
Now I like to think,
immodestly, perhaps,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.150
I like to think that if these
two were in their 20s today,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.740
they would be Googlers.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.060
I have actually read
Gloria's work recently,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.095
and she rebelled
against the constraints.

00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:28.540
And I'll let her use your
own words to describe that.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.470
But she felt that
many of you-- just

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.290
looking at your
presumptive youth

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.670
here-- do not appreciate
the constraints

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.100
that women of her age
and generation faced.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.530
And she, unlike many
other people, rebelled.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.810
And she rebelled in
the most clever way.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.310
She had a better idea, and
she wrote about it, initially,

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.890
as a writer, and eventually
in founding the defining

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.330
magazine in that time.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.570
And for those of us who
were alive in that period,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.640
we remember, I remember
how powerful this was

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.355
and what an enormous
change she brought.

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:08.730
And fortunately
or unfortunately,

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.635
she's quite quotable.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.900
"A liberated woman is one
who has sex before marriage

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.537
and a job after."

00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:20.485
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:22.920
I didn't--

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.380
And an even better one.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.320
"A woman without a man is like
a fish without a bicycle."

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.940
I can think of no
two better people

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.430
to have onstage with
me than these two.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.600
Welcome to Google.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.683
GLORIA STEINEM: Thank you.

00:05:53.405 --> 00:05:55.030
ERIC SCHMIDT: What
I though we would do

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.620
is I have some questions,
and I know the audience

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.770
has lots of questions.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.890
I thought maybe we'd start
with, you all have actually--

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.870
and Jane, I'm going to
refer to this as a third act

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.600
conversation.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.790
What is the third act like?

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.730
What does it actually look like?

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.230
And you've been
working on something

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.220
called the Women's Media Center.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.830
And what's interesting about
the Women's Media Center, which

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.370
the press has discussed it's
really a radio talk show,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.710
but it's actually
much more than that.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.610
And we at Google are perfectly
interested in working with you

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.110
all.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.100
And I think a lot
of our employees

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.700
will want to help in
some of the initiatives.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.991
Do you want to talk about that?

00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:32.460
Do you want to talk
about what you're up to?

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.520
JANE FONDA: About two years
ago, after the election,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.260
a group of us-- there was
a big question looming--

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.475
what do we do about the
media, the mainstream media?

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:56.060
One of the core problems
is women's voices, faces,

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.360
interests, concerns,
were absent, just absent.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.030
News is delivered as
though it's gender-neutral.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.900
It's not.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.770
All kinds of things, all kinds
of issues, and war and peace,

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.560
and so forth, affect women
differently than men.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.190
Poverty, environmental
degradation, and so forth.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.360
And we decided that we needed
to do something about it.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.880
The great thing about her,
she doesn't just complain.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.400
She says, how do we fix it?

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:32.370
And we began to
talk about the fact

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.297
that-- well, I won't
even go into that.

00:07:34.297 --> 00:07:36.630
I was going to tell them about
the Leadership Institute.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.510
I won't go there.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.620
The other side
trains its speakers.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.830
There are talking
heads all over that

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:51.550
represent the opposite of what
we believe, in our opinion,

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.630
the opposite of democracy.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.100
And they're trained.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.060
They're trained to
stay on message.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.470
They're trained in
a certain ideology.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.690
They're recruited very young.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.340
And then they're spread
out through the mass media.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.720
We decided that we wanted
to create a Women's Media

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.430
Center that could do
a number of things.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.230
First of all, bring
women, in every way,

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.990
into the world's consciousness
through the media.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.260
Because we're missing both
in front of the camera,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.520
behind the camera,
as professionals,

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.050
as spokespeople, as stories.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.919
We wanted to be-- and this
is we dovetail with Google--

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:38.760
we wanted to be a place
where news that gets

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.169
missed in the
mainstream media, news

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:45.040
from every part of this country
and every part of the world,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.890
can get viewed, and
channeled, and written about

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.451
through a gender lens,
though a woman's lens.

00:08:51.451 --> 00:08:52.950
And why don't you
take it from there

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.454
because there's other
things that we're doing too.

00:08:55.454 --> 00:08:57.620
GLORIA STEINEM: Well, I
think, as I look out at you,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.720
that really, we are, at heart,
a group of people who are mad,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.190
who are gifted, who
are imaginative,

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.560
who are pissed off
that 60% to 80%

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.870
of the people who
voted for George Bush

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.980
thought they were voting
for the opposite of what

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.710
his policies really are.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.080
We're bringing together,
as you are together

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.160
on this wonderful campus, smart,
gifted women inside the media

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.580
who are media professionals,
who are trying

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.370
to do their best in
their individual jobs,

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.390
and being a support system
for them in all kinds of ways.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.110
So we are putting stories
out there on our website.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.970
You can find our website and
see our original material there.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.530
We are hotlinked to all the
progressive women columnists.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.910
There's a lot going on there.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.280
We are also trying
to unspin the spin

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.930
by giving accurate
language as opposed

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.790
to what we frequently get.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.630
It's not a death tax,
thank you very much.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.250
It isn't everybody who
dies who gets taxed.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.690
It's an inheritance tax.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.750
And onward from that.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.060
And it really is
a center of energy

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.140
to train people as spokespeople,
as Jane points out.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.590
Now the very first
project that we spun off

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.280
and we're very proud
of is GreenStone Media,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.870
which is a radio network.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.610
And that's what you
were mentioning.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:29.310
It's the first woman-owned,
national radio network.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.120
And in radio, talk network
means not a chain of stations,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.740
but a center of programming.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.580
So we have created the
GreenStone Media Group which is

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.910
for profit, unlike the
Women's Media Center which is

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.835
a 501(c)(3).

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:55.330
It has developed, over the last
year, 12 hours of programming

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.960
which is now being
streamed from its website,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:05.070
greenstonemedia.net, with
2, 3-hour drive time shows,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.070
with women stand-up comics
who are smart and funny,

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.087
who give the news, and
give information, and make

00:11:12.087 --> 00:11:13.170
it interesting, and so on.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.760
That's one project.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.050
Training people is
another project.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:22.320
Making accurate, spin-free
language is another project.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.420
And we were fortunate enough
to be given right away not

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.370
something as gorgeous as
this, but 6,000 square feet

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.020
in the Empire State Building.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.670
So we have a wonderful office.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.350
If you're in New York, you need
to have a press conference,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.580
we can give you a
place to have it.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.920
You want to have
a training session

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.720
or show a documentary
film, we can do that.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.570
There needed to be
a physical center

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.280
in New York as the media
capital of the world

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.810
where people could come.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:58.500
So our overall purpose is to
make women visible and powerful

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.630
in the media.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.650
And that means, of course,
it affects everything.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.110
It isn't as if there is any
such thing as a women's issue,

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.480
every issue is a women's issue.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.900
So violence is normalized in
the street and in foreign policy

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.370
because it's
experienced in the home.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.690
But how often do you hear that?

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.080
We want to make
this kind of linkage

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.080
so that, in looking at the
world as if everyone mattered,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.210
we actually shift and change
the view of every issue.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.440
ERIC SCHMIDT: When I went back
and read the things in the '70s

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.120
and '80s that you
all worked on, I

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.040
remembered the
feelings and the sense

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.080
of what was going to happen.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.690
And it didn't quite
all work out that way.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.250
One of the great achievements,
as I mentioned, from,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.440
in particular, your
leadership is the integration

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.970
of women into professional life.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.050
Did it turn out the
way you expected

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.520
when you founded
the magazine, when

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.460
you were so much the target
of opposition and fighting

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.780
in the '70s?

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.481
Is this the outcome
you expected?

00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:09.272
GLORIA STEINEM: No.

00:13:09.272 --> 00:13:11.313
ERIC SCHMIDT: Did you
expect something different?

00:13:11.313 --> 00:13:12.931
GLORIA STEINEM: Yes and no.

00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:13.430
No.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.210
It's interesting.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:19.910
I think that if we then had
been able to see all of you now,

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:24.590
we would have been greatly
encouraged in many ways.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.910
Looking at this audience,
looking at the public opinion

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.510
polls, understanding
there is majority support

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.060
for all the basic issues
of justice and equality

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.550
we care about.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.390
So if we looked
laterally, I think

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.360
we would have felt
very successful.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.020
If we looked vertically,
at what's going on,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.150
who's in power, who's making the
decisions, and the translation

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:49.080
of the majority opinion to
the decision-making structure,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.740
then I think we would have been
surprised and disappointed.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.390
And I expect we had too
much faith in democracy.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.980
I think we thought
that if we got

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.540
the majority, 60%, 70%
of people to support

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.860
all the issues of equality,
it would be translated

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.560
into the power structure.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.240
So we were naive, I think, about
the degree of democracy we have

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.050
and the other forces
at work, including

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.190
control of the
media, which is what

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.940
we're trying to address now.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.490
ERIC SCHMIDT: As
for Jane, you've

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.020
been an activist all
your professional life.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.483
You've had 30 years of this.

00:14:22.483 --> 00:14:28.580
Is this another time for
activism, as you see it?

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.887
JANE FONDA: What do you mean?

00:14:29.887 --> 00:14:32.220
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, you were
very outspoken with respect

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.134
to Vietnam, very
outspoken with what

00:14:34.134 --> 00:14:35.800
you saw in the
inequalities with respect

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.810
to women and poor
people, and so forth.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.420
Is this a continuation of that?

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.350
Are we in the same situation
we were in the '70s?

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.060
Is it different?

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:53.402
JANE FONDA: It, the conditions
in the world-- it's the same,

00:14:53.402 --> 00:14:54.193
and it's different.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:02.660
We see ourselves at war again.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.620
We see ourselves having been
lied to to get into the war.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.460
And being lied to to get
in, perhaps, another war.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.350
And that is a repeat of
what happened in Vietnam.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.640
And that's discouraging
because it means

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.980
we didn't learn the lessons.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.760
And there isn't as
much public outcry

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.390
for many reasons,
including there's

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:32.680
no draft and also
because of the media.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.570
Because we're not
being told the truth.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.990
If you really want to
find out what's going on,

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.440
you can't go, in general,
to the mass media.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.960
You have to go to various blogs.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.180
And you have to subscribe
to magazines and newspapers

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.590
from Europe, or
Asia, and so forth.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.530
It's really hard to find
out what's really going on.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.815
So that's part of it.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.180
So that's what's the same.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:04.020
And for me,
personally, what I've

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:11.590
learned in the course of my
40 years of activism-- how can

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.860
I say it simply-- is
that nothing will change

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.600
until women make it change.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.690
And it's not just rhetoric.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.700
There was a time in my
life where if I had heard

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.850
someone say that, I
would have thought, well,

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.810
that sounds pretty rhetorical.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.430
But women are the agents of
change everywhere in the world.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.000
And you can't
address poverty, you

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.570
can't address
sustainable development

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:40.850
without taking women's rights
and issues into consideration.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.450
There's a lot of
talk about poverty,

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.050
and a lot of really good people
in the world trying to address

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.610
it-- Jeffrey Sachs and others.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.970
And I know that the Google
philanthropy, a lot of that

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.050
goes to poverty in Africa.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.060
That work is not often
viewed through a gender lens.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:09.030
It's not often seeing the extent
to which it is mostly women

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.660
and children who are poor.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.890
It is mostly women
who are impacted

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.970
by environmental degradation.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.099
For example, it's women,
basically, in the global south

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.829
who are the farmers.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:21.920
They plant the crops.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.930
They harvest the crops.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:23.819
They chop the wood.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:24.750
They fetch the water.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.589
They cook the food.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.800
They feed the children.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.940
And they take care of the
health of their families.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:35.220
And so if they have to go five
miles further to get wood,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.560
or to bring water
back, that is going

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.280
to have a major impact that's
going to start with the woman

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.730
and then ripple through
the whole community.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:53.300
So every single issue that makes
life so dangerous and unhealthy

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:59.040
in the world starts from the
impact that it has on women.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.070
And we want that to be a
big part of the work we

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.920
do at the Women's Media
Center because that's left out

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.200
of the national dialogue.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.180
And our research shows that
women want to know that.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.980
And so we want to create
a global community.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.730
And this is why we feel
such kinship with Google,

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:23.680
because you're about community
and about stories, about

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.050
personal stories.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.210
And that's what women do best.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.040
We create community.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.360
And we tell our stories around
campfires, historically, now

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.440
around Google and webs.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:44.790
But we're trying to put the
gender back into the campfire.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.030
ERIC SCHMIDT: Do
you have a sense

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.060
of how this change will occur?

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.910
Where is the outrage?

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.730
Because I don't hear it.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.670
And yet you're so
passionate about it.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.700
Is it that you're
not being heard?

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.607
Is it that there's somebody
fighting against you?

00:19:04.607 --> 00:19:06.190
GLORIA STEINEM: Well,
I would say just

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.560
as somebody who spends a lot
of time going around speaking,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.170
I'm on the road maybe a
third of the time to campuses

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.780
and so on, the outrage is there.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.020
It's much more difficult
to get it reported

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.550
than it was in the Vietnam era.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.080
Having said that,
it's remarkable

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.120
that we have turned in the
majority against this war.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.070
It took four years at least
in the case of Vietnam

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.230
for the majority of the
country to see the war.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.640
Now that's happened
much more quickly

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.950
even though there is
supposedly not a draft.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.090
Now part of what we
want to do with language

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.740
is to explain that
there is a draft.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.760
There is a poverty draft.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.580
If I say that to you, you
know what it is, right?

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.219
There is a green card draft.

00:19:49.219 --> 00:19:51.260
Part of the reason that
the administration is not

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.910
quite as draconian
about immigration

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:58.090
as some of its supporters is
because they are getting people

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.680
into the country and
into the military

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.650
to serve in return for
getting a green card.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:06.985
There is an education draft.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.710
Kids are graduating
now with more debt

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.540
than the average
family in this country

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.180
because tuition has
gone up 30% just

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.760
during this administration.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.950
College loans have
gone down because he's

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.630
given more money to the
bankers that service the loans.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.340
So if you say those
things, it's my experience

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.020
on college campuses
that, first of all,

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.070
there is much more
outrage and much more

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.940
activity than is
getting reported.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.170
Part of the reason that the
first spin-off was about radio

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.960
is because in the Vietnam
era, if Jane and I went

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.380
around touring, we were
interviewed on the radio.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.040
Now there's a closet with
a spinning disk being

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.580
programmed 1,000 miles away.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.170
There's no more possibility,
most of the time,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.140
of being interviewed locally.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:06.160
So I don't think we should
get too much into self-blame.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.260
Yes, it's our responsibility
to keep this country

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.785
from being the lowest voting
turnout in the world, which

00:21:12.785 --> 00:21:13.680
it currently is.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.970
It's our responsibility to act.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:21.180
But we can't take the blame
onto ourselves totally.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.780
We have a right to
be angry at the fact

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.110
that we are being
active, and it is not

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:32.020
being translated into visible
form for the rest of the world

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.160
to see.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.870
I'm writing a book about
being on the road for 35 years

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:40.910
just because I'm so frustrated
that what I see is not visible.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.050
It's such a different
country from the country

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.719
we read about in the media.

00:21:44.719 --> 00:21:46.260
JANE FONDA: Yeah,
I completely agree.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.650
I did a year and a half
book tour for my book,

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.740
and traveled all over the
country and other parts

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.100
of the world, but in this
country including Kansas City

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.050
and really into the heartland.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.350
And what Gloria said is so true.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.490
People are angry.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.669
There isn't quite as much
organized movement to harness

00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:06.460
it, but it's there.

00:22:08.999 --> 00:22:10.665
ERIC SCHMIDT: I'll
ask my last question,

00:22:10.665 --> 00:22:14.570
then I'd like to get
questions from the audience.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.660
Both of you have been
identified with both activists

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.880
and, in particular, what was
known as women's liberation,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.080
the women's lib movement.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.760
Where does it go from here?

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.350
The women that I
work with now are

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.460
faced with many more
complicated life choices

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.710
with family, and husbands,
and work, and the pressures,

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.250
especially if they're
single moms or whatever.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.990
And it's a challenge, I think
perhaps a welcome challenge,

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.910
but it's nevertheless
a very big challenge.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.980
And it's a greater
challenge, in my view,

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.230
for women than for men just
because of the way society

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.030
works.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.040
Where does women's
liberation, as I know it

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.740
from my generation, where
does it go from here?

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.250
GLORIA STEINEM: Well, I think
there's a natural progression.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.500
We started out with equal pay.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.710
You'll be glad to know there
was a moment when people thought

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.520
that women worked for pin money
and shouldn't have equal pay.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.530
We got through that.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.915
Everybody supports equal pay.

00:23:07.915 --> 00:23:09.790
It's known as "the part
I agree with," right?

00:23:13.577 --> 00:23:16.160
Then there was comparable worth,
because we figured out, well,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.790
if women are totally
nurses, equal to whom?

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.350
They're all getting poorly paid.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.979
So let's compare
them to pharmacists,

00:23:22.979 --> 00:23:24.770
who are guys with the
same amount of-- that

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.610
was comparable worth.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.690
So we've moved forward
on those, and we're still

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.610
trying to get there.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.720
And that is revaluing
salaried work.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.180
What we now need to do
is value unsalaried work.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.400
A third of the work
in this country

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.690
is done by women mainly,
and some men too,

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.780
and it's not called work at all.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.890
It's raising children.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.170
It's taking care of
invalids, and AIDS patients,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.860
and aging parents,
and all the work

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.590
of caregiving and
human maintenance

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.960
is a third of the
work in the country.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.350
We have a piece of
legislation that

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:07.180
could make that visible
by attributing--

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.460
the economists in the
audience understand

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.040
that an attributed value
is not an unusual thing.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.200
You can attribute value at
replacement level to this work,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.610
make it tax deductible
for those who pay taxes,

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.130
and for those who are too
poor to pay taxes, tax

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.630
refundable, which
would substitute

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.820
for the disaster
of welfare reform.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.600
Now that's a piece of
policy that is an example.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.170
But it's actually much bigger
because what it is saying

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.200
is we're redefining work.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.300
Work is all productive labor.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.920
And in that process,
we are also saying

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.550
that men can raise babies
and little children too.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.580
And indeed, it's not a
punishment, it's a gift.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.080
And it allows
children to grow up

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.310
knowing that men can be as
loving and nurturing as women,

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.870
and women can be as
assertive, and daring,

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.660
and inventive in this
salaried workplace as men.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.840
And until we do that, we will
go on reproducing the gender

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.920
roles.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.550
Because we do what we see as
kids, not what we're told.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.367
So both men and women
grow up thinking

00:25:19.367 --> 00:25:21.450
that only women can be
loving and nurturing, which

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.960
is a libel on every
man in this room.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.952
We all have all these
human qualities.

00:25:26.952 --> 00:25:28.660
So I don't know how
to break this to you,

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.868
but I think we've just begun.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.650
JANE FONDA: There's the
subject of violence too.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:40.020
Violence against women was
outed starting in the late '60s

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.220
and '70s because of
the women's movement,

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.280
the epidemic, the pandemic
aspect of violence,

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.860
sexual abuse, incest.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.550
I think part of what
feminism means is

00:25:54.550 --> 00:26:00.580
to look at why this violence
exists against women.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.260
And part of that has
to do with the way,

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.350
historically, we've
defined masculinity.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:12.920
Masculinity is so much about I'm
going to bring home the bacon.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.610
I'm going to take
care of my family.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.530
I'm the manly man.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.490
And so when you have
an economy where

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.470
in more and more families, women
are working at lower salaries

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:31.990
and without benefits often, and
men aren't, their masculinity

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.970
is threatened.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.630
And we need to create
a masculinity that

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:40.360
isn't as vulnerable to shaming
if we're going to reduce

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.940
violence against women.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.840
And that's very much, I
think, a feminist issue.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.810
And we, as women,
have to think about it

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.220
because the problem begins
as we raise our little boys

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.140
and for me, my grandchildren.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.220
How we allow our young
children to internalize

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:04.600
this concept of
masculinity that has

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.345
to be earned through
domination and violence.

00:27:09.345 --> 00:27:10.720
ERIC SCHMIDT:
Indeed, the problem

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.570
is much worse--
it's bad in the US,

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.320
it's much worse outside
the United States.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.279
Look in some of these
countries and cultures,

00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:17.070
it's just terrible.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.500
JANE FONDA: But over 25%
of women in this country

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.260
are abused, raped, incested.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.444
It's horrific.

00:27:24.444 --> 00:27:26.360
GLORIA STEINEM: The cult
of masculinity really

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.150
is a prison for men too.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.080
In some cases, it may
be a better prison

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.110
with wall-to-wall carpeting
and people to serve you coffee.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.630
But it's a prison because we
all have all human qualities.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.470
And what we are trying
to do, what feminism

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.810
does is to link-- the
personal is political.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.470
Robin Morgan is in
the audience here.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.070
And now, that has--

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.570
ERIC SCHMIDT: We
have her book here.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.403
GLORIA STEINEM: Yes.

00:27:56.403 --> 00:27:58.580
This is what the
founders of our country

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.410
really said about
religion as opposed

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.990
to what the ultra right wing
says they said about religion.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.550
It will take your breath away.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.247
This is the stuff you
need to argue with.

00:28:07.247 --> 00:28:07.955
Fantastic quotes.

00:28:07.955 --> 00:28:09.580
JANE FONDA: And all her
research was done on Google.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.705
GLORIA STEINEM: Yes, right.

00:28:10.705 --> 00:28:11.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.999
JANE FONDA: She never
went to a library.

00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:16.290
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, thank
you, Google, for helping out.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:20.110
Let's get some questions and
get people up to the mics.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.300
We need to get the mics because
we have lots of folks watching.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.350
And men and women
can ask questions.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.400
And Jane, can you
take one minute

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.690
to introduce the other person
or animal on this panel?

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.144
Tulea.

00:28:35.144 --> 00:28:36.810
JANE FONDA: I didn't
realize that Google

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.414
was such a dog-friendly campus.

00:28:39.414 --> 00:28:41.330
ERIC SCHMIDT: She just
showed up with her dog.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.590
JANE FONDA: This is Tulea.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.380
I got Tulea so I wouldn't
miss my grandkids.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.560
So I didn't want to end
up then missing her too,

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.154
so I brought her with me.

00:28:53.154 --> 00:28:54.945
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK, first
question, go ahead.

00:28:54.945 --> 00:28:57.620
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.190
I think that the reform you're
trying to do in the media

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:03.750
is really well-targeted
and really necessary.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:08.280
I wonder, you talked
about training more people

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.950
and getting more
voices out there,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.830
but I'm wondering if
you're putting any focus on

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.910
or how important you
think it is to address

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.380
just the consolidation of the
media, and how massive it is,

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:29.230
and how hard it is to
get any kind of news

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.490
aside from infotainment.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:33.770
I was just reading
a story yesterday

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:38.890
about how Barbara Boxer had
discovered that the FCC just

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:43.370
suppressed two studies that
came out about what failures

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:48.120
the 1996 Telecommunications
Act was in terms

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:54.350
of the reduction in the number
of radio stations and the fact

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:58.160
that there's so few.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.650
Like there's no protest
songs for the Iraq war

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:04.372
because all the radio stations
are owned by Clear Channel.

00:30:04.372 --> 00:30:05.830
So I'm wondering,
is there anything

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.947
that you think you
can do about that?

00:30:08.947 --> 00:30:10.030
GLORIA STEINEM: Certainly.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.360
It's a spectrum.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:16.700
You try to start where you can.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.450
So if you look on the
Women's Media Center website,

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:25.600
you will find that there is a
story about the stalking, rape,

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.940
and murder of a 14-year-old
Iraqi girl by US mil--

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.320
that we inserted into
the mainstream media.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.790
Or the South Dakota abortion
battle that we inserted.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:42.570
So there are good people
in the media as it exists.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:46.220
So we're not going to wait
until we change policy up there.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.020
But that is certainly
part of the goal--

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:53.700
to change the government policy
of deregulation that allowed

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.185
this terrible consolidation.

00:30:55.185 --> 00:30:55.685
Absolutely.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.260
AUDIENCE: So there are so many
questions I'd love to ask.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.593
It's hard to concentrate on one.

00:31:02.593 --> 00:31:05.490
GLORIA STEINEM: We could use
some answers too, incidentally.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:06.760
You have answers, right?

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.100
Right.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.980
AUDIENCE: I wish I did.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.812
So I'm part of the
Google News team.

00:31:12.812 --> 00:31:15.020
I noticed a lot of the other
members of the news team

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.700
are here.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.141
And this is something we
struggle with every day.

00:31:20.141 --> 00:31:21.515
What we'd like is
for Google News

00:31:21.515 --> 00:31:23.260
to present all sides
of every story.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.340
One of the tenets
of the free press

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.470
was that if all of the
sides of a story are out,

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.740
you should be able to trust
the people to read it and make

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.590
the right decision.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:40.225
Of course, now we have this
problem that people say, well,

00:31:40.225 --> 00:31:41.600
I get my news from
Bill O'Reilly.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.683
That's all I need to know.

00:31:42.683 --> 00:31:45.390
You can lead a horse to
water from either side,

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.690
via left or right, but
you can't make them drink.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:53.290
Is there something in human
nature that prevents us from--

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:58.520
is the media just reflecting
human nature by presenting what

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.760
people want to
hear rather than--

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.420
GLORIA STEINEM: No,
I don't think so.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.080
AUDIENCE: How can we
get people to hear

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.670
the voices that are out there?

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.430
On Google News, if I scroll
down through a cluster

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.320
of some story, I
get Fox News there.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.280
I get Al Jazeera there.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.270
I get Xinghua.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.130
Most people are only going to
read either Fox or Al Jazeera.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.796
They're not going to
see the other side.

00:32:23.796 --> 00:32:25.914
How do we get them to do that?

00:32:25.914 --> 00:32:27.580
JANE FONDA: Do more
of what we're doing,

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.146
what you're doing, what
we're beginning to do

00:32:30.146 --> 00:32:31.395
with the Women's Media Center.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.150
I don't think that the
media reflects human nature.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.190
I think it develops,
and prepares,

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:44.170
and shapes human nature so
that we think that there's

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.830
just two sides-- right and
wrong, black and white-- rather

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:51.070
than holding the contradictions
that there are many sides.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.550
What did you say in Japan?

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.470
GLORIA STEINEM: In
Japan, they actually,

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.810
when discussing a serious
issue, generally have

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.130
three people rather than two.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.370
Because the whole idea
that there are only

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.690
two sides to every issue is part
of the division of human nature

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.300
into masculine and feminine.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.760
And can you say
bullshit on this?

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.170
ERIC SCHMIDT: Of course.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.394
GLORIA STEINEM:
It's all bullshit.

00:33:09.394 --> 00:33:10.269
AUDIENCE: Apparently.

00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:11.610
Right.

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:15.040
GLORIA STEINEM: And they
at least have three people.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.560
And even that is like a
drink of water in the desert,

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.010
just to have three
people instead

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:23.430
of having this constant fighting
that's all heat and no light.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.610
AUDIENCE: So you're
saying that we

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.160
need to encourage the
media to actually,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.817
instead of having crossfire,
instead of having two sides,

00:33:31.817 --> 00:33:33.400
make it more of a
Rashomon experience.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.890
GLORIA STEINEM: You find
out who's a better debater,

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.450
but you don't find
out information.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:41.140
However, I do think we need to
think very carefully about two

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:41.800
things.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.390
Are we using trusted messengers?

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:49.020
We all turn to people
we trust and know.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:55.340
Except we don't have time
to look at the full array

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.580
of different sides.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.730
And I was very heartened, for
instance, in the last election

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:04.670
to see that Planned Parenthood,
which has 900 affiliates

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.080
and is nationwide.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.600
One in three or four American
women has gone to them.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.159
Many men have gone too.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.710
People believe them
and trust them.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:14.710
They endorsed a
presidential candidate

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.980
for the very first time,
and they are getting

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.900
much more politically active.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.600
That's a nationally
important, trusted messenger.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.929
We all have trusted
messengers in our lives

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.280
that we are not using.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.900
We really must use those.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.030
That's one thing.

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.000
And the other thing
is that I wish

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.900
you could arrange to have a
giant fact-checking system

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.219
in the sky.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:37.650
Because the thing
that worries me

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:42.909
most about the blogosphere and
other parts of our new world

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:47.340
is the difficulty of knowing
what's accurate and what's not.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.830
And the fact that there
is even the dimmest amount

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.650
of fact-checking at
the "New York Times"

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:55.300
makes them a trusted messenger.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.050
We have to figure out how
to make the new sources

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.141
trusted messengers.

00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:02.140
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Missy.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.330
It's such a pleasure to
have both of you here.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:06.246
I want to just say, Jane,
I want to thank you.

00:35:06.246 --> 00:35:09.580
I have, for the last year and
a half, given this as a gift

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.944
to every female in my life,
particularly those under 18.

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:13.860
JANE FONDA: Thank you.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.360
Thank you.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.050
AUDIENCE: And I highly
recommend anybody

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:18.360
in this room who hasn't
read it to read it.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.500
It touched me because
as an undergrad,

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.550
I was a theater major at
UCLA and was in the industry.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.540
And as a female, I felt
objectified over, and over,

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.530
and over again when
I went on auditions.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.900
Left that industry.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.160
Got a degree in
policy, and went to DC,

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.764
and worked in the last two years
in the Bush administration.

00:35:37.764 --> 00:35:39.430
And my question to
both of you, and what

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:42.450
I noticed when I was
in DC, is that many

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.850
of the female politicians--
Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer,

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.870
Hillary Clinton-- it's
interesting to watch how they

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:53.514
have to defeminize or dewomanize
themselves to actually play

00:35:53.514 --> 00:35:54.430
in that kind of arena.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.780
And my question
specifically is, how do we

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:00.420
support our female politicians
so they can actually

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.990
be human, be female, and
be emotional, but still

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:07.442
be productive in that
kind of environment?

00:36:07.442 --> 00:36:09.400
GLORIA STEINEM: Well,
that is a great question.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.980
All I can say to
you is if you think

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.470
that they are
defeminized, you should've

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:13.600
seen the generation before.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.330
So there's a trend line.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.100
Ever since Patricia
Schroeder stood up

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:27.660
on the floor of Congress as
the first pregnant member

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.250
of Congress ever in the
history of the nation and said,

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.500
"I have a brain and a womb,
and I'm going to use both.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.925
Thank you very much," things
have been getting better.

00:36:36.925 --> 00:36:39.370
But I think one of
the ways that we

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.850
do it is to always
say to ourselves,

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:46.480
are we, ourselves, imposing
different standards on females

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.040
than we are on males?

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:52.600
So I always try to
figure that out.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.530
And if I'm feeling uneasy when
a man comments on me physically,

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.330
I comment back on him physically
in exactly the same way.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:05.140
And usually, it has a
consciousness-raising in men.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:10.030
And also, that we not impose
the double standard of expecting

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.040
perfection from our
representatives, and we do

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.730
do that.

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:23.790
And it does really cripple
them that they are supposed

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.880
to be better than anyone else.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.130
We have to look at
them in the real world

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:33.850
and celebrate their full
circle of human qualities.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:37.830
Bella Abzug was one of the
greatest dancers ever, played

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:39.279
the ukulele.

00:37:39.279 --> 00:37:41.070
JANE FONDA: Ann Richards
rode a motorcycle.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.480
GLORIA STEINEM: Ann Richards is
a great symbol of a full circle

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.810
human being, right?

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.680
Right, so we have
to celebrate that.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.360
JANE FONDA: And vote.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.264
Vote, vote, vote.

00:37:52.264 --> 00:37:53.180
GLORIA STEINEM: Right.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: As a
follow-up, roughly 80%

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.430
of the elected
officials are male.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.890
What would the Congress
and the government look

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:02.380
like if it were 80% female?

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.700
GLORIA STEINEM:
Well, I hope you all

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.960
understand we're not
biological determinists here.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.470
We perfectly well
understand that women

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.580
can be just as
evil and difficult,

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.440
and men can be
much more feminist.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.110
We understand that, OK?

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:21.150
In the aggregate,
however, the mere fact

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:28.400
that women don't have our
masculinity to prove is useful.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.220
And therefore, if you
look at the studies

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.280
of any decision-making
body, whether it's

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.940
Congress or anything
else, if it is all men,

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:42.300
it is more likely to reward
the most aggressive solution

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.770
even if it's wrong.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:46.770
If it's all women, it's
most likely to reward

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:50.190
the most conciliatory
decision even if it's wrong.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.210
But a 50-50 or more or
less evenly divided group

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.400
is much more likely to have
the full circle of alternatives

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.780
in order to find
something that's

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.910
appropriate for the
problem at hand.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:02.510
So I do think that
a Congress that

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.460
looked like the country,
racially, economically,

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:11.740
every way, ethnically--
what a relief that would be.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.020
And it really would
act differently.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:20.812
All the studies of groups show
that it would act differently.

00:39:20.812 --> 00:39:21.770
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Josh.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.010
I'm from the Netherlands.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.224
And I consider myself a pretty
liberated guy growing up

00:39:27.224 --> 00:39:28.390
in a pretty liberal society.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:31.880
But I've learned I've
still got a long way to go.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.670
But one of the things that we
experience in northern Europe

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.880
especially is that
we have boatloads

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.640
of immigrants from
more traditional

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.890
masculine-feminine countries.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:46.460
And what we see is that even
second and third generation

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.050
immigrants, and
especially the girls,

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.900
voluntarily go back into
that traditional mode,

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.850
like wearing head scarves.

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:57.350
And basically not be
the liberated women

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.310
that we all expected them
to be, but voluntarily

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:04.940
go back to this traditionalist
mode of society, of operation.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.552
And doesn't that warp us
back to 40, 50 years ago?

00:40:08.552 --> 00:40:09.510
What's your take on it?

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:10.520
Is this a problem here?

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.360
How should we address
that particular issue?

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.192
JANE FONDA: You cited
some extreme versions

00:40:19.192 --> 00:40:22.740
of women "voluntarily"
going back

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:28.670
to traditional,
fundamentalist ways of being.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:32.440
And there are more subtle
ways that it can happen.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:40.830
I was 61, 62 years old, before
I-- privileged, successful,

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:45.470
financially independent-- before
I was brave enough to truly

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:48.750
stand up and claim my voice.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:54.450
Because I was afraid that
if I really owned who I was,

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.490
that my man would
leave me, which he did.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:03.200
I'm single.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.740
That we're raised
to be good girls.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:14.540
And so many of us-- forget
about coming from a culture

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.930
where it is mothers that perform
female genital mutilation

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:21.700
on their daughters, and
where women voluntarily

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.280
go under the burqa.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.420
It is terrifying
for all people who

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:36.300
have been raised in a way
that stunts their humanity

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.450
and to think that that's
right, to stand up and seize

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:40.740
their humanity.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.180
Because you think you're
going to be killed,

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.300
psychologically, emotionally,
physically in reality,

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.420
it's very frightening.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:56.786
And I think what myself, and
Gloria, and other women that

00:41:56.786 --> 00:41:58.660
are on the board of the
Women's Media Center,

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.750
and other friends that
we have, what we do

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.100
is try to support the
leaders in those cultures,

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.260
the women in those
cultures, who are

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.575
trying to change from within.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.910
One of the things that excites
us a lot about the Women's

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.220
Media Center is that we see--
I mean, we just started,

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:22.080
but that we have the potential
for becoming the hub,

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.300
the site, where women
everywhere in the world

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:31.900
can come to learn other
women's narratives,

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.160
learn how they can move forward
within their own cultures

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.110
and the things
that restrict them.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.770
We have half of our board here.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:42.500
Or all of our board is here.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.900
Do you all want to say anything?

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.274
Because these are
women who are--

00:42:45.274 --> 00:42:47.240
have you all read
"Sisterhood is Powerful,"

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.490
"Sisterhood is Global"?

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:50.530
Well, the editor or
the author of that

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:51.962
is Robin Morgan who's here.

00:42:51.962 --> 00:42:55.406
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.650
Yeah, and while you're
coming, Carol Jenkins

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.557
is our chair of the board.

00:43:05.557 --> 00:43:06.140
Carol Jenkins.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:10.577
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:10.577 --> 00:43:12.056
GLORIA STEINEM: NBC anchorwoman.

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:13.770
So there are two
media professionals.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:15.115
So those are from the inside.

00:43:15.115 --> 00:43:16.490
JANE FONDA: Gloria
Feldt, who was

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.550
the president of the Planned
Parenthood of America.

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.670
I wanted to introduce
Helen and Christina.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:29.170
GLORIA STEINEM: Helen Zia.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:29.670
Where's Helen?

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:30.750
JANE FONDA: Helen
is right there.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.970
GLORIA STEINEM: Helen Zia,
who was, I'm proud to say,

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.415
an editor at "Ms." magazine
but who now has gone on

00:43:35.415 --> 00:43:37.670
to even bigger and
more amazing things,

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:41.750
is a resident of San
Francisco, and was

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.394
head of the Asian American
Journalists Association.

00:43:45.394 --> 00:43:47.060
Well, I could give
their whole pedigree.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:47.590
But anyway.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:49.610
JANE FONDA: And
Christina Azocar.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:50.140
GLORIA STEINEM: And Christina.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:50.640
Right.

00:43:55.914 --> 00:43:58.080
ROBIN MORGAN: I just want
to say a quick word, which

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.681
is this is so fucking awesome.

00:44:00.681 --> 00:44:03.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.410
I now know how it must
feel to-- as if they

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:12.970
refound-- I'm in the Library of
Alexandria, that's where I am.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.881
We have refound the
Library of Alexandria.

00:44:15.881 --> 00:44:17.880
There were friends who
said, with this new book,

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.290
with "Fighting Words," my
god, with the research--

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.990
shorts, factoids, soundbites
that the founders were really

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.220
radicals.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.120
Not so good on slaves,
not so good on women,

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.790
but on separation of church
and state, the real thing.

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:33.420
I still have some friends
in my generation who

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:38.226
run with pterodactyls,
and who said, my god,

00:44:38.226 --> 00:44:40.350
you must have spent weeks
and weeks in the library.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.290
And I said, what are you?

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:41.790
Crazy?

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.020
I never left the house.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:47.375
So everything that Jane,
and Gloria, and Eric

00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:49.690
have said so superbly, yes to.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.630
And we need you.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.210
You are the future.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.630
For women of the global
south about whom everything

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:00.271
is building community
and for women

00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:02.020
all over the world
about whom everything--

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:06.150
we were on personal
content before you were.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.070
That is what the women's
movement's been about.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:10.640
So just keep doing it.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.760
Feed us your ideas.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.900
Tell us what we should be
doing with this magic next step

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.360
in evolution, which is this
new communications revolution,

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.730
and with Google's place in it.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.582
I'm a Googler.

00:45:23.582 --> 00:45:27.054
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:35.277 --> 00:45:37.110
AUDIENCE: She's a really
hard act to follow,

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.360
but at least I have gray hair.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.770
I have one comment
and then a question.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:48.160
My comment is I'm 61, and
I'm a professor at Stanford.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.670
This is the first time I've
ever gotten up to a microphone

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.755
to ask a question.

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:00.190
And I noticed the
reason I got up

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.150
is because of the first
four people who got up,

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:05.160
three were men and
one was a woman,

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.030
and I said, I have to
get up and say that.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:12.110
Because even in this
audience, the men

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:15.370
were quicker on
the draw and felt

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:19.440
more legitimate about
jumping up to ask a question.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.140
And I think that
that says something

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.840
about what is the
underlying set of issues.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.070
And now my question, which
relates to the underlying

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:34.420
set of issues, which
is that what I'm seeing

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.970
among the young people,
who I'm teaching

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.960
and who I'm seeing
through my children,

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:48.210
is that young women, many of
whom have had feminist mothers,

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:53.960
are seeing how difficult it
is to, quote, "have it all."

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.430
And that working full-time
and having quality time

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:01.390
with their children-- which
is all the stuff that they're

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:04.000
hearing-- just seems impossible.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.610
And I think indeed, it is.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.690
And what is not
happening is the men

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:14.640
are not feeling
that they dare risk

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.590
their careers to be at home.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.750
Betty Friedan had
said that that's

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:27.090
where the problem
is, that we have not

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:32.040
changed the cultural
view of what a family is,

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.910
of what men should do.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:35.210
You've talked about it.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:41.520
But I ask if you have any
ideas about how to really begin

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:47.340
to allow men to be at home
so that children can really

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.940
get both parents,
and women can be

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.520
able to do what they
want to do and not

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.910
feel forced into part-time.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.852
GLORIA STEINEM: Yeah,
you put your finger--

00:47:56.852 --> 00:47:58.310
when I was talking
about redefining

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.980
work, that was part of it.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.320
But we are at the
place you described.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.970
We have convinced the
majority of everybody

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.990
that women can do what
men can do, which is huge.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:14.110
But we haven't even begun to
convince ourselves that men

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.750
can do what women can do.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:18.660
And so children are growing
up with much too little father

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.020
and too much mother.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.990
And men are not developing all
the qualities that are wrongly

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:25.870
called feminine
but are just human,

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.850
that are developed by
both raising children

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:30.980
and being raised
to raise children,

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.500
so that you become
a whole person.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:39.494
Much of it, I think,
is-- well, you

00:48:39.494 --> 00:48:40.910
don't know where
to begin exactly,

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:42.076
so I won't say "much of it."

00:48:42.076 --> 00:48:46.430
But part of it is that
young women are not yet

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:47.600
angry about this.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.340
I think that will be
the next big stage.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:54.780
Because women's pattern
of activism is usually--

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.780
I'm sure everybody in
this room is an exception,

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.100
but anyway-- is the reverse
of men's where we're

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.550
conservative when we're young.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.096
We don't make waves
when we're young.

00:49:03.096 --> 00:49:05.220
And we get steadily more
radical and trouble-making

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.090
as we get older.

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:10.157
Whereas men tend to
be rebellious in youth

00:49:10.157 --> 00:49:11.240
and get more conservative.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.710
Because men gain power with age.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:14.080
Women lose power with age.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.150
It makes sense.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:20.340
Therefore, young women
are still assuming

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.020
they have to do it all.

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.750
And I must say, the
women's movement

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:25.160
never said "have it all."

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.380
We always knew that that was the
enemy of the women's movement

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:28.880
saying that.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.171
If having it all means doing
it all, it's not possible.

00:49:31.171 --> 00:49:33.170
You can't have two
full-time jobs.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:39.450
So we need to start at
the microcosm of ourselves

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:42.440
in the household saying no.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.460
Them what cooks can also eat.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:45.330
I'm not cooking.

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.680
A woman in an audience
stood up and said that she

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.670
was worried about this.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:55.477
So she just had a baby, and
she went away for three weeks

00:49:55.477 --> 00:49:57.060
and left her husband
with the new baby

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.357
because she realized that
he would not learn unless he

00:49:59.357 --> 00:50:00.440
had to, just like she did.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.574
And the audience went-- [GASP]

00:50:02.574 --> 00:50:03.827
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:03.827 --> 00:50:05.285
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
did they survive?

00:50:05.285 --> 00:50:08.540
GLORIA STEINEM:
Yeah, they survived.

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.850
Some of it is control.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:13.210
In women, it's the get out
of my kitchen syndrome.

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:14.590
It's my house,
I'm going to cook.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:16.840
We have to look
at the microcosm,

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.750
and are we really expecting
this kind of change?

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.000
And we have to look
at the macrocosm

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.660
and get work patterns that
allow both women and men to be

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.520
the parents, the nurturing
parents, of babies

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.640
and little children.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.080
So that you can work a three-day
week, or a shorter day,

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.870
or what every other developed
country in the world

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:41.830
has more than we do, which
are flexible work patterns

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:42.980
and child care.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.870
We're the only
industrial democracy

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.970
or whatever we are-- do
we still say "industrial"?

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:48.040
No.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:48.900
"Technological"?

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.809
Whatever we are.

00:50:49.809 --> 00:50:50.975
Do we still say "democracy"?

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:57.190
Anyway, that doesn't have a
national system of child care.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.530
Kids need to see each other.

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:00.321
They get very bored
with looking at grownup

00:51:00.321 --> 00:51:02.910
knees and the television set.

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:05.760
So you can start at the
policy, political end,

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.530
and you can start
at the personal end.

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:10.589
And we'll meet in the
middle in a revolution.

00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:12.130
JANE FONDA: We could
take a good look

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.180
at what the Netherlands does.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.334
They're not perfect, but
you're way ahead of us.

00:51:16.334 --> 00:51:18.500
ERIC SCHMIDT: We have time
for a few more questions.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.020
So why don't we have the
folks here, lined up,

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.580
ask their questions
reasonably quickly.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.720
Go ahead, and we'll see you
get some quick answers as well.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.270
AUDIENCE: Well, I
wanted to tell you

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:26.950
it's a pleasure
to have you here.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:29.300
And I thank you so
much for what you've

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:35.050
done for everybody, especially
for me at Berkeley in the '70s.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:37.900
I wouldn't be here at
Google, I don't think,

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:42.280
if I hadn't been
so taken by what

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.980
you both did then, and stood up,
and gave us a voice and power.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.270
So I wanted to thank you.

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:50.974
That was my first part.

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:52.140
There's a couple more parts.

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.080
One more part is
that if, somehow,

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.360
you are partnering
with Google, I

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.530
would be thrilled to help
you in some way to make

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:02.910
the full circle to come back.

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:08.820
I do QA, and I would be
glad to do some kind of QA.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.965
I would be thrilled.

00:52:09.965 --> 00:52:12.370
And then the third
part of it-- I

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:15.580
know you touched upon
it with your question--

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:21.520
is I am just really scared about
the rise of fundamentalism.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.590
It's not just one religion.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:25.470
We have it here in our country.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:30.850
And as a feminist, I am
so worried for the women

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:32.970
who are oppressed again.

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:35.990
We can have an influence
in our country,

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:39.190
and hopefully, we'll stand up
and show the world something

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.930
about it.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.410
But I do worry about that.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:44.760
And I was wondering
about your thoughts.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.400
GLORIA STEINEM:
Well, I don't know.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.920
Jane, do you want--
fundamentalism.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.570
Well, this is the point at
which I get in deep trouble, OK?

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:56.514
But anyway.

00:52:56.514 --> 00:52:57.864
ERIC SCHMIDT: Please go ahead.

00:52:57.864 --> 00:52:59.780
AUDIENCE: And I'm not
picking on any religion.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.460
GLORIA STEINEM:
Monotheism was invented

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.280
to put God into one
kind of human being,

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.360
not into nature, to make
it OK to dominate nature,

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.550
to make it OK to dominate women.

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:12.610
The rise of fundamentalism
is precisely

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:17.420
to put down the worldwide
rebellion of women,

00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:22.740
and it also has all
kinds of racial aspects.

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:27.750
It is politics in
the sky, really.

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:30.610
And the first thing I think
we have to do, especially

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:34.190
in this country, is to stop
being afraid of discussing it.

00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:39.210
We have allowed religion
to be off-limits as an area

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:42.630
of discussion because,
well, you know.

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:45.130
But when it is political
and oppressive,

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:47.200
we have to be able to name it.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.250
And that's what's so
great about Robin's book,

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:52.780
because you see that
our founders were

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.270
saying exactly that.

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.680
You can't have a
democracy with priests.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:01.320
We shouldn't even have
chaplains in Congress.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.050
Jefferson sat in the White
House and edited everything

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.050
undemocratic out of the Bible.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:11.190
Can you imagine anybody even
criticizing the Bible now?

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.950
Saying, hello?

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:14.430
Maybe the Gnostic Gospels
were much more authoritative.

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:17.670
Jesus never said he
was the Son of God.

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:21.710
There's a world there that
we are afraid to approach

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:24.360
and therefore, is crushing
us, because it knows

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.320
very well what its purpose is.

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.537
And we're afraid to
name its purpose.

00:54:28.537 --> 00:54:29.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:30.220
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's go
to our next question.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:30.719
Thank you.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:40.200
AUDIENCE: So my mom was a member
of the National Organization

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:44.260
of Women in the Mother's Day
march in Chicago in 1980,

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:49.840
and did sit-ins in college,
and was taking action

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.870
to support women's rights,
and thinks so highly of you

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:54.810
both for all of your
action and leadership.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.585
And I don't see a
woman of my age doing

00:54:57.585 --> 00:54:59.410
that, including myself.

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:00.970
And how did you
have the strength

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:04.100
to take that leadership
role, and really

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.306
put yourself out there,
and really message

00:55:06.306 --> 00:55:07.930
and communicate to
the public, and lead

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.490
people to march and raise
awareness of these issues?

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:13.530
Because I feel like we need
that now for women and men.

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:15.970
And I see that there's
a leadership vacuum.

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:17.600
And is it the media?

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.090
And maybe if there was more
awareness of what was actually

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:23.890
happening, people
would find a way

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:27.500
to drive that anger and
frustration to actually doing

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.350
something.

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:31.920
Because in the last election, I
didn't go to whatever-- Ohio--

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.760
and knock on doors.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.112
And I think a lot of people are
in this sort of complacency.

00:55:36.112 --> 00:55:38.760
I can't believe it, but I'm
not willing to do something.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.700
JANE FONDA: A lot of people did
though, go and knock on doors.

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:41.320
AUDIENCE: Oh, they did?

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.130
Yeah, and I hope in
the next election,

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.550
I want to connect
with some group that

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:46.760
is going to go and do that.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.220
But I feel like
that spirit was so

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.827
alive in my parents'
generation in a way

00:55:51.827 --> 00:55:53.660
that I certainly didn't
see it on my college

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.340
campus in Florida.

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.690
And I don't know.

00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:03.580
How do we train the leaders
to really take that next--

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:07.610
are you training new leaders?

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:09.190
GLORIA STEINEM: We are training.

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:12.545
The Women's Media Center
is-- the wonderful woman

00:56:12.545 --> 00:56:14.545
who was age 60, the one
who got up and said this

00:56:14.545 --> 00:56:15.860
is the first time she spoke.

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.140
We're trying to help women
find their voices young,

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.520
and get out there in the
media, and spread it.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.510
But I must say that
part of the reason

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:26.910
you know Jane and me was
because there were so few of us.

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:29.070
Now, it seems to me,
there's so many of you.

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:30.930
We were like six crazy
people at the time.

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:33.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:38.130
And there are many,
many, many more now.

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:43.640
And therefore, you don't see
the same kind of individuation.

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.320
But it is present.

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:47.310
It is absolutely present.

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:53.210
And whether you're getting
politics in song lyrics

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:54.670
with Ani DiFranco, whoever.

00:56:57.590 --> 00:57:00.090
That didn't exist before.

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:01.550
With June Moon Honeymoon.

00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:07.500
Now you've got a CR
group just in your iPod.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.750
Or whether it's on campus
with the majority opinion.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:15.390
But it does require us to
say, how am I translating this

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:16.347
into action?

00:57:16.347 --> 00:57:18.680
And what you just said was
the answer, that you're going

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.796
to do it this time, right?

00:57:19.796 --> 00:57:20.920
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's right.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.520
Let's have a couple
more quickly,

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.815
and then we'll be-- go ahead.

00:57:23.815 --> 00:57:25.440
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.410
I'm just in awe.

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:29.850
And I read every
bit of Ms. Magazine,

00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:31.780
and it really totally
changed my life.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.920
And just that you
came to Google,

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.520
that we're not selling out,
and working for ourselves,

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.490
that working for a corporation,
we could also work for a cause.

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:44.170
So it means a lot to me.

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:50.980
Anyway, my question was,
when I read feminism,

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:53.520
sometimes, we have
to work with theory

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.380
because we have to have vision.

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.200
And it tends to be very white.

00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.310
And I grew up very sort of
white, so it speaks to me,

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:05.770
but I really-- what is
your vision of feminism?

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:08.000
Diverse yet very unified?

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.690
Because I see it going
to environmentalism

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:12.300
and all these other things.

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.680
But what is your vision for now?

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.732
And I'm fine with changes,
and I know visions change.

00:58:18.732 --> 00:58:20.940
But I would just like to
hear that since you're here,

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:22.450
and I would like that slice.

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:24.437
And thank you so
much for coming.

00:58:24.437 --> 00:58:25.520
GLORIA STEINEM: Thank you.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.686
JANE FONDA: I just want to
say one thing personally.

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:34.230
I go to the Interdenominational
Theological Center in Atlanta.

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:37.590
It's the largest training center
for African American ministers

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:38.606
and me.

00:58:38.606 --> 00:58:40.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.120
I'm the only white
student there.

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.850
And a couple of the
classes that I'm taking

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.620
is Womanist Interpretation.

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:55.960
And I am in this school
surrounded by black--

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.400
their word is womanist.

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:04.360
It comes from Alice Walker's
writings, "My Mother's Garden."

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.630
Feminism, womanism, it's there.

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:08.620
And it's women of all color.

00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:11.560
And I personally
have experienced it.

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:16.240
And it's proof to
me of how far we've

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:20.500
come from an all-white,
middle class movement

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:26.450
to a global, really
global, multiracial,

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:29.680
multiethnicity movement.

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.670
It's there.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:33.760
I just came back
from Sweden where

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.750
there was a feminist
candidate running for office.

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:39.540
And a bunch of us
went just to show

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:43.670
that it's a global movement.

00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:45.340
GLORIA STEINEM: The
president of Liberia

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:50.390
who basically won because
women in the marketplace

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:51.680
could vote in the marketplace.

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:55.660
And also because when they
couldn't reach an agreement,

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:59.800
and it was mainly men reaching
an agreement-- the preface

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.200
to the election-- the women
surrounded the building

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.240
and wouldn't let them out.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.700
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's
get our next question.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:12.660
I'm a big believer in the
power of women's institutions.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.470
I went to an
undergraduate college that

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:17.730
was an all-women
college and believe

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:20.350
that women's groups have
been a big agent for change.

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.280
But I struggle with
the idea that when

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.360
you label something a women's
group, or women's media,

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.290
that it gives more
credence to the idea

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.940
that the mainstream
institution is still for men.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:34.099
It makes it easier to
belittle or sideline.

01:00:34.099 --> 01:00:36.640
So I'm just wondering how you
see the future of these groups,

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.490
and how we can best integrate
our ideas into the mainstream.

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:42.790
GLORIA STEINEM: Well, I
envision it like this.

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:44.170
You've got a
powerful group here,

01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:45.870
you've got a less
powerful group here,

01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:51.540
whether it's because
of any reason-- gender,

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.800
ethnicity, whatever it is.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:59.570
If you integrate at this point,
you come into a hierarchy.

01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:03.620
What you have to do is empower
this group to get up here,

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.530
and then you can come together.

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:10.420
So the coming together is the
goal, but the path to the goal

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:15.210
is to become visible, to move
from the margins to the center,

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:17.740
to have a voice,
to be able to say.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.960
So labeling things
in that way is

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.050
a step towards not having
to label them eventually.

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:29.330
And we need to keep saying
what the end goal is, I agree,

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:32.490
so that we don't think that
separation is the goal.

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:33.770
It is not.

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:34.770
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you.

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:36.957
And you will have the
honor of the last question.

01:01:36.957 --> 01:01:37.790
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:40.700
I don't know whether I'm
thrilled or intimidated.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.330
But I want to say thank
you again for coming.

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:46.444
I'm thrilled to be here
and hear the two of you.

01:01:46.444 --> 01:01:48.110
Actually, I want to
end this by bringing

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.360
it closer to what I
think is something

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.020
relevant to the women in this
audience, which is there's

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.210
this brand new report out by
the National Academy of Sciences

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.980
about women leadership in
science and engineering.

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.920
And essentially
refuting everything

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.810
that Larry Summers said,
and saying that it's not

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:05.920
differences in ability.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.640
It's essentially the
death by a thousand cuts

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.804
and the small little
things that happen

01:02:10.804 --> 01:02:12.470
to women over the
course of their career

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:14.585
that end up holding them back.

01:02:14.585 --> 01:02:18.570
And the fact that we
have so many fewer women

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:20.910
leaders in science and
technology than the pipeline

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:23.270
would suggest.

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:25.060
Many of the women
in this audience

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:28.670
are living that pipeline,
living the route

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:33.850
to potentially being a woman
leader in the sciences field.

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:36.260
Do you have any
thoughts of this?

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.720
How to overcome.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.590
How to stay steadfast through
these thousands of small things

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:44.650
that aren't even noticed
by the participants,

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:46.490
neither the men or the women.

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:48.573
GLORIA STEINEM: She's
turning to me, the engineer.

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:50.130
No.

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:57.460
Well, I think you need
each others' support--

01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:00.315
women who are going through the
struggle, men who understand

01:03:00.315 --> 01:03:02.450
it and are supportive.

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:03.820
We're communal creatures.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.220
If we're by ourselves,
we come to feel crazy,

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.280
and alone, and immobilized.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.370
You need people to talk to about
what's happening to you once

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:14.590
a week, once a month, get
together, call it whatever--

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:18.100
a CR group, a networking group,
a book club, a quilting bee.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.410
I don't care what you
call it, but someplace

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:22.830
where you can talk
about it, and get

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:25.240
support, and pool information.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:30.060
I think that's
absolutely crucial.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.330
And then also, we need
to look at the way

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:38.300
that the inclusion of other
groups transforms the outcome.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:42.410
There's a whole amazing feminist
critique of anthropology,

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:45.140
and the feminist critique of
the scientific method that

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.820
says, wait a minute,
your hypothesis

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.890
dictates the whole thing.

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:51.880
And what you get in the
laboratory is only replicate.

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.240
All that argument,
which is fascinating.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.260
And we need to start our
own centers of power,

01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.610
like the Women's Media Center.

01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:02.510
My college, Smith College,
is the only women's college,

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:04.690
I think, with an
engineering school.

01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:05.190
Why?

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:08.710
Because the young women
were going to UMass,

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:11.459
and were not getting
called on, and whatever.

01:04:11.459 --> 01:04:13.500
And this went on for years,
and years, and years.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.200
And they got pissed.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.075
And they started their
own engineering school

01:04:16.075 --> 01:04:18.940
on the premise that not
only would engineering

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:22.230
change women-- to give
them knowledge, and power,

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.510
and so on-- but women
would change engineering

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:28.160
in all of its different
permutations and fields.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.880
So again, the environmentalists
are right-- act locally

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.390
and think globally.

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:38.060
It's starting with the
intimate, with ourselves,

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.880
and keeping our strength up,
and keeping our vision up,

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.540
and also going to change
the structure in the policy.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.760
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you so
much for taking the time

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.300
to come here.

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.080
In the last hour,
we've talked a lot

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.890
about the sense of
activism and the role

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:57.230
that everybody has played.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:00.306
But I could think of no
better examples of impact

01:05:00.306 --> 01:05:01.680
on the world than
the two of you.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.030
I think all of us can only hope
to have the level of impact

01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:06.480
on society as a
whole as you have

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.626
done in the first two
of your three acts.

01:05:11.626 --> 01:05:15.410
And since it's going to get more
interesting as you get older,

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:18.240
I'm very much looking
forward to their third act.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.250
Thank you very much.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:19.750
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.650
GLORIA STEINEM: Thank you.

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:23.500
JANE FONDA: Thank you.
