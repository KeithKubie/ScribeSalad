00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.719
Happiness, we all crave the feeling of contentment and satisfaction

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.258
But not everyone actually achieves it

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.899
for many individuals the presence of a great family life and a flourishing career is

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.449
often not enough a

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.540
Smart individual can have all these things and more but still feel a sense of loneliness and sadness

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.489
Here are six reasons why smart people sometimes struggle to find happiness.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.630
number one

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.130
intelligent people

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.149
overanalyze

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.899
It's common for an individual of high intelligence to overthink and analyze every aspect of their life

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.109
While this analytical nature can be a great asset

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.570
Constantly analyzing everything in your life only leads to frustration and exhaustion

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.980
Your knowledge and life experiences have taught you to have a critical eye

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.739
This is a burden that many people don't carry simply because they don't think on this level

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.019
Plus there are the timeless dilemmas and philosophical issues that seem to have no solution

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.509
The more you try to figure it all out the less satisfied you become in your quest for understanding in this case the saying

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.259
"Ignorance is bliss" is true. Number two

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.900
intelligent people have high standards

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.979
Smart individuals like to hold everything in their life to high standards and the failure to reach these standards

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.409
Ultimately leads to disappointment

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.400
be it your career, your relationships or even the talent and skill level that you bring to your daily activities

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.009
if your expectations are unrealistic

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.110
Prepare to be disappointed and the greater and more unrealistic the expectations

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.099
The greater the letdown when these hopes aren't met number three

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.549
Intelligent people are extremely self-critical

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.039
Unhappiness four highly intelligent people also stems from their deep thinking nature

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.770
When you compare yourself to those high standards

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.919
You'll blame your failures on your own shortcomings

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.398
This self critical nature directly combats your happiness and then fault-finding becomes your new normal

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.770
Intelligent people often think back to events of the past into situations in which they behaved poorly or made the wrong choice

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.879
You may not realize it but this constant regret over past decisions is robbing you of happiness every day

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.600
But those who are able to forgive themselves and work beyond these issues are on the path to happiness

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.250
number four

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.250
Intelligent people are overly ambitious

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.160
It's very difficult for a person of high intelligence to be satisfied with what they already have

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.579
Your complex mind causes you to constantly seek something bigger and better, a greater purpose if you will

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.240
This drive to achieve can make you miss the simple things in everyday life that bring others a great deal of satisfaction

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.040
Your mind craves intellectual stimulation and you aren't satisfied until you find it. Then you need more of it

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.649
For this mindset the saying "stop and smell the roses" can be helpful

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.060
number five

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.210
Intelligent people are often misunderstood

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.020
We all want to be understood and accepted for who we are

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.520
It's great to share meaningful conversations with a like-minded person and to find someone who shares your own worldviews and philosophies

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.269
This can be quite difficult to find for a person of high intelligence

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.780
When you feel like no one can connect with you on your level you feel alone and misunderstood

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.869
It's been proven that people with high levels of intelligence don't need to socialize as much as others

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.139
But the need for human interaction is still there

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.809
When you have a high intelligence

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.230
You just prefer to talk about meaningful and fascinating things

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.199
Rather than trivial subjects such as food or weather or other people number six

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.770
intelligent people often develop psychological issues

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.690
numerous studies have shown links between psychiatric problems and high intelligence

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.590
Anxiety and bipolar disorder are among the most common

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.660
It's not certain whether these disorders come from having a brilliant mind or not. But the prevalence of the connections cannot be ignored

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.659
Even in the absence of severe mental disorders if you have exceptionally high intelligence

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.129
Chances are you may struggle with depression because of the reasons mentioned above

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.449
When you constantly think on these things you may also find yourself reflecting on life and death and the purpose of existence

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.319
Topics that are often accompanied by feelings of sadness. in the end you hold the key to your own happiness

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.409
Sure, the circumstances around you play a big part, but that doesn't mean they determine your happiness

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.119
