00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The second bonus question was what is the smallest angle Î± where the cannonball

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
makes it over the iceberg and can still hit the enemy ship?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now this is different than the first question because in this question,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the cannonball just has to make it over the iceberg.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It doesn't necessarily have to curve down and hit the enemy ship, but in this question

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the cannonball has to make it both over the iceberg and still hit the enemy ship.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So tell me what's the smallest angle is where this is actually possible.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, this question is really quite difficult, so don't feel bad if you can't get it

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and please free to discuss it in the forums and keep in mind this isn't for credit--

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so just have fun with this problem.
