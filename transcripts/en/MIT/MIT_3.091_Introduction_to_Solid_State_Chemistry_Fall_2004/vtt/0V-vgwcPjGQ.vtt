00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.300
One announcement,
even though you will have no

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.610
academic exercises Thursday and
Friday, I know you would feel a

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.920
sense of shock,
disruption and dare I say

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.230
dislocation in your life if I did
not stick to schedule,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.530
so there will be a skill testing
question on Tuesday based on

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.840
Homework 12. And that will be the
last one because the subsequent week

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.300
is the last week of semester.
And, since there is a final exam in

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.920
this subject, there can be no tests
during the last week of class,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.530
so we will not have any weekly test.
Today I want to talk about

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.150
biochemistry. We are going to spend
the next three lectures on

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.760
biochemistry. This is the chemistry
of living organisms.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.380
And I want to make several points
by way of introduction.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:32.693
The first one is that living
organisms are chemical systems.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:22.610
And they are governed by the same
laws that apply to inanimate matter.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.220
We don't have a special chemistry.
And, in fact, I came across this

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.840
comment that was made by the Nobel
Laureate Richard Feynman who said

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.460
that if in some cataclysm all of
scientific knowledge were to be

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.070
destroyed and only one sentence
passed onto the next generations of

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.690
creatures, what statement would
contain the most information

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.530
in the fewest words?
"I believe that it is the atomic

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.610
hypothesis or the atomic fact or
whatever you wish to call it,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.690
that all things are made of atoms.
Little particles that move around

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.760
in perpetual motion attracting each
other when they are a little

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.840
distance apart but repelling upon
being squeezed into one another.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.920
The atomic hypothesis very
important. Second comment I want to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:35.106
make is none of us is unaware of the
boom in biotechnology today.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:25.400
What is the boom in biotechnology?
Why do we have the boom in

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.790
biotechnology?
It is really a boom in biochemical

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.190
technology. What is the modern
biology called?

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.590
It is called molecular biology.
And what is molecular science?

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.990
This is chemistry.
And, more importantly,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.390
it is really not just chemical
composition but spatial arrangement.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.790
Chemistry, materials science, solid
state chemistry underlies

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.540
the boom in biotech.
That is why we are going to spend

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.630
some time. We are spending 10% of
our lectures in 3.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.720
91 on this topic. And,
last comment is, why only now?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.810
Why didn't this happen 50 years ago?
What is enabling this boom today?

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.900
And the answer is complexity.
Let's get the answer out there.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:34.533
The answer is complexity of the
chemistry.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:26.300
And if you think about how materials
have evolved over time,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.610
you know, we date our ages.
The ages of man are dated in terms

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.920
of materials. We have the Stone Age,
Bronze Age, Iron Age.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.230
You might call the first half of
the 20th century the "Plastics Age."

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.530
You might call the last half of the
20th century the "Silicon Age."

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.840
And we see increasing complexity.
To work with stone, stone is found

00:03:47.840 --> 00:04:05.680
in nature.
It requires only a change of shape.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
But everything else, the metals,
the bronze, the iron are not found

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in nature, native.
That requires a change in shape

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
after a change in chemical
composition. Chemistry is magic.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And chemists were revered as
sorcerers, magicians and were highly

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
respected. Not today.
There are compelling reasons to be

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
alive today, but not for the respect
given to chemists.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
It is magic to take something and
convert its chemical composition.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And that took time to get the fires
hot enough to discover the chemistry

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that would allow us to take a pile
of sand and turn it into a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
semiconducting device so that you
could talk on a phone or type a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
letter on a solid state device known
as a computer.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That took time.
Polymers come at the dawn of the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:54.160
20th century.
Macromolecules.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.490
It turns out that many of the
molecules in living organisms are

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.830
macromolecules,
so necessarily our understanding of

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.160
this chemistry had to wait for the
understanding of polymer chemistry.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.490
Finally, now we have information
technology, we have our

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.830
understanding of macromolecules,
and now we can go forward with

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.420
biotechnology.
Let's get down to business and start

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:28.280
talking about the chemistry of
specific biomolecules.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.140
And they fall broadly into four
categories. Let's document the four

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:52.213
categories of biomolecules.
We have, first of all, proteins.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:49.830
Carbohydrates,

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.490
nucleic acids and lipids.
And, in the three lectures that we

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.160
have, I am going to focus primarily
on proteins, nucleic acids and

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.830
lipids. I think this will get you
far enough along to enjoy subsequent

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.490
chemistry. Let's get down to
business and start with proteins.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.160
Protein comes from the Greek word
proteos which means of

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:25.280
first importance.
And these are macromolecules,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:33.850
polymers of a sort. And they are
formed by polymerization.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:42.420
And the mer groups that go into
this macromolecule are called amino

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:56.906
acids, formed by polymerization
of amino acids.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:56.630
We better get a grip on what amino
acids are. As the name applies,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.270
they must be compounds that have an
acid group. In other words,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.900
capability of donating protons.
And amino means there must be some

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.540
kind of an NH formation.
Let's draw the skeletal structure

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.180
of a prototypical amino acid.
We start at the center with a

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.110
carbon that is sp3 hybridized.
And one of the terminals contains an

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:31.330
amino group which consists of this
formation bearing nitrogen.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.550
The acid is given above. This is
carboxylic acid.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.770
Carbon double bond to oxygen.
And then the OH. And this H is

00:07:43.770 --> 00:08:00.540
capable of detaching. There
is the amino acid.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
The third bond goes to oxygen.
Three of the four bonds are

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
uniquely specified in every amino
acid. Three of the four.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And now the fourth one, this is a
tetrahedron so I am trying to

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
indicate that this bond is receding
into the back,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
is variable. And I am going to use
the carrier variable R.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And this is the term for the
substituent.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:26.660
And this is nature's choice.
In principle, anything that will

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:33.330
covalently bond with a sigma bond
can be put here.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:39.990
This means that there are thousands
and thousands of compounds that

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:46.660
qualify as amino acids,
but in proteins, only 20 found in

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:52.720
proteins. That is a short list.
It is a rather compact library.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.180
Let's take a look at the types of
substituents. And for that you can

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.630
look at the table here in your
reading. This is from the table.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.080
It actually spills over two pages.
I know that is very hard to read,

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.540
but it is more iconic just to sort
of symbolize that maybe somebody has

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:32.546
done the reading and they say I
recognize that table.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:25.810
There are 20 different R groups,
20 different substituents. And they,

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:31.630
themselves, fall into four
categories. The R groups can be

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:37.450
broken down into four categories.
First one is nonpolar, the R group

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:43.270
is nonpolar. Clearly,
under that circumstance,

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:49.090
we would have something that is
hydrophobic. Nonpolar groups would

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:55.250
be less inclined to bond to water.
We have the option of polar groups.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:01.750
Polar with hydrogen bonding
capability. And such groups are

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:15.100
going to be hydrophilic.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:16.400
There is a third group that has a
net charge, so the R group is

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.790
actually net positive.
And so that means these are going

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:40.646
to be strongly hydrophilic.
They have a very high affinity for

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
water. And it turns out they will
function as basic in aqueous

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
solution. And then the last group
is a set of substituents that have a

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
net negative charge.
And this, too, are strongly

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
hydrophilic and will act acidic when
dissolved in water.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:57.300
Now our bodies can synthesize only
ten of the twenty amino acids.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.610
You will read in advertising that
certain foods contain some of the

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.920
essential amino acids,
meaning they contain some of the ten

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.230
amino acids that we are incapable of
processing. And failure to consume

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.530
this in the diet,
over a long period of time,

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.840
can have deleterious effects
prompting, in the extreme,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:37.746
your exiting the carbon cycle.
You do want to watch your diet.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
There is one other structural
feature that is important in the

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
amino acids, and that I want to show
with reference to a specific amino

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
acid. Let's choose alanine.
In alanine, the substituent group

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
is methyl CH3.
I can draw alanine as follows using

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:53.230
the skeletal structure to the left.
Here is the amino group which I am

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.690
just going to truncate as H2N.
And, maybe later, I am even going

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.150
to get so bold as to put NH2
recognizing that it is not the H

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:06.610
that is bridging to the nitrogen.
But let's do it this way. The

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.070
carboxylic acid will go up here,
will go here, and then we will just

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.530
put the methyl group.
Now, I could just as easily have

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:34.526
written it the following way.
I could have done this.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:24.140
I could have put the amino group to
the right and the hydrogen to the

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.280
left. If you look at these two,
at first glance, you might say I

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.420
just have to turn it and he has
basically written the same thing.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.560
But upon closer inspection you will
discover that it is impossible to

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.710
convert the one on the right to the
one on the left.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.850
In fact, they are not
superimposable.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:13:04.633
What we are looking at here is
essentially a pair of gloves.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:53.830
This is considered the left hand and
this is the right hand.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.660
And you can close the gloves.
You can make them fit one against

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.490
the other. They will mirror one
another across a mirror plane,

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:08.330
but they are not superimposable.
As opposed to something like, say,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:13.160
propane. If I take propane, which
is also carbon sp3 hybridized,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:31.053
in contrast it has methyl above and
below.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:23.660
And that clearly is perfectly
symmetric and does not have such a

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:29.330
glove-like feature.
Such molecules that have,

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:34.990
we say, a handedness are called
chiral, from the Greek word for hand.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:40.660
Chirality is the property of having
handedness, non-superimposable.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:46.330
Another term for these is
stereoisomers.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:14:03.726
We can consider chiral molecules
stereoisomers.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.200
And the different hands,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.600
if you will, are called enantiomers.
And we don't refer to one

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.000
stereoisomer or the other
stereoisomer. We refer to the

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:13.400
enantiomer coming from the Greek
word for mirror.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:32.800
Enantios is the Greek word for
mirror. These are different

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:22.200
mirror images.
The other thing about these is that

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.600
they are optically active.
And what they will do is take

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:46.333
polarized light and rotate it
through a degree of polarization.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:35.400
Just to give you another example of
the difference between something

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.800
that is chiral and not.
You see the boxes at the top with

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:59.266
no distinguishing features?
They can be twisted, turned and

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.600
made to superimpose over one another.
By putting these little features in

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.000
the bottom corner, we render
these boxes chiral.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.500
And no matter how you twist and turn
this box, you won't be able to

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.000
superimpose it on top of the other
box. Here is a more complicated

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.500
molecule that can come chemically
identical but has a right-handed

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.000
version and a left-handed version.
Let's talk about optical activity.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.500
The only reason I refer to this is
that it gives the labels that are

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.000
used in referring to one
versus the other.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
If you have a light source that just
gives light that is randomly

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
polarized, that is to say it is not
polarized, and then you put it

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
through a polarizing prism so that
the light is polarized in a certain

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
direction. In other words,
the electric vector is only in one

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
direction. Now the polarized light,
here it is indicating that it is

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
polarized vertically.
This is the optically active

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
substance which could include an
aqueous solution of alanine.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:52.920
And, if the aqueous solution of
alanine consists of only one

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.840
enantiomer, then when the polarized
light passes through that solution,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.760
the plane of polarization will be
rotated a certain amount by

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.680
interaction of the light with the
electrons in the orbitals in this

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.610
particular molecule.
And what you see here is an angle

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:17.530
of rotation alpha where alpha is
proportional to the concentration of

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:36.226
the chiral species.
And also the path length through the

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.500
solution. If we put in both
enantiomers, we expect no change.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.500
If we put in one enantiomer, we
will have one direction.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.500
And so it turns out that the
different enantiomers will cause

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.500
different directions of rotation.
And this is how they are labeled.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.500
The one that I have shown here on
the right will cause a clockwise

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:52.280
rotation of the light.
And so it is termed D as in

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.850
dextrorotatory from the Latin word
for right. This is the

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.420
dextrorotatory form.
And then the one here on the left

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.990
will cause the light - And I am
going to write h nu here.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.560
It is the plane of polarization of
the light that is rotating.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.140
The plane of polarization, if it
went through a solution that

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.710
consisted of only the enantiomer
depicted on the left,

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.300
would move in the left direction.
And, even though the Latin word for

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.920
left is sinister,
they didn't call it sinistrorotatory.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.530
They call it levorotatory.
I guess they had to go the Slavic

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.150
languages to get a root word.
Levorotatory is this one. Some

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:42.760
will call this the positive
enantiomer and the left one the

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.380
negative enantiomer,
but in most of the reading that you

00:17:47.380 --> 00:18:05.493
will encounter it will
be the D and the L.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:41.500
It turns out that only the L form of
amino acids are found in proteins.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:51.000
Only L enantiomer of amino acids
are found in proteins.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:19.090
But synthesis could give rise to

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:25.290
both. And certainly chemical
synthesis will give rise to both.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:31.490
I am not going to spend much time
on carbohydrates,

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:37.690
but just for reference,
the carbohydrates are also chiral

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:43.890
molecules. It turns out that in
sugars only D form is metabolized

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:55.780
by our bodies.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:57.830
You may have heard of invert sugar
or baker's sugar.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:02.660
This is simply the L form of the
various sugars.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.490
And this passes unrecognized
through the body.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:12.330
Honey contains the L form of the
carbohydrate because it is processed

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.160
by bees, and the bees have a
different biological apparatus.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:36.653
There is science fiction where
somebody is after some grand event.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:26.330
Finds themselves at a strange place.
It always has to be a desert island.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.660
And they end up eating fruit that
happens to be chock full of energy,

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.990
but it is the wrong enantiomer. And
the people, although they are filled

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:39.330
to satiety, die because they cannot
process the food.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:43.660
That is the basis.
That plot line has been used

00:19:43.660 --> 00:20:03.120
already, I am sorry to tell you,
so you cannot use it now.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:54.400
And, when both enantiomers are
present, this is called racemic.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:12.200
And this is very important, as I
said it is a matter of life and

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:47.200
death, in pharmaceuticals.
I will tell you one example.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:20:13.600
Back in the 1960s there was a drug
that was produced by a German

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:29.933
pharmaceutical company
called thalidomide.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:24.280
Thalidomide was developed as an
anticonvulsant and it was also good

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.560
as a sedative for people that were
severely depressed.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.850
One of the properties of
thalidomide was that you could not

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:37.140
overdose on it.
If a person took a huge quantity of

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.420
thalidomide, it would make the
person comatose,

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.710
you would go into a deep sleep,
you would be an extra on the set of

00:20:45.710 --> 00:21:04.553
Rip Van Winkle, but you could
not kill yourself.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:54.280
An unintended benefit of thalidomide
was discovered by pregnant women in

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.560
Europe who learned that consumption
of thalidomide had a tremendous

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.850
palliate effect on morning sickness,
particularly early in the pregnancy,

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:07.140
so people started using it for a
palliative against morning sickness.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.420
This was only in Europe. The Food
and Drug Administration in the

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:15.710
United States said it has not been
subjected to enough testing and

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:35.086
refused to allow its importation
into the United States.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:23.520
And there was a lot of clamoring
saying the FDA is old-fashioned,

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.050
they are in the pockets of the drug
companies, they are holding up the

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.580
advance of drugs and so on.
And you hear these charges with

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.110
respect to cancer drugs and drugs in
the treatment of AIDS where people

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:37.640
are inpatient for solutions.
The FDA held its ground, but much

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.170
of the drug did find its way into
the United States.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.700
And then shortly after its
widespread consumption,

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.230
it was found that this is a
teratogen and produces

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.820
hideous birth defects.
And people said,

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.460
what went wrong? Why did they not
discover this?

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.110
Was it not tested?
Was it not tested on animal models?

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.760
And the answer is it was tested on
animal models.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.400
It turns out that all the animal
models that it was tested on,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.050
those animals lacked a particular
enzyme that processes thalidomide

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.700
the way it is processed in humans.
This is something that caused quite

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.350
a stir at the time.
But what is the punch line?

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:36.433
The punch line is it is a chiral
molecule.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:24.860
Only one enantiomer causes the birth
defects, but nobody knew at the time.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.730
If they had known,
and instead of selling a racemic

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.590
form and sold a form that has only
the one enantiomer,

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.460
they could have had the beneficial
effects without the undesirable

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.330
effects. And now thalidomide is
back in the news.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.190
Some people have discovered that it
may have some benefit as a component

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:48.060
of a cocktail that is being used in
the treatment of AIDS. But

00:22:48.060 --> 00:23:04.920
the memory lingers on.
By the way, Ritalin,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:42.000
which is used in the treatment of
ADHD, is also chiral.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And it has been produced without
regard to its chirality.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:58.000
It is now emerging that the D
enantiomer, the D form is effective

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:24.630
in the treatment of ADHD.
And the L form is ineffective.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:29.900
And some of the undesirable side
effects of long-term use of Ritalin

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:35.180
may, in fact, be linked to the L
enantiomer. What you are seeing

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.450
more and more in drug design is
attention paid to the structure.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:45.720
It is the structure. In fact, why
don't I cut to the chase.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:24:04.240
This is what drug design is all
about in like two minutes.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:55.830
Let's say this is some receptor
molecule and it has little dipoles

00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:00.660
here. This is a delta minus and
this is a delta plus.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.490
And maybe this is a delta minus and
this is a delta plus just

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.330
arbitrarily. And this is some
candidate drug that is supposed to

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:15.160
come up to this receptor.
And the drug is designed to react.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:33.720
What is going on is really a lock
and key mechanism.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:24.930
And you know the Debye frequency.
It is about ten trillion hertz.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:29.860
Ten trillion times a second nature
puts the system to the test.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.790
On one of those tests, suppose this
drug that is supposed to bind to

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:39.730
this receptor where this is delta
minus, this is delta plus,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:44.660
where this is delta plus, this is
delta minus and so on,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.590
the two will stay together long
enough to do the math and figure out

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:54.530
that there is some more energy to be
gained through a further

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:59.540
chemical reaction.
If, on the other hand,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:04.630
this is somehow misformed so that
opposite this delta minus is also a

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:09.720
delta minus, during that collision
there won't be that staying power to

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.810
keep things together long enough.
And so the activation will not be

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.900
achieved. And so the reaction won't
go forth. Really,

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:38.400
the message here is that atomic
arrangement is the key.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:29.150
With a pun here,
it's the key. This is a lock and

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:33.300
key mechanism,
and atomic arrangement is the key,

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:37.460
paying attention to chirality. Of
course, the other thing is let's

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.610
understand the chemistry to such a
high degree that we are not relying

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.760
on field testing to sort of
determine whether something is

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.920
acceptable or not.
We need to get rid of empiricism

00:25:49.920 --> 00:26:08.906
and ramp up the determinism.
Let's talk about properties of amino

00:25:35.200 --> 00:26:01.600
acids. What are the properties of
these compounds?

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:18.866
Well, first of all,
they are solids at room temperature.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:26:14.750
And they can crystallize.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.250
They can be crystalline. Remember,
these are the mer groups. They are

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.280
not the polymers.
These are the mer groups that have

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.850
yet to be polymerized.
They can crystallize. I think it

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:31.420
is fair to say they are going to be
colorless, entirely covalent,

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.990
highly bonded. And they are
moderately soluble in water,

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.570
which is a good thing for something
that is going to function as a

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.140
biomolecule. I think solubility in
water is desirable.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.710
In fact, I want to look a little
more closely at the

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:54.540
behavior in water.
And to mention that the first thing

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:59.630
that happens, this thing transforms.
And in the chart that is in the

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:04.720
book, that Bio Table 1,
you do not see the amino acids drawn

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.810
as I have drawn them with the amino
end neutral and the carboxylic end

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:14.900
neutral. They draw them as follows.
They show what happens when the

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:32.866
amino acid has already been
dissolved in water.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:24.460
Let's represent that solvation
reaction. I am going to compact the

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.920
notation. Here is the central
carbon, there is the hydrogen,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.380
there is the amino substituent on
the bottom, and on the top I am

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.840
going to put the carboxylic acid.
Let's ask what happens when this

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.300
dissolves in water at neutral pH.
This does not necessarily mean pH

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.760
equals 7. It means neutral with
respect to this reaction

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.580
we are going to show.
What happens when this species

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.740
dissolves in water is the proton
leaves the carboxylic acid and comes

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.910
over and attaches to the amino end.
Look at the amino end. This is

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:07.080
really a Bronsted base.
This is an Arrhenius acid.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.240
It is also a Bronsted acid.
Now we have, from what is a neutral

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.410
molecule, something that looks like
this, protons attached here

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:22.900
rendering this end positive.
The R group remains unchanged.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.720
And the carboxylic acid is now
minus the proton.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:34.540
This molecule is still net neutral
because I have charge neutrality to

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:40.360
maintain. All I have done is
relocate something within the

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:46.180
molecule, but it is bipolar.
That is to say it is locally

00:28:46.180 --> 00:29:04.426
positive and locally negative,
but globally it is net neutral.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:57.110
It is kind of a strange ion.
Is it an ion or is it not an ion?

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:02.220
It is net neutral so we wouldn't
call it an ion.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:07.330
Instead of an ion,
it is called a zwitterion,

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:12.440
which means a double ion.
Zwitterion or a double ion,

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.690
some kind of a hybrid.
That is really important chemistry

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:23.070
because that gives this molecule the
ability to respond to its

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:28.460
environment. Somehow,
through the chemistry, we have to

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.840
explain how matter becomes animate.
What is the chemistry here? I mean,

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:39.220
how do I do this?
How do I move my hand?

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:44.610
This is all macromolecular,
so what am I doing when I move my

00:29:44.610 --> 00:30:02.820
hand? I am changing the
confirmation of those polymers.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.500
Those polymers are changing shape.
Remember the C17H36? I showed you

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.000
two long chains.
One was relatively straight and one

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.500
was coiled. And I can go from one
confirmation to the other.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.000
How do I do that? The electrical
engineers are going to say it is all

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.500
electrical. I say,
no, it is not electrical.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.000
You cannot do this electrically.
Where are the wires? This is

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.500
chemical. It is all chemical,
and I am going to show you how.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.000
But you say you cannot do it that
fast.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:23.230
Fast is fast only in the mind of the
beholder. This simply has to happen

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:28.460
at a rate that is keeping pace with
the conversation.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:33.690
On a geological timescale this is a
vanishingly short period of time.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:38.920
Otherwise, as long as our data rate
of understanding can keep pace with

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.150
the ability for us to change the
confirmation, we live.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:49.380
Let's look at how this responds.
Suppose this is, I don't know, in

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:54.530
the wall of the stomach.
And you get a hankering for some

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:59.610
cola beverage and you drink the cola.
The cola is low pH.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:04.690
It is about pH 3, phosphoric acid,
benzoic acid. What is going to

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:09.760
happen is this Zwitterion will
respond in a defensive manner.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.840
There is a principle in chemistry
that is analogous to a Newton's

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.920
Third Law, action-reaction.
It is called the Le Chatelier

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:38.440
Principle after the French scientist
who enunciated it.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:32.140
The Le Chatelier Principle talks
about the restorative force exerted

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:39.280
by a chemical system.
And what is this restorative force

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:46.420
designed to do?
It is designed to minimize the

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:54.640
impact of any perturbation.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.500
By perturbation,
I mean not a physical perturbation,

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.000
I mean a chemical shift, any kind of
chemical perturbation.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:32:13.330
Let's say we have the zwitterion

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:30.860
sitting happily in a neutral
solution and suddenly the pH drops.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:25.330
How can the zwitterion respond?
What do I do to bring the pH back

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:30.660
to where it was before to the
disturbance? What is the

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:35.990
manifestation of pH?
It is proton. Somehow the proton

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:41.330
concentration suddenly went way up
driving the pH way down.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:46.660
And I am zwitterion sitting here.
Here is zwitterion right here.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:33:06.053
What could zwitterion do to minimize
the impact of this flood of proton?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:56.920
Well, there are two possibilities.
How do you neutralize something?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.840
You either start flooding this with
hydroxyl in order to neutralize.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.760
I look on zwitterion and see no
hydroxyl, so that is no good.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.690
But what could zwitterion do?
At the carboxylic acid end there is

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:16.610
an attachment site for proton.
What zwitterion can do is to gobble

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:21.530
up the excess proton in order to
bring the pH back to

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:39.126
where it was before.
Let's write that reaction.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
It triggers this response.
There is the amino end.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:45.850
I am going to put the carboxylic

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:51.570
acid over to the right here.
Now this is from the solution.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:57.280
It is trying to bring the pH back
to where it was before consuming the

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:15.493
proton and attaching the proton to
this carboxylic acid end.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:34:13.330
What has happened now to zwitterion?

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:30.926
The negative end has been capped.
Zwitterion now is net positive.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:25.450
Over here it is net neutral.
And it is gobbling up protons from

00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:30.900
the solution. And so this is really
an acid-base reaction for which I

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:36.360
can write a k,
an acid dissociation constant.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:41.810
And I am getting tired writing all
these characters so I am going to

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:47.270
reformat this.
I am going to represent the

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:52.470
zwitterion as proton plus the rest.
This is proton.

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:57.410
And what is this thing here?
This is now zwitterion to which

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:02.360
proton has attached.
I have attached this proton to the

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:07.310
net neutral species.
I can rewrite this reaction in a

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:12.260
more compact notation.
A captures all of this other stuff

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:17.200
minus the proton.
I can write the K for that reaction.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.150
K1 will equal the concentration of
proton times the concentration of

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:27.100
neutral zwitterion over the
concentration of this protonated

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.050
zwitterion, **K1 = [H+][HA]/[HAH]**
the zwitterion onto which we have

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:49.566
glommed this proton
from the solution.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:42.060
And we are going to take a page out
of Sorensen's book.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:47.130
And we will take the log of both
sides. And then we can say that pK1

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:52.190
is equal to pH plus log.
And I am writing 10 here,

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:57.260
but in engineering, if you see log
it is typically log base 10.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:02.330
I know in some of the math classes
they use the log to represent

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:07.390
natural log, but it is uncommon in
engineering. Here is the "Sorensen

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:12.460
version" of the equation.
What this tells us is that at 50%

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:18.070
association --
In other words,

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:24.210
when 50% of the zwitterion has
gobbled up the proton to generate

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:30.350
this protonated species,
this ratio is equal, 50% zwitterion

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:36.490
unprotonated, 50% protonated.
So the log of one is zero. And

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:42.640
that is the pH that gives us the
value of the acid dissociation

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:48.780
constant. At 50% of consumption of
zwitterion, we have the

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:54.920
concentration of zwitterion equaling
the concentration of the

00:36:54.920 --> 00:37:01.140
protonated zwitterion.
And, therefore,

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:07.420
the pH is exactly at the value of
pK1. Now, what happens on the other

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:13.710
extreme? What happens if all of a
sudden there is a rise in pH?

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:31.420
If there is a sudden rise in pH,
how does zwitterion respond?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:24.610
That means the concentration of
proton suddenly fell,

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:29.220
so we use the Le Chatelier Principle
again. We use the Le Chatelier

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.840
Principle. We go back over here and
look at zwitterion.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.460
We say what we have right now is a
sudden dearth of,

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:43.070
a shortage of proton.
How can zwitterion respond to that

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:47.690
sudden shortage of proton?
Well, the neutral zwitterion has

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:52.460
protons sitting right here.
What zwitterion can do,

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.380
in response to that sudden drop in
proton concentration,

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:02.300
is donate, become a proton donor and
start adding protons to the solution,

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:07.220
sacrificing its neutrality in order
to minimize the impact of that

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.150
sudden rise in pH.
Let's document that reaction.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:17.070
That is this one here. That is
where zwitterion does the following.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:34.540
We will start with the neutral
again.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:28.570
That is over here.
H3N. Here is the neutral

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:35.140
zwitterion. It experiences a sudden
rise in pH and responds by dumping

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:41.710
protons into the solution.
Now the left end is deprotonated

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:54.686
leaving it neutral.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:55.810
And this proton is now donated to
the solution. And if this solution

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:01.630
is, in fact, high in pH then this
proton can go and attack the excess

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:07.450
hydroxyl and neutralize it.
This is how zwitterion responds.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:13.270
And what do we see here? This is
net neutral. But now the positive

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:19.090
end has become neutralized by the
loss of the proton so this

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:24.540
is now net negative.
And so we can call this reaction two,

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:29.630
and it has a K2.
And, using the notation that I have

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:34.720
developed up there,
the neutral zwitterion I am denoting

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.810
HA. This is the zwitterion minus
this proton, so this is just the A

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:44.900
minus. It is making sense.
This is net negative. And,

00:39:44.900 --> 00:40:04.200
if I take H away from HA, I get
minus. And then this is the H plus.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:56.660
That is the reaction we are looking
at. And we can write the k for that

00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:03.330
reaction as concentration of proton
times concentration of deprotonated

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:09.990
zwitterion divided by the
concentration of the neutral

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:16.660
zwitterion. **K2 = [H+][A-]/[HA]**
And take the log base 10 of both

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:22.810
sides, pK2 is pH plus log base 10
I am going to flip this over so that

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:28.450
I don't have to put a minus sign
here. This would be HA divided by A

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:34.090
minus. Again,
when we have 50% neutralization then

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:39.720
that means there will be 50% of this
species consumed,

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:45.360
50% of this left, the log of one is
zero. And at that pH we have the

00:40:45.360 --> 00:41:02.320
value of the acid dissociation
constant.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:55.610
And I think this slide shows what is
going on here.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:41:00.220
All it does is plots these two
equations. If you take the first

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.840
equation here,
the logarithmic,

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.460
the Sorensen form of the first
equation, that is the lower part of

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:14.070
this graph. We are plotting pH
versus the ion dissociation.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:18.690
If you turn this around, pH versus
the amount of this that

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:24.220
has been consumed.
And what you see is that when you

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:30.660
have 50%, this is 50% ions
dissociated per molecule,

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:37.110
you have pK1 where both are equal.
The other thing to note is that, as

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:43.550
this reaction is taking place,
look at the gentle change in pH,

00:41:43.550 --> 00:42:01.300
the concentration here changes from
roughly about 10% up to 90%.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:54.610
We have an 80% variation in
concentration.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:59.220
And by that I mean an 80% interval
over which we are changing the

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:03.840
amount of attachment here.
Here there is no attachment.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.460
Here there is total attachment.
And in the middle we have, from

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:13.070
about 10% to 90% attachment,
the pH only moves about two units.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.690
Zwitterion is fighting really,
really hard to get this pH up to a

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:22.750
certain level and hold it there.
We say that the zwitterion,

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:28.250
under these circumstances, is acting
as a buffer. Zwitterion acts as a

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:33.750
buffer. What it will do,
it has the capacity to either donate

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:39.250
protons or remove protons,
and do so in a way that reduces the

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:44.750
impact of the pH.
And then here is the other part of

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:50.250
the graph, the upper part,
the case where we have a sudden rise

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:56.550
in pH.
The pH goes up and zwitterion is now

00:42:56.550 --> 00:43:03.660
holding the pH as best it can around
a value of pK2.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:10.770
There is a special point on this
graph shown right here where we have

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:17.880
maximum undissociated zwitterion.
In other words, what is the pH at

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:35.026
which we have 100% undissociated
zwitterion, just the zwitterion.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:31.250
And that is given by the balance
between the K1 and the K2.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:49.200
That is called the isoelectric
point, because then everything is

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:43.750
net neutral. And that is also given
the notation pI,

00:43:43.750 --> 00:44:00.033
lowercase p, capital I for
isoelectric.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:54.830
And, in this case,
it's simply the average of pK1 and

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:59.660
pK2. And this can be found for
various amino acids.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.490
I don't expect you to know the
amino acid compositions by heart.

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:09.330
I would always give you the
chemical formula of the amino acid.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:14.160
And, if you had to do anything with
such calculations,

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:33.320
I would tell you what the K1 or the
K2 is as the case may be.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:26.550
There is one other twist on this.
There are a few amino acids where

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:34.100
the R groups are also capable of
attaching or donating protons.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:41.660
We say that the R groups are
titratable. That is to say they can

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:49.220
also be proton active and can
participate in this Le Chatelier

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:56.370
Principle in action.
And, if you look on the homework,

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:03.120
Question 11 goes through an analysis
of how you deal with a situation

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:09.870
where there is a change in pH.
And, for example, suppose you have

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:16.620
a side group. Aspartic acid is a
good example. In aspartic acid the

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:22.380
R group is methylene.
And then there is a carboxylic acid

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:27.150
sticking off. This is the R group.
Clearly, this is a site of

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:31.920
attachment. If I get a sudden drop
in pH, there is a flood of hydrogen

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.690
ions. The hydrogen ions can be
attaching not only to the carboxylic

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:41.450
acid end here,
but they can also be attaching on

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:46.220
the R group. That brings a new
level of complexity,

00:45:46.220 --> 00:46:05.106
and we work that out in the
particular homework example.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:55.830
Let's take a break here now,
and I will leave you with five

00:45:55.830 --> 00:46:00.660
minutes on extreme kinetics.
Earlier in the semester, I went up

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:05.490
to Halifax to give a seminar and was
reminded of this.

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:10.330
Actually, our audiovisual
technician, Dave Broderick,

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:15.160
had brought to my attention a number
of years ago. We talked about the

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:33.586
extremes in kinetics, one
of them being explosion.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:24.610
The reason I tell you about this,
it follows kinetics, and also it is

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:29.220
apropos of the season.
After Thanksgiving Day when you go

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:33.840
downtown, you will see a feature
that I am going to tell you about at

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.460
the end of this story.
On December 6, 1917, this was in

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.070
the middle of World War I and Canada
was part of the British Empire at

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:47.690
the time and was drawn into the war,
Halifax was a port of exchange of a

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:51.810
lot of munitions.
There was the Belgian relief ship,

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:55.430
the Imo, and the French supply ship,
the Mont Blanc. This is the cargo

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:59.060
of the Mont Blanc.
And you can see it was a potent

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.680
cargo, to be sure.
At 8:45 AM there was a collision.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.300
The Imo hit the Mont Blanc. It
missed the TNT,

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.930
there was 20,000 tons of it,
but it struck the picric acid,

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:13.560
which was stored directly beneath
the drums of benzol,

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.180
and there were some sparks.
And so, that is the way the story

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.650
begins.
And for this one,

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:23.950
in this light, I think I will put on
some glasses so that I can read it

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.240
to you in modern English.
The crew of the Mont Blanc,

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.540
aware of their cargo, immediately
took to the lifeboats screaming

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.840
warnings that no one heeded.
They rode for Dartmouth, which is

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.140
across the harbor.
The Mont Blanc drifted by Halifax

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.440
Pier brushing it and setting it
ablaze. Members of the Halifax Fire

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.740
Department responded quickly and
were positioning their engine up to

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.040
the nearest hydrant when the Mont
Blanc disintegrated in a blinding

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.340
white flash creating the biggest
man-made explosion before

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.860
the Nuclear Age.
It was 9:05 AM.

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:57.590
Over 1,900 people were killed
immediately. Within a year,

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:01.330
the figure had climbed to well over
2,000, 9,000 more injured,

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:05.060
many permanently, 325 acres,
almost all of North End Halifax

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.790
destroyed, and much of what was not
immediately leveled burned to the

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:12.530
ground, added by winter stockpiles
of coal in cellars.

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:16.260
As for the Mont Blanc,
all 3,000 tons of her were shattered

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:35.786
into little pieces that were
blasted far and wide.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:23.620
The barrel of one of her cannons
landed 3.5 miles away,

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.240
part of her anchor shank weighing
over half a ton flew 2 miles in the

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.870
opposite direction,
windows shattered 50 miles away and

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:34.490
the shockwave was felt even in
Sydney, Cape Breton 270 miles

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:38.120
northeast. There was about 20
minutes between the collision and

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.740
the explosion,
enough time for spectators,

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.370
including many children, to run to
the waterfront to watch the ship

00:48:45.370 --> 00:49:04.273
burning, thus, coming
into close range.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:52.870
It was enough time for others to
gather at windows and,

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:56.740
thus, an exceptionally large number
of people were injured by flying

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.620
glass. Many sustained permanent eye
damage. Not surprisingly,

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.490
hospitals were unable to cope with
so many wounded.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:08.370
Also the misery was compounded by a
blizzard that struck the city the

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:12.240
following day dumping 16 inches of
snow over the ruins of their sooty,

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.120
oily covering. With astounding
speed, relief efforts were set into

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:36.573
motion, money poured in from as far
away as China and New Zealand.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:24.570
The Canadian government gave - so
much money. But most Haligonians,

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:29.140
which is what you call a resident of
Halifax, remember the generosity of

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:33.710
the State of Massachusetts which
donated $750,000 in money and goods

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:38.280
and gave unstintingly and volunteer
assistance to The Massachusetts

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.850
Halifax Relief Committee.
People from the hospitals,

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:47.420
Mass Eye and Ear, went up because so
many people had sustained eye damage.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:50:07.106
They got on trains and went up
there to minister to these people.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.500
To this day, Halifax sends an annual
Christmas tree to The City of Boston

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:41.000
in gratitude. When you go downtown,
I don't know where it is now, it

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.500
used to be in front of the
Prudential, but I heard recently

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:50.000
they relocated it to the Boston
Common, if you see a 45 foot

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.500
Christmas tree that looks like it
came from Canada,

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:59.000
that is the reason.
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.666
I will see you next week.
