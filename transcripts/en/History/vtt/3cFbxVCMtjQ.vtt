[music playing]

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.330
NARRATOR: In 1799,
Napoleon Bonaparte

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.290
seized power in
France by plotting

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.460
a coup within another coup.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.880
And he did it all without
shedding a drop of blood.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.120
One year before the coup, France
was at war with Great Britain

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.040
and Russia, Austria,
the Ottoman Empire, and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.420
some German and Italian states.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.750
But Napoleon was
focused on Great Britain

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.250
and wanted to cut
off the country's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.420
roots to its profitable
trading outposts in India.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.210
Even though much of his fleet
was captured or destroyed

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.080
by the British at the
Battle of the Nile,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.670
Napoleon still managed
to capture and hold Egypt

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.580
to cut off British trade
routes and even attack targets

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.210
deeper into the Ottoman Empire.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.920
But back home, the French
weren't faring as well,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
suffering a series of defeats
against their European enemies

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.420
across the first half of 1799.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.580
The French people became fed
up with their current system

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.540
of government known
as the Directory,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.750
the fourth different
system of government

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.580
since the beginning of
the French Revolution

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.170
10 years earlier.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.960
The Directory system included
two legislative bodies,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.380
a council of 500, a chamber of
elected men that proposed laws,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.290
and the Council of Ancients,
250 elected men over 40

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.580
years old that approved laws.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.290
The two bodies
also work together

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.120
to choose the
directors themselves,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.620
five executives of equal power
responsible for enforcing laws.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.080
But by 1799, the Directory
had brought France into war

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.120
and near economic ruin.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.790
The people largely looked
to the country's military

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.290
for leadership.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.380
This is where Napoleon
saw his chance.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.710
When British ships temporarily
retreated from France's ports,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.290
Napoleon left Egypt and
returned home a hero.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.460
Meanwhile, another
prominent Frenchman

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.670
had been plotting to seize power
from the weakened Directory.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.170
Emmanuel Joseph Sieyes, better
known by his religious title,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.000
the Abb Sieyes, was elected
as a director in May of 1799.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.790
He had long been one of the most
influential political figures

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.250
for his writings that partly
inspired the French Revolution.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.170
But Sieyes hated the Directory,
finding the executive

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.120
too weak to effectively govern.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.790
So soon after Napoleon's
return to Paris,

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.330
the two men met in secret.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.960
They agreed to a coup that would
allow Sieyes to place himself

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.620
at the head of a new
government formed with the help

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.250
of Napoleon and his loyal army.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.000
There were other conspirators,
including Minister of Foreign

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.540
Affairs Talleyrand
and Lucien Bonaparte,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.670
President of the Council of 500
and Napoleon's younger brother.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.880
On the morning of 18
Brumarie, or November 9,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880
the plan was set into motion.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.120
Sieyes and Lucien
Bonaparte informed

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.500
their respective legislative
bodies there was a plot

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.460
to overthrow the government.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.670
But they lied and said it was
being led by the Jacobins,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.290
the party that had carried
out France's reign of terror

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.040
five years earlier.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.120
The lawmakers were
moved for their safety

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.380
to a palace in St. Cloud,
a suburb of France.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.380
Conveniently, Napoleon
himself was placed

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.040
in charge of their protection.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.000
Meanwhile, three of
the five directors

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.830
had resigned in coordination
with the coup, Sieyes, his ally

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.210
Roger Ducos, and Paul
Barras, a former lover

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.500
of Napoleon's wife Josephine.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Talleyrand had been
given 2 million

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.420
francs to bribe
Barras to resign,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.000
but he resigned on his own.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.500
So Talleyrand just pocketed
the money for himself.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.540
The next day, the
Council of Ancients

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.250
were receptive to
Napoleon's argument

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.540
that the government
needed to be reorganized.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.750
But the Council of 500
needed more convincing.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.420
So Napoleon marched into
their chamber with grenadiers

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.880
by his side.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.210
The legislators erupted
in anger, some charging

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.880
at Napoleon with daggers.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.000
Amidst the chaos,
Lucien Bonaparte

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.080
used the attacks on his
brother as an excuse

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.380
to dissolve the Council of 500.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.330
Napoleon's troops dispersed
the rest of the council.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.290
The Council of Ancients then
dissolved the Constitution,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.540
replacing the Directory
with three consuls, Sieyes,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.040
Roger Ducos, and Napoleon.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.040
Sieyes' coup was complete.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.460
But Napoleon was not
interested in sharing power.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.790
The new government quickly
drew up the Constitution

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.960
of the Year VIII,
and Napoleon made

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.790
sure he was its chief editor.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.120
With the new constitution,
Napoleon wrested

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.620
control away from Sieyes,
using his supreme popularity

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.920
to declare himself first consul
with Sieyes and Ducos secondary

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.420
in power.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.380
Napoleon had succeeded in
his coup within a coup,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.250
setting himself up to
ultimately become dictator,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.500
and all without a
single life lost.
