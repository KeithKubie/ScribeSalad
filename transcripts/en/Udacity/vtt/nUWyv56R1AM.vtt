00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.520
If we only were to focus on two

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.450
generations let's say for a dominant and recessive

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.560
trait in a pedigree, we could really be

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.090
missing information. Take this example here. I have

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.570
two very small pedigrees of just an immediate

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.100
family and they show the same affected inheritance

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.200
pattern where one child, one daughter is affected.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.980
But one of these pedigrees is for a recessive

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.140
trait that both parents have an allele for, but

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.960
they're unaffected and then they pass both of those

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.730
recessive alleles on to the daughter. And the other

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.130
pedigree is from a very new spontaneous mutation that's

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.480
causing a dominant trait but the question is, can

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.540
you tell the difference? I can't. The only way

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.200
to distinguish these two possibilities would be to zoom

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.340
out on both pedigrees and fill out as much family

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.800
information as we can. This family history is going to

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.150
be able to help us figure out which one

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.360
of these is a recessive trait pedigree and which

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.240
one of these is a spontaneous mutation that's caused a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.530
new dominant trait. For example this pedigree on the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.740
right is most likely the pedigree of a recessive trait.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.470
Because we now see that there's a family history.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.370
Unaffected parents with affected offspring, the traits skip generations and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.590
we see it on both sides of the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.150
family. Whereas the other pedigree is mostly likely caused

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.840
from our spontaneous mutation and the new dominant trait

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.200
because we don't have any family history of it,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.010
whatsoever. Although again, this could still possibly be a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.330
result of limited information. And maybe we just need

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.240
to zoom out even further to tell if it's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.640
actually another possibility of it being a recessive pedigree

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.180
as well. The point is, is that any time we're really doing this in real life.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.930
We try to get as much information as

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.050
possible and specifically when we're trying to distinguish

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.220
these two scenarios, what we're looking for is a family history

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.980
of the condition. Meaning that you've got maybe more than one affected

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.305
sibling or parent or close relative, or even possibilities of

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:06.450
[UNKNOWN]

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.920
relationships. Effectively reproduction with close relatives.
