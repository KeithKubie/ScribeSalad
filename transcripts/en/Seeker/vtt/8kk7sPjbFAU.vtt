00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.020
Vint Cerf has warned that we may lose all
our important data if we rely on digital storage,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.210
but who is this guy and what does he know
anyway?

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.849
Oh he helped invent the internet?

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.030
Ohhh…

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.519
Hello out there in meat space, magnetic ones
and zeros decoded as the image of Julian here

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.650
for DNews.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.250
Doomsday prophets run rampant on the internet
and usually they’re pretty easy to tune

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.759
out, but when the vice president of Google
warns of a digital dark age, it’s kind of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:29.910
hard not to take notice.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.070
Vint Cerf, along with being vp of google and
therefore having dibs on any gmail address

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.540
he wants, helped develop the internet in 1969.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.730
He and Bob Khan created the Transmission Control
Protocol and Internet Protocol for ARPANET,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.780
which allowed computers to send data to each
other and is the basis for the internet.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.540
I bet he tells “Cerf the internet jokes”
all the time at parties.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.280
Side note, the World Wide Web was developed
20 years later by a British scientist at CERN.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.170
Tim Berners-Lee’s Hypertext Transfer Protocol
or Http makes accessing web sites possible,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.390
but the world wide web is built upon the internet
and the two terms are not synonymous.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.400
At this point though nobody seems to care
unless they’re arguing over who invented

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
it.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.220
Ok history lesson aside, Cerf believes that
storing things digitally isn’t bulletproof

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.530
as you might think.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.650
And the elder of the internet may have a point.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.060
Digital mediums do degrade over time, sure,
but even if the information is good there’s

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.600
the problem of accessing it.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.520
What’s a universal device today might be
totally obsolete in a decade.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.130
It’s why you don’t see floppy diskettes
or laser disks anymore.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.280
What’s a laser disk you ask?

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280
Exactly.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.190
But even if we keep the hardware around we
still need the software to decode it.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.530
Digital data are just ones and zeros but there
are many different formats they can be arranged

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.530
in.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.420
New and better formats are developed all the
time, and there’s no guarantee of backwards

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.560
compatibility.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.920
Without software that can interpret the information,
it’s all gobbledigook.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.630
That’s why you need to stay strong and keep
saying not today to that Java update.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.979
But you can’t hold out forever, and you’d
need to keep transferring your data to new

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.560
mediums and formats, which sounds like a lot
of effort.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.270
Plus you may miss something you don’t realize
is important until it’s too late.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.200
Like the very first web page ever?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
It’s gone.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.530
CERN is trying to rebuild it.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.149
I guess they didn’t think this whole website
thing would take off.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.879
So Cerf recommends printing and storing documents
and pictures physically.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.279
But there’s a reason we don’t do this
already: where would you put all of it???

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:22.560
Paper, thin as it is, takes up huge amounts
of space because it’s a relatively inefficient

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.629
way to store data.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.200
I think however I may have found a solution.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200
DNA.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.239
For years scientists have had the idea that
if DNA can save genetic information, why can’t

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.549
it be used to store digital information too?

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.019
George Church, a Harvard professor who is
mapping the human genome, thought he’d try

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.739
that as a fun little side project.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.329
In 2012 he appeared on the Colbert Report
with a copy of his book, and then produced

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.060
a vial with a slip of paper on it. and on
the paper was a tiny dot.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.360
And on that dot was DNA with its base pairs
of AT and GC representing 1’s and 0’s.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.550
That single dot of DNA contained 20 million
copies of his book.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.159
So why aren’t we rocking smartphones with
20 gazillion terabytes of storage on DNA drives?

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.120
Well for a number of reasons, the technology
isn’t ready yet.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.340
First off, DNA has issues of longevity.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.189
It reacts with its environment and errors
in the data are caused by heat or radiation.

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.569
Dr. Robert Grass of Zurich's Department of
Chemistry and Applied Biosciences may have

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.980
solved the problem by encasing the DNA in
silica spheres 150 nanometers in diameter.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.260
They tested it by keeping the glass coated
DNA heated between 60 and 70 degrees celsius

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.760
for a month to simulate the passage of hundreds
of years, and when they separated the DNA

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.939
from the silica with a fluoride solution they
found it was just fine, thanks.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.760
It’s also not cheap, with a megabyte costing
over $12,000, and it’s not easy to access

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.760
quickly.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.349
But this way you can keep every single TV
show and Movie ever made in a solo cup for

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.139
thousands of years.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.669
So long as we keep a method to decode it,
there’s no reason we should lose a thing.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.859
Maybe that’ll help Cerf rest a little easier.

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.469
Long term storage is one of the few advantages
paper has over digital.

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.790
Trace explains why over here.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.319
Are you worried about your digital storage?

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.230
What’s your strategy to keep everything
safe.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.859
I have a bunch of back up hard drives at home
with all these episodes on it because I want

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.310
to make sure I’m immortal.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.719
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
