00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.576
Let's see if we can
rewrite 6/12 as a decimal.

00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:09.700
And once again, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.870
and try this on your own.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.203
And I'll give you a little hint.

00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:14.090
See if you can rewrite
this fraction, not

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.490
in terms of 12ths,
but in terms of 10ths.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.210
Well, let's just
visualize this thing.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.800
So let's say that this
right over here is a 12th.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.970
So that is a 12th.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.100
And so let me try
to make 12 12ths.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.806
So copy and paste that,
so that's two 12ths.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.720
And that is three 12ths.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.530
And that is-- actually
let me just copy and paste

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.240
the three 12ths.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.710
So copy and paste.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.420
So now we have six 12ths, which
I'll color it in a second.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.700
And now we have 9/12, and now we
have 12 12ths right over there.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.210
And we care about
six of these 12ths,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.630
so this is representing
six of these 12ths.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
So let me see if I can
color in six of them.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.230
So let me go to-- let me
see if I can pull this off.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.130
So this is going to be 1.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.880
Let me do a bigger paint brush.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.339
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:21.880
That's right.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.870
That's 6/12.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.090
I'm just going to color
all of this business in.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.910
So there you have.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.380
We have represented
our fraction.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.290
Now, how do we represent
this thing right over here

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.460
in terms of 10ths?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.140
So the one thing that
I might want to do

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.250
is well look, 6 and 12
are both divisible by 6.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.240
So what if we divide this, not
if we rewrite this whole, not

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.210
in terms of 12ths, but we
write it in terms of halves?

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.500
Well, how would we do that?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.560
Well, we could
say-- we could call

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.490
all of this stuff-- this is
1/2, and this is another 1/2.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.810
Or another way of
thinking about it is we're

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.679
taking six of our
12ths together,

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.220
and then we're
putting them together,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.910
and we're turning
them into a 1/2.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.240
So in terms of the
number of sections

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.880
we have, we're
dividing the number

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.290
of sections we have by 6.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.720
So let's do that.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.450
So let's divide the
number of sections by 6.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.040
So now we're only going
to have two sections.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.170
We're only going
to have two halves.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.980
That right over there is 1/2,
and that right over there

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.860
is the other 1/2.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.190
Notice we had 12/12.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.300
Now we're taking 6 of those at
a time putting them together,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.220
so now we only have two
sections instead of 12 sections.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.630
But those 6/12, what are
they going to be in halves?

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.522
Well, once again, where we're
taking six of the things

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:51.980
and putting them
together into one.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.950
So we're going to divide
that by 6 as well.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.100
And so this is going to
be the same thing as 1/2.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.420
And you see this
1/2 right over here.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.540
And notice, all we
did in the past,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.650
we had multiplied
and divided-- sorry,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.040
in the past we had
multiplied the numerator

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.860
and the denominator
by the same quantity

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.270
to get an equivalent fraction.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.270
Now, we're dividing the
numerator and the denominator

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.710
by the same quantity to
get the same fraction.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.012
Hopefully, this makes sense,
that 1/2 is equivalent to 6/12.

00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:26.970
Now, why did I do that?

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.980
Didn't I say that I wanted to
get this in terms of 10ths?

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.300
And yes, I do want to
get it in terms of 10ths,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.650
but 1/2 is fairly easy to
rewrite in terms of 10ths.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.060
So let me re-express 1/2.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.720
So 1/2, let me
write it like this.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.290
So 1/2, I could
represent 1/2 again.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.550
I'm going to re-represent 1/2.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:58.960
So let's say this right
over here is clearly 1/2,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.690
so I'm just representing it.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.170
So I'm taking a whole,
dividing it into 2,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.895
and 1/2-- let me
just color it in--

00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:11.270
would be that right over there,
which as we already seen,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.790
it's equivalent to the 6/12.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.680
Now, I want to
write this as 10ths.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.430
So what if I take
each of those halves,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.219
and I turn it into five
times as many pieces?

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.980
So let me do that.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:42.240
So I'm going to do it into
1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.620
So what did I just do?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.850
I multiplied.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.280
I now have five
times as many pieces

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.950
and the 1/2 is
going to represent

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.710
five times as many 10ths.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.855
So this is going to
be equal to 5/10.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.130
Let me do it in a
green color, 5/10.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.560
Notice, 6/12 is the
same thing as 1/2,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.810
which is the same thing as 5/10.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.660
All I did here is I
multiplied the numerator

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.600
and the denominator by
the same quantity 5,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.620
so I could get 10
in the denominator.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.090
And 5/10, well that's the
same thing as 5 times 1/10.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.230
It's literally 5/10, and we can
represent this as a decimal,

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.730
or you could say in
decimal notation.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.030
5/10, we know that-- let's say
that that is the ones place,

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.060
and if we go one place to the
right of the decimal, that

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.730
is the tenths place.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.010
That right over there
is the tenths place.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.720
And we have 5/10, so we would
put a 5 right over there.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.487
So this could be rewritten
as the decimal, 0.5.

00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:55.820
Now, there's other ways you
could have thought about it.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.820
You could say hey, look.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.610
6 is half of 12, and
so what is half of 10?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.410
Well, 5 is half
of 10, and so 5/10

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.270
is the same thing as 5/10,
which is the same thing as 5/10

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.389
written as a decimal.
