00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.720
Move that aside, move this over here

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.520
Put this in a box here

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.580
Toss this over here, get rid of that

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.820
Throw this out of the way

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.920
[glass noises]

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.060
It was 1995

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.140
A friend of mine, doing scientific glass-blowing

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.200
Calls me up and says, "Hey, can you help program my glass oven?"

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.180
I said, "Sure" So we work on this Macintosh that produces glass

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.760
This oven so that the temperature was up/down and everything

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.860
He says, "Well, how'd you want to get paid?"

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.600
And I say, "Don't pay me, let's build something. Let's make a Klein bottle!"

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.020
So he says, "Oh yeah!" And so we work together

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.940
And we sort of weld the stuff and we're building this out of...

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.040
Out of glass and we finally finish it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.980
And I say, "This is a glass Klein bottle!"

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.640
And so I say

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.680
"I'll go over to the math department, in Berkeley"

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.120
"And I'll show my friend, Ken Rivet this Klein bottle"

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.520
"He's a topologist, he'll actually appreciate it!"

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.840
I say, "Ken, look what I made!"

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.440
And this guy...

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.620
He's a professor of math

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.320
He looks at it, and he says...

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.660
"That's a glass Klein bottle!"

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.260
"I've always wanted one!"

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.160
"How much money do you want?"

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.920
And so I say, "Pfft"

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.420
"I don't know, a hundred bucks"

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.860
He reaches into his pocket and starts counting out twetny-dollar bills!

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.520
I'm stunned

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.320
So suddenly, this five-watt lightbulb goes off in my head

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.820
You know, if I make a bunch of these...

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.680
I can probably sell 'em!

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.440
The problem is making a bunch of them...

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.780
You know, it takes me two or three days to make one

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.240
So I call around...

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.060
Glass companies, glass shops...

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300
"How much would it cost to make like..."

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.040
[shrugs]

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.300
"A bunch of 'em?"

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.840
I want the price to be low enough, that I can sell 'em

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.880
Turns out...

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.900
Making one or two isn't going to do it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.380
Making ten or twenty isn't going to do it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.580
I'd have to have, like, a THOUSAND made

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.760
Come on over. Check this out

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.100
Under my house

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.820
is a...

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.820
is, my little forklift robot

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.080
To go pick Klein bottles from stock

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.040
Tilt the thing. If you look carefully at it...

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.880
*Let's see if I can actually show this...*

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.860
Oh this is just home but this is only incidental

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.860
This is not Klein bottles, this is how to run a warehouse, really

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.720
This is the lift mechanism

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.680
for, from a car window. From an old Pontiac car

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.540
So I went to the junkyard, got a window tilt...

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.020
Everything's made from junk

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.020
The up/down, that's an old electric drill that I got for 5 dollars

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.180
The wheels, you know, they're little motors drive the wheels around

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.220
*Let's tilt this up, lift it*

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.520
So here's my...

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.720
Here's a box of.. oh, hey!

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960
And yes, there are Klein bottles in here

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.860
[Brady laughs]

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.900
And indeed... indeed

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.780
This is a box of throwaway Klein bottles, things, you know...

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.260
Things that have flaws on them, but I don't care about that

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.660
The main thing is, there are lots and lots of bottles

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.060
It's the footprint of my house! I mean it's...

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.280
*Let's see, it's... hey, go back, go back, go back*

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.960
Let's...drop this off

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.240
From here on out, you're going to have to look at a tv camera

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.600
Because you have to appreciate that there's lots of bottles and...

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.680
Heading over to, where I store bottles under my house

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.660
Let's see, there are lots and lots of baby Klein bottles

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.200
In boxes under my house

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.740
And lots and lots of...

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.560
Medium sized Klein bottles, under my house

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.260
The reason for having so many bottles...

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.380
Isn't, "Oh I gotta have, you know, in case somebody orders a lot!"

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.540
It's so that, in manufacturing a lot of them...

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.700
I can keep the cost low enough, that I can sell them

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.880
Turns out that, small production runs are REAL expensive

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.140
So if I can just have ONE production run

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.040
Save enough bottles for the next

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.420
*ten years*

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.760
So notice now, there's a...

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.140
Both Brady and Cliff

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.260
Both are being seen by the rear camera of my little forklift robot

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.760
*Hang on*

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.700
*Behind you, behind you is a cat*

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.280
*Okay*

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.020
*Hang on a sec*

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.520
*Sure*

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.500
[Brady straining]

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.120
*No keep going on, cat's gone, don't worry about it*

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.900
*That's alright, I've got the shot now if you come around towards me*

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.220
[machine whirring]

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.160
Goodbye!!

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.020
