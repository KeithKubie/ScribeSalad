mounting it on the left hand side

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859
mounting it on the left hand side
 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.250
mounting it on the left hand side
sticking out of the vise a little bit so

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
sticking out of the vise a little bit so
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.200
sticking out of the vise a little bit so
that we can use an edge detector to

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210
that we can use an edge detector to
 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.329
that we can use an edge detector to
determine exactly where that corner is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339
determine exactly where that corner is
 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.150
determine exactly where that corner is
located the center of the nameplate is

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160
located the center of the nameplate is
 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.130
located the center of the nameplate is
four inches to the right and one and a

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140
four inches to the right and one and a
 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.880
four inches to the right and one and a
quarter inches off the corner tightly

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890
quarter inches off the corner tightly
 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.250
quarter inches off the corner tightly
into the house make sure you tap on it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
 
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 
here is an edge detector

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760
here is an edge detector
 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.020
here is an edge detector
it is a 2/10 of an inch diameter tip

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030
it is a 2/10 of an inch diameter tip
 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.180
it is a 2/10 of an inch diameter tip
that is spring-loaded and attached to a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190
that is spring-loaded and attached to a
 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.929
that is spring-loaded and attached to a
shaft it's often called a wiggler the

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939
shaft it's often called a wiggler the
 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.840
shaft it's often called a wiggler the
idea of an edge detector is you spin it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850
idea of an edge detector is you spin it
 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.410
idea of an edge detector is you spin it
at 1500 rpm and you approach it with the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
at 1500 rpm and you approach it with the
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.359
at 1500 rpm and you approach it with the
edge of the part that you wish to detect

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369
edge of the part that you wish to detect
 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.149
edge of the part that you wish to detect
as you approach the edge detector at

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159
as you approach the edge detector at
 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.760
as you approach the edge detector at
some point the edge detector will start

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770
some point the edge detector will start
 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.210
some point the edge detector will start
to spin eccentrically

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
to spin eccentrically
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.910
to spin eccentrically
the idea is to keep approaching the edge

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
the idea is to keep approaching the edge
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160
the idea is to keep approaching the edge
detector until you can detect that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
detector until you can detect that
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.410
detector until you can detect that
specific moment when the edge of the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
specific moment when the edge of the
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.670
specific moment when the edge of the
detector encounters the edge of the part

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680
detector encounters the edge of the part
 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.560
detector encounters the edge of the part
once you are happy with the edge

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
once you are happy with the edge
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.920
once you are happy with the edge
detection process it is time to zero the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
detection process it is time to zero the
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.950
detection process it is time to zero the
Machine this is done by hitting the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960
Machine this is done by hitting the
 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.220
Machine this is done by hitting the
yellow X button zero comes up you hit

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230
yellow X button zero comes up you hit
 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.460
yellow X button zero comes up you hit
enter and you will effectively zero the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470
enter and you will effectively zero the
 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.250
enter and you will effectively zero the
x-axis

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260
x-axis
 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.650
x-axis
once the x-axis has been zeroed you must

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
once the x-axis has been zeroed you must
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.050
once the x-axis has been zeroed you must
play the same game in the y-direction

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060
play the same game in the y-direction
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.170
play the same game in the y-direction
it is important to realize that if you

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
it is important to realize that if you
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.630
it is important to realize that if you
overshoot the edge detector it is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
overshoot the edge detector it is
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880
overshoot the edge detector it is
necessary to back out the part all the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
necessary to back out the part all the
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.280
necessary to back out the part all the
way until it starts until the edge

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
way until it starts until the edge
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.650
way until it starts until the edge
detector starts spinning cool again and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
detector starts spinning cool again and
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.570
detector starts spinning cool again and
then you can we approach the part and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580
then you can we approach the part and
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.810
then you can we approach the part and
try again once you're happy with the Y

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820
try again once you're happy with the Y
 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.440
try again once you're happy with the Y
edge detection we will also 0 the y-axis

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
edge detection we will also 0 the y-axis
 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.490
edge detection we will also 0 the y-axis
by hitting again the yellow Y button and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500
by hitting again the yellow Y button and
 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.240
by hitting again the yellow Y button and
entering 0 since the edge detector is

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
entering 0 since the edge detector is
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.640
entering 0 since the edge detector is
2/10 of an inch in diameter it is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650
2/10 of an inch in diameter it is
 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.060
2/10 of an inch in diameter it is
necessary now to move the Machine 0.1

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:20.330
moves into the part
 

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.960
moves into the part
so in climb milling the part is left

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:22.970
so in climb milling the part is left
 

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.240
so in climb milling the part is left
ever so slightly larger than the actual

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.250
ever so slightly larger than the actual
 

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.790
ever so slightly larger than the actual
size you want and in conventional

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800
size you want and in conventional
 

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.940
size you want and in conventional
milling it is left slightly smaller now

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:30.950
milling it is left slightly smaller now
 

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.070
milling it is left slightly smaller now
keep in mind this is a big cutting tool

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:33.080
keep in mind this is a big cutting tool
 

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.410
keep in mind this is a big cutting tool
but one we're using

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:34.420
but one we're using
 

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.710
but one we're using
maybe smaller but despite the fact that

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720
maybe smaller but despite the fact that
 

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.600
maybe smaller but despite the fact that
you might think that these tools are

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:39.610
you might think that these tools are
 

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.940
you might think that these tools are
incredibly rigid they actually are

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:41.950
incredibly rigid they actually are
 

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.490
incredibly rigid they actually are
capable of being slightly bent during

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:44.500
capable of being slightly bent during
 

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.210
capable of being slightly bent during
the cutting process and there are other

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:48.220
the cutting process and there are other
 

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.550
the cutting process and there are other
issues regarding the differences between

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560
issues regarding the differences between
 

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.610
issues regarding the differences between
climb and conventional milling but for

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:53.620
climb and conventional milling but for
 

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.129
climb and conventional milling but for
the most part another aspect of it is

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:56.139
the most part another aspect of it is
 

00:09:56.139 --> 00:09:58.170
the most part another aspect of it is
the finish you get it turns out that

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:58.180
the finish you get it turns out that
 

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.610
the finish you get it turns out that
climb milling gives you a better finish

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620
climb milling gives you a better finish
 

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.410
climb milling gives you a better finish
and decided to cut out our nameplate

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:04.420
and decided to cut out our nameplate
 

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.870
and decided to cut out our nameplate
using cutting radius compensation to the

to this point we're going to take four

00:10:23.569 --> 00:10:23.579
to this point we're going to take four
 

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:26.400
to this point we're going to take four
rough passes and one final pass to

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:26.410
rough passes and one final pass to
 

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.600
rough passes and one final pass to
complete the cut remember with cutting

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:30.610

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.509
complete the cut remember with cutting
radius compensation we program the

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519
radius compensation we program the
 

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:36.600
radius compensation we program the
actual parts dimensions and then the

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:36.610
actual parts dimensions and then the
 

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.400
actual parts dimensions and then the
machine will compensate for the radius

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:38.410
machine will compensate for the radius
 

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.460
machine will compensate for the radius
of the tool so it is essential to have

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:41.470
of the tool so it is essential to have
 

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.490

when we enter it it will put that into

00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:57.539
when we enter it it will put that into
 

00:24:57.539 --> 00:25:01.279
when we enter it it will put that into
our program so basically we profile the

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:01.289
our program so basically we profile the
 

00:25:01.289 --> 00:25:03.830
our program so basically we profile the
part we move down another tenth of an

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840
part we move down another tenth of an
 

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.639
part we move down another tenth of an
inch into Z and then we profile it again

00:25:06.639 --> 00:25:06.649
inch into Z and then we profile it again
 

00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:10.759
inch into Z and then we profile it again
I've added the lines to do all the

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:10.769
I've added the lines to do all the
 

00:25:10.769 --> 00:25:14.080
I've added the lines to do all the
profiling I come down a tenth of an inch

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:14.090
profiling I come down a tenth of an inch
 

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.109
profiling I come down a tenth of an inch
four times to a final depth of Z minus

00:25:17.109 --> 00:25:17.119
four times to a final depth of Z minus
 

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:20.269
four times to a final depth of Z minus
0.4 and now I want to do something a

00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279
0.4 and now I want to do something a
 

00:25:20.279 --> 00:25:22.159
0.4 and now I want to do something a
little bit different I want to make a

00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:22.169
little bit different I want to make a
 

00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:23.670
little bit different I want to make a
final pass

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:23.680
final pass
 

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.770
final pass
I'm going to do that is I'm going to

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:25.780
I'm going to do that is I'm going to
 

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.870
I'm going to do that is I'm going to
tell the machine to grab another tool

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880
tell the machine to grab another tool
 

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.090
tell the machine to grab another tool
it's actually going to be the same tool

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:30.100
it's actually going to be the same tool
 

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.780
it's actually going to be the same tool
but I'm going to enter in the tool table

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:32.790
but I'm going to enter in the tool table
 

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.430
but I'm going to enter in the tool table
the correct diameter of the tool that

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440
the correct diameter of the tool that
 

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.120
the correct diameter of the tool that
will give us our final cut let's take a

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:39.130
will give us our final cut let's take a
 

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.860
will give us our final cut let's take a
quick look at the slight changes to the

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:40.870
quick look at the slight changes to the
 

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.980
quick look at the slight changes to the
program after we make our last rough cut

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:43.990
program after we make our last rough cut
 

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.490
program after we make our last rough cut
which is at a depth of Z minus 0.4 we

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:47.500
which is at a depth of Z minus 0.4 we
 

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.860
which is at a depth of Z minus 0.4 we
now make a tool change to to number 6

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:49.870
now make a tool change to to number 6
 

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.260
now make a tool change to to number 6
that's going to be still the 3/8 of an

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:52.270
that's going to be still the 3/8 of an
 

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.810
that's going to be still the 3/8 of an
inch tool but it's going to have the

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:54.820
inch tool but it's going to have the
 

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.940
inch tool but it's going to have the
correct tool diameter listed in the tool

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:56.950
correct tool diameter listed in the tool
 

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.250
correct tool diameter listed in the tool
table it does everything that we did

00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.260
table it does everything that we did
 

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.220
table it does everything that we did
before we spin it at 3000 we rapidly go

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:02.230
before we spin it at 3000 we rapidly go
 

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.710
before we spin it at 3000 we rapidly go
down to our entry point of X 0 and Y

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720
down to our entry point of X 0 and Y
 

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.650
down to our entry point of X 0 and Y
negative 2 and then we finally bring it

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:07.660
negative 2 and then we finally bring it
 

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.080
negative 2 and then we finally bring it
down to our final depth of negative 0.5

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.090
down to our final depth of negative 0.5
 

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.720
down to our final depth of negative 0.5
and then we repeat one more time the

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:12.730
and then we repeat one more time the
 

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.700
and then we repeat one more time the
entire profiling and that should give us

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:14.710
entire profiling and that should give us
 

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.600
entire profiling and that should give us
a final cut that's just a little bit of

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:18.610
a final cut that's just a little bit of
 

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.160
a final cut that's just a little bit of
material being taken off we should get a

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.170
material being taken off we should get a
 

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.460
material being taken off we should get a
really good finish out of this I just

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:23.470
really good finish out of this I just
 

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.200
really good finish out of this I just
want to point out that so I don't get

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.210
want to point out that so I don't get
 

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.630
want to point out that so I don't get
too confused I put a comment line on

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640
too confused I put a comment line on
 

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.900
too confused I put a comment line on
line number 27 indicating that that 3/8

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:30.910
line number 27 indicating that that 3/8
 

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.080
line number 27 indicating that that 3/8
end mill has the proper diameter listed

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.090
end mill has the proper diameter listed
 

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.830
end mill has the proper diameter listed
in the tool table let's draw it again to

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840
in the tool table let's draw it again to
 

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:46.780
in the tool table let's draw it again to
see if we're getting the passes we want

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:46.790
 
 

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.550
 
you can see it's going to make five

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:48.560
you can see it's going to make five
 

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.670
you can see it's going to make five
passes and the last pass should have

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:51.680
passes and the last pass should have
 

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.010
passes and the last pass should have
been a final pass now we're going to

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:54.020
been a final pass now we're going to
 

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.330
been a final pass now we're going to
take a little look at some of the

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:55.340
take a little look at some of the
 

00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:00.240
take a little look at some of the
options on the drawing menu if we go to

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:00.250
options on the drawing menu if we go to
 

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:04.930
options on the drawing menu if we go to
display the f5 key you notice one of the

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:04.940
display the f5 key you notice one of the
 

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.300
display the f5 key you notice one of the
choices there is window I'm going to

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:07.310
choices there is window I'm going to
 

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.180
choices there is window I'm going to
select window you go back up to the

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:10.190
select window you go back up to the
 

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.650
select window you go back up to the
drawing screen you're going to see a

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:11.660
drawing screen you're going to see a
 

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.510
drawing screen you're going to see a
little window in there a box that's

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520
little window in there a box that's
 

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.580
little window in there a box that's
going to close up on a particular part

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:15.590
going to close up on a particular part
 

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.490
going to close up on a particular part
I'm going to look at this edge to see if

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:18.500
I'm going to look at this edge to see if
 

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.090
I'm going to look at this edge to see if
we are getting a final cut and now we

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:22.100
we are getting a final cut and now we
 

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.700
we are getting a final cut and now we
will hit enter to have it redraw now

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:24.710
will hit enter to have it redraw now
 

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:25.990
will hit enter to have it redraw now
we're just looking at the very bottom

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000
we're just looking at the very bottom
 

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.910
we're just looking at the very bottom
edge those are the passes and we should

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:30.920
edge those are the passes and we should
 

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.330
edge those are the passes and we should
see a final cut a little bit closer it's

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:34.340
see a final cut a little bit closer it's
 

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.160
see a final cut a little bit closer it's
hard to see but you can see that final

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.170
hard to see but you can see that final
 

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.590
hard to see but you can see that final
cut was slightly in more than the other

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600
cut was slightly in more than the other
 

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:46.120
cut was slightly in more than the other
one changing the view to isometric we

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:46.130
one changing the view to isometric we
 

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:50.560
one changing the view to isometric we
can see the outline being made the next

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:50.570
can see the outline being made the next
 

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.140
can see the outline being made the next
step is to grab tool number four which

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:53.150
step is to grab tool number four which
 

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.510
step is to grab tool number four which
will be the ball end mil and we'll have

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520
will be the ball end mil and we'll have
 

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.520
will be the ball end mil and we'll have
it come along here to create the

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:57.530
it come along here to create the
 

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.280
it come along here to create the
scalloped edge now the way we do that is

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:00.290
scalloped edge now the way we do that is
 

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:02.860
scalloped edge now the way we do that is
we don't use cutting radius compensation

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:02.870
we don't use cutting radius compensation
 

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:07.180
we don't use cutting radius compensation
the actual tool the center of the tool

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.190
the actual tool the center of the tool
 

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.400
the actual tool the center of the tool
will be hugging the edge of the part

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:09.410
will be hugging the edge of the part
 

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.070
will be hugging the edge of the part
just like this and that's how we will

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080
just like this and that's how we will
 

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.740
just like this and that's how we will
get the scalloped edge hope everybody

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:14.750
get the scalloped edge hope everybody
 

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:20.650
get the scalloped edge hope everybody
can see what I'm talking about okay once

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:20.660
can see what I'm talking about okay once
 

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.690
can see what I'm talking about okay once
again let's look at the lines of code

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:22.700
again let's look at the lines of code
 

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.330
again let's look at the lines of code
that have been added we are asking for

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:25.340
that have been added we are asking for
 

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.020
that have been added we are asking for
line number 34 tool change to tool

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.030
line number 34 tool change to tool
 

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.240
line number 34 tool change to tool
number 4 which the comment line below it

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:31.250
number 4 which the comment line below it
 

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.220
number 4 which the comment line below it
shows it as a half inch ball and mill

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:33.230
shows it as a half inch ball and mill
 

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.130
shows it as a half inch ball and mill
the m3 code is clockwise direction of

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:36.140
the m3 code is clockwise direction of
 

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.700
the m3 code is clockwise direction of
the spindle we spin it up to 3000 rpm

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:39.710
the spindle we spin it up to 3000 rpm
 

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:42.730
the spindle we spin it up to 3000 rpm
and then we're going to again exactly

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:42.740
and then we're going to again exactly
 

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.830
and then we're going to again exactly
like we did before rapidly move to zero

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840
like we did before rapidly move to zero
 

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.130
like we did before rapidly move to zero
negative to come down to zero zero point

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:48.140
negative to come down to zero zero point
 

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.020
negative to come down to zero zero point
one above the part and then we're going

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.030
one above the part and then we're going
 

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:54.040
one above the part and then we're going
to go down another 0.05 inches and then

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.050
to go down another 0.05 inches and then
 

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:54.630
to go down another 0.05 inches and then
we're going to

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640
we're going to
 

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.360
we're going to
start our profiling again this time it's

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:57.370
start our profiling again this time it's
 

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.370
start our profiling again this time it's
going to not involve cutting radius

00:28:59.370 --> 00:28:59.380
going to not involve cutting radius
 

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:03.960
going to not involve cutting radius
compensation I moved back up to the

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:03.970
compensation I moved back up to the
 

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.750
compensation I moved back up to the
lines nine through nineteen these are

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760
lines nine through nineteen these are
 

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.520
lines nine through nineteen these are
the lines that contain the geometry of

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:08.530
the lines that contain the geometry of
 

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.370

line so it's mechanical rocks so now I

00:35:14.859 --> 00:35:14.869
line so it's mechanical rocks so now I
 

00:35:14.869 --> 00:35:17.980
line so it's mechanical rocks so now I
have to type in the word rocks there is

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:17.990

no choice of fun the X start now rocks

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:21.170
no choice of fun the X start now rocks
 

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.620
no choice of fun the X start now rocks
is a much smaller word so perhaps the

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:23.630
is a much smaller word so perhaps the
 

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.870
is a much smaller word so perhaps the
x-coordinate is more like negative one

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880
x-coordinate is more like negative one
 

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.530
x-coordinate is more like negative one
the Y has to be below the center line so

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:29.540
the Y has to be below the center line so
 

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.390
the Y has to be below the center line so
perhaps I'll try negative 0.6 the start

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400
perhaps I'll try negative 0.6 the start
 

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.000
perhaps I'll try negative 0.6 the start
height again is the same the depth is

we're not really going to have to change
 

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.600
we're not really going to have to change
any tools but this is just so that the

of the tool for our final pass we come

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:46.610
of the tool for our final pass we come
 

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.700
of the tool for our final pass we come
down we make our final pass at negative

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:48.710
down we make our final pass at negative
 

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.820
down we make our final pass at negative
0.5 inches and we will if can finish the

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:51.830
0.5 inches and we will if can finish the
 

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.820
0.5 inches and we will if can finish the
profiling we then switch to our ball end

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:54.830
profiling we then switch to our ball end
 

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.580

the spindle hugs the exact edge of the
 

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.770
the spindle hugs the exact edge of the
part so we'll end up with a nice

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:14.780
part so we'll end up with a nice
 

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.140
part so we'll end up with a nice
scalloped edge we do that with two

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:17.150
scalloped edge we do that with two
 

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:20.200

passes one at z- oh five and then the

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:20.210
passes one at z- oh five and then the
 

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:23.530
passes one at z- oh five and then the
last one at z negative 0.1 and now we

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:23.540
last one at z negative 0.1 and now we
 

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.740
last one at z negative 0.1 and now we
switch to the 1/16 of an inch ball and

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:26.750
switch to the 1/16 of an inch ball and
 

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.470
switch to the 1/16 of an inch ball and
mel for engraving and we simply bring up

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480
mel for engraving and we simply bring up
 

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.600
mel for engraving and we simply bring up
the engraving algorithm so the program

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:31.610
the engraving algorithm so the program
 

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:33.460
the engraving algorithm so the program
is quite simple and we're ready to run

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:33.470
is quite simple and we're ready to run
 

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:37.240
is quite simple and we're ready to run
it let me just say one thing that's

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:37.250
it let me just say one thing that's
 

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.650
it let me just say one thing that's
worth mentioning I had left out

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660
worth mentioning I had left out
 

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.140
worth mentioning I had left out
this line here in the program the m3

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:42.150
this line here in the program the m3
 

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.329
this line here in the program the m3
code to turn the spindle on clockwise

00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339
code to turn the spindle on clockwise
 

00:38:44.339 --> 00:38:48.109
code to turn the spindle on clockwise
when I added that line it shifted every

00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119
when I added that line it shifted every
 

00:38:48.119 --> 00:38:50.839
when I added that line it shifted every
line down one and believe it or not I

00:38:50.839 --> 00:38:50.849
line down one and believe it or not I
 

00:38:50.849 --> 00:38:53.660
line down one and believe it or not I
had to go in now and change all of these

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:53.670
had to go in now and change all of these
 

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.670
had to go in now and change all of these
repeat lines which used to be nine

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680
repeat lines which used to be nine
 

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.440
repeat lines which used to be nine
through nineteen they all became

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:57.450
through nineteen they all became
 

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.690
through nineteen they all became
different now they're 10 through 20 and

00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700
different now they're 10 through 20 and
 

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.349
different now they're 10 through 20 and
then my final ball and mill repeat line

00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359
then my final ball and mill repeat line
 

00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:07.370
then my final ball and mill repeat line
also changed it was 41 to 51 it became

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380
also changed it was 41 to 51 it became
 

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.880
also changed it was 41 to 51 it became
42 to 52 so unfortunately this is a

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:10.890
42 to 52 so unfortunately this is a
 

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.430
42 to 52 so unfortunately this is a
disadvantage of using repeat commands

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440
disadvantage of using repeat commands
 

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.160
disadvantage of using repeat commands
but just be aware of it if you add lines

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:16.170
but just be aware of it if you add lines
 

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.160
but just be aware of it if you add lines
of code after you use a repeat command

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:19.170
of code after you use a repeat command
 

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.369
of code after you use a repeat command
you better change things
