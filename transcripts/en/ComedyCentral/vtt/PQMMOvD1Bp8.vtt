00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.118
( shutter clicking )

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:19.586
Ugh.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.025
( shutter clicking )

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.693
God.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835
( shutter clicks )

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.137
Ooh, ooh.

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:38.539
( phone ringing )

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.840
Jess?

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.008
<i>( Jess )
What's wrong?</i>

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:42.176
Okay, Bobby just text me,

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.644
he wants me to send him, like,
a sexy picture.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:44.778
<i>Oh my God, did you?</i>

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.480
No, no, I've been trying

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.948
and they're just,
like, really bad.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.483
Should I just
send him that one where--

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.084
Remember I met Hillary Clinton
at LaGuardia?

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:52.219
Should I
send him that one?

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.554
You can, like, basically see
my nipple.

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:54.688
They made me take it off
Facebook,

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.491
so it's
definitely not not sexual.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:58.926
<i>You're taking them yourself?</i>

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.861
Yeah... Wait, what?

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.063
<i>Honey, let me call
my guy.</i>
Your guy?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.264
( phone text beeping )

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.701
Oh, that's Bobby again.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:10.070
<i>Okay, I'm calling Danny P.
right now.</i>

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.205
Danny P.?

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:12.773
( knocking )

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.476
Hi, come on in.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.611
Hi, thank you.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:18.812
Cute place.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:19.913
Do you teach art
to cats?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.081
Can I
offer you something?

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.282
Offer me what?

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.951
Half a coconut water
and the dirt from your Brita?

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.085
I think I'm actually good,
lonelybones,

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:26.420
I'm kind of in a rush.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.689
What do you got already,
let's see.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.123
Ooh.

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.092
Why the cactus?

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:35.162
That's not a--
that's not a cactus.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.431
Okay, we need the bush
team on standby,

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:38.665
it looks like
she's got a Hasidic rabbi

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.900
living in her underpants.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.101
No offense.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:42.236
Okay.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.837
We're just gonna clean you up,
it'll take a second.

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:45.539
20 minutes.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.674
Don't worry, you're in good
hands, okay?

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:48.809
I've done everyone's.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.111
I'm talking Blake Lively,
Scarlett Jo,

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:52.312
George Lopez.

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:54.515
It was actually my idea to make
Brett Favre's dick,

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:55.749
like, bright yellow.

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:56.884
No, that was you?

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.151
That was me.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:01:59.887
Let's get to it.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.055
Did you
wear that yesterday?

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.558
Yes!

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:06.059
Very good, but don't forget
your duck mouth,

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:07.561
don't forget
that duck mouth.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:08.896
Now you're in a boat.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:11.064
You're in a boat because
you're Pocahontas

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:12.399
and it's the new world!

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.601
Maybe less feathers.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:17.070
Smile like you don't
have Spanx on.

00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:18.572
Yeah!

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:20.541
Lay back
and look really alluring.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:22.676
Well, actually, don't
look dead.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:23.810
You're pregnant!

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:26.480
You're pregnant with
gift cards !

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:27.714
Yeah!

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:29.516
Oh-- Are you
gonna shit your pants?

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.751
Oh my God, are you gonna
shit your pants?

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.819
You're so comfy.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.987
Too comfy.

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.155
Too comfy.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.857
Look, if you don't watch your
fucking shadow,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.225
I will remove it.

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:40.961
Here we go.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.196
Yes!

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.898
You've got a secret and only the
pillow can know.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.266
Wash yourself.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.836
Wash your whole body and your
armpits and under your boobs.

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:49.970
Amy!

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.638
Oh no, there's a spider
in your hair!

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:52.806
There's a spider
in your hair!

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:53.941
No!

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.809
There's a spider in your hair,
get it out!

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:57.477
Yes!

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.213
We have our shot,
that's a wrap.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.547
You were amazing.

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:01.849
Yoko!

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:04.518
Unplug everything, we're gonna
burn this rat's nest down.

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:05.953
You were so great.

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:08.088
I'd love to stay and chat, but
I've got to run downtown.

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:11.124
I have to shoot Diane Keaton
bottomless with a turtleneck

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.594
like an hour ago, I'm sure you
understand.

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.097
Oh my God, I just don't
know how to thank you.

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:20.167
Just get fucked.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.602
Bonsoir.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.976
