STEPHEN BLUM: Thank
you so much, Melanie.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.860
Well, I'm very glad to be here.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.620
Thanks for having me.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.580
I'm going to start
very briefly by talking

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.180
about why did I write this book.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.020
And to do so, it's important
to go back and talk

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.150
just a little bit
about my background.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.010
So after undergraduate
college, I went to law school,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.260
like a lot of other people did.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.990
And having gone to law
school, I became a lawyer.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.800
That wasn't a good fit for me.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.210
I didn't like being a lawyer.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.350
And in retrospect, part of the
reason it wasn't a good fit

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.820
is I wanted something
more related

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.510
to taking care of people.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.395
I'm one of those guys who really
likes to take care of others.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.280
As I explored what
else I might do

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.690
and had conversations with
people, I was heard to say,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.640
I want to have a flock.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.340
I want to be a
counselor, but I also, I

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.700
want flock, like a minister
or a rabbi or a priest.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.250
And then there's a joke in there
about realizing that priests

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.250
take a vow of celibacy and
decided to knock priest out

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.870
of the list.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.420
But like a minister,
like a rabbi.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.580
And that led to-- I like
to say sarcastically,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.960
a little bit-- that I
invented wealth management.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.770
I didn't really.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.860
Wealth management is really
the financial services industry

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.760
realizing that, why
just sell investments

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.540
when you can sell investments
and tax-related things

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.066
and estate
planning-related things

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.440
and you can put
them all together

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.210
and have a broader
something to offer.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.750
But in my case, eventually
one of my more strong-willed

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.682
friends grabbed me by the
lapel and said, listen you,

00:01:56.682 --> 00:02:00.790
you know money and investing
and tax and estate planning

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.040
and you can't figure out how
to help people and get a flock?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.660
That's what everybody needs.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.315
That's what everybody
wants help with.

00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:11.290
Get out there and just do it.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.500
So I put out a shingle
as a lawyer, that's

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.060
what I was trained as, and have
been doing that ever since.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.420
At the same time, I've been
teaching at the Wharton School

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.709
the University of
Pennsylvania for 21 years.

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.000
I teach in the Department of
Legal Studies and Business

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.140
Ethics.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.870
And what I teach most is
negotiation and conflict

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.370
resolution.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.070
This book is the coming-together
of those two careers,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.290
and it germinated
out of my realization

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.010
that my understanding of how
there could be better ways

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.290
to guide people in
their financial lives

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.840
grew directly out of viewing
financial life through the lens

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.790
of, what would a
good negotiator do.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.620
A good negotiator, as I
was taught as a student

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.810
and as I teach them.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.540
And by the way, I should
mention that before getting

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.780
to teach at Wharton, I was
a student at the Program

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.310
on Negotiation at
Harvard, and so I believe

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.370
I had the best teachers
in my field in the world.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.200
And by the way, that makes it
extremely hard-- excuse me,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.290
extremely easy-- to be
a really good teacher

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.590
and extremely easy to win
awards, teaching awards.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.290
Just channel what your teachers
did, if you had great teachers,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.810
and do what they did.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.790
The primary themes
of this book-- and I

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.460
guess I should
hold it up and say,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.660
this book-- the primary
themes are these.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.240
First of all, anyone can
become a better negotiator,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.210
and doing so will
improve life outcomes.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.600
Investing and other aspects
of your financial life

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.370
are simply another
set of negotiations.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.170
Applying the
negotiation methods that

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.839
are talked about in
this book-- the ones

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.880
that I teach at Wharton,
the ones that are taught

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.775
at Harvard, they're taught at
a lot of other universities

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:07.650
around the country and
now around the world--

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:15.410
but applying those to the issues
and the problems of investing

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.160
will get you significantly
better results

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.380
in your investing, in your
financial decision-making.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.790
Onward with the themes.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.820
Certain systematic
problems arise

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.660
as you negotiate in
a financial context,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.260
as you deal with the
financial services industry.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.320
And particular
actions are called

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.390
for if you're going to
be successful in dealing

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.390
with those systematic problems.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.700
And we'll talk more about them.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.830
And finally, that the fruits of
improved negotiation techniques

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.430
in the areas of
investing and dealing

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.150
with your financial
life are worth more

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.280
than most people
would ever imagine.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.050
I challenge you-- I
think they're probably

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.570
worth more than
you would imagine.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.280
And in the final
chapter of this book,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.380
I have a couple little charts
to try to demonstrate that

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.990
and, time allowing, we'll talk
just a little bit about that so

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.750
that I can try to make
that point to you,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.370
that it's well worth paying
this attention to these subjects

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.910
because, hey, it's worth money.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.870
It's worth money to
you as an individual

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.370
who is investing and dealing
with your financial life.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.920
Now, a one-hour talk requires
us to make some choices, yes?

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.640
We can't really cover
everything in a one-hour talk,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.270
and indeed I hope
students really

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.060
get the gist of
negotiating after 42 hours.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.590
One hour, a little
more limiting.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.369
So in light of those
time constraints,

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:54.285
here's what I propose.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.590
I'm going to offer you a quick
overview of the negotiation

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.900
methods as they're
presented in the book,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.300
as they're taught at Wharton and
at Harvard and at other places.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.400
In light of the
limited time, I'm

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.270
going to only touch on and
just review very briefly

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.240
the economic truths
at the end of the book

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.080
that I think are fundamental
knowledge if you're

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.350
going to be any good as a
negotiator of your investments.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.310
There's some economics
you've got to know.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.790
It's not too hard,
we'll touch on it.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.720
I'll mention topic
areas, and then I'll

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.070
encourage you to go off
and do some more learning.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.450
I want to reserve as
much time as I can

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.440
for what I refer to as the
systematic problems that

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.810
arise in negotiating
your investments.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.500
These are the topics of
conflicts of interest,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.060
asymmetric information,
and a new understanding

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.000
of professionalism
that I believe

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.310
holds the key to
addressing these problems.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.860
So that's what I hope
to talk about the most.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.350
So with your permission, let's
begin in those directions.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.097
So let's start by talking
about negotiation.

00:07:15.097 --> 00:07:17.055
It's what the first part
of this book is about.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.110
And I want to
start by stressing,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.460
look, I wrote this book,
I've been interviewed.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.120
Been interviewed a lot of times.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.160
And a lot of interviewers
say, oh, OK, negotiating.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.170
We know how to do that, so
tell us in three sentences

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.360
how do you negotiate
your investments?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.310
And what they're talking about
is people's common sense idea

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.740
of negotiating.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.620
And that's not what we're
talking about in this book.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.730
We're talking about
a systemic method.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.280
A way of structuring
negotiation, thinking about it,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.550
breaking it down into its
parts, preparing for it,

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.060
gathering the information
you need, and doing it.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.080
So that's what I
want to just give you

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.910
an overview of now, this
systematic way of thinking

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.830
about negotiation.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.130
So let's start
with a definition.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.810
What is negotiation?

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.750
An interactive communication
process that potentially takes

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.710
place whenever you want
something from somebody else

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.480
or they want something from you.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.580
That definition,
as students quickly

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.780
realize when they see
it, is very broad,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.620
and suggests that a lot of
what we do is negotiation.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.630
My teachers at Harvard
urged that a negotiation

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.990
could be broken down into
seven basic elements.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.970
So here they are, quickly.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.040
The first one is alternatives.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.200
In negotiation
speak, alternatives

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.010
means everything
else that we could

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.230
do in the world besides
this negotiation.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.220
You and I are negotiating.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.510
What if we walk away?

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.790
What if we can't make a deal?

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.790
What else is there are
out there for me to do?

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.170
And of course, what else is
there out there for you to do.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.275
If any of you have read
about or studied negotiation,

00:09:08.275 --> 00:09:11.570
you know that the
Harvard people went on

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.680
to talk about isolating
your best alternative.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.960
And they called it--
BATNA, the best alternative

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.550
to the negotiated agreement.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.400
It turns out, this
is where power

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.910
comes from in a negotiation.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.540
Understanding your alternatives
and your best alternative,

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.950
making educated guesses
about the other side's best

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:41.920
alternative, and taking
a pulse of who's got

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.820
the stronger
alternative, meaning

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.130
who can walk away
from this negotiation

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.220
and be the less diminished.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.700
If I have a very, very
strong alternative,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.620
I can walk away from
this negotiation

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.120
and instead of being here-- what
I hoped to get from our deal--

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.040
I'm right here.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.610
I haven't fallen very much.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.790
If, on the other hand, you--
if I can make an intelligent

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.280
guess that if we
don't make this deal

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.840
you have a great ways to
fall because your best

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.560
alternative is weaker,
then guess what?

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.560
You need to deal a lot, I
only need the deal a little,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.880
I have the power, OK?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.180
That's very important
to negotiating.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.620
Later we're going
to find out it's

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.510
tremendously
important to applying

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.200
negotiating to things
like investing.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.500
All right, so
alternatives are first.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.090
Second are interests.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.020
And what I always
tell students is,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.790
what you really, really want.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.420
What lies down below
positions-- you know,

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.220
how much will you take?

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.110
I'll take $10,000.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.620
That's a position.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.370
Below that are issues.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.970
What are the concerns?

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.740
And below that are interests.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.730
What are we really, really
trying to get and do.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.910
And I put it to you
that you and most--

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.610
let's say all-- negotiators
you deal with, they

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.635
have a lot of
different interests.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.470
And finding them out,
discovering the other side's

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.600
interests, being well-conversant
with our own interests,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.100
can lead us to
making better deals.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:20.600
Which leads us to the third
element of any negotiation.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.390
This is options.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.910
Now when I started
studying this,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.890
I said, wait a minute--
alternatives, options,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.070
they sure sound
like synonyms to me.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.150
In negotiation speak, we
need to lose that idea.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.610
They're totally different.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.150
Options are all the
ways we can structure

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.840
this deal we are working on.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.460
And alternatives
are all the things

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.760
that are totally
external to this deal.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.540
So, options.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.770
I'll trade you my peanut
butter sandwich for your turkey

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.420
sandwich.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.335
Or, I'll cut the
peanut butter in half

00:11:56.335 --> 00:11:58.543
and I'll trade you half of
the peanut butter for half

00:11:58.543 --> 00:12:01.180
of your turkey if you'll
throw in that Twinkie.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.840
Right?

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.080
Two options.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.040
Just in the lunchroom
trade, we could probably

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.470
come up with a thousand, right?

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.230
Lots and lots of permutations.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.970
Well, of all the
options, of all the ways

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.690
to structure a given deal,
some are better than others.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.760
Some get us closer
to maximum value

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.440
that we're splitting between us.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.010
And indeed, a lot of you in this
room probably know this phrase,

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.330
some are pareto optimal,
and some are not.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.890
Obviously we want to
create as much value

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.410
as we can before we
go about dividing it.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.370
A bigger pie is just better
to split than a smaller one.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.520
So creating lots
and lots of options,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.130
figuring out which
are the best ones,

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.110
and then finalizing a deal based
on the best possible options,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.920
the richest, the options
that create the most value.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.400
And indeed, the
options that actually

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.960
get us to more of our interests.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.970
What do we really, really want.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.375
Fourth element, legitimacy.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:12.190
I've taken to calling this,
outside measures of fairness.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:19.970
The teachers at Harvard
refer to objective criteria,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.210
and my Wharton
colleague Richard Shell

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:30.850
has referred to authoritative
standards and norms.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.560
What are we talking about?

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.200
Outside measures of fairness.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.840
So what's an outside
measure fairness?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.530
Well if you're going to
buy a share of Google stock

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.100
on the market today, what
would you pay for it?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.232
Anyone know?

00:13:49.232 --> 00:13:51.970
Probably between
570 and 580 bucks.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:52.980
Thank you for that.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.605
How do you know that's
the right price?

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.890
There's a liquid market, right.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.270
And liquid market is one way
to get objective standards.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.730
But it's by no
means the only way.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.420
By no means.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.610
So here's an example I
often throw my students.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.930
I knew a guy who was
having his own house built,

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.040
so he hired a contractor.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.300
And the contractor--
the subcontractor--

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.520
came to him one
day and said, hey,

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.430
how deep you want the
foundation of your house to be?

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.654
And he said, I don't know.

00:14:28.654 --> 00:14:30.320
I don't know anything
about foundations,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.330
you're the builder.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.720
He said, well I'll
tell you what.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.289
Here's what we'll do.

00:14:35.289 --> 00:14:36.830
Most people in this
neighborhood have

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.530
spent about $50,000
on their foundation.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.740
So we'll just dig until we
get to 50 and then we'll stop.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.940
That's how deep it will be.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.070
No good, huh?

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.160
Why not?

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.130
Can anybody put in my language?

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.690
Wrong standard, right?

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.680
Wrong standard.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.820
What is the right standard?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.170
Obviously the standard we
want is the building code,

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.350
which is actually a codification
of scientific standards.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.960
And we want scientists
and engineers

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.880
who think about these
things to tell us

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.700
how deep our foundation
should be, not a price market.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.830
So finding the right
standards is very important.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:18.170
Let me also just say
about legitimacy,

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.550
no one wants to feel cheated
or taken advantage of

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.930
or treated badly.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.290
You don't, and I put it
to that people you're

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.950
negotiating with
don't, and therefore

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.390
fairness, legitimacy, in
both process and outcomes--

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.890
in how we do the negotiating
and in the deals we make--

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:37.860
is very important.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.430
It's important to us,
it's important to others.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.620
The next element
is communication.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.120
Communicating well
is very important.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.240
And over so many years
of teaching and studying

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.390
and researching and
thinking about negotiations,

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.970
I've come to the conclusion that
the single place they go wrong

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.000
the most is misunderstandings.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.360
Miscommunications.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.230
Not quite getting what the other
folks are trying to put out

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.040
or they're not getting what
we're trying to put out.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.590
Making communication stronger
and better will bring fruit.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:12.757
Try to do it.

00:16:12.757 --> 00:16:13.673
Next is relationships.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.880
Relationships.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.530
Important, no?

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.200
Relationship in a
negotiation, important?

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.482
Well as we study it,
students always say,

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:24.940
well that depends
on if you're ever

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.240
going to see the person again.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.020
Are you ever going to
see the person again?

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.070
I usually end up by challenging
my students that I'm not sure

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:38.490
that I know of any situation
where I'm absolutely positive I

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.120
will never see the person again.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.190
It's a big risk to run.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.910
And let me suggest this.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.709
There's a relationship at
this moment in a negotiation,

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:51.500
we're sitting here
talking and negotiating,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.250
there's a relationship
right now.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.380
There's a negotiating
relationship that's bigger.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.880
It's the size of the
entire negotiation, which

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.150
sometimes negotiation lasts
for months or weeks or months

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:06.819
or years or even lifetimes and
we usually pull out one or two

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.599
negotiations that
have lasted millennia.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.650
You can probably
think of a couple.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.230
So, relationship right
now, relationship

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.400
for the negotiation.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.930
Relationship beyond
the negotiation.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.280
Right?

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.069
Do you negotiate
with your parents?

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.760
You do.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.200
You have a bigger
relationship than that.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.400
You negotiate with
your neighbors,

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.990
with the people
around you in life.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.259
You have a bigger relationship
than just your negotiating

00:17:34.259 --> 00:17:36.550
relationship, and you don't
want to lose sight of that.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.716
You don't want to damage it.

00:17:37.716 --> 00:17:41.370
In fact, what's best for a
negotiator is, can you come out

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.350
of it with the
relationship strengthened.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.000
And let me add this.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.100
Every relationship has a
potential relationship.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.880
What could this relationship
be if we steered it

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.900
in the direction to get us even
deeper, richer relationship,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.740
which would get us
more of what we wanted.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.010
So keep that in mind
about relationships.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:07.470
And the final element of
negotiation is commitment.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.750
I put it to you that, as
you're closing a deal,

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:14.280
you don't want an
agreement or a deal

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.950
or a handshake-- you
want a commitment.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.900
Here's some plain English.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.100
You want to make it as likely
as possible that the other guy

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.460
will actually do everything
that he or she promised

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.260
to do through the very end,
through the last promise that

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.580
was made.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.930
Now why didn't I
say, and you will

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.970
do what you promised to do?

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.670
I figure you can trust yourself.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:47.840
Can you trust yourself
to do what you promised?

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.690
And when you start
worrying about,

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.909
how am I going to make a
deal that they are extremely

00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:55.450
likely to actually do everything
they promised they would do?

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.574
You start worrying about
that at the very beginning

00:18:57.574 --> 00:18:59.010
and throughout.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.350
All right.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.950
So that's seven elements
of any negotiation.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.720
I now want to talk about four
phases of any negotiation.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.540
And I guess I should--
time for a commercial?

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.620
I walk you through in the
first part of the book,

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.370
I work you through these seven
elements and these four phases.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:23.310
Four phases of any negotiation,
the first one is preparation.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.290
Prepare, prepare, prepare.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.810
This is the single best
advice about a negotiation

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.580
you can get.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.560
Prepare fully, you'll do better.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.780
Know your stuff, do your
homework, you'll do better.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.440
The second stage
of any negotiation

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.290
is information exchange.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.660
Learn and gather everything
you need to know,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:46.670
and that includes all
about the other people

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.170
in the negotiation,
the other side.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.670
Let's do this, because I guess
we have time-- it's OK for it

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.326
to be a little interactive.

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:56.450
Let's say you and I are in
a negotiation right now.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.991
What would you like
to know about me?

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.324
Anyone?

00:20:02.324 --> 00:20:04.520
Depends on what it's about?

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.230
OK.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.350
Would you-- I'd
suggest you'd like

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:13.230
to know about my background,
my ethics, my interests.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.650
You'd like to know all the
information you can figure out

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.680
about my alternatives and my
best alternative, my BATNA.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.432
What I'm trying to
do, what I care about.

00:20:22.432 --> 00:20:24.820
How about how I am
as a negotiator?

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.070
How I've dealt with
other people who

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.680
are similarly situated to you.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.890
Time pressure, as in the time
pressure I'm feeling right now.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:34.630
Yes!

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:35.890
Good, time pressure.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:36.390
What else?

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.750
Anything else?

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.850
Here's a thought experiment.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.100
Let's say that as I
was driving here today,

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.030
my little mobile phone
rang and it was my wife

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.140
and she said our little
seven-year-old daughter Libby,

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.940
there's something not
right with her today.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.880
I'm a little concerned
and I've decided

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.564
to take her to the
pediatrician this morning.

00:20:57.564 --> 00:20:58.730
Would you like to know that?

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.500
The answer is yes.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.240
Absolutely.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.180
Why?

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.540
It goes to my state of mind.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.820
It suggests I might
be in a hurry.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.130
It offers you-- well,
students have sussed out

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.930
that it offers you
the opportunity

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.050
to do one of two very
different things.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.780
You can either, with
this information,

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.375
take advantage of me
because I may be distracted

00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:23.130
or I may feel tremendous
time pressure,

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.580
or you could offer me a gift.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.790
Such as hey,
perhaps you'd prefer

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.810
to put this off and
not do this now.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.570
Or we don't have to
complete this now.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.460
Or I can get you out
of here early, right?

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.285
So you either take
advantage of me

00:21:37.285 --> 00:21:41.640
or offer me a kindness or a gift
that hopefully I will either,

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.380
I will repay
someday, and it will

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.590
change how I'm
disposed toward you.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.230
I put it to you
that, if you'd really

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.965
like to know even about
my little girl's health,

00:21:51.965 --> 00:21:54.761
that you would like
to know everything.

00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:56.260
And I think that's
the right answer.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.430
You would like to
know everything

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.630
you possibly can about me.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:07.022
There is one problem with that.

00:22:07.022 --> 00:22:08.230
Actually, I'm skipping ahead.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.900
OK.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.650
If you'd like to know
everything about me,

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.120
how are you going to get that?

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.640
Well, there's three
levels of ways.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.530
You can do research on me, you
can go to your favorite tool

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.720
Google and look,
you can ask people,

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.780
you can ask other people
similarly situated

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.730
to me as you are,
you can ask my wife.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.310
Please don't ask my wife.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.990
And on the first level of
all, you ask me, right?

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.680
You're sitting at
table, at least

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.840
metaphorically, with
the biggest expert

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.130
on the subject of
me in the world.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.230
And [INAUDIBLE], it's
my favorite subject.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.990
I'm happy to talk about it.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.580
But there is a problem
with asking me questions.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.880
What is that?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.540
Anyone?

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.650
Right.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.060
The problem is I may lie.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.230
And my suggestion
to you is you take

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.570
all the information
offered, you take everything

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:03.710
I will tell you.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.800
But in your head you're
putting in two different piles.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.550
Here this pile is,
this is what he said

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.560
and I know of
absolutely no reason

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.580
or incentive why he would lie.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.150
And this pile is,
here's what he said,

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.970
but I can identify some
incentives for him to lie,

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.140
so be careful with it.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.930
But this pile that he may
be lying, is not worthless.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.530
There's a lot of data in there.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.065
It's just not necessarily all
for the truth as it was spoken.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.020
So you want to know everything.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.050
First phase of negotiating
was preparation

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.730
and you did that
before we sat down

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.510
at the metaphoric
negotiating table.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.680
But the second phase,
information exchange,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.130
now we're interacting.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.500
Now it's you and me, you
and the other parties

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.310
to the negotiation.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.290
Learn, gather, listen,
ask great questions

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:59.460
and gather up all the
information you possibly can.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.570
Be patient.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.700
Wade slowly, because
the third phase,

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.710
bargaining-- as soon as somebody
mentions a price or a term,

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.760
what happens in a
room of negotiators?

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.780
Everybody gets back
and gets cautious

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.870
and if it's playing cards
they pull their cards

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.320
to their chest, right?

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.250
The tone changes.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.310
So the big advice
for a negotiator is

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.520
do not move from the second
stage, exchanging information,

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.730
to the third stage, bargaining,
any earlier than you have to.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.300
Try to hold off as
long as you can.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.960
It probably won't
be long enough,

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.660
our tendency is to
want to jump ahead.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.770
But finally we reach bargaining.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:38.770
You all know bargaining.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.690
It's probably what
before this afternoon

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.640
you would have called
negotiating, right?

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.390
The great job of
the negotiator is

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.640
you're looking to identify,
what can I offer you

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.230
that is cheap and easy for me
to offer you that you will hold

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.240
dear, and because
you value it so

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.780
much you'll be
willing to offer me

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.140
things that are
great value to me.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.240
Perhaps they're less dear
or less valuable to you.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.490
And we make those
value-creating trades.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.880
Finally we get to the fourth
stage, closing and commitment,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.290
where-- I reiterate what I
said about commitment before.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.090
You're looking to
make a deal that

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:19.980
works for everyone at least
well enough that the other side

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.480
says, yeah, I'm going
to keep my promises

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.220
because it's in my
interest to do so.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.890
So those are seven
elements of any negotiation

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.220
as laid out by my
Wharton colleague Richard

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.720
Shell in his excellent book,
Bargaining for Advantage--

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.880
there's another commercial--
and as reviewed and gone over

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.800
and perhaps added to a
little bit in my book,

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.720
Negotiating Your Investments.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.860
All right.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.420
Now part two of
my book says, OK,

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.580
that's what negotiating
is all about,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.810
you can apply this
directly to investing.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:03.530
First of all, I have to make
the argument that investing

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.270
is really just
another negotiation.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.190
And some people haven't
liked that argument so much.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.030
So let me try to make
it to you briefly,

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.280
and see if I can win you over.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.632
Let's start with this.

00:26:18.632 --> 00:26:21.370
You ever buy a house?

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.154
Was it a negotiation?

00:26:23.154 --> 00:26:25.070
Were you absolutely sure
it was a negotiation,

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.150
or set of negotiations?

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.220
Absolutely.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:27.980
No doubt about it.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.230
You ever buy a new car?

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.630
That's the most famous
negotiation in our society,

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:35.140
right?

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.270
Going to the car
dealership and going up

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:41.585
against that highly trained
pro at negotiating tricks.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:50.530
So how come when you go to buy
an interest in an investment,

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:54.280
an interest in a business--
why isn't that a negotiation?

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.290
My argument is, it surely is.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.090
What are you going to buy, one
one billionth of this company

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.700
Google?

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.430
Is that what you buy usually?

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.350
One one billionth interest?

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.810
It's a negotiation.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.030
And these tools
can and indeed, I

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.280
argue, must be used to do well.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.760
Couple other things on this.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:25.200
The fact that these investments
are traded on exchanges

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.165
and priced by liquid markets
does not change their character

00:27:29.165 --> 00:27:32.330
as negotiations, but rather
just adds another challenge,

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:33.580
another negotiating challenge.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.920
Oh, OK, this a negotiation
about something

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.250
that has this pricing mechanism.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:41.350
I urge you that you have
to reject the notion

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.710
that, because it seems to be--
and I emphasize that it seems

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.510
to be-- a take it or
leave it pricing model,

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:50.570
somehow that's
not a negotiation.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.680
And by the middle
of the semester,

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.730
any student of
mine who said, hey

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.250
it seems to be take it or leave
it so it's not a negotiation,

00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:59.830
would get a scolding.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.600
Or a bad mark or however it is
I tell students to turn around,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.090
go the other way.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.710
Just because somebody comes
to you and says, I'm sorry,

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.660
this isn't quote unquote
negotiable, does not make it

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.125
something other
than a negotiation.

00:28:18.191 --> 00:28:20.440
And this is what I said a
minute ago-- buying a house,

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.100
buying a car, buying property.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.560
Buying a property interest
that you hope will appreciate,

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.070
such as an investment, like a
stock or a bond that you hope

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.980
will pay you
dividends, and so on.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:50.160
Now as quickly as I can-- I told
you, the first part of the book

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.290
is negotiating.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.150
The second part of
the book is about

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.380
applying negotiating
to investing,

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.880
and we're going to
swing around back

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.380
to that, to the
systematic problems.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.209
But the third part is
some basic economics

00:29:01.209 --> 00:29:02.750
that you need to
know if you're going

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.170
to be a good negotiator
over your investments.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.000
So here's some.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.040
Let me start with this.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.280
Economists know a great deal.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.830
They know a tremendous amount.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.440
Now, we make jokes.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.200
We say it's the
dismal science, and we

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.100
say economists have predicted
nine of the last three

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.610
recessions, and that's fine.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.790
And we take notice that
economists most certainly

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.380
do not know what will the
markets do next month,

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.290
or next year.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.880
In fact, the most honest
economists will tell you,

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.677
I have no idea about that.

00:29:44.677 --> 00:29:46.510
But that doesn't mean
they don't know a lot.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.610
They do know a lot.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:52.280
And yet most Americans
and people in the world

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.634
invest as if none of
that knowledge was known.

00:29:55.634 --> 00:29:57.800
And I'm going to guess that
some people in this room

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.710
sometimes invest in direct
conflict with things

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.960
that scientists know.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:10.460
So the third part of this
book is review, as I said,

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.340
and I think you've got to
know this stuff if you're

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.290
going to negotiate.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.910
Because, don't forget, what did
I say a good negotiator does?

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:18.680
Does their homework, right?

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.202
Knows what they need to know.

00:30:20.202 --> 00:30:23.540
Not just about the other side,
you need to know the science.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.689
You need to know the
background of the matter you're

00:30:26.689 --> 00:30:27.230
dealing with.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:30.460
So here's a few of them.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:36.000
The markets are rational and
price investments correctly

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.260
based on what is
currently known.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:45.230
Therefore, it is essentially
impossible-- more

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:49.030
or less impossible, at
least-- to beat the market.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.310
There are only three ways you
can beat the market, according

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.390
to this science.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:58.890
Through luck, which
is random chance.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:05.390
Through insider knowledge,
which is cheating--

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.290
I should do the other
way-- through cheating,

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.840
which is insider
knowledge, right?

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.610
Martha Stewart did very
well on that trait,

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.256
but she had to go
to jail for it.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.525
And what's my third one?

00:31:18.525 --> 00:31:19.025
Oops.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.600
I can't remember the third one.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.310
AUDIENCE: High
frequency trading?

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.105
STEPHEN BLUM: Pardon?

00:31:25.105 --> 00:31:26.480
AUDIENCE: High
frequency trading?

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.620
STEPHEN BLUM: No, high frequency
trading you cannot beat

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.090
the market.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:35.090
You can beat other investors,
right, you can jump ahead,

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.650
you can front-run their
trades, basically.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.373
And you've read
Michael Lewis's book?

00:31:39.373 --> 00:31:40.011
Good.

00:31:40.011 --> 00:31:40.510
OK.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:47.360
If markets price
things rationally,

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.240
which they do, more
or less at least,

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:57.640
and nobody can beat the market,
what is to be done about that?

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.110
Well it is irrational
to pay somebody

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:07.030
to do something for you that
scientists know can't be done.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.530
Right?

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.550
It's not a smart move.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.340
Yet most Americans
do that every day,

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.360
and I put it to
you that all of you

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.360
are paying-- directly
or indirectly-- paying

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.120
a lot of people a lot of money
to pick individual stocks

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.620
for you, individual investments
for you, one way or the other.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.070
And that is something that
scientists basically know

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.916
cannot be done.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:33.540
Except for random chance,
that will not successfully

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.380
beat the market consistently
over a long term.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.300
Second economic truth,
past performance

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.030
is not going to help you.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.470
Past performance is just a
reflection of random chance,

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.612
just like if there were
100 people in this room--

00:32:49.612 --> 00:32:51.070
it looks like there
might be, let's

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.840
say there are 100 people in
this room-- I want you to all--

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.150
you can do this virtually,
don't do it actually--

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.790
I want you all to
take out a quarter,

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.000
flip it, and try as hard
as you can to get heads.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.750
Good job, 50 of you got heads.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.020
OK, you 50, do it again.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.500
25 of you got heads.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.380
Again.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.570
12 of you got heads.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:08.470
Again.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:09.810
6 of you got heads.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.270
Again.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.457
You three-- come on.

00:33:13.457 --> 00:33:14.540
That's just random chance.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.248
Let's see you three,
let's see one of you

00:33:16.248 --> 00:33:18.110
get-- who can get heads again.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.660
One of you gets
heads again, right?

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.920
Any skill?

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.550
Any anything?

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.590
The playing out
of random chance.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:30.680
That's most of what we
see in past performance.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.180
Another economic truth.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.090
Diversification is the only
free lunch in economics.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.950
It is very valuable to you.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.366
Take advantage of
diversification.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.830
The fourth economic truth
that I want to deal with here

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:53.880
is historical data.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.470
We know what investments and
markets have done in the past.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.090
This is an incredibly
easy thing to study,

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:02.930
because most of the
data is already captured

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.730
and in computers.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.860
So dealing with people
who are telling you lies

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:11.280
or making vague statements
about past history

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.850
is not a good idea, because
the history is known.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.920
Next important economic
idea-- critical idea-- costs

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.010
reduce returns.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:26.340
I like to say they reduce
them dollar for dollar.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.889
One dollar of cost will reduce
your returns one dollar.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:38.480
Pulling out unnecessary costs
when investing is of great help

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.929
to you in getting better
investment results.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.810
And in light of compounding
over long periods of time,

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:44.885
it is a fortune.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.030
Wall Street churns out a
lot of bad investments,

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.920
and they should be avoided.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.540
There's a list in here
of-- a partial list,

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.960
maybe not comprehensive-- of
things that I would suggest

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.490
are bad investments that
you should steer clear of.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.040
OK, one more thing.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.090
The amount of money at stake--
by doing these things better,

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.360
by pulling out the
cost and so on--

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.520
is more than you would imagine.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.780
Did I promise you-- oh,
all right, we'll do it

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.190
as a game-- there's a
chart in here put together

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.905
by one of my students who's
much smarter than I am

00:35:21.905 --> 00:35:24.810
and much more able
to do such charts.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.270
But that chart
asks-- shows us this.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.920
I'm going to make
it as a game for us.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:36.750
If you have a million
dollars and some smart cookie

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:43.970
is able to increase your
returns by 1% per year--

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.580
either through pulling out
costs or increasing returns

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.460
or some combination, doing
it more intelligently--

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:57.975
a 1% increase per year
on a million dollars,

00:35:57.975 --> 00:35:59.140
what has this saved?

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.980
What is that worth to
you after one year?

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.030
$10,000.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.760
Good.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.220
How about after 30 years?

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.980
Anybody want to play?

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.160
Well here's the answer.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.692
The answer's a question.

00:36:16.692 --> 00:36:19.150
You raise your hand and you
say, hold on there smarty pants

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.970
professor, you didn't tell
us the compounding rate,

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.110
and we need it.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:23.866
Right?

00:36:23.866 --> 00:36:25.240
The chart in the
back of the book

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.460
uses a compounding rate of 7%.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.780
If your investment is returning
on average 7% per year

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.690
and you are increasing return
or decreasing cost whatever

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:42.420
it is, bettering yourself by 1%,
how much is that over 30 years?

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.260
Well we are tempted to multiply
10,000 by 30 and get $300,000.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.730
But there we've completely
ignored the compounding.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.120
Anybody want to
take a gut guess?

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.890
You took a gut guess,
one and a half million?

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:54.550
Not too bad.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.450
What?

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.070
OK, that's very low.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:04.040
The answer, as the chart in the
book attests, is $2.1 million.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.890
So a lot of-- that face.

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.480
You're kidding.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.800
Gotta do the math.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.350
OK.

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.580
A lot of money is at stake.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.650
I guess that's my chance to
say, you should read the book.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.900
You should do what I tell you.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.560
Because it's not
small, it's big.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.870
Having said that, and
not having too much time

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.840
left-- didn't I say I was
reserving almost all my time

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.670
for what I'm first
getting to now?

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.090
Here's what I want
to talk about now.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.480
The systematic challenges
inherent in almost all

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.760
investment negotiations.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.070
Conflicts of interest.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.880
Dealing with people
who have interests

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:50.060
that are in conflict
with our own interests.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.940
Asymmetric information.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:59.110
The simple fact that they know
a lot more about the situation,

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:02.900
the playing field, what we're
talking about, than we do.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.200
And the issue of trust.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.500
The problem of, we
may be in a situation

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.825
where we have to put our
trust in other people,

00:38:09.825 --> 00:38:11.735
and who should we
put our trust in

00:38:11.735 --> 00:38:13.800
and who should we avoid
putting our trust in.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.280
I want to point out very quickly
that conflicts of interest

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.559
are not necessarily
just financial.

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:26.100
You understand a
conflict of interest

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.370
in a financial conflict
of interest, right?

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.840
You go to somebody and you
say, what should I invest in?

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.290
Somebody you;'re
paying, no less,

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:33.873
to tell you what you
should invest in.

00:38:33.873 --> 00:38:36.100
And they say, you should
invest in this over here,

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.090
because when you
do I make money.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.300
Basic financial
conflict of interest.

00:38:45.142 --> 00:38:49.310
How about conflicts
of interest over time?

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:53.670
How about-- the one that
comes most to mind is,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.890
I'm serving you but
every minute that I

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.430
spend serving you is a
minute I can't be out trying

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.510
to get another customer.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:04.549
That's a direct conflict
of interest over time.

00:39:04.549 --> 00:39:07.090
How about conflicts of interest
over things other than money,

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:09.410
like position or
prestige or notoriety?

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:12.400
And the example I decided
to come up with for you

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.920
last night is, I'm not
going to use any names

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.450
but there are a
bunch of celebrity

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.580
lawyers in our society.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.039
And it seems like
whenever somebody

00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:22.871
gets in some kind of
problem-- I don't know,

00:39:22.871 --> 00:39:25.100
let's just make something
up, let's say [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:29.820
And I know you guys are all
very confident in our highly

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.470
technological
world, but let's say

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.840
that I took naked
photos of myself.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.220
And suddenly, they're all over
the place, and easily searched.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:46.160
Here come a certain group
of lawyers-- not to me,

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.540
I don't matter, but to Jennifer
Lawrence and all the others.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.410
Celebrity lawyers, right?

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.310
What's in it for the
celebrity lawyer?

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.690
They get paid, probably a
handsome fee, and so on.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:01.740
But what about the fact that
a young and budding celebrity

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:06.470
lawyer, their career will
be made if it goes to trial.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:10.850
And if it's settled quietly,
which might be by far the best

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:12.835
choice for their
celebrity client,

00:40:12.835 --> 00:40:15.750
it doesn't do much for
the lawyer, does it?

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.650
Conflict of interest.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.270
OK.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:21.510
Let's go to the
second one quickly.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.380
Asymmetric information.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.030
As I said, they
know more than you.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.800
They know more than
you about the facts,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.094
they have more experience than
you, they know the scuttlebutt,

00:40:33.094 --> 00:40:35.510
they know the playing field,
they know the published rules

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.190
and they know the insider rules.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:42.570
It's very, very hard to get a
fair shake in that situation,

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.371
unless they care to
give you a fair shake.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:53.440
What are some classic examples
of asymmetric information

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.050
working against us in investing?

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:58.792
Well, front running,
which you alluded to.

00:40:58.792 --> 00:41:00.250
The idea that if
I know what you're

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.720
going to do-- if you're
going to buy something,

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.070
it's going to raise the
price at least a little.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.160
And in some situations, a lot.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.504
If I know you're about to raise
the price, I can buy it first.

00:41:10.504 --> 00:41:11.920
And then when you
raise the price,

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.770
I have an instant profit.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:17.820
And there's Michael Lewis's
book in a real nutshell.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.665
If I can build these very high
speed information systems,

00:41:20.665 --> 00:41:22.540
I can know what you're
going to do before you

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.640
do it and I can
jump ahead of you.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.630
So that's an example of
asymmetric information.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:34.840
How about this one, though.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.500
What about when somebody
guides you to an investment,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.680
and when you go to actually make
the investment they hand you

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.170
a contract is 90 pages long.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.410
And you don't have--
anybody here ever signed

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:47.950
such a contract?

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:50.790
If anybody's ever invested in
a so-called annuity product,

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.090
you probably have.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.740
That's a contract that your
own lawyer wouldn't understand.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.810
Only a lawyer in that industry
would even understand it,

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.600
because it's full of jargon.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.530
It's totally
one-sided because it's

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.300
written by the
person, the company,

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.150
selling you the
instrument, right?

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.960
They know what's
in that contract,

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.850
they know what the
deal is, and you don't.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:13.020
It's a serious asymmetric
information problem.

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:16.595
And finally, trust.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.460
We are put into situations
where we must trust somebody

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:26.699
even though we have not yet
built up a body of evidence

00:42:26.699 --> 00:42:28.365
to say, this is
somebody I should trust.

00:42:30.745 --> 00:42:33.120
When we are lucky enough that
we are in a situation where

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.580
we actually can
make a choice, how

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.640
do we go about
making that choice?

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.450
These three systematic
problems are huge,

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:45.900
but here's the good news.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.420
Society has struggled
with them for a long time.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:52.350
They're not-- they may be
huge, but they're not new.

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:57.200
And I'm here today to argue--
and chapter 17 in my book

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.260
tries to argue as well-- that
the answer that society has

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:06.120
come up with, in
part, is what we

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:10.470
call the traditional
professions.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:12.750
Medicine, law and clergy.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:16.300
When you go to the doctor,
or surgeon, perhaps,

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.640
you're in this situation, right?

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.784
The surgeon could have
conflicts of interest easily.

00:43:21.784 --> 00:43:23.200
If the surgeon
were more concerned

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.200
with how do I make the
most money instead of how

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.490
do I do best by you, it's
pretty easy, isn't it?

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.300
Lawyers-- I'm a lawyer.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.240
Conflicts of interest daily.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.310
Sometimes dozens of them daily.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:39.090
And clergy.

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:41.590
Your relationship
with the almighty.

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.420
These are the
traditional professions,

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.165
and they have been
aware of this problem.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.340
Here's what I think the
traditional professions have

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.140
come up with.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.940
Long and serious training.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.510
Standards, rules
and regulations.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.880
Codes of professional conduct
that address these problems.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.220
Specifically the codes.

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.850
Among the many
things they say are,

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.830
when you hit a conflict of
interest, here's what you do.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:19.510
And you do for your client,
your patient, your parishioner.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.190
Carrot and stick.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:25.320
Serious penalties for
violation of the codes.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.740
Things like, you
lose your license.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:33.630
And perhaps most significantly,
in my opinion, very strong

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.780
socialization in these values.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.950
To do any of these things and
become a doctor or a lawyer

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:41.990
or a clergyman-- as
I'm talking about it,

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:49.720
as a professional clergyman,
not a mail order ministry--

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.570
over and over and over.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:56.230
The training includes getting
you to think like, and take

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.720
in the values of,
this profession.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.650
And those values include
patients come first,

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:07.880
clients come first, and
parishioners come first.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.420
The traditional
professions all understand

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.420
in their codes,
their ethics, and

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:18.910
their informal self-identities,
that care-taking

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:23.260
and safeguarding of others is
an integral and essential part

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.060
of professional work.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:30.750
Now I'm not so naive as to say
well, all doctors, lawyers,

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.870
and clergy always put
their clients first,

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:34.620
that we don't have any
problems with that.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:36.710
No, no, we have plenty
of problems with it.

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:39.600
But my argument is that
the professions themselves

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.270
take this on, and
that when a doctor

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.230
or lawyer or a clergy person
screws up in this area,

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.670
they're screwing up in part
against their profession.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.920
They are outside the
bounds of their profession.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.840
They are violating their
professional duties.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.760
As opposed to arm's
length transactions sales

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:04.350
cultures where the codes
don't exist, or the ethos

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:05.005
doesn't exist.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:11.420
I better hurry up.

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.485
So here's my proposal.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:20.420
A new professionalism,
a proposed definition

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.820
of professionalism.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:27.020
I propose that what
professionalism should mean

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.330
is that a true professional is
one who uses his or her ability

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:33.470
and power-- the
knowledge, the learning,

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.780
everything you've
gathered-- solely

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.340
to advance the best
interests of the client.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.560
And, very importantly,
if you're going

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.430
to be a true professional, when
your interests and the client's

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.680
interest diverge, you
follow the client's interest

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.420
and only the client's interest.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.990
Client simply comes first.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.970
This is my idea and
my understanding

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:58.050
of a true professional.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:07.570
And my argument is we're making
a tremendous mistake when

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:13.500
we say, well, professionalism
refers to technical knowledge

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.880
or experience or
having done it a lot.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.900
I think professionalism
in particular

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.670
is about this question of
care-taking and safeguarding

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:27.600
of clients, and following
only their interests.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.770
And that's what we look
for in a professional,

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:33.190
and therefore this
idea of professionalism

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:37.405
must be expanded beyond the
traditional professions.

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:43.301
Advancing true professionalism
in the managing

00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:44.300
of other people's money.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:50.370
We need to apply a
duty of care-taking

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:54.890
in addition to advanced
levels of skill.

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:58.030
This is particularly
critical in our society

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:01.030
because we're becoming
more and more of a you're

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.780
on your own society.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.350
You're on your own with
your retirement savings.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.310
You want to send your kids to
college, you're on your own.

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:10.817
We'll help you, we'll help
you with tax deductions,

00:48:10.817 --> 00:48:13.150
we'll help you-- your employer
helps you with a program.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:17.720
But you have to do
the decision-making.

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.980
So to abandon everyone
to you're on your own

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:24.980
and you're going to work
with people who are not

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.410
professionals, we're not
meeting these definitions,

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:30.160
but rather there,
in a sales culture,

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.216
is a tremendous
societal problem.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:45.670
And finally though-- my
please I guess is this.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:48.720
At this point I'm going to argue
that the financial services

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.620
industry is not a profession.

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:56.290
Rather, it is an arm's
length sales-based industry.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:59.140
The great challenge for
society and for the industry

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:05.390
itself is to transform
itself into a profession.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.140
In light of the
conflicts of interest

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.710
and asymmetries of
information that

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:12.180
are inherent in investing
and money management,

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.640
I would say this is
a matter of urgency

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.520
for our society as a whole.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.900
However, that's
very nice, right?

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.100
And I'm not the first person
who came to this podium

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.530
and said we need great
societal transformation

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.530
and it'll probably take a
long time and let's all do it,

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:28.440
right?

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.950
But one more thing for
you is, let's get real,

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.570
this ain't gonna
happen tomorrow.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:38.400
So what do you do about
your individual situation?

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.780
And here is my answer.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.700
The industry-wide changes
we've discussed here

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.240
will not take place overnight.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.120
Indeed, even the
first baby steps--

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.220
the imposition of
a fiduciary duty

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:55.420
on all financial advisors--
is being fought vigorously

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.590
in Washington, DC right now.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:00.480
To your surprise, most
financial advisers

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.025
do not owe you a fiduciary
duty at the present time

00:50:03.025 --> 00:50:04.800
at law, which is crazy.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.580
It's what I just
described as a baby step.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:12.500
And in light of that, it
falls to the individual

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.260
to take action for herself.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.300
So here's the prescription.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.310
Here's what I think
you need to do.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:23.450
I think you need to look for
individuals and companies

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:26.570
to work with who exhibit
these professional qualities

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:30.580
that I've talked about,
and who understand

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:36.050
their responsibilities in
safeguarding and care-taking

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:37.840
of their clients in their work.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:44.430
In this quest, here's
what you need to do.

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.860
You need to do a
lot of preparation.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.240
You need to ask a tremendous
amount of questions.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.550
You need to do your homework
and know the subject area.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.120
Do your research.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.850
Be skeptical.

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:56.795
Own your own power.

00:50:56.795 --> 00:51:00.380
This is very important
because a lot of us

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.880
mistake financial people for the
people who tell us what to do

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.300
and we just accept, like
doctors and lawyers and clergy.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.540
That's a mistake.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.610
You are the one in
the power position.

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.800
In fact, to go back
to a concept mentioned

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.430
earlier, what's your
best alternative?

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:19.260
Well, last time
I looked, there's

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:23.760
somebody else plying this
trade across the street.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.570
Financial services is the
most competitive industry

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.850
in our society.

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:29.530
You've got a lot of choices.

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:31.820
That means you have the power.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:35.020
Own that power.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.600
Know well your best alternative.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:41.880
Do not settle, keep shopping
for the professional you seek.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:49.870
Get everything in writing,
and maintain lots of controls.

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:51.310
Maintain lots of control.

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:55.800
Do not hand excessive
authority over to others.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.610
Practice your
negotiating skills,

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:00.310
get better as a negotiator,
and then understand

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:03.450
that you're dealing with a
negotiation with your finances.

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:08.510
And of course, read
my book, all right?

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:11.630
It is my fondest hope that
this has been helpful to you

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.710
in navigating your
financial life,

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:18.380
and that it will result in a
richer future for all of you.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.990
So with that, I
thank you very much.

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:23.570
I think I went over, yes?

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:25.340
Is that what that was about?

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.090
I went over.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:26.590
OK.

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:28.410
But if-- those of
you can stay, anybody

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:30.120
who needs to leave, go ahead,
and those of you who can stay,

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.494
I'll be glad to
answer questions.

00:52:31.494 --> 00:52:35.170
And I think I'm supposed to
encourage you to buy the book.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:38.170
And if you do buy the book, of
course I'll be glad to sign it.

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:39.460
I'm not in a hurry.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.754
I'll stay as long as you want.

00:52:40.754 --> 00:52:43.170
And if people want to talk as
individuals after questions,

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:43.990
that's fine.

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.520
So what can I tell you?

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.520
What can we chew around?

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.437
Go ahead.

00:52:47.437 --> 00:52:50.120
AUDIENCE: So there are a lot
of financial negotiations

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.818
I can do like [INAUDIBLE], my
career, my salary-- job things,

00:52:53.818 --> 00:52:57.280
right-- If I could invest
my energy in only one

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.790
negotiation, what would that be?

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:00.241
STEPHEN BLUM: I'm
sorry, if you--

00:53:00.241 --> 00:53:03.034
AUDIENCE: If I invest my energy
in only one negotiation, what

00:53:03.034 --> 00:53:04.922
would your top most thing be?

00:53:04.922 --> 00:53:06.880
STEPHEN BLUM: Well it's
an interesting question

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.500
because I don't want to
be boxed in to just one.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.290
But I think the
point that I'm trying

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.820
to make is, don't give short
shrift to the negotiation

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.730
about your investment,
your savings and so on.

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.750
Don't say, well that'll
take care of itself.

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:22.910
It really won't.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.120
It's really worth the effort.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.920
It may not be more important
than, say, your job

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.471
or your future or
figuring out how

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:30.720
you're going to deal with
your kids and their futures,

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.100
but it's terribly important.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.200
That's my message.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.841
OK?

00:53:34.841 --> 00:53:35.750
Go ahead.

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:38.062
AUDIENCE: So if you
can't beat the market

00:53:38.062 --> 00:53:39.770
and want to minimize
costs, is the answer

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:43.691
to just buy SMP500 index
funds and call it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:43.691 --> 00:53:45.440
STEPHEN BLUM: A great
question because you

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.790
have to read my book.

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:51.050
The answer is not to buy
SMP500 funds and here's why.

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:53.530
The SMP500 is an index.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:56.240
It is not the index,
and in fact it's

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.960
not the best index for you.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.350
It's not broad enough.

00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:03.730
It's only 500
stocks, more or less.

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:07.939
Well no, not the
best, the biggest.

00:54:07.939 --> 00:54:09.980
And there's lots of research
that will tell you--

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.270
and you can read about
it not just in my book,

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.480
there's lots of places to
read about this-- that you

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.271
want to go broader.

00:54:15.271 --> 00:54:17.230
Remember about diversification.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:19.850
And so you want to build
a group of index funds

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:21.330
or other passive
investments such

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:23.920
that essentially
you own everything.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.480
OK?

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.610
So you're on the right
track, but the answer

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:28.450
is not the SMP500.

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:30.431
OK, good.

00:54:30.431 --> 00:54:30.930
Go ahead.

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:34.419
AUDIENCE: I'm looking-- I'm
apartment shopping right now,

00:54:34.419 --> 00:54:36.419
[INAUDIBLE] potentially
purchasing an apartment,

00:54:36.419 --> 00:54:39.390
and it's really-- I feel
like I don't trust anyone.

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.760
Which seems to be
the correct thing.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.460
I don't trust my
real estate broker,

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:46.550
I don't trust my
mortgage broker.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:48.270
What should I do
to get past that,

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:51.455
where I can make this decision
and feel good about it?

00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:54.170
STEPHEN BLUM: The
truth about negotiation

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:55.730
that I didn't
mention is, we always

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:58.160
have to make a
cost-benefit analysis.

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.600
The book in my
classes teach you how

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.610
to do a big,
important negotiation.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.160
And they say, invest a lot of
the resource of yourself in it.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.490
And so the answer I have
to give you involves

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:10.490
investing a lot of
yourself and a lot of time.

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.292
You might not choose to do it.

00:55:12.292 --> 00:55:14.500
But the answer that I've
been trying to present today

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:15.800
is this.

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:20.870
It's worth the effort to make
a huge research project out

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:24.550
of finding particularly the
realtor, the one in a million

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:28.000
realtors in New York, who really
behaves like a professional.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.790
Who really-- and you
have to find this

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:33.230
through reputation and
through people who know them,

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:34.730
or perhaps through
personal contact,

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:37.690
but someone who will really do
as I said of a professional.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:39.980
Who will say, you are my client.

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.450
You come first.

00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:44.660
And I don't have to make maximum
money off you, because if you

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.060
go away saying, this is the
best realtor in New York

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:51.040
and tell everyone who you know,
I'll do just fine in my career.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:51.870
OK?

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:54.792
So the answer is, negotiate it.

00:55:54.792 --> 00:55:55.750
Like a real negotiator.

00:55:55.750 --> 00:56:00.810
And negotiate it means do your
research, do your finding out.

00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:01.900
Suss out the people.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.321
Learn, learn, learn.

00:56:03.321 --> 00:56:05.570
AUDIENCE: Who has the BATNA
in that situation, though?

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:07.790
Because there's
a million buyers,

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:09.249
but there's a
million brokers, too.

00:56:09.249 --> 00:56:11.289
STEPHEN BLUM: Well the
answer to BATNA analysis--

00:56:11.289 --> 00:56:13.100
and I really didn't
have time to do BATNA,

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.300
BATNA takes me a
whole 3-hour lecture--

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.910
but the answer to BATNA analysis
is, you always have a BATNA

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:20.810
and they always have a BATNA.

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:23.660
You always have an
answer to this question.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.650
After I've done all my
research and really examined

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:29.000
my alternatives and
really thought hard

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.240
about which is the best one,
I always have an answer.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.200
What will I do
after the research?

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.180
What will I actually do?

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.600
So what will you actually do?

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.167
AUDIENCE: Just find someone
else or not [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:41.167 --> 00:56:42.000
STEPHEN BLUM: Right.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.416
And if you're
buying an apartment,

00:56:43.416 --> 00:56:45.417
obviously-- one of
the things I didn't

00:56:45.417 --> 00:56:47.750
talk about but I want you to
read the book and see about

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:49.269
is strengthening your BATNA.

00:56:49.269 --> 00:56:50.810
You can always
strengthen your BATNA.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:52.800
The simple solution on
strengthening your BATNA

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.450
is, know three places
you want to buy.

00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:59.619
And then knowing that, if I
can't reach a deal on this one

00:56:59.619 --> 00:57:02.160
because they're being jerks and
they're being New York realty

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.110
people, I can buy this one.

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:06.030
And I only fall this far.

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:06.671
OK?

00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:07.170
Good.

00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:07.660
Sure.

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.618
AUDIENCE: What's your
opinion of Robo-Advisors?

00:57:12.516 --> 00:57:15.190
STEPHEN BLUM: Well as you can
probably guess from my lecture,

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.672
I think working
with somebody who

00:57:16.672 --> 00:57:18.880
behaves like this true
professional I'm talking about

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.660
is incredibly valuable to you.

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:22.590
So let me say this.

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:27.980
I think Robo-Advisors,
let me back up a minute.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.022
The word financial
advisor, what does it mean?

00:57:30.022 --> 00:57:32.230
Well I give a whole lecture,
another lecture about it

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:33.970
doesn't really mean much.

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:36.000
But there's a lot of
confusion in American life

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.210
and financial life because
an awful lot of people

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:40.418
call themselves financial
advisors when what they are

00:57:40.418 --> 00:57:41.710
is investment advisers.

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:45.450
That's even how they're
regulated, just by investments.

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:48.005
Robo may be able to do a
reasonably good job of choosing

00:57:48.005 --> 00:57:50.080
an investment portfolio for you.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.670
There's a whole lot more
to your financial life,

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:55.600
and I don't know that Robo
can do anything with it.

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.580
So the answer is, perhaps
just for investments,

00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.780
maybe it's-- I don't have a
full opinion, it's just coming.

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.992
For a full guidance with
your financial life,

00:58:04.992 --> 00:58:06.200
it's going to fall far short.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.702
AUDIENCE: Have you heard
of Personal Capital?

00:58:08.702 --> 00:58:10.310
STEPHEN BLUM: No,
I haven't tried

00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:12.080
to keep track of all of them.

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.655
They're springing up like weeds.

00:58:13.655 --> 00:58:14.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:17.110
What's interesting about new
ones like Personal Capital,

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:21.192
it's a Robo-Advisor plus you
get assigned to a live person

00:58:21.192 --> 00:58:22.400
to kind of manage your books.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.050
STEPHEN BLUM: OK.

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.110
If it was my 2.1
million dollars,

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:29.780
and that's just what you will
say, that's not-- believe it

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.430
or not-- everybody in the room
looks pretty young with one

00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:34.960
or two exceptions-- we're
talking about 10s and 10s

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.376
of millions of
dollars when you're

00:58:36.376 --> 00:58:38.480
old because of
inflation and so on.

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.220
We're talking about
a lot of money.

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:44.795
I wouldn't work with somebody
who some robot assigned me.

00:58:44.795 --> 00:58:47.420
Part of the message of the book
is you want to do your homework

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:50.680
and find somebody who's
really superb and professional

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:51.760
for you.

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.404
And it's worth it.

00:58:54.404 --> 00:58:57.586
AUDIENCE: What about
if you're worried

00:58:57.586 --> 00:58:59.706
about the ethics
of your investment?

00:58:59.706 --> 00:59:05.297
I mean, buying a big,
broad [INAUDIBLE] is fine.

00:59:05.297 --> 00:59:07.960
Probably be investing
in child prostitution--

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.720
STEPHEN BLUM: So you're talking
about what the industry calls

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.787
socially responsible
investing, right?

00:59:12.787 --> 00:59:13.370
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:14.620
STEPHEN BLUM: OK.

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.312
There are a lot of
choices out there.

00:59:17.312 --> 00:59:19.270
Some of them are good
and some of them are not,

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:21.410
so you're going to run
into the same problems.

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:23.970
But it exists, and
it's there for you.

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:25.964
But unfortunately of
course it's not perfect.

00:59:25.964 --> 00:59:27.880
The way it works, or the
way it tends to work,

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:31.550
is investment choosers
work with screens.

00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:33.870
So lists are made of what
they will not invest in,

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.744
and they invest in the rest.

00:59:35.744 --> 00:59:36.910
Some are better than others.

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:40.350
My advice would be, in
light of efficient markets,

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:42.640
you probably just want
to build your screen

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.250
and invest in everything else.

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:48.070
And there are companies
that will do that for you.

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:49.910
OK?

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:50.960
Other questions?

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.620
Thoughts?

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.570
Criticisms?

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:55.533
No?

00:59:55.533 --> 00:59:58.545
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
saying that irrespective of

00:59:58.545 --> 01:00:01.716
whether you invest in real
estate or stocks or anywhere,

01:00:01.716 --> 01:00:02.632
just put it somewhere.

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:05.536
Because eventually over
the next 20, 30 years,

01:00:05.536 --> 01:00:10.710
[INAUDIBLE] at the same
rate as [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:13.670
STEPHEN BLUM: That
question goes to my point

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:15.000
about the history is known.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And you can research it.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.740
What you'll find is,
real estate does not

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.590
return what common stocks
do over long periods.

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:27.680
Let's take one minute and
talk about what is a stock.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.670
A stock is an ownership
interest in a company.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:32.330
And what is a company?

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:37.540
A company is the coming together
of people, machines and capital

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.470
under our laws for
solely one purpose.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.678
And hopefully it's a little
broader than one purpose,

01:00:41.678 --> 01:00:43.330
but our laws say
for one purpose.

01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:45.800
To try to make money.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.720
OK?

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.540
They do.

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.160
Not all of them do.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.310
Some fail.

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:51.520
Some do poorly.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.910
But on average, they make money.

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:55.580
And don't forget
what I'm advocating

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.250
involves you're owning
essentially everything.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:01.970
So your broad portfolio
of everything of stocks

01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:03.850
is going to make
money, it's going

01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:07.420
to make the return that
companies make on average.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.746
And it turns out
that common stocks--

01:01:09.746 --> 01:01:11.120
these diversified
common stocks--

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.982
is probably the best
investment you can make.

01:01:13.982 --> 01:01:15.940
On average, it will do
better than real estate.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.430
Because what is real estate?

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:19.690
Real estate is sitting
there and it collect rents.

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:23.510
But companies-- if this great
real estate to be had New York,

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.390
you know who you're
competing with to buy it?

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:26.706
Some real estate company.

01:01:26.706 --> 01:01:28.080
You can own stock,
you can become

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.960
an owner of that
real estate company.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.160
OK?

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:32.960
Good?

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.240
You're calling time on me.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.330
Well thank you so much
for doing this with me.

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:38.210
I appreciate it very much.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.060
Thank you.
