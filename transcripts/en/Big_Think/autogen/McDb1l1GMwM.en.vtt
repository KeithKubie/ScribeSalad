00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380
like teaching because what poker really
 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.799
like teaching because what poker really
does is teach you how to deal with

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809
does is teach you how to deal with
 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.660

probabilities and uncertainties and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670
probabilities and uncertainties and
 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.060

not that complicated there's a lot of
approximations you can do and I I found

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469
approximations you can do and I I found
 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.679
approximations you can do and I I found
that I used to actually not be very good

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689
that I used to actually not be very good
 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.379

at mental arithmetic I was fine if I had

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389
at mental arithmetic I was fine if I had
 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.629
at mental arithmetic I was fine if I had
a pen and paper and algebra that was

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639
a pen and paper and algebra that was
 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.479
a pen and paper and algebra that was
like that but in the moments mental

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489
like that but in the moments mental
 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.860
like that but in the moments mental
arithmetic I could never do but I

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
arithmetic I could never do but I
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.719
arithmetic I could never do but I
started playing poker and sort of just

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729
started playing poker and sort of just
 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.409
started playing poker and sort of just
practicing these things and now I it's a

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419
practicing these things and now I it's a
 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.520
practicing these things and now I it's a
skill I'm proud of so it's it's it's

skill I'm proud of so it's it's it's
 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.039
skill I'm proud of so it's it's it's
just a willingness to keep plugging away

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049
just a willingness to keep plugging away
 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.200
just a willingness to keep plugging away
at it

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210
