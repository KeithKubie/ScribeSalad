00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:18.867
This is the story of an invention that changed the world.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:23.418
Imagine a machine that could cut 10 hours of work down to one.

00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:27.900
A machine so efficient that it would free up people to do other things,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.968
kind of like the personal computer.

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:33.267
But the machine I'm going to tell you about did none of this.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.883
In fact, it accomplished just the opposite.

00:00:36.883 --> 00:00:44.167
In the late 1700s, just as America was getting on its feet as a republic under the new U.S Constitution,

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:48.568
slavery was a tragic American fact of life.

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:53.501
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both became President while owning slaves,

00:00:53.501 --> 00:01:01.051
knowing that this peculiar institution contradicted the ideals and principles for which they fought a revolution.

00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:06.918
But both men believed that slavery was going to die out as the 19th century dawned,

00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:10.568
They were, of course, tragically mistaken.

00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:12.819
The reason was an invention,

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:16.421
a machine they probably told you about in elementary school:

00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:19.083
Mr. Eli Whitney's cotton gin.

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:25.819
A Yale graduate, 28-year-old Whitney had come to South Carolina to work as a tutor in 1793.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:31.201
Supposedly he was told by some local planters about the difficulty of cleaning cotton.

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.883
Separating the seeds from the cotton lint was tedious and time consuming.

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:40.284
Working by hand, a slave could clean about a pound of cotton a day.

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:42.701
But the Industrial Revolution was underway,

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.801
and the demand was increasing.

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:50.818
Large mills in Great Britain and New England were hungry for cotton to mass produce cloth.

00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:57.568
As the story was told, Whitney had a "eureka moment" and invented the gin, short for engine.

00:01:57.568 --> 00:02:04.101
The truth is that the cotton gin already existed for centuries in small but inefficient forms.

00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:11.700
In 1794, Whitney simply improved upon the existing gins and then patented his "invention":

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.617
a small machine that employed a set of cones that could separate seeds from lint mechanically,

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:19.218
as a crank was turned.

00:02:19.218 --> 00:02:26.783
With it, a single worker could eventually clean from 300 to one thousand pounds of cotton a day.

00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:33.300
In 1790, about 3,000 bales of cotton were produced in America each year.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.500
A bale was equal to about 500 pounds.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.883
By 1801, with the spread of the cotton gin,

00:02:39.883 --> 00:02:44.283
cotton production grew to 100 thousand bales a year.

00:02:44.283 --> 00:02:47.319
After the destructions of the War of 1812,

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.500
production reached 400 thousand bales a year.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.050
As America was expanding through the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.250
yearly production exploded to four million bales. Cotton was king.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.517
It exceeded the value of all other American products combined,

00:03:07.517 --> 00:03:11.783
about three fifths of America's economic output.

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:16.684
But instead of reducing the need for labor, the cotton gin propelled it,

00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:20.850
as more slaves were needed to plant and harvest king cotton.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.751
The cotton gin and the demand of Northern and English factories re-charted the course of American slavery.

00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:34.734
In 1790, America's first official census counted nearly 700 thousand slaves.

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:39.633
By 1810, two years after the slave trade was banned in America,

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:43.117
the number had shot up to more than one million.

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:49.834
During the next 50 years, that number exploded to nearly four million slaves in 1860,

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:53.195
the eve of the Civil War.

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:59.800
As for Whitney, he suffered the fate of many an inventor.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.368
Despite his patent, other planters easily built copies of his machine, or made improvements of their own.

00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:08.801
You might say his design was pirated.

00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:13.884
Whitney made very little money from the device that transformed America.

00:04:13.884 --> 00:04:16.668
But to the bigger picture, and the larger questions.

00:04:16.668 --> 00:04:20.116
What should we make of the cotton gin?

00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:24.201
History has proven that inventions can be double-edged swords.

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:27.385
They often carry unintended consequences.

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:34.500
The factories of the Industrial Revolution spurred innovation and an economic boom in America.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.784
But they also depended on child labor,

00:04:36.784 --> 00:04:43.279
and led to tragedies like the Triangle Shirtwaist fire that killed more than 100 women in 1911.

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:47.833
Disposable diapers made life easy for parents,

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:50.801
but they killed off diaper delivery services.

00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:54.667
And do we want landfills overwhelmed by dirty diapers?

00:04:54.667 --> 00:05:01.033
And of course, Einstein's extraordinary equation opened a world of possibilities.

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:04.235
But what if one of them is Hiroshima?
