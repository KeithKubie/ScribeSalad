00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.040
 talent to the silicon valley good the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.690
 true that he was presenting a 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.340
 technology ours that suspense is that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.830
 You wear portbou to force us 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.770

 to be able to communicate through the network or 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.880
 through the disk I was quite surprised 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.630
 in fact I am very pleasantly 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.250
 surprised at the level and attention 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.990
 that the guys gave during this 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.150
 presentation is true because we were 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.530
 seeing questions and even 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.080
 he was asked questions that have 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.180
 responded quite well in fact 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.110
 that surprises me that indeed the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.580
 level of attention they maintained in the 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.470
 presentation was quite high which 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.690
 speaks very well of the exact group that is 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.460
 that we invite you who are there for 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.170
 supposedly listening to us to use 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.490
 open-source tools that you know 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.110
 much more as they said for others is going to 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.970
