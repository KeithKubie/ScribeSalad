00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.690
- [Instructor] We're told
Kaya rode her bicycle

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.300
toward a tree at a constant speed.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.700
The table below shows the relationship

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.050
between her distance to the tree

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.020
and how many times her front tire rotated.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.720
So once her tire rotated four times,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.780
she was 22 1/2 meters from the tree.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.800
Then once she's rotated eight times,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.080
she's 12 1/2 meters from the tree.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.450
When it rotated 12 times,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.300
then she's only 2 1/2 meters to the tree.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.980
So she's getting closer and closer

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.130
the more rotations that her tire has had.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.100
So then they ask us some questions here.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.060
So they ask us how far away
was the tree to begin with?

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.070
How far does Kaya travel
with each rotation?

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.960
How many rotations did it
take to get to the tree?

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.830
So like always, pause this video,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.210
and see if you can answer these questions

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.223
on your own before we do it together.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.440
So let's start with the first question.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.210
How far away was the tree to begin with?

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.550
So the way that I would think about it is,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.200
after four rotations, we're
22 1/2 meters from the tree.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.800
We see that if we increase
by another four rotations,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.390
so let's say plus four rotations,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.150
we see that we have gotten
10 meters closer to the tree,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.690
or our distance to the tree
has gone down by 10 meters.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.440
So I'll write negative 10 meters here.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.310
If we want to figure out how
far the tree was to begin with,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.670
we have to go back to zero rotations.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.150
So if we're going back by four,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.310
so we're subtracting
four from the rotations.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.340
And if we're going at a constant rate,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.230
well, then we would add 10 meters.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.040
So we would add 10 meters.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.300
If we add four rotations,
we get 10 meters closer.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.090
If we take away four rotations,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.130
to get us back to zero rotations,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.120
then we will go 10 meters further.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.650
So that would be at 32.5 meters.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.800
So 32.5 meters is how far the tree was

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.660
to begin with when Kaya
had zero rotations.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.640
The next question is
how far does Kaya travel

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.210
with each rotation?

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.510
All right, well, we already
saw that with four rotations,

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.470
she's traveling 10 meters,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.600
so we could say 10 meters

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.713
in four rotations.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.870
So if we divide both of these
by four, what would we get?

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.870
Well, that's the same thing as
2 1/2 meters in one rotation.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.800
So this is 2.5 meters.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.280
And last but not least,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.630
how many rotations did it
take to get to the tree?

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.820
Well, we know that after 12 rotations,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.540
she's only 2 1/2 meters
away from the tree.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.500
We also know that in every one rotation,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.090
she gets 2 1/2 meters closer.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.080
So she only needs one more rotation

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.330
to cover this next 2 1/2 meters.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.700
So,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.140
if we go plus one rotations,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.450
we're going to go down 2 1/2 meters.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.970
We're going to go 2 1/2
meters closer to the tree,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.000
and we will be at the tree.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.590
So how many rotations did it take

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.500
to get to the tree in total?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.450
13 rotations.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.550
Now one thing that's
interesting is to think about

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.020
what we just did in a graphical context

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.600
that you might have seen before.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.110
And if we were to put on the
horizontal axis rotations

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.440
and if we were to put on the vertical axis

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.010
distance to the tree,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.670
distance

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.570
to tree,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.330
I'll just call the
vertical axis the y-axis

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.780
and the horizontal axis the x-axis,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.680
well, we could see here
that we have zero, four,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.600
eight, 12,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.680
I could go to 16.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.480
And then we saw that at zero rotations,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.520
we are 32.5 meters from the tree,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.400
so 32.5.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.150
This is all going to be in meters.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.950
So this first question was
really another way of asking

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.140
what is our y-intercept?

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.650
And this next question,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.420
how far does Kaya travel
with each rotation,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.030
well, we saw that when you
increase your rotations by four,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.850
your distance to the tree
goes down by 10 meters.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.340
So when this is plus four, we went down,

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.800
we went down 10 meters.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.480
So it's negative 10 meters.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.980
So really what we were thinking
about right here, this is,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.410
you could think about the
magnitude of the slope.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.150
The slope of this line,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.880
the slope of this line that
would describe her distance

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.830
to the tree as based on
the number of rotations,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.200
the slope is going to be
our change in our distance,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.940
which is negative 10,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.830
four, our change in rotations, over four.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.290
So the slope of this line

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.870
is negative 2.5 meters per rotation.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.350
But when they say how far does Kaya travel

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.050
with each rotation, she's
getting 2 1/2 meters closer.

00:04:55.002 --> 00:04:57.600
Her distance from the tree
goes down by 2 1/2 meters.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.770
And this last question,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.300
how many rotations did it
take to get to the tree,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.920
well, at what point is our y value,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.210
our distance to the tree, zero?

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.920
And we saw that it is at 13 rotations.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.710
So this is another way of thinking about

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.400
what was the x-intercept?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.300
So the line,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.590
it's a line because we
know that she's traveling

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.110
at a constant rate, looks
something like that.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.490
So they really were
asking us the y-intercept,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.483
the slope, and the x-intercept.
