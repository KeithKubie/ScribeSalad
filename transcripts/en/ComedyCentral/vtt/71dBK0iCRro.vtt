00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.237 size:81% position:41% line:91%
MY GUEST "NEW YORK TIMES"
BEST SELLING AUTHOR, WHOSE

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.340 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEW BOOK IS CALLED "HERETIC: WHY
ISLAM NEEDS REFORMATION NOW."

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:10.710 align:start position:0% line:91%
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE
PROGRAM AYAAN HIRSI ALI.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:11.477 align:start position:0% line:85%
HELLO.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.713 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HOW ARE YOU.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:17.884 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANKS FOR COMING.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:18.718 align:start position:0% line:85%
SIT.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.485 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOW ARE YOU?

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:21.421 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M GOOD. THANK YOU.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.789 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:26.526 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BOOK IS CALLED "HERETIC:
WHY ISLAM NEEDS A

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.527 align:start position:0% line:85%
REFORMATION NOW."

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.199 align:start position:0% line:91%
MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE WHY
DOES ISLAM NEED A

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.333 align:start position:0% line:85%
REFORMATION NOW?

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.669 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY TOO
MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING IN THE

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:40.740 align:start position:0% line:91%
NAME OF ISLAM, TOO MANY
WOMEN LIVE UNDER OPPRESSION.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.076 align:start position:0% line:91%
TOO MANY JEWS ARE BEING
DEMONIZED FOR IT,

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.047 align:start position:0% line:91%
TOO MANY GAYS ARE BEING KILLED
IN THE NAME OF ISLAM.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.949 line:91%
TOO MANY CHRISTIANS ARE BEING
KILLED IN THE NAME OF ISLAM.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.084 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK IT REALLY HAS THE
ANSWERS TO HAVE

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.718 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE REFORMATION NOW.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.755 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT ISN'T IT, IF I'M
REMEMBERING THE REFORMATION 

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:57.090 align:start position:0% line:91%
CORRECTLY, AND IT'S BEEN A
WHILE --

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.092 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.726 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WASN'T THE -- AREN'T WE
HAVING THAT NOW?

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.728 align:start position:0% line:91%
AREN'T WE HAVING THE
REFORMATION NOW?

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:06.666 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THE REFORMATION WAS MARTIN
LUTHER WANTED A PURER FORM

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.534 align:start position:0% line:85%
OF CHRISTIANITY.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:13.106 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND SO WHEN HE PUT THAT UP
THERE, IT CREATED A HUNDRED

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.342 line:85%
YEARS OF VIOLENCE AND MAYHEM.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.744 size:84% position:42% line:91%
ISN'T THAT THE PROCESS THAT
WE ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:19.812 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW?

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.647 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT IS THE PROCESS THAT
WE'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.681 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.785 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S THE PROCESS THAT I
DESCRIBE IN THE BOOK, THAT

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.120 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW, TALK OF REFORMATION
IN ISLAM HAS BEEN UNDER

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.088 align:start position:0%
WAY FOR A WHILE.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:33.159 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT
NOW IS YES, THERE IS A GREAT

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:38.197 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEAL OF VIOLENCE IN THE NAME
OF ISLAM BUT THERE IS AN

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.702 align:start position:0% line:91%
EMERGING AND INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT MINORITY OF REFORMERS

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.004 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHO ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES
TRYING TO GET THIS CHANGE DONE.

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:46.873 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I STAND WITH THEM. I HOPE
YOU STAND WITH THEM.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:52.044 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. WELL, NO, I MEAN,
I GUESS MY POINT IS, I THINK

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:55.181 size:81% position:41% line:91%
PEOPLE SINGLE OUT ISLAM AS
THOUGH THERE'S SOMETHING

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.149 align:start position:0% line:91%
INHERENTLY WRONG WITH
IT THAT WASN'T WRONG

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.251 align:start position:0%
WITH OTHER RELIGIONS.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.320 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND SO I GUESS MY POINT IS
IF CHRISTIANITY WENT THROUGH

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:04.790 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALMOST THE EXACT SAME
PROCESS, PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:07.927 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THEY KNEW BETTER AND WERE
PURER AND THAT CREATED

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.131 size:84% position:42% line:91%
VIOLENCE, AND SO WHY, I GET
THE SENSE THAT YOU THINK

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:15.001 align:start position:0% line:91%
ISLAM IS DIFFERENT THAN
OTHER RELIGIONS.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.537 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I'M SAYING THAT
CHRISTIANITY WENT THROUGH

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.140 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT PROCESS OF REFORMATION
AND ENLIGHTENMENT AND CAME TO A

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:24.143 align:start position:0% line:91%
FACE WHERE THE MASS OF
CHRISTIANS AT LEAST IN THE

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:25.178 align:start position:0% line:85%
WESTERN WORLD --

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.180 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.347 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HAVE ACCEPTED TOLERANCE IN
THE SECULAR STATE, THE

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.183 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE,
RESPECT FOR WOMEN,

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.484 align:start position:0% line:85%
RESPECT FOR GAYS.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:32.452 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT. WELL.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.953 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH WELL --
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND IN AFRICA I THINK

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:38.191 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE ARE STILL CENTRAL
AFRICAN REPUBLIC STILL HAS

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.992 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHRISTIAN --
&gt;&gt; CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN THE

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:42.595 align:start position:0% line:91%
NAME OF CATHOLICISM AND ARE
HOMOPHOBIC.

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:45.765 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES. AND ALSO BEHEAD
MUSLIMS AND DO CRAZY THINGS.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH. CENTRAL AFRICAN
REPUBLIC.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.301 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.202 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT THE MAJORITY OF
CHRISTIANS --

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.303 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.204 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF
MUSLIMS ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.772 align:start position:0%
VIOLENCE.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:56.642 line:91%
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW
70% OF THE GLOBAL VIOLENCE IN

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:57.276 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE WORLD TODAY--
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:58.878 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MUSLIMS ARE RESPONSIBLE.

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.313 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THE LARGEST NUMBER VICTIMS
FROM IT.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.581 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OR ARE SUFFERING FROM
IT.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:05.051 size:84% position:42% line:91%
BUT I GUESS MY POINT IS IT
SEEMS LIKE THE NARRATIVE IS

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.687 align:start position:0% line:91%
FROM SOME REFORMISTS THAT
THERE IS SOMETHING

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.257 size:81% position:41% line:91%
INHERENTLY WRONG WITH THIS
RELIGION THAT IS NOT WRONG

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.792 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH OTHER RELIGIONS.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:16.095 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT
I'M TRYING TO GET AT.

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:16.462 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, SO HERE'S THE KEY
POINT.

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:17.630 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:21.067 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE CHRISTIANS WITHIN
CHRISTIANITY WHO CAME OUT

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.202 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND SAID, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO
CHANGE THINGS.

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:25.238 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE NEED TO REFORM,
BASICALLY.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.272 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.240 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE NOW MUSLIMS
TODAY IN GROWING NUMBERS,

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.241 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT AS LARGE AS I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE --

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:30.910 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:33.879 line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT IN GROWING NUMBERS WE'RE
NOT POINTING THE FINGER TOWARDS

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:36.816 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THE JEWS OR CHRISTIANS OR
AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY OR

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.319 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SOME OTHER EXTERNAL FACTOR
BUT THEY'RE SAYING THERE IS

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:41.254 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOMETHING WRONG WITHIN OUR
RELIGION.

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:42.989 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:47.126 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT I'M TRING TO DO HERE
AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP WITH THIS

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.262 size:84% position:42% line:91%
RELIGION AND CAME OUT OF IT
AND VERY MUCH, YOU KNOW,

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:50.263 align:start position:0% line:91%
DRIVEN BY A DESIRE TO CHANGE IT.
OR TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.464 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:54.967 line:91%
&gt;&gt; OR TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE IN
THE CONVERSATION IS TO, OKAY,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.601 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET'S IDENTIFY IT.

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:56.869 size:84% position:42% line:85%
AND WHAT IS WRONG ABOUT IT.

00:03:56.902 --> 00:04:00.506 line:91%
YOU KNOW, WHAT IS IT WITH ISLAM
THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE AND THEN

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.341 align:start position:0% line:85%
I HAVE FIVE KEY POINTS.

00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:04.176 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT I GUESS WHAT I AM
SAYING IS THE REFORMATION

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.445 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS NOT PEOPLE WHO
WANTED TO MODERATE

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:08.748 size:84% position:42% line:91%
CHRISTIANITY, IT WAS PEOPLE
THAT WANTED IT PURER WHO

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:11.884 align:start position:0% line:91%
FELT THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
HAD BECOME CORRUPT.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.153 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE TWO, YEAH, SO THE TWO
RELIGIONS, CHRISTIANITY IS

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:15.387 align:start position:0% line:85%
DIFFERENT FROM ISLAM.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.324 line:91%
THE ONES IN ISLAM WHAT ARE YOU
KNOW ISLAMIC STATES RIGHT NOW IN

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:20.559 align:start position:0% line:91%
IRAQ AND SYRIA, GROUPS LIKE
THAT.

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:21.294 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT. THEY WANT A MORE
PURE FORM.

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:23.095 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THEY WANT -- 

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:23.762 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: AS THEY INTERPRET IT.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.298 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WELL, AND AS THEY APPLY IT.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.466 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: AS THEY APPLY IT.

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.301 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND AS THE QUR'AN SAYS AND
THE PROPHET MOHAMED LIVED IN

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.269 align:start position:0% line:91%
MEDINA.
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.703 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE TRYING TO EMULATE
HIM IN THAT TIME.

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:33.239 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT
THE QUR'AN IS ACTUALLY WRITTEN

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.942 line:91%
BY A MAN AND BY MEN, AND IT
IS TIME FOR THAT NARRATIVE TO

00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:38.477 line:85%
CHANGE. SO, I TOTALLY AGREE --

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING,
LIKE TO SAY THAT IF WE JUST

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:45.584 size:81% position:41% line:91%
CHANGE THE TEXT, DON'T WE
HAVE TO SOMEWHAT CHANGE --

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:47.386 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, WHAT I'M ARGUING
IS NOT TO CHANGE THE TEXT.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.087 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH. I SEE.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.188 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT I'M ARGUING FOR IS FOR 

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:52.191 size:88% position:44% line:91%
MUSLIMS TO ACCEPT THE FACT
THAT THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN BY

00:04:52.224 --> 00:04:54.093 align:start position:0% line:91%
A MAN A LONG TIME AGO AND
THAT MORALITY-- OF THE 7th --

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:58.364 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN
ACCEPTED IN CHRISTIANITY YET.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:04:59.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MORALITY IN THE 7TH CENTURY
DOESN'T APPLY TO THE 21st

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:00.566 align:start position:0% line:91%
CENTURY. AND THEY HAVE TO
GIVE THAT UP.

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.069 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S DIFFERENT. 

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:04.704 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I HONESTLY THINK THAT
MOST CHRISTIANS

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.706 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE ACCEPTED
THAT.

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.808 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT THE BIBLE WAS
WRITTEN BY MAN.

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:11.377 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT THE MORALITY OF GOD
KNOWS WHEN DOESN'T APPLY NOW.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.978 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S DIFFERENT.

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:14.046 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND MOST MUSLIMS ARE
STRUGGLING, ON THE ONE HAND

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:15.715 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THE GROUP I CALL THE MECCA
MUSLIMS, ON THE ONE HAND,

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:19.151 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO BE AS
TRUE TO THEIR RELIGION AS

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:22.054 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEY POSSIBLY CAN WHILE
