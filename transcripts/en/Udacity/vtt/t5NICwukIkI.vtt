It's interesting to note that most adults become parents. However, when they

00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:08.651
become parents seems to be particularly associated with personality. For

00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:11.957
example, one study found that shy men have children later in life than

00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:17.035
extroverted or outgoing men do. On the other hand, Shy women actually have

00:00:17.035 --> 00:00:22.100
children sooner than extroverted or outgoing women. Why do you think this is?
