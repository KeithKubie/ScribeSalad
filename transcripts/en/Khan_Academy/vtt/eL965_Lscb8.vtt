00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:02.014
- [Voiceover] Now that we've
spent a couple of videos

00:00:02.014 --> 00:00:05.195
exploring a scenario where I'm
taking multiple free throws

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:07.516
and figuring out the
probability of making K

00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:10.395
of the scores and six
attempts or in N attempts.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.054
Let's actually define a random variable

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:14.355
using this scenario and see if we can

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:16.635
construct it's probability distribution

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.756
and we'll actually see that
it's a binomial distribution.

00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:22.724
So, let's define the random variable X.

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:26.644
So, let's say that X
is equal to the number,

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:30.254
the number of made shots,

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:33.226
number of made free throws

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:36.884
when taking,

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:39.425
when taking six free throws.

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:41.339
So, it's how many of the six do you make?

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.859
And we're going to assume what we assumed

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.899
in the first video in this series of this,

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.700
these making free throws.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.757
So, we're gonna assume the seventy percent

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.433
free throw probability right over here.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:53.894
So, assuming assumptions,

00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:58.894
assuming seventy percent free throw,

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:01.894
free throw percentage.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:02.894
All right.

00:01:02.894 --> 00:01:04.272
So, let's figure out the probabilities

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.793
of the different values that
X could actually take on.

00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:10.175
So, let's see, what is the probability,

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:14.655
what is the probability
that X is equal to zero?

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:15.348
That even though you have a

00:01:15.348 --> 00:01:18.247
seventy percent free throw percentage

00:01:18.247 --> 00:01:19.801
that you make none of the shots

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:22.021
and actually you could
calculate this through

00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:24.356
probably some common
sense without using all

00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:25.999
of these fancy things but just

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.571
to make things consistent,
I'm gonna write it out.

00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:32.110
So, this is going to
be, this is going to be,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.110
it's going to be equal to six choose zero

00:01:37.353 --> 00:01:42.353
times zero point seven to the zeroth power

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.361
times zero point three to the sixth power,

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:52.891
and this right over here
is gonna end up being one.

00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.170
This over here's going
to end up being one.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.851
And so, you're just gonna be
left with zero point three

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:02.785
to the sixth power and I
calculated it ahead of time.

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:05.205
So, if we round to the nearest,

00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:08.624
if we do, if we round our
percentages to the nearest tenth,

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:11.125
this is going to give you approximately,

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:15.260
approximately, well, if we round
the decimal to the nearest,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.556
to the nearest thousandth you're gonna

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:19.778
get something like that
which is approximately

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:23.978
equal to zero point one percent chance

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:26.472
of you missing all of them.

00:02:26.472 --> 00:02:28.394
So, roughly I'm speaking, roughly here

00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:31.853
a one in a thousand,
one in a thousand chance

00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:35.034
of that happening, of
missing all six free throws.

00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:37.655
Now, let's keep going, this is fun.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:40.674
So, what is the probability that our

00:02:40.674 --> 00:02:43.074
random variable is equal to 1?

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:45.873
Well, this is going to be six choose one

00:02:45.873 --> 00:02:49.331
times zero point seven to the first power

00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:54.267
times zero point three to
the six minus first power.

00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:57.328
So, it's a fifth power.

00:02:57.328 --> 00:02:59.407
And I calculated this and this is

00:02:59.407 --> 00:03:02.967
approximately zero point zero one

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:05.462
or we could say one percent.

00:03:05.462 --> 00:03:06.715
So, it's still a fairly low probability.

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:08.635
Ten times more likely than this roughly

00:03:08.635 --> 00:03:11.173
but still a fairly low probability.

00:03:11.173 --> 00:03:12.416
Let's keep going.

00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:15.329
So, the probability
that x is equal to two,

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.950
well, that's what our first
video was essentially.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.789
So, this is going to be six choose two

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:26.789
times zero point seven squared times zero,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.441
zero point three to the fourth power,

00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:35.858
and we saw that this is
approximately going to be

00:03:35.858 --> 00:03:40.858
zero, zero point zero six,
or we could say six percent,

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:44.579
and obviously you could type
these things in a calculator

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.314
and get a much more precise answer

00:03:46.314 --> 00:03:48.713
but just for the sake
of just getting a sense

00:03:48.713 --> 00:03:50.416
of what these probabilities all look like,

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:52.450
that's why I'm giving
these rough estimates.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.970
Kind of, I guess you
could say, to the closest,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.423
maybe, tenth of a, tenth of a percent.

00:03:58.423 --> 00:04:00.343
And actually and if you
round to the closest tenth

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:01.623
of a percent you actually actually get

00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:06.024
to six point oh percent
and this is one point,

00:04:06.024 --> 00:04:08.541
one point oh percent 'cause
this we actually went

00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:10.480
to a tenth of a percent
here but let's keep going.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.854
We're obviously going to have
to do a few more of these.

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:16.769
So, let me just make sure
I have enough real estate.

00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:19.932
All right, so, the probability

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:22.538
that our random variable is equal to three

00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:24.834
is going to be six choosethree

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:27.191
and I'm sure you could probably
fill this out on your own

00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:28.712
but I'm going to do it.

00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:31.827
Zero point seven to the third power

00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:35.288
times zero point three
to the six minus three

00:04:35.288 --> 00:04:39.697
which is a third power which
is approximately equal to,

00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:43.902
well, it's going to be
zero point one eight five

00:04:43.902 --> 00:04:48.902
or eighteen point five,
eighteen point five percent.

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:52.654
So, yeah, that's definitely
within the realm of possibility.

00:04:52.654 --> 00:04:54.095
I mean, all of these are
in the realm of possibility

00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:58.218
but it's starting to be a
non-insignificant probability.

00:04:58.218 --> 00:05:00.596
So, now, let's do the probability

00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:03.479
that our random variable is equal to four.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.599
Well, it's going to be six choose four

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.042
times zero point seven to the fourth power

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.450
times zero point three
to the six minus four

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.250
or second power which is equal to,

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.285
this is going to get equal to

00:05:16.285 --> 00:05:18.586
or approximately, 'cause
I am, I am taking away

00:05:18.586 --> 00:05:19.491
a little bit of the precision when

00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:21.275
I write these things down.

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:26.275
Zero point three two four.

00:05:26.446 --> 00:05:31.295
So, approximately thirty two
point four percent chance

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:36.105
of making exactly four out
of the six free throws.

00:05:36.105 --> 00:05:37.786
All right, two more to go.

00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:40.324
Let's see, I have not used purple as yet.

00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:44.815
So, the probability that a
random variable is equal to five

00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:48.515
it's gonna be six choose five or zero,

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.531
at times I should say, zero
point seven to the fifth power

00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:55.894
times zero point three to the first power

00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:59.974
and that is going to be roughly,

00:05:59.974 --> 00:06:04.535
roughly zero point three zero three

00:06:04.535 --> 00:06:09.413
which is thirty point three percent.

00:06:09.413 --> 00:06:11.355
That's interesting, one more left.

00:06:11.355 --> 00:06:15.263
So, the probability
that I make all of them,

00:06:15.263 --> 00:06:18.333
of all six, is going to be equal to,

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:22.533
is equal to six choose six

00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:25.554
and zero point seven to the sixth power

00:06:25.554 --> 00:06:28.626
times zero point three to the zeroth power

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:30.933
which is, this right over
here is going to be one,

00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:32.275
this is going to be one, so it's really

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:36.333
just zero point seven to the
sixth, to the sixth power

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:41.333
and this is approximately
zero point one one eight.

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:44.194
I calculated that ahead of time,

00:06:44.194 --> 00:06:47.635
which is eleven point eight.

00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:49.870
Eleven point eight percent.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.523
And so, there's something
interesting that's going on here.

00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:53.402
The first time we looked
binomial distribution

00:06:53.402 --> 00:06:55.682
we said, "Hey, there's
a symmetry as we kind of

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:57.464
"got to some type of a peak and went down,

00:06:57.464 --> 00:06:58.984
"but I don't see that symmetry here."

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:00.824
And the reason you're not
seeing that symmetry is

00:07:00.824 --> 00:07:03.352
that you are more likely to
make a free throw than not.

00:07:03.352 --> 00:07:05.944
It was you have a seventy
percent free throw probability.

00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:08.593
This is no longer just
flipping a fair coin.

00:07:08.609 --> 00:07:11.691
Where you will see the symmetry
is in these coefficients.

00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:13.531
If you calculate these coefficients,

00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:16.272
six choose zero is one.

00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:18.713
Six choose six is one.

00:07:18.713 --> 00:07:22.750
You would see that six choose one is six

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.290
and six choose five is six.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.778
You'd see six choose two is fifteen

00:07:28.778 --> 00:07:32.538
and six choose four is also fifteen,

00:07:32.538 --> 00:07:35.587
and then six choose three is twenty.

00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:37.907
So, you definitely see, you definitely see

00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:39.427
the symmetry in the coefficients

00:07:39.427 --> 00:07:41.206
but then these things are weighted

00:07:41.206 --> 00:07:42.404
by the fact that you're more likely

00:07:42.404 --> 00:07:44.064
to make something than miss something.

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:45.602
If these were both point five

00:07:45.602 --> 00:07:49.065
then you would also see the
symmetry right over here.

00:07:49.065 --> 00:07:51.842
And you can plot this
to essentially visualize

00:07:51.842 --> 00:07:54.344
what the probability distribution

00:07:54.344 --> 00:07:55.981
looks like for this example

00:07:55.981 --> 00:07:57.519
and I encourage you to do that.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.238
To take these different cases,

00:07:59.238 --> 00:08:00.617
just like we did in that first example

00:08:00.617 --> 00:08:03.278
with the fair coin, and plot these.

00:08:03.278 --> 00:08:04.538
But this essentially does give you

00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:07.245
the probability distribution for,

00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:08.575
for the random variable in question.

00:08:08.575 --> 00:08:11.135
This is, I just wrote it out
instead of just visualizing it

00:08:11.135 --> 00:08:12.592
but it says, "Okay, well, what's the...

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:14.369
"These are the different values

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.128
"that this random variable can take on."

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.068
It can't, it can't take on negative one

00:08:18.068 --> 00:08:22.647
or it can't be fifteen point
five or pi or one million.

00:08:22.647 --> 00:08:25.446
These are the only seven values
that this random variable

00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:28.526
can take on and I've just
given you the probabilities,

00:08:28.526 --> 00:08:30.006
or I guess you could say
the rough probabilities

00:08:30.006 --> 00:08:32.327
of the random variable taking on

00:08:32.327 --> 00:08:37.202
each of those, each of those seven values.
