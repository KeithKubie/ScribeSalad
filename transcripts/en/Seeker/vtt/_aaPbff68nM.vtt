00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.670
The Sun’s just a boring old glowing ball
in the sky, right?

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.500
So wrong.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.360
Hello all, Amy here bringing you some sunlight
on DNews.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.280
Or at least, knowledge of it.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.369
Recently, NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory
took its 100 millionth observation of the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.699
Sun and to celebrate, the mission team released
a gallery of some of their favourite solar

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.289
images, and most of them don’t really look
like the Sun we’re used to seeing.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.289
Why is that?

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.689
So first off, it sort of goes without saying
that you should NEVER look directly at the

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.370
Sun because it will seriously damage your
eyes.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.300
Always use eclipse glasses or special filters
on a telescope or binoculars.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.090
So if someone were to ask you what colour
the Sun is, you would say yellow, right?

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.870
Well, the Sun looks yellow because of our
atmosphere.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.070
If you could look at the Sun in space, it
would be a white ball.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.079
But it doesn’t look like a boring old white
ball in these pictures from SDO you say?

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.350
That’s because SDO can see far more than
our eyes can.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.500
The spacecraft has three instruments: the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager measures

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.220
the ripples and the magnetic field on the
visible surface of the Sun; the Atmospheric

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.770
Imaging Assembly designed to measure the Sun’s
atmosphere; and the Extreme Ultraviolet Variablity

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.040
Experiment tracks the extreme ultraviolet
rays the Sun sends our way.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.580
Not only do all these instruments look for
different things, they look in different wavelengths

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.580
of light.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.060
We see in visible light, which is a tiny part
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.140
As lightwaves get longer you get into infrared
light, microwaves, and radio waves.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.920
On the long end, you get ultraviolet, x-rays,
and gamma rays.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.090
So each instrument on SDO sees in various
wavelengths.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.180
But that’s not all.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.180
Since it launched on February 11, 2010, SDO
has captured some incredible occurrences up

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.430
close and in varying wavelengths, like coronal
mass ejections which are massive bursts of

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.060
solar wind and magnetic fields rising above
the corona.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.280
And when you take all these observations and
put them together, adding the x-ray observations

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.729
of coronal activity with infrared and x-ray
data, you get these amazing, exciting pictures

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.100
that show just how dynamic our Sun really
is!

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.320
So, will you look (indirectly of course) at
the Sun differently now?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.539
