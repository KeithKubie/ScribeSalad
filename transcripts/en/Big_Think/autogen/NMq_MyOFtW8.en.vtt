involve the ingestion of the substance
and it's much newer it's a much more

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
and it's much newer it's a much more
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.869
and it's much newer it's a much more
recent phenomenon so substance addiction

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
recent phenomenon so substance addiction
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.610
recent phenomenon so substance addiction
has been around for a very long time by

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
has been around for a very long time by
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.139
has been around for a very long time by
some accounts for many thousands of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
some accounts for many thousands of
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.930
some accounts for many thousands of
years but their word behaviors around

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940
years but their word behaviors around
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.819
years but their word behaviors around
that were compelling enough to rise to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829
that were compelling enough to rise to
 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.110
that were compelling enough to rise to
the level of addiction until quite

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
the level of addiction until quite
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170
the level of addiction until quite
recently and the reason is that for them

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
recently and the reason is that for them
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.049
recently and the reason is that for them
to be addictive basically what has to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
to be addictive basically what has to
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.430
to be addictive basically what has to
happen is that there's a behavior that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
happen is that there's a behavior that
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.500
happen is that there's a behavior that
you enjoy doing in the short term that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
you enjoy doing in the short term that
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.970
you enjoy doing in the short term that
you do compulsively so you keep

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
you do compulsively so you keep
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.189
you do compulsively so you keep
returning to it over and over again but

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
returning to it over and over again but
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.540
returning to it over and over again but
that in the long term harms your

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
that in the long term harms your
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520
that in the long term harms your
well-being and it can again harm your

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
well-being and it can again harm your
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.250
well-being and it can again harm your
well-being in lots of different respects

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260
well-being in lots of different respects
 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.010
well-being in lots of different respects
social financial physical psychological

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
social financial physical psychological
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.469
social financial physical psychological
and I think the reason why we've got

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
and I think the reason why we've got
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.510
and I think the reason why we've got
these new forms of addiction there are

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
these new forms of addiction there are
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.310
these new forms of addiction there are
two main reasons the first one is that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
two main reasons the first one is that
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.289
two main reasons the first one is that
technology is much more sophisticated

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
technology is much more sophisticated
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.149
technology is much more sophisticated
and advanced than it was even 20 years

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
and advanced than it was even 20 years
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.399
and advanced than it was even 20 years
ago you're able to deliver the kinds of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
ago you're able to deliver the kinds of
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.859
ago you're able to deliver the kinds of
rewards that you need for a system to be

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
rewards that you need for a system to be
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080
rewards that you need for a system to be
addictive so basically what people are

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
addictive so basically what people are
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.520
addictive so basically what people are
looking for is unpredictability and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
looking for is unpredictability and
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.310
looking for is unpredictability and
rapid feedback of either rewards or if

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
rapid feedback of either rewards or if
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620
rapid feedback of either rewards or if
it's negatives then negative experiences

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
it's negatives then negative experiences
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.359
it's negatives then negative experiences
and you actually need that mix of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
and you actually need that mix of
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429
and you actually need that mix of
positive and negative feedback just as

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
positive and negative feedback just as
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.840
positive and negative feedback just as
for example when you post something

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
for example when you post something
 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.880
for example when you post something
online sometimes you're going to get a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
online sometimes you're going to get a
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.679
online sometimes you're going to get a
lot of hits sometimes you aren't and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
lot of hits sometimes you aren't and
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.139
lot of hits sometimes you aren't and
it's that unpredictability that we find

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
it's that unpredictability that we find
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.910
it's that unpredictability that we find
so compelling you need to be able to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
so compelling you need to be able to
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590
so compelling you need to be able to
deliver those rewards really rapidly and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
deliver those rewards really rapidly and
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.660
deliver those rewards really rapidly and
for that you need the internet with the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
for that you need the internet with the
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.100
for that you need the internet with the
right kind of bandwidth to be able to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
right kind of bandwidth to be able to
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.929
right kind of bandwidth to be able to
deliver those rewards the other thing

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
deliver those rewards the other thing
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.789
deliver those rewards the other thing
that I think has happened is that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
that I think has happened is that
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.709
that I think has happened is that
companies are much savvy about this

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
companies are much savvy about this
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719
companies are much savvy about this
they're employing behavioral experts to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
they're employing behavioral experts to
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.609
they're employing behavioral experts to
tell them how to design their media how

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
tell them how to design their media how
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.080
tell them how to design their media how
to design the vehicles that deliver

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
to design the vehicles that deliver
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.779
those media smart phones iPads
smartwatches things like that and for

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
smartwatches things like that and for
 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.940
smartwatches things like that and for
that reason I think they are delivering

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
that reason I think they are delivering
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.200
that reason I think they are delivering
products to us that are

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210
products to us that are
 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.580
products to us that are
harder for us to resist they've got

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590
harder for us to resist they've got
 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.280
harder for us to resist they've got
enough features built-in that we find to

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
enough features built-in that we find to
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.930
enough features built-in that we find to
be pretty hard to resist that we end up

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940
be pretty hard to resist that we end up
 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.940
be pretty hard to resist that we end up
developing addictions to them and by

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950
developing addictions to them and by
 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.950
developing addictions to them and by
some counts that applies to about half

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960
some counts that applies to about half
 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.540
some counts that applies to about half
of the population of the developed world

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550
of the population of the developed world
 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.460
of the population of the developed world
it turns out that it's not the addiction

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470
it turns out that it's not the addiction
 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.930
it turns out that it's not the addiction
to the device itself it's that the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
to the device itself it's that the
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.610
to the device itself it's that the
device is just an incredibly effective

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620
device is just an incredibly effective
 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.070
device is just an incredibly effective
way of delivering addictive content so

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080
way of delivering addictive content so
 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.690
way of delivering addictive content so
when you're addicted to a screen it's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700
when you're addicted to a screen it's
 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.250
when you're addicted to a screen it's
not that the screen itself is something

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260
not that the screen itself is something
 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.750
not that the screen itself is something
that you can't get enough of it's what

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760
that you can't get enough of it's what

that you can't get enough of it's what
it's providing I think one of the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530
it's providing I think one of the
 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.470
it's providing I think one of the
reasons why we're so addicted to screens

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480
reasons why we're so addicted to screens
 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.930
reasons why we're so addicted to screens

they go with us wherever we go and

they go with us wherever we go and
that's relatively new so if you play

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690
that's relatively new so if you play
 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.690
that's relatively new so if you play
video games in the 80s or 90s or even

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700
video games in the 80s or 90s or even
 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.480
video games in the 80s or 90s or even
the early 2000s they didn't really go

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490
the early 2000s they didn't really go
 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.490
the early 2000s they didn't really go
wherever you went as much as they do now

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500
wherever you went as much as they do now
 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.230
wherever you went as much as they do now
especially those games that were tied to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240
especially those games that were tied to
 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.860
especially those games that were tied to
the Internet

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870
the Internet
 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.350
the Internet
those were tied to your PC you play

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360
those were tied to your PC you play
 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.760
those were tied to your PC you play
where you were and you didn't really

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770
where you were and you didn't really
 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.830
where you were and you didn't really
leave with them as much you had some

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840
leave with them as much you had some
 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.780
leave with them as much you had some
portable devices but those were much

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790
portable devices but those were much
 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.150
portable devices but those were much
more primitive today with iPhones you
