00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
The exotic pet trade makes for great
Instagramming. But people with weird pets

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.040
are seriously messing up the environment
and costing us millions of dollars in

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.370
the process.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.360
Hello, everyone, I'm Trace (as you may know)
and today we have a special guest from

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.369
Shed Science, Sally Le Page. Hi, Sally. Hello, thanks for having me.
Welcome. Every year pet owners are

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.150
faced with the dilemma of what to do
with unwanted companions. In Boulder,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.630
Colorado, a handful of goldfish were
released into a local lake and now there

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.070
are thousands of them.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.610
Goldfish are actually carp, like the
well-known coy carp. They're native to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.239
Japan

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.590
so they've got no natural predators here
in the US. They could be carrying viruses

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.620
and if they escape lakes and head
downstream they could out-compete native

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.190
fish, some of which are already
threatened. You may think of him as cute

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.329
little Mr Bubbles.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.070
What harm could he possibly do? But removing
these species costs the government a lot

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.870
of money and time, and it's not just our
goldfish. In 1890, a fan of William

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.949
Shakespeare named Eugene Shefflin wanted
to bring the birds from Shakespeare's

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.390
works into his home of New York. He
released a hundred starlings that are

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.220
native to Europe, Asia, Africa, and
Australia into Central Park. And by 1928,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.980
those 100 beds had bred so much that
the population reached the Mississippi

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.480
River. By 1942, they had spread all the
way to California, forming flocks of as

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.680
many as a million hungry birds driving
off native species like bluebirds and

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.380
woodpeckers. And today there are an
estimated 200 million starlings flying

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.310
around North America, costing eight
hundred million dollars in damage to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.090
agriculture every year and unknown
millions in damage to the airline

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.470
industry through bird strikes. They even
caused a plane crash in 1960.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.250
It's not just the waterways and skies
harboring introduced species.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.660
Oh, no, no, no. There are two states which
bear the brunt of these animals:

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.010
Florida and Hawaii. In a 20-year Florida
study, they found 56 different non-native

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.910
species completely established in
America's favorite little dangly state.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.130
Pythons are a well-known invader

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.990
but what about the newest reptilian
invader: the Argentine tegu? This

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.950
black-and-white lizard is just starting
to breed and spread into parts of the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.550
state.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.170
How did it get there? Exotic pet release.
Their study found eighty-four percent of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.510
all introduced species in Florida came
from exotic pets.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.159
Tegus grow up to four feet in length and
lay 35 eggs a year. Once established, they'll

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.360
compete with feral cats and dogs, as well
as native animals like raccoons.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.799
Florida is also home to wild hogs. Not
that better-than-expected John Travolta

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.200
movie. No. Literally, wild pigs. Yeah.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.670
The hogs were introduced in the 1500's by
the Spanish. But Europeans have their

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.640
invaders, too, like the red-eared slider or
Terrapin.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.000
It's from the Mississippi Valley but
it's been found as far away as Europe and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.739
Asia. The red-eared slider females are
larger than most native turtles, so they can

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.690
out-eat, out-mate, and out-breed. And
apparently most male native turtles like

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.090
the larger ladies. And indeed

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.930
who wouldn't? You see, bigger females make
more eggs, so of course they're more

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.799
attractive to the males. As years go by,
more and more non-native species get

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.590
spread around, even trees. The Norway
maple, a beautiful tree, grows so fast and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.909
has such dense shade it displaces native
trees, shrubs, and herbs, as well as

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.440
flowers, which affects the native forest
life. And trees are essential for some

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.699
species of forest life, and the Norway
maple out-competes native maples for

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.299
resources, causing the native tree
populations to die and affecting the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.160
animals that live in and around them.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.629
Just don't plant them. But if you aren't
into cutting down beautiful maple trees,

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.169
even if they are invasive, you could help
by getting an environmentally friendly

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:37.769
car.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.919
The new Toyota Mirai is looking to the
future with sustainability in mind,

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.389
fueled by hydrogen and leaving
zero-emissions behind. Now that California

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.180
and other southwestern regions are
beginning to react to this massive

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.359
drought, chances are we'll see more
native plants and landscaping that

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.440
require less water and are more suited
to our habitat. That's probably good.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.919
There are solutions to the drought, but
desalination isn't going to do it.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.579
For more on that, check out Julian's
video here. "It can only make ten percent

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.030
of the county's needs and it'll use a
lot of energy because it's forcing

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.810
pressurized water through a membrane to
separate the water from the salt in a

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.049
process called reverse osmosis." And thank
you for watching.

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.949
