Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Do you have guys trash talk you like you're pretty easy going guy. Easy going. It's nothing to my face. It's always subtle. If, if I ever hear about anybody saying something, it's just through word of mouth and I'm just like, yeah, well, but you never had like a Conor McGregor type incident were only only in the beginning with Paul Craig. But I think it was just, it was just like his thing. We've like, we smashed that beef, you know? Yeah. But what do you think about trash talking in this day and age? Because in many ways it looked, Connor's an amazing fighter and his fighting skills, what's made him such an international superstar, but he also talks some mad shit and that helped him too because he was so good at it. It was funny. He would say funny, mean insulting Shit. It was fucking great.

Speaker 1:          00:51          100% yeah. But I think what people forget, Joe, is that like, that's always been Connor, even when you go and, and, and, and look at the, the, the interviews from before he was a in the UFC and he was just like, I'm going to make a bunch of money and I'm going to be all this. And so like he created that for himself and yeah, he made a bunch of money from talking trash because he always had a plan that that's was, that's what he was going to do. Yeah. And so I think people try to hop on it just to sell tickets or get money and sometimes it works, it gets people wanting to watch and it gets your name up and stuff like that. But that's not the time. But name I want to make for myself. Like I don't like people talking trash to me. So I'm not really gonna talk trash to anybody unless there's something that's really personal. But if I don't know you and I don't care about you, then I don't really consider it. Like why would I talk trash? I don't even care about you.

Speaker 1:          01:46          It's a waste of energy. It's a waste of their, like I got so much other stuff to care about her on. Yeah, it's, well, it's a very healthy look man. I mean the way you, you're seeing like that you said healthy, like I like to maintain a healthy heart and mind as much as possible students. Damn man. Like mental health is a real thing, you know what I mean? And especially like, especially just having certain obligations and and just using social media and having people reach out and they say like, oh ignore this, ignore that. But it's like, man, it's like, it's hard to just ignore certain things, you know, like you still see things then. So just that and condition of the world and just everything man, being in multiple different countries and here in this news and that news and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like for a person who like, who wants to care about the world, they're just genuinely cares like a lock and go on in my mind. So I'm just like, ah, I don't even want that in my heart now. I'm just going to do my best to kind of keep my own peace and, uh, come fight time. I let it loose.
