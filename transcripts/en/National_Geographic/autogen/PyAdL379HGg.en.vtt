the same soil type that you'll find down

the same soil type that you'll find down
in the valleys so the soil is very

in the valleys so the soil is very
 

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.050

right of us was burnt last year so those

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.140
right of us was burnt last year so those
 

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.010
right of us was burnt last year so those
enormous fires put through here and that

grass from the fire that raged through
 

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.230
grass from the fire that raged through
here and that's how the trees also

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240
here and that's how the trees also
 

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.090
here and that's how the trees also
protect some of these little rocky areas

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100
protect some of these little rocky areas
 

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.940
protect some of these little rocky areas
because the fire is often sort of kept

valley there was burnt last year and we
 

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.030
valley there was burnt last year and we
had so many of all the best in this area

had so many of all the best in this area
 

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.580

little bit more down on the valley and
 

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.410
little bit more down on the valley and
we don't get these signals so we're

we don't get these signals so we're

did scan all around they're probably
 

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.430
did scan all around they're probably
hidden in flat in the grass or maybe

starting to kind of wilt and you'll see
 

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.770
starting to kind of wilt and you'll see
that they're all changing color now it

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:20.780
that they're all changing color now it
 

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.210

it does in the northern hemisphere when
 

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.740
it does in the northern hemisphere when
you get those whole deciduous forests

just at the bottom of that Cambria tomb
there we go you can see that there's

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:54.530
there we go you can see that there's
 

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:57.330
there we go you can see that there's
still some green leaves and then it goes

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:57.340
still some green leaves and then it goes
 

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:01.450
still some green leaves and then it goes
yellow and then red towards the bottom

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:01.460
yellow and then red towards the bottom
 

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.310
yellow and then red towards the bottom
of your screen there you can see a few

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:03.320
of your screen there you can see a few
 

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.500
of your screen there you can see a few
of the redder leaves and then it gets

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:05.510
of the redder leaves and then it gets
 

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.289
of the redder leaves and then it gets
black of course

00:47:07.289 --> 00:47:07.299
black of course
 

00:47:07.299 --> 00:47:11.189
black of course
as it falls so you can see that the

00:47:11.189 --> 00:47:11.199
as it falls so you can see that the
 

00:47:11.199 --> 00:47:15.259
as it falls so you can see that the
seasons are most definitely changing and

00:47:15.259 --> 00:47:15.269
seasons are most definitely changing and
 

00:47:15.269 --> 00:47:17.039
seasons are most definitely changing and
you'll see it a lot with the

00:47:17.039 --> 00:47:17.049
you'll see it a lot with the
 

00:47:17.049 --> 00:47:18.959
you'll see it a lot with the
completeness as the color changes it's a

00:47:18.959 --> 00:47:18.969
completeness as the color changes it's a
 

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:21.479
completeness as the color changes it's a
really pretty warm color and as I'll see

00:47:21.479 --> 00:47:21.489
really pretty warm color and as I'll see
 

00:47:21.489 --> 00:47:24.239
really pretty warm color and as I'll see
also some marula trees that have been

00:47:24.239 --> 00:47:24.249
also some marula trees that have been
 

00:47:24.249 --> 00:47:26.069
also some marula trees that have been
changing a pretty color as well if I

00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079
changing a pretty color as well if I
 

00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:27.929
changing a pretty color as well if I
find one of them I'll show it to you now

00:47:27.929 --> 00:47:27.939
find one of them I'll show it to you now
 

00:47:27.939 --> 00:47:29.249
find one of them I'll show it to you now
it's really interesting how that color

00:47:29.249 --> 00:47:29.259
it's really interesting how that color
 

00:47:29.259 --> 00:47:31.620
it's really interesting how that color
works so you know that chloro plot a

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:31.630
works so you know that chloro plot a
 

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:33.769
works so you know that chloro plot a
chlorophyll fold with chloroplasts

00:47:33.769 --> 00:47:33.779
chlorophyll fold with chloroplasts
 

00:47:33.779 --> 00:47:38.639
chlorophyll fold with chloroplasts
create this green that we see in plants

00:47:38.639 --> 00:47:38.649
create this green that we see in plants
 

00:47:38.649 --> 00:47:40.349
create this green that we see in plants
and what happens is when this resources

00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:40.359
and what happens is when this resources
 

00:47:40.359 --> 00:47:42.989
and what happens is when this resources
gets kissed it gets colder drier less

00:47:42.989 --> 00:47:42.999
gets kissed it gets colder drier less
 

00:47:42.999 --> 00:47:46.679
gets kissed it gets colder drier less
nutrients around it stops nutrients

going to certain leaves because now it's

00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599
going to certain leaves because now it's
 

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:53.999
going to certain leaves because now it's
saving all its its energy and by doing

00:47:53.999 --> 00:47:54.009
saving all its its energy and by doing

that chlorophyll no longer gets

00:47:57.649 --> 00:47:57.659
that chlorophyll no longer gets
 

00:47:57.659 --> 00:48:00.899
that chlorophyll no longer gets
maintained in those leaves and so what

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:00.909
maintained in those leaves and so what
 

00:48:00.909 --> 00:48:03.089
maintained in those leaves and so what
happens is the other pigments that are

00:48:03.089 --> 00:48:03.099
happens is the other pigments that are
 

00:48:03.099 --> 00:48:06.269
happens is the other pigments that are
in the leaves get a chance now to be

00:48:06.269 --> 00:48:06.279
in the leaves get a chance now to be
 

00:48:06.279 --> 00:48:08.279
in the leaves get a chance now to be
seen so that's what happens when we see

00:48:08.279 --> 00:48:08.289
seen so that's what happens when we see
 

00:48:08.289 --> 00:48:11.909
seen so that's what happens when we see
the reds and yellows of trees that are

00:48:11.909 --> 00:48:11.919
the reds and yellows of trees that are

the reds and yellows of trees that are
changing with the seasons is actually

00:48:15.269 --> 00:48:15.279
changing with the seasons is actually
 

00:48:15.279 --> 00:48:17.459

the green pigments been stripped away
 

00:48:17.469 --> 00:48:19.259
the green pigments been stripped away
and now we can see the other pigments in

00:48:19.259 --> 00:48:19.269
and now we can see the other pigments in
 

00:48:19.269 --> 00:48:21.089
and now we can see the other pigments in
the leaves which i think is quite

00:48:21.089 --> 00:48:21.099

from of dryness it's a result first of
 

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:39.240
from of dryness it's a result first of
those pigments being taken away

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.240
I suspect there may be others around but
not very very close I haven't seen too

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:20.250
not very very close I haven't seen too
 

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:22.760
not very very close I haven't seen too
many elephant tracks around either so I

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:22.770
many elephant tracks around either so I
 

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:24.020
many elephant tracks around either so I
was actually surprised when I stumbled

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:24.030
was actually surprised when I stumbled
 

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:35.070
was actually surprised when I stumbled
upon these three

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:35.080
 
 

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.020
 
they're lovely I hope I'll be able to

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:37.030
they're lovely I hope I'll be able to
 

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.300
they're lovely I hope I'll be able to
catch up with the rest with the rest of

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:39.310
catch up with the rest with the rest of
 

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:41.190
catch up with the rest with the rest of
the head if there are more around I

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200
the head if there are more around I
 

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.590
the head if there are more around I
really hope they are anyway let me keep

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:43.600
really hope they are anyway let me keep
 

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.800
really hope they are anyway let me keep
on going I've done my Border Patrol here

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:46.810
on going I've done my Border Patrol here
 

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:48.270
on going I've done my Border Patrol here
a little bit in the meantime let me send

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280
a little bit in the meantime let me send
 

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.510
a little bit in the meantime let me send
you over to Tristan while I keep looking

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520
 
 

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.880
 
rut so we saw with dinger while we

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:56.890
rut so we saw with dinger while we
 

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:58.950
rut so we saw with dinger while we
rejoined Tigana but he's heading to

01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960
rejoined Tigana but he's heading to
 

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.040
rejoined Tigana but he's heading to
where we were looking just now and

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.050
where we were looking just now and
 

01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:03.600
where we were looking just now and
apparently some of you say that there

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:03.610
apparently some of you say that there
 

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:05.190
apparently some of you say that there
was a leopard on a frame that we had

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200
was a leopard on a frame that we had
 

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.560
was a leopard on a frame that we had
just now of that fallen over log and so

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:09.570
just now of that fallen over log and so
 

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.510
just now of that fallen over log and so
he's kind of staring in that direction I

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520
he's kind of staring in that direction I
 

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.450
he's kind of staring in that direction I
had I honestly did not see a leopard and

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:15.460
had I honestly did not see a leopard and
 

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.920
had I honestly did not see a leopard and
neither did sensor which she's got the

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:16.930
neither did sensor which she's got the
 

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:18.690
neither did sensor which she's got the
sharpest eyes of all of us but maybe it

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:18.700
sharpest eyes of all of us but maybe it
 

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.160
sharpest eyes of all of us but maybe it
was just hidden me and I just missed it

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.170
was just hidden me and I just missed it
 

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.140
was just hidden me and I just missed it
completely which is going to be

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:22.150
completely which is going to be
 

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:23.970
completely which is going to be
surprising but the waiting on is

01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:23.980
surprising but the waiting on is
 

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.410
surprising but the waiting on is
behaving it's possible that they could

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:25.420
behaving it's possible that they could
 

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.620
behaving it's possible that they could
be another leopard here given that there

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:28.630
be another leopard here given that there
 

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:31.890
be another leopard here given that there
was the way he's been sniffing and he's

01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:31.900
was the way he's been sniffing and he's
 

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:33.740
was the way he's been sniffing and he's
just stopped and stayed and he's hitting

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:33.750
just stopped and stayed and he's hitting
 

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.360
just stopped and stayed and he's hitting
exactly exactly the way we were framed

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:36.370
exactly exactly the way we were framed
 

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:38.190
exactly exactly the way we were framed
up on that log just now when I was

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200
up on that log just now when I was
 

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.690
up on that log just now when I was
showing you that tandy has another day

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:39.700
showing you that tandy has another day
 

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.250
showing you that tandy has another day
it will has had another den before and

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:41.260
it will has had another den before and
 

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:45.930
it will has had another den before and
so let's see how we go and see whether

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:45.940
so let's see how we go and see whether
 

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:49.470
so let's see how we go and see whether
or not we get lucky here maybe there is

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480
or not we get lucky here maybe there is
 

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.780
or not we get lucky here maybe there is
another leopard if it is another leopard

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:53.790
 
 

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:59.760

think my ear is about to bleed with the

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:01.750
think my ear is about to bleed with the
 

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:03.000
think my ear is about to bleed with the
amount of talking I've had to deal with

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:03.010
amount of talking I've had to deal with
 

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:05.700
amount of talking I've had to deal with
today go hey James not James's fault

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:05.710
today go hey James not James's fault
 

01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:07.140
today go hey James not James's fault
James's first time I've heard him on the

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:07.150
James's first time I've heard him on the
 

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.880
James's first time I've heard him on the
radio so we don't blame James with this

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:08.890

shouting and carrying on and there's

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:13.210
shouting and carrying on and there's
 

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.120
shouting and carrying on and there's
been no decorum today and there needs to

been no decorum today and there needs to
 

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.070
been no decorum today and there needs to
be some lessons taught I think so I'm

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:28.930
 
all right so the log that I framed just

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:28.940
all right so the log that I framed just
 

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.330
all right so the log that I framed just
now that's you guys are saying there was

he is no he's heading straight to that
 

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:31.660
he is no he's heading straight to that
log since let's just go forward a little

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:31.670
log since let's just go forward a little
 

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:34.280
log since let's just go forward a little
bit

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:34.290
 
 

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:38.030
 
she is hitting across I don't see a

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:38.040
she is hitting across I don't see a
 

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.920
she is hitting across I don't see a
lipids but maybe I'm wrong

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:44.930
 
 

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:48.160
 
he's walked right past it and he hasn't

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:48.170
he's walked right past it and he hasn't
 

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:49.570
he's walked right past it and he hasn't
interacted with anyone I don't see

01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:49.580
interacted with anyone I don't see
 

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:56.590

another leopard coming Art's

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:56.600
 
 

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.750
 
so Lu says she can't see anything in the

01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760
so Lu says she can't see anything in the
 

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.130
so Lu says she can't see anything in the
shots but that's the log apparently

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:00.140
shots but that's the log apparently
 

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.740
shots but that's the log apparently
there was another lipid at that log I

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:01.750
there was another lipid at that log I
 

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:10.270
there was another lipid at that log I
honestly did not see anything but but

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:10.280
honestly did not see anything but but
 

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.410
honestly did not see anything but but
it's possible I suppose

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:11.420
it's possible I suppose
 

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:15.070
it's possible I suppose
I just wanna lose ting Ghana I'm gonna

just go up and around back to where we

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.000
just go up and around back to where we
 

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.850
just go up and around back to where we
were when we had that first shot and try

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:21.860
were when we had that first shot and try
 

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.430
were when we had that first shot and try
and see if we can

01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440
and see if we can
 

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.560
and see if we can
get some sort of view of what's going on

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:27.570
get some sort of view of what's going on
 

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:28.900
