00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.210
- [Instructor] Mr. Jadav raised
all of his students' scores

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.030
on a recent exam by 10 points.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.060
What effect did this have on the mean

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.310
and median of the scores?

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.960
Now there's two ways
we could approach this.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.280
One is we could come up
with a simple example

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.730
that meets the constraints,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.720
a plausible combination of scores,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.790
and then see what is going to be true,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.490
which of these statements get contradicted

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.950
or don't get contradicted.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.900
That's one technique,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.090
and that might actually be a simpler one

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.890
if you're under time pressure
in something like the SAT.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.760
And another technique is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.330
to do it a little bit more rigorously.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.240
So let's do the simple way first.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.430
So when you say, okay,
you know, his students,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.580
you imagine a classroom
with 20 or 30 students,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.110
but they don't say it's 20 or 30 students.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.520
You could imagine that it
could be three students.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.380
And if it could be three students,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.140
then these statements need to be true for

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.040
any of the plausible
combinations of scores.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.240
So let's just think a simple one.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.826
Let's just imagine that the
three students all got 80s.

00:00:52.826 --> 00:00:55.020
And I just randomly picked those numbers

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.240
because it's very easy to calculate

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.070
both the median and the mean here.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.380
The mean here is 80,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.820
and the middle score here,
the median, is also 80.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.470
So both median,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.380
median

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.740
is equal to 80 here,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.953
and the mean is equal to 80.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.620
Now, if you add a 10 to all of these,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.930
if you add a 10 to all of these,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.420
then it becomes a 90, a 90, and a 90.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.150
And then your median and mean

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.410
are both going to become 90.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.400
Median is going to be equal to the mean,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.630
which is going to be equal to 90.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.140
So at least for this
case, which is plausible,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.360
it's not necessarily the case
that they're talking about,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.200
but, for this case, when
you increased by 10,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.750
but when you increased
all the scores by 10,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.400
both the median and the
mean increased by 10.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.380
Now let's see what these statements say.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.220
The mean increased by 10 points

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.640
but the median remained the same.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.373
Well, this combination, we
just said this was plausible.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.670
This could've been Mr.
Jadav's students' test scores,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.120
but it contradicts the statement.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.700
The median didn't remain the same

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.370
in this case right over here,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.980
so we could cross that out.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.720
The median increased by 10 points,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.380
but the mean remained the same.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.410
Well, once again, this little
case that we came up with,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.150
it's plausible that that was
the scores of his students,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.430
but it contradicts the statement.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.950
So the statement is
definitely not true for all

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.560
the possible combinations of
his students' test scores.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.900
The mean increased by 10 points,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.840
and the median increased by 10 points.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.040
Now, this combination we picked,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.990
this particular case we picked,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.680
this doesn't prove that this
is always going to be true,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.240
but at least it doesn't contradict it.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.730
So we can't cross it out just yet.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.440
The mean and the median remained the same.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.210
Well, we were able to
come up with this case,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.210
which is plausible, this could've
been his students' scores,

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.380
and it contradicts this.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.260
In order for us to be able
to select a statement,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.550
we have to feel good that it would be true

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.970
for any combination of
scores that his students had.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.470
So we could cross that out as well.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.040
So if I'm under time
pressure, I'm taking the SAT,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.540
I would definitely do this
choice and then move on.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.820
Now I'm sure a lot of you
probably want a little bit more

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.330
of a rigorous proof that we can say any,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.230
for any combination of scores,

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.080
the mean would increase by 10 points

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.320
and the median would
increase by 10 points.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.110
And for that, we could do a
little bit of a justification,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.640
borderline proof right over here.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.100
So let's just imagine
this is the score one,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.980
and then this right over
here is the median score.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.440
And then we keep going,
and this is the nth.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.920
That is the nth score right over there.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.210
Now if we added 10 to everything,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.950
the order isn't gonna change.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.270
So all of these scores, these n scores,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.740
are just gonna go up by 10.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.460
So this is going to be S one plus 10.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.460
And then you're gonna have S two plus 10.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.116
And then you're gonna have
your former median plus 10.

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:50.150
But now this thing's
going be the middle value,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.140
and then you're going to
have your highest value.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.140
I'm assuming that I ordered
these from lowest to highest.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.510
And then you're going to have
your highest score plus 10.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.890
So if all of the scores go
up by 10, whatever was the,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.000
kind of that median, that's
still gonna be in the middle,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.560
but now it's gonna be 10 higher.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.100
So your new median is
going to be 10 higher.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.890
So hopefully this justification shows you

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.630
that for whatever combination of scores,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.730
if you order 'em in this way,
and you need to order 'em

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.600
to figure out the middle
value, the median value,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.410
that the median indeed would go up by 10.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.830
I also feel good that the
mean would go up by 10.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.430
So how would you calculate the mean?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.940
So the mean is going to be the first score

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.040
plus the second score, all
the way to the nth score,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.440
and you're going to divide it by n.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.070
That is what, that is going
to be equal to the mean.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.490
Now, if you added 10 to all of these,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.010
if it was S one plus 10

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.160
and plus S two plus 10,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.890
and we went all the way

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.320
to Sn plus 10

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.130
divided by n,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.800
well, what's that gonna be?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.160
What's that gonna be?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.350
Well, if we take all the 10s
out, we're adding 10 n times,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.320
so we could rewrite
this as S one plus S two

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.153
plus Sn.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.010
And then we have 10 plus 10 n times.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.630
So we could write plus 10 n.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.090
And then divide that whole thing,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.720
divide that whole thing by n.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.800
I just rewrote this.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.260
I just, instead of adding the 10 n times,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.880
I just wrote 10 times n, or n times 10.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.040
Well, this right over here,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.580
I can instead write this like this.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.270
This is going to be that divided by n

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.570
plus that divided by n.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.920
And what is this value right over here?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.430
This is your mean,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.900
your old mean.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.510
And 10 n divided by n,
well, it's gonna be plus 10.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.990
So your new mean is gonna
be the old mean plus 10.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.960
So hopefully that gives you justification,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.890
not just using a special case to rule out,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.000
that contradicts these other cases,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.540
but a justification why this would be true

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.600
for all combinations of scores.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.363
We could feel very good about this.
