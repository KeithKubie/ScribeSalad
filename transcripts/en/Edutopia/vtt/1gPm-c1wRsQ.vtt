00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:03.066
&gt;&gt;My grad students were
interviewing high-school-aged students

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.526
around the world.

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:08.176
In almost every case, what we
heard was young people had a richer

00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:11.066
intellectual and creative life
outside of school than inside it,

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:13.256
that the things they learned
from and the things they cared

00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:15.946
about were things they did
after the school day was over.

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:29.266
&gt;&gt;Participatory culture describes a
world where everyone participates,

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:33.976
where we take media in our own hands,
where we have the capacity, often,

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:35.676
to produce media, share media.

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:40.546
I trace participatory culture back
to the middle of the 19th century

00:00:40.546 --> 00:00:42.866
when there was a Tory
printing-press movement

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:46.656
and high-school-aged kids
were producing publications,

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:50.806
hand-laying type down and sending
them across a national network.

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:55.126
So the Amateur Press Association
in the 19th century paved the way

00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:59.456
for science-fiction fandom in
the 20th century, for radio,

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:04.106
amateur radio and ham radio,
down through the zine movements

00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:08.936
around Riot Grrrls and punk rock,
the indie movement around Seattle

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:12.686
and the World Trade Organization,
down to the rise of digital media.

00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:18.936
&gt;&gt;So there's a whole trajectory of
examples where communities begin

00:01:18.936 --> 00:01:23.756
to produce media to share ideas among
themselves and where they follow some

00:01:23.756 --> 00:01:26.296
of the practices we might
associate with a folk culture.

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:32.146
&gt;&gt;In a folk culture, media is
produced not to make money.

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:34.606
People produce media to
share it with each other.

00:01:34.606 --> 00:01:37.436
When someone makes a quilt, as
my grandmother used to make,

00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:39.156
people gathered together.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.646
There's no expert.

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:42.646
There are people who are
learning from each other.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:45.906
Skills get passed from
someone who knows a little more

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:47.126
to someone who knows a little less.

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:49.196
It's a social mode of production.

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:51.836
It's a gift, typically,
that the quilt is given.

00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:54.356
Until fairly recently,
it was not sold.

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:56.976
It was passed on to a
member of the community

00:01:56.976 --> 00:01:59.886
as the community acknowledged
a ritual in their life.

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:02.016
&gt;&gt;When we think about
media on the Internet,

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:03.766
it does many of those things, right?

00:02:03.816 --> 00:02:06.056
The fan communities
I have spent much

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:08.896
of my career studying write
stories not because they want to get

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:10.836
in the industry or they
want to make money,

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.606
but because they love
telling stories and they want

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:15.366
to tell stories to each other.

00:02:16.906 --> 00:02:19.016
&gt;&gt; If we think about YouTube,
and many of the people

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:20.726
on YouTube are producing media

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:23.336
because there's something
they vitally want to share.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.506
It might be a skateboarder
who did a great stunt

00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:28.446
and had their friends record
it and paste it online.

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:30.986
It might be an amateur remix artist

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:34.336
who saw a TV show they
loved and set it to music.

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:39.056
It could be a political commentator
or someone doing a video blog to talk

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.486
about their everyday life.

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:42.926
All of that becomes part
of what I'm describing

00:02:42.926 --> 00:02:44.176
as a participatory culture.

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:51.436
&gt;&gt;The question is really, well,
how do we go from participating

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:54.866
in our culture to participating in
our political and civic structures?

00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:57.976
If we look at, for example, the
young people who made videos

00:02:58.046 --> 00:03:00.666
to support the Obama
campaign a year or so back,

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:03.866
how many of them got
their start making movies

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:08.036
of themselves skateboarding or
making fan films or whatever?

00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:11.916
They acquired their skill by
simply playing around with media,

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:13.476
in the terms of the
Digital Youth Project,

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:15.536
"messing around" comes first.

00:03:15.536 --> 00:03:17.596
They were messing around
with technology,

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:20.016
"geeking out" around a
certain set of subject matter.

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:22.546
So what I'm interested in
right now is what would it mean

00:03:22.546 --> 00:03:23.996
to "geek out" for democracy?

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:28.856
&gt;&gt;What does it mean to be as
passionate about the future

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:33.726
of your society as you are about
anime, about games, about the sort

00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:36.916
of forms of popular culture that
young people are involved with?

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:41.086
&gt;&gt;We could also point to, for
example, the Harry Potter Alliance,

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:45.006
and the Harry Potter Alliance
is a group that organizes

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:46.656
around human-rights
issues around the world.

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:49.726
So Andrew Slack, the
20-something-year-old leader

00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:51.826
of the group, said when
he read "Harry Potter,"

00:03:51.826 --> 00:03:55.926
what he saw was a story of a
young man who recognized evil

00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:58.966
in his society the government
was covering up, the mass media

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:02.126
of his time was lying about
it, but he saw through it,

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:04.806
organized his classmates to
form Dumbledore's Army and went

00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:05.686
out and changed the world.

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:09.446
And that's his account of the plot of
"Harry Potter," and he said, "Well,

00:04:09.446 --> 00:04:11.236
what if we had a Dumbledore's
Army in our world?

00:04:11.236 --> 00:04:12.386
What issues would it tackle?

00:04:12.876 --> 00:04:13.726
What are the concerns?

00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:14.456
What would you do?"

00:04:14.456 --> 00:04:18.326
And now he uses that fantasy of
Dumbledore's Army to mobilize.

00:04:18.836 --> 00:04:21.976
Now 100,000 young people
around the world are involved

00:04:21.976 --> 00:04:24.966
in the Harry Potter Alliance
and they're going out to deal

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:30.986
with human-rights violations in
the Third World, Darfur, Uganda,

00:04:31.306 --> 00:04:34.726
workers' rights issues in the
United States around Walmart,

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:39.366
gay-marriage propositions in Maine
and California they've mobilized on.

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:43.026
They just raised a cargo plane
worth of supplies for Haiti.

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:45.606
So they work on a range of issues.

00:04:46.316 --> 00:04:49.346
So the people who are involved
in that are not the kids

00:04:49.346 --> 00:04:50.456
who join student government.

00:04:50.596 --> 00:04:53.756
They're the kids who were, you know,
playing "Dungeons and Dragons,"

00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:56.726
the kids who, you know, were
collecting monster magazines,

00:04:56.726 --> 00:04:59.386
the kids who read a lot
of science fiction books.

00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:03.596
They're suddenly finding a vehicle to
think politically through these kinds

00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:04.816
of interest-driven networks.

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:07.786
And we're seeing again and again
these interest-driven networks are

00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:11.356
preparing the way for them to
think of themselves as citizens

00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:15.186
in a new way, to mobilize the skills
they developed as contributing

00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:17.946
to online communities
and participatory culture

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:21.306
and direct them toward changing
society, changing the world.

00:05:21.306 --> 00:05:25.736
&gt;&gt;I mean, I'm deeply
enthusiastic about all

00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:27.536
of this stuff that's taking
place outside of school,

00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:31.036
but if we leave it there as sort
of the way we create feral children

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:34.546
of the Internet, you know, and
the idea that just let them be,

00:05:34.546 --> 00:05:37.256
they'll learn on their own, I
think leaves a lot of kids behind

00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:42.256
and it leaves us -- those kids without
adult guidance, without engagement

00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:45.706
and skill, validation of those skills
that would prepare them to move

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:47.876
up to higher levels
and to get recognition

00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:49.536
for what they've accomplished.

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:51.756
They don't need us snooping
over their shoulders,

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:52.976
but they do need us
watching their backs.

00:05:57.246 --> 00:05:59.766
&gt;&gt;What I'm seeing is there are
individual teachers out there

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:04.096
who are incredibly innovative,
dedicated, willing to explore things,

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:07.636
willing to think in open-minded
ways about the future of education,

00:06:07.636 --> 00:06:10.146
and those are the battles that are
worth fighting for at this point.

00:06:10.786 --> 00:06:13.506
School systems, you
know, are locked down.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.086
Federal policy makes it difficult.

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:19.546
The change, they may be in schools
where all of the affordances

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.506
of participatory culture
are locked out.

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:27.436
&gt;&gt;What's important is to
figure out how to bring

00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:29.606
that into the educational process.

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:34.846
So, for example, "Moby Dick,"
we had students make changes

00:06:34.846 --> 00:06:37.356
in the Wikipedia entries
around Melville and "Moby Dick"

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:42.156
and defend those changes against
challenge through the vetting process

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:45.876
on Wikipedia and to have some
of their changes stand the test

00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:50.416
of the community and have to mobilize
evidence and support arguments

00:06:50.826 --> 00:06:54.216
and demonstrate the value of the
arguments they made on something

00:06:54.216 --> 00:06:57.176
that would be a permanent
part of the public record

00:06:57.686 --> 00:06:59.706
and the public conversation
around these books.

00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:03.236
And the sense of empowerment
those kids got by participating

00:07:03.236 --> 00:07:08.046
in that process is really vital, but
to think of all the schools who say,

00:07:08.426 --> 00:07:11.456
"Wikipedia is bad, let's not
let that in our classroom,"

00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:15.016
that's the experience that
so many kids in America have.

00:07:16.616 --> 00:07:19.706
&gt;&gt;In the short term, it's about
getting this stuff in the hands

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:21.616
of teachers who will
want to make a difference

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:24.856
and giving them the validation
and encouragement they need

00:07:25.186 --> 00:07:28.506
to keep fighting the good fight on
behalf of the new media literacies.
