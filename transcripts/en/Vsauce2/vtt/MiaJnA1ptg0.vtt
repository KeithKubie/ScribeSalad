00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.600
A robot designed to scratch your itch? Oh,
and here's a palm laser so that you can be like

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.009
Iron Man.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.250
VSauce, Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.270
A multi-touch LCD wall was rigged to play
Fleet Commander - a real-time strategy game

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.030
developed at the electronic visualization
laboratory. It's a Star Wars game and watching

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.400
these kids play it reminds me of Ender's Game.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.400
Watching this Tetris Master reminds me never
to think I'm good at Tetris again.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.180
And watching this might make you barf. It's
the steepest RollerCoaster in the world. It's

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.180
located in Japan and has a 43 meter drop with
a 121 degree freefall.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.149
To cool off after the ride visit the Japanese
Frozen Aquarium. It showcases 450 specimens

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.540
of marine life frozen in ice and illuminated
with blue light.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.990
"Hey, I'm wearing an episode of the Simpsons."
You certainly are, sir. You certainly are.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.079
The world's largest photo is on display at
the Culver Center of the Arts. The 32x111

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.569
foot photo was taken with the world's largest
camera... Which is an abandoned aircraft hangar

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.579
with a 6mm hole in the side that functions
as the aperture.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.840
Perhaps the most complicated way to take a
photo is with this Rube Goldberg machine.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.840
It took about 6 months to put together but
the results are well worth it...Check it out...

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.359
After all that work, relax in the Hammock
House. It's a five story hangout spot in Vienna

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:53.130
meant to serve as an oasis of relaxation.
And outside of it is umm..this...

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.719
Here's some levitating water. It's not a video
effect. This real, steady stream of water

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.829
has a strobe effect on it to make it look
like individual floating droplets.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.700
And this is Flashed Face Distortion Effect.
The pictures of these women are not altered

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.700
in any way. But if you stare at the cross in the middle
as the faces flash, their images appear to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.640
stretch and distort in a freakish manner.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.640
Finally, an

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.890
epic animation referred to as Little Nemo,
from exactly 100 years ago.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.500
I'm gonna leave you with

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.350
a riddle.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.330
There are two animation and three video game
references in this video. The first person

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.110
to name them all will be our genius
of the week. So good luck and, as always,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.110
thanks for watching.
