00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:18.040
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.520
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.530
to the Library of congress.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.590
I'm John Cole, I'm the Director
for the Center for the Book

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.310
in the Library of Congress, so I'm
the lucky person who gets to have

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.100 position:56%
as his major job promoting books and
reading and literacy in libraries.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.320 position:56%
And it's a program that was actually
created by a history group here.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.660
It was created by Daniel
Borschton [phonetic]

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.380
when he was Librarian
of congress in 1977.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.500
And the idea of was the Library of
Congress needed an office dealing

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.730
with the public to help promote
books and reading and especially

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.950
to reassure people that books
and reading were important.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.440
In the face of the new
technology of the time.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.120
And if you think back to
1977 that new technology

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.840
which Dr. Borschton
viewed is something

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.690
that needed combatting
was television.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.840
And in the very beginning our
major reading programs were related

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.320
to connecting television
and making use of television

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.780
and of subsequently
all new technologies.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.060
To promote books and reading
to which we have added literacy

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.590
and libraries as the
years have gone by.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.490
And also we have been able
to through this program,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.920
this noon time lecture program
stress of, the encouraging

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.830 position:56%
of the historical study of books and
reading and literacy in libraries.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.990
The Center for the Book quickly
also has national networks,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.380
we have affiliates in each
state that help us at the state

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.180
and local level promote
books and reading.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.530
And we have reading promotion
partners, nonprofit organizations.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.090
We ourselves are a
public, private partnership

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.570
with our programs including
the National Book Festival,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.140
which is a major project,
not just for us

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140
but for the Library of Congress.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.010
Is an example of a program
that requires private funding

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.700
but we also -- is administered by
the Center for the Book and others.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.490
This has been the pattern
actually for our growth,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.530
the Center for the Book in recent
years has expanded and are able

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.110
to work now with a new part of
the library that promotes reading.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.670
Reading Administrators of the
Young Reader's Center which is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.180
in the Young Reading
Jefferson Building.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.720
And also now re-administer
the libraries poetry

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.360
and literature program which
includes the Poet Laureate

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.930
which is a major Library
of Congress activity.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.680
That we're able to look at
this ins a central sort of way

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.400
to see what is needed
for outreach in this area

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.540
on the part of the library.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.900
Thank you for coming to Books and
Beyond, it's a special program

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.850
that we started in
1997 to mark books

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.900
that have been recently
published books that had some kind

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.320
of special connection with
the Library of Congress.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.110 position:56%
And today is an example of a book
that depended in part on the Library

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.380
of Congress but on other
research libraries as well.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.410
But we have found that
by having this program

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.230
which today is cosponsored with the
European Division, that we are able

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.120
to help advertise the
Library and it's collections.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.130
Because these programs are
all filmed for the Library

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.340
of Congress' website and
are by themselves a kind

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.450
of a standing example of the
value of libraries in some ways

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.470
and the way that the Library
of Congress is trying to reach

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.990
out to talk about our collections.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.630
And to let people know the value
of our collections and the fact

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.240 position:56%
that in fact the Library of Congress
is a major research institution

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.870
that we feel doesn't
quite get the publicity

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.710
in many circles that
we want it to have.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.180
So the other part of the
outreach is working hard

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.910
to show off our wonderful
Jefferson building,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.410
which by itself is a
historical monument and to work

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.140
with the library in a
[inaudible] program now for tours

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.100
of the Jefferson building
which is a,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.940
by itself really a monument
to books and reading.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.760
It opened in 1897 and it's
filled with names of authors

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.850
and aspiring Americans
and a great show

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.470
of American cultural nationalism.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.770
We will have -- we'll hear
from our speaker Janet

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.220
and then we'll have a chance
for questions and answers.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.770 position:56%
Because I would like you to remember
to turn off all things electronic

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.370
since we're being filmed.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.330
And a chance to purchase the
book and to get it signed

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.530
when the program is over.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.550
I also have a couple of handouts
on the back table for you,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.870 position:56%
one is the latest, second to the
latest Library of Congress magazine.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.150 position:56%
We now have a magazine that appears
six times a year and we got out just

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.100
in time for this year's National
Book Festival in September

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.980
and it's dedicated to the joy of
reading but it does talk a lot

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.440
about Center for the
Book activities.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.050
Then I cannot resist also
handing out one of our products,

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.560
our latest publication which is
an announcement about the Library

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.120 position:56%
of Congress literacy awards which is
a project funded by David Rubinstein

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.650
who also is the generous
donor to half of the cost

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.160
of the National Book
Festival each year.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.420
But were able to give awards to
organizations around the country

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.160
and to honor them for the work
that they're doing in literacy

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.340
and this is a five year program
for the Center for the Book

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.510
and for the Library of Congress.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.350
But back to today it's my
pleasure to introduce Grant Harris

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.390
who is representing our
cosponsor, the European Division.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.460
And Grant is the head of
the European reading room

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.190
and he will introduce our
speaker and get us started.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.490
Let's give Grant a hand.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.290
Thank you, Grant.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.510
[ Applause ]

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:07.040
[ Background noise ]

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.450
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Well,
thank you John.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.240
I get to work in that Jefferson
building that John Cole described,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.380
he's actually authored a great
work about the Jefferson building.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.050
But I actually get to work there
every day and John you're stuck

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.700
over here in the Madison building
I believe most of the time.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.000
&gt;&gt; John Cole: That's
enough Grant on that.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.830
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: All right,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.310
I am honored to introduce
Dr. Janet Polasky

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.510
who has authored the book
we'll be talking about today,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.660
Revolutions Without Borders:

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.180
The Call to Liberty
in the Atlantic World.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.460
Dr. Polasky's title if I can
embarrass her giving the full title

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.590
is Presidential Professor,
History Department,

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.780
University of New Hampshire.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.850
Her earlier monographs published
by university presses look largely

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.390
at revolution and reform
in Belgium but also

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.090
at 19th century labor
reform in England.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.830
Today Professor Polasky will
talk about her new book,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.580
Revolutions Without
Borders which is published

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:12.360
by the prestigious Yale University
Press for it she conducted much

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.350
of her research here at
the Library of Congress.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.180
And especially in the
manuscript divisions collections.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.530
This book has received praise
by critics, high praise.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.000
The New York Review
of Books says this,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.870
Revolutions Without Borders does
three things and does them well.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.690
It identifies and traces
the fortunes

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.750
of the most zealous promoters
of the universal cry of liberty

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.020
in the tumultuous 28
years after 1776.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.950
It demonstrates the importance
of understanding the failures,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.260
the dead ends, the
unrealized dreams,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.570
as well as the successes
of past eras.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.320
And it contributes to our knowledge
of Atlantic history, a solid

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.330 position:56%
and imaginative work of scholarship.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.320
The Economists magazine says this,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.350
instead of telling the
usual heroic national story,

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.820
she ranges wherever her wayfaring
revolutionaries take her.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.420
To Paris and Washington
but also to Poland,

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.900
Sierra Leona and the Caribbean.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.770
Instead of confining herself
to the deeds of valiant men,

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.480
she also gives the stage
to women and slaves.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.440
The result is a spectacle
the conveys the thrill

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.980
of the enlightenment as well
of the delirium of revolution.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.360
Janet Polasky herself has
written about her book of course

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.740
and she says this among
many other things.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.880
To limit our history of the
18th century to the revolutions

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.470
that prevailed, the American and
French Revolutions is to forget

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:56.250
that history is replete with
dead ends, movements that surged

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.110
and fizzled or were suppressed.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.540
Uninformed we cannot
imagine the rich variety

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.520
of revolutionary alternatives
in our own world.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.310
Well, with that I will turn
it over to Professor Polasky,

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.510
thank you for being here,
please give her a hand.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:18.410
[ Applause ]

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.870
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: Thank you
and you can tell first of all

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.910
where I've been already today
because I have my Library

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.500
of Congress reading card
in my pocket so I've been

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.980
[ Applause ]

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.520
coming from the reading room.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.790
So thank you very much and it
is wonderful to have a chance,

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:43.810
let's see if that actually
-- sorry I can rearrange --

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.030
to have a chance to thank
the Library of Congress.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:52.250 position:56%
Because this is really where I began
my research and I'm back here now.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.190
I've just started my next book
and so where better to begin

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.150
than in the main reading room

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:03.370
from which I will then
hopefully branch off to archives

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.400
or to the manuscripts
and rare books.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:11.500
So what I want to talk about
today are the interconnections,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.940
the interconnections
between revolutions.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:22.740
And the interconnections of today's
global society are inescapable.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.710
So why should we imagine that
the founding fathers dreamed

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.570
of freedom in isolation.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.270
The Atlantic world I argue

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:35.090
in my book was never more
tightly interconnected than it was

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.370
at the end of the 18th century.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:44.440
From the Americas to Geneva,
the Guinea coast, the Andes,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.180
revolutions challenged the
rule of tyrannical kings

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.840
and of overreaching nobles.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.930
On plantations carved out of the
Caribbean Islands by enslaved labor

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.490
and among the slave
holding entrepreneurs

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.450
of West Africa the possibility
of insurrections lurked.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.930
Terrifying overseers and
government officials alike.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.410
Rumors course the Atlantic
with the ocean currents,

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:21.890
this as one of my predecessor
wrote was a world in motion.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:26.570
Today no one would dispute the
obvious fact that ideas travel,

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:30.110
revolutionary ideas above all.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.040
Protestors in a park in Rio de
Janeiro declare quote we are the

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.870
social network.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.540
A banner quotes Bertolt
Brecht quote,

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.250
nothing should be impossible
to change.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.160
But difficult though it is for
us to imagine an interconnected,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.540
cosmopolitan world before the
invention of the internet.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.980
In fact revolutionary
ideas travelled back

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.330
and forth across the Atlantic.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:03.210
Starting in America and reaching
four continents before 1800.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:08.940 position:56%
Two centuries before the Arab Spring
without electronic social media

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.670
or even in international
postal system, ideas of liberty

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:18.290
and equality in various
languages inspired philanthropists

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.590
transporting freed
slaves to Sierra Leone,

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.930
haunted governors of
Caribbean colonies.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.570
Informed novelists
and were proclaimed

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:33.160
by revolutionary armies marching
down the Italian peninsula.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.060
How, well that's where the
Library of Congress, not,

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.370
never fear is a fomenter of
these revolutionary currents.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.800
But rather and maybe
more appropriately

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.310
as a preserver of the documents.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.170
In the 18th century
documents had legs.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:59.310
They travelled, words travelled
they were no respecters of borders

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.280
and this goes from the
obvious, pamphlets, newspapers,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.240
diplomatic decrees, the
kind of documents that we

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.420
as political historians are
accustomed to working with

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:15.220
but also I've argued from
letters, novels and even rumors,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.970
words were invested with
the power of persuasion.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:25.390
Fortunately for historians we have
a paper trail to follow and for me

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:30.120
as will all of my books in fact it
began at the Library of Congress.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.350 position:56%
I found letters sent home on
package ships by husbands and lovers

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.810
who had been dispatched
on diplomatic missions.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.680
Pamphlets transported
in pockets and annotated

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.870
in margins by previous readers.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.560
Newspapers reprinting accounts
of clandestine meetings

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.800
in Warsaw and Charleston.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.590
Diaries, some intended for
publication and others not

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.990
and rumors that tell us more
than the teller intended.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.890
And these are all at
the center of my book.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.280
Not just the pamphlets, that are
available today to our students

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.260
on the internet who say why go to a
library, I can all find it online.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.490
But actually the manuscripts
and rare books

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.220
that require visiting
the Library of Congress.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.190
Now most Americans know that
Thomas Paine proclaimed quote,

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.420
tis time to part.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.830
Goading the Americans to battle for
what he pictured as quote, the free

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:34.220
and independent states
of America, in July 1776.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.610
The common sense was filled
with uncommonly frank language.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.490
Charging quote, there is
something exceedingly ridiculous

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.290
in the composition of a monarchy.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.880 position:56%
But fewer of my amused students
know that he cast the king as a worm

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.750
or William the Conqueror
was in Paine's words,

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.160
a French bastard landing
within [inaudible]

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.260
and establishing himself King
of England against the consent

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:06.910
of the natives in very plain terms,
a very paltry, rascally original.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:12.850 position:56%
Paine who claims there is something
very absurd in supposing a continent

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.780
to be perpetually governed
by an island.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:21.500
But less well known is his line
at the end of common sense,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:28.270
quote we have it in our power
to begin the world again.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:33.100
In our modern age when nation
state reign supreme we look

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.970
to the 18th century for the
roots of the nation states

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.500
that have endured into the present.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.650
For the united States, France and
sometimes in more recently Haiti,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.830
that should probably
be true for the Library

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:50.210
of Congress though that's
an assumption that I want

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.600
to question in the next half hour.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.820
If Thomas Paine or his
contemporaries were thinking

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.640
within national boundaries, why,

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.770
I've asked did they
travel so widely?

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:09.720
What did Paine me by, we have it in
our power to begin the world again?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.360
To answer that I think we need
to look beyond our borders,

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.700
even in an age that
founded our nation.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.050
And that's to me at least a
much more compelling story

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:28.600
in what Paine saw as a
wide open rollicking world.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.530
So what I'm arguing is for readers

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.240
of revolutionary history
and for our students.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.500
Including my students what we've
done is to reduce the rowdy world

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.370
when revolutions seem to
be erupting everywhere

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.090
into the tidy American
revolution of the founding fathers.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.420
And that isn't to reduce the sales
of the biographies that are all

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.160
down on the shelves of
the bookshop downstairs.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.260
And there is that section
on founding fathers.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.680
Or even all of the books that
aren't downstairs but on the terror

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.600
of the French Revolutions.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.370
It's just that I don't think that's
the way the contemporary saw their

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:11.700
world in the decades after
America revolted in 1776.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:17.160
In our obsession with nation
states of our own world we forget

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:23.420
that no inexorable logic led from
an old regime of fragmented empires

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.800
to a set of modern nations
commanding the loyalty

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.380
of geographically bound citizens.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.670
A Belgian pamphleteer proclaimed as
his neighbor unfurled patriot flags

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.480 position:56%
over utrecked, [phonetic] quote,
over half of the globe all men utter

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.910
but one cry, they share but one
desire, humanity united in action,

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.900
after being oppressed for so long
under tyranny rises up with pride

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.540
to reclaim a majestic
and powerful liberty.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.280 position:56%
Now these are the pamphlets that are
in the American imprint collection

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.310
in rare books along with
then the American responses

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.690 position:56%
such as James Chalmers, Plain Truth.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.100
Which are in the Oliver
Walcott pamphlet collection.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.940
As reported in newspapers
and recounted

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.350
by entrepreneurial merchants
form the Americas to Geneva,

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.890
the Guinea cost and the Andes
revolutionaries challenged the rule

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:24.600
of these tyrannical kings
and over reaching nobles.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.920
The possibility of
insurrection depending

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.370
on your perspective either lurked
or loomed on all of these areas.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:37.860
In plantations in the Caribbean
islands, and novels written

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.000
by about Dutch housewives
written actually

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.700
by Dutch writers raising their
children on manuals inspired

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:52.410
by John Lock and among
the and in west Africa.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.870
Where these rebellions founded
independent nation states,

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.410
that have endured,
we celebrate them.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:05.470
The others struggles in Sierra
Leone, Guadalupe, Tuscany

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:11.170
and Geneva equally hard fought
have been largely forgotten,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.100
consigned for the most part
to the dust bin of history.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.690
I chanced on this topic as an
undergraduate, not [inaudible] not

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:23.220
in the Library of Congress but in
public records office in London,

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.810
now the National Archives
in [inaudible].

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.550
But then and this was
back in the 1970's

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.590
when they removed the
lightbulbs to save electricity

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.590
and what you really
needed to research was one

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.550
of those miner's hats with
the light on the front.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:41.430
I filled out my call slip and
then again it was by hand,

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.010
one of those lackey
things we don't do anymore.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.320
So I filled out my call slip

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.140
and have terrible handwriting
even though I'm the granddaughter

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.430
of someone who taught penmanship.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.510
And so I got back the wrong
folio, well in the time of course

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.750
that it would take was raining
so I didn't bother to go outside

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.490
and get a cup of tea, so in the
time it took to get the ones

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.640
that I really wanted to get.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.610
I thought well I've got this in
front of me, what else am I going

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.420
to do for the next hour I might
as well sit down and read it.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.450
And it said chicken farming on it

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.150
and I thought oh great this is
going to be real interesting.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.910
And as I started reading
it in the midst

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.870
of all this we're letters
form Thomas Paine.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.480
They had been misfiled they
had just been stuck there.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.880 position:56%
And I was a senior, I was on a study
abroad program working on a paper

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.530
on London radicals and what
I discovered in this reading

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.000
that I had not expected at all.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.330
Were the connections between Paine
and the barristers he was running

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:47.240
into in London but
also Jacoven's in Paris

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.170
and finding connections
with Germany.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:53.010
And suddenly I discovered all
these interconnections that weren't

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.370
in the secondary sources
that I had read leading me

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.280
up to write this project.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.440
So I thought about it and
obviously what do you do

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.990
when you're an undergraduate,
you running up to the Arch

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.680
of the Saint, look what I found.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:13.660
And so here are the letters and I
think now they're properly filed

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.050
and back in my mind what I kept
doing was filing away Paine's

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.390
itinerant friends.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.640 position:56%
And every time I would run into them
over the last more than 30 years,

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.680
this sort of would put the note
card aside or now would write it

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.030
on a file and kept it away.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.030
So I found them negotiating
with barbary pirates

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:38.440
to find free hostages, distributing
shoes to French armies on behalf

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.190
of the English radicals,
spearheading the insurrection

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.660
in Saint-Domingue with money
that had been raised in London

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.280
and Charleston and
sliding down bedsheets

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.250
to escape a hanging in Dublin.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:56.570
I just kept filing these
away as I wrote other books

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:01.000 position:56%
but these characters were compelling
and what was really interesting

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.440 position:56%
to me were the connections that they
made from one revolution to another.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.980
Let me just give you -- and so
these are the characters that are

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:13.610
in my book, there is the Tuscan
merchant, Filippo Mazzei,

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.640
whose memoirs I found in used
book stall in [inaudible].

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.120
My husband does not like travelling
where I can read the language

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.560
because that's where you
always find the great books

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.330
and you can also always then
make it into the library.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.570
He was Thomas Jefferson's
Virginia neighbor who served

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.460
as the Polish king's liaison
in revolutionary Paris.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.390
Or Anna Falconbridge who's the
wife of a British abolitionist

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.960
who founded Free Town
in Sierra Leone.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.210
And recounted her encounters
among the Temne people.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:50.620 position:56%
And there's Vanson Oget [phonetic]
who was frustrated by the laborious,

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.380
equivocating French debates
over slavery and so sailed back

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.550
to Saint-Domingue to lead an
insurrection demanding rights

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.110
for all people quote,
without regard to race.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:07.560 position:56%
He was joined in his insurrection by
veterans of the American Revolution.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:13.290
These were not founding
fathers, they're not the subjects

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:17.980
of the books on the
shelves in the down stairs.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.230
Instead these were people
who were on the move.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.320
So the revolutionaries that I kept
encountering in the archives men

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:31.890
and women, black and white ignored
borders and what I also found

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.780
that their international struggles

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.300
for what they called
universal rights.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.860
Or we would called
universal human rights.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.130
Do not fit neatly into
national histories.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:47.720
So what I began to wonder was as
I was teaching French history,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.290
why do historians divide
this revolutionary period

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.150
into self-contained
national stories.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:00.430
Why do we keep buying and selling
biographies of founding fathers

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.780
on this side of the Atlantic,
or grisly accounts of the terror

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.030
and it's humane guillotine
on the other.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.930
History doesn't repeat itself
even if Napoleon said it did,

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.440
but as I've discovered
historians do.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.640
Especially because our histories
and our documents are organized

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.740
or divided is perhaps more
apt into national categories.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:32.120
With borders more ridged than
those of the revolutionaries

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.590
and certainly more divided than
the revolutionaries discovered

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.980
at the end of the 18th century.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.290
And again these are
the revolutionary some

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.730
of whom we know quite well.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:48.060
When Thomas Paine handed George
Washington the key to the Bastille

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.610
that had been entrusted to him
by the Marquis de Lafayette.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:56.540
He reminded George Washington,
this is October 1789 that quote,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.110
a share in two revolutions
is living to some purpose.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:04.240
And this is a theme that
gets repeated over and over.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.080
There's a Dutch writer, Harry
Pop and he asked his wife,

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.730
who he left behind, nice man, to
tend to their family business.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:18.060
He took off and he writes
what could be more enticing

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.430
than to join revolutions
that would humble aristocrats

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.540
and dethrone kings.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:28.050
He set off to skies with a hat
and a wig and two false passports

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:33.500
and a sleep sack and he found
his way into four revolutions.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.240
Or there's the English poet,

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.720
a lot of these people we
know for other reasons.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.590
Helen Maria Williams and she
arrived in Paris on July 13,

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.550
1790 the eve of the first
celebration of the storming

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.800 position:56%
of Bastille and she woke up the
first morning in revolutionary Paris

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.920
to witness right out of her
window processions of men

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.440
and women assembling
on the Champ de Mars.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.210
Led by Lafayette including not
only peasants from the provinces

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.430
but John Paul Jones,
who's house is --

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:06.400
John Paul Jones' house
is right down the street

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.290
from where I live in Portsmouth.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:13.460
Leading an American delegation
but also delegations from Geneva,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.990 position:56%
from Poland, from Italy, from the
United provinces of the Netherlands,

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.380
from Ireland, England and Prussia.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:25.290
And at the center of course was
Lafayette on his white charger.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:30.260
The press reported quote, all
national differences vanished.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.410
All prejudices disappeared.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:38.290 position:56%
Helen Maria Williams wrote home, how
am I to paint the impetuous feeling

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.980
of the immense, that
exalting multitude.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.630
It was man reclaiming

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.690
and establishing the
most noble of his rights.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.350
And all it required was a
simple sentiment of humanity,

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:54.800
to become in that moment
a citizen of the world.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:01.250
And so you find these
statements over and over again,

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.110
some we know well,
Anacharsis Cloots for example

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.160
who writes the trumpet
announcing the resurrection

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.980
of a great people has sounded to
the four corners of the world.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.870
The cries of joy from a chorus

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:20.720 position:56%
of 25 million free men will awaken
the people's long asleep in slavery.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.520
So my question as I found
these documents was,

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.820
so how in the 18th
century do ideas travel?

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:35.270
Again before social media, 50 years
before the barricades of 1848,

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:39.860
before Garrosh dies on the
barricades of Les Mis in 1832.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:43.680
A century before the socialists
founded the second international.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.560
So, I found the travelers
that I'd encountered,

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.500
first of all in meetings,
in conversations,

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.760
sometimes aboard ship, hammocks
slung across the back deck

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.630
of the appropriately named
ship, the Salseble [phonetic]

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:02.330
with the young John Quincy
and a young diplomat,

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.960
Francois Barbe-Marbois who
observed the keel hauling

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.340 position:56%
of a slave aboard a passing corsair.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.410
We find them talking
in cafes and salons,

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.080
the English poet Williams conversed

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.730
with we know the French
Jacovan Robes Pierre,

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.610
the journal chronicler
the Gayard Forrester,

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:26.960
the Venezuelan General Miranda,
the Polish revolutionary Koscuiszko

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.760
and others in her Paris apartment.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.560
How do we know that, well sometimes
they leave us their journals

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.810
or their memoirs but we also
have the reporting of spies,

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.640
intelligence agencies
obviously weren't organized

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.320
in the 20th century.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.280 position:56%
And we have their records as well
including their records of reporting

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.870
on other spies who were they
thought were the fomenters

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:57.760 position:56%
of the revolution, one of whom
ended up finding his way into prison

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.770
because there was no way not
to expose the whole expedition.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.470
Or it's fun to read and to figure
out what their interpreting

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:10.610
as the signal John Horne Tooke
sends out all these what turned

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.950
out to be dinner invitations.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.110
But let's assemble at 6 PM at.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:20.260
And then he gives an address and
of course the spies then you see

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:25.200
through those records took this
as the assembly of ne'er do wells

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.660
who were going to start the
next revolution in England.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.880
And you can only imagine what they
felt like when they showed up.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.400
We also can find in the pamphlets

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.680
and this is why you don't
just find them on line

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.370
but go look for them in rare books.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:46.330
Because in the margins you
find who had read them before

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:51.750
and you find comments as they get
handed from one person to another.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:56.760
Encounters on the age transformed
readers into revolutionaries,

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.490
I suppose that's maybe not
something you want to promote

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.330
from the center of the book.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.670
But ideas did travel and
what's important then

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.650
in the 18th century
is this is the time

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:12.660 position:56%
when people took the written word
seriously which is wonderful for all

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.740
of us who are historians.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:20.130
But I came to realize that what
really pulled me in as a historian

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:24.790
and what all of you who work at
the Library of Congress know was

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.890
that it was the documents
themselves.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:29.340
And I think we historians
and it sometimes looks

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.480
like what we really are out
to do is it's our conclusions

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.630
that the draw us in,
but I think it's not.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.760 position:56%
I think it's actually the documents.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.100
And it's actually holding the
documents and I came to realize

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.300
that John Bowle, who
is a former colleague,

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.540 position:56%
when I started taking students down,

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.650
since I'm in New Hampshire
I obviously can't bring them

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:55.060
to the Library of Congress, so I
took a group of seniors to work

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.790
in rare books at Harvard.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.870
And they had all been
working on their papers first

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.170
of all they were really excited

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.860
because the librarian thought
they were graduate students

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.360
and then assumed of course they'd
come from a private institution.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.190
I could say no we're the State
University of New Hampshire.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:16.300 position:56%
And she was so impressed because
these students had taken a Saturday,

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.980
we all found a common
day, we took the bus down,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.270
they had all been doing
all the secondary research

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.390
and what they could find of
primary documents online.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:28.330
But what was so exciting was
watching them actually get the

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.900
letters and the journals that
they had been reading about.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.170
And to realize and
they'd come up and say

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:41.000
but I think doesn't this suggest
and then it would be a conclusion

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.560
that was completely different
than they had been reading.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.220
And you'd say yeah,

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.380
that interpretation Christina
makes a lot of sense.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.810
I couldn't get them out of
the library, the bell rang,

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.810
they did not want to leave.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:59.050
I've taken freshmen down
to work in rare books

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:02.130
at the Boston public library
and so here are students

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.350
who have just started
studying French

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:08.510
and they find there's a
great collection of pamphlets

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:13.370
from Saint-Domingue in Boston so
they would find pamphlets in French

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.980
and they could read them.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.590
And they would sit there opening
these pamphlets so it's not only.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.840
You know first they get excited
because it's actually a letter

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.190
of Thomas Jefferson
that they get to hold.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.840
But they find that here are
the real documents that went

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.700
into the writing of history.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.500
And I can tell when
I can take students

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.440
to do that, they become historians.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.340
I can take a class where
they all came in as engineers

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.870
and business students but a few of
them will overcome the skepticism

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:46.610
of their parents and
become historians.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:51.200
So, that's what I decided,
it's actually it's my students

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.750
that encourage me and that convince
me that the way to write a book was

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:58.950
to write a book organized
around the documents themselves.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:03.100
And so what I did in terms
of organizing this book is

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:08.310 position:56%
as I was telling John, the complex
organization that about did me in is

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:12.340
that each chapter looks at how we
read a different kind of document.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:17.290
So that of course it starts out
with pamphlets and Thomas Paine

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:22.280
but I'm also looking at the novels
written by these Dutch novelists.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.740
Looking at how do we read rumors,

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:28.390 position:56%
what do we do when we read what some
other historians have called reading

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.070
against the grain.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.990
So it's using the documents
themselves,

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:35.840
because I think that's what's
exciting to all of us is

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.380
to return and you all know this.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:44.490
It's to return to those documents,
now not all these documents were,

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:47.230
some of them are obvious but not
all of them are easy to find.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:51.370
And let me just give
you one example.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:56.250
From lots of and this is from
lots of examples from emails

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.650
that I've sent out that
were generously answered

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:00.930
by archivists and librarians.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.610
Not to mention all the
visits to municipal archives

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:08.090
and national libraries and these --

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.900
so these are the letters
of one of my characters.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.380
Not all my characters move, some
were sort of the telegraph poles

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.880
that stayed still that
transmitted messages and one

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.320 position:56%
of those is Nancy Shippen [phonetic]
who lived in Philadelphia,

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.040
she was the daughter of the
continental army surgeon general.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:34.780
And she was courted by the
French attache, Louis Otto

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.150
and those documents, those
letters are excerpted in.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:42.950
They were published a century ago
by Ethel Arms who had found a chest

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:47.270
of documents when restoring
the Strafford Hall in Virginia.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:50.640
And she realized that most of the
correspondence had been classified

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.050
by the Shippen's and cataloged
in letter books deposited

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:58.100
in the division of manuscripts at
obviously the Library of Congress.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.530
Which I then read mostly
on microfilm here.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:06.380
From this correspondence
we learn in great detail,

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:11.060
probably more than ever they wanted
us to know about the courtship

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.180
of Louis Otto and Nancy Shippen.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.760
And let me just read you
one quick example of this,

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.600
why we love these documents.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.610
So Otto took to walking past the
Shippen's elegant three story red

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:30.890
brick, Georgian house on
Fourth Street every day.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:35.190
Nancy suggested a rendezvous with
him on the corner of her garden.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.440
But guided by his French
manners and concern

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.230
for her reputation he
rejected what he writes

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:44.000
as your contrivance of the corner.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.960
What's interesting to me is
he's complaining all along

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.560
of his struggle to
write in English quote,

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.890
a language that is not my own.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:55.980
But he seems to have no difficulty
expressing his sentiments.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.620
He asks Shippen to read
his true feelings quote,

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.700
and these are the letters
that are down stairs.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.190
In my eyes, in my whole conduct

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:07.940
or if it is possible
read them in your heart.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.600
He leaves her house
and he rhapsodizes

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.180
in what I think is fluent English.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:17.610
Quote, you image is entirely
present to me, all my thoughts are

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.390
so entirely directed
towards you that I see

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:24.460
or feel nothing in
the world but you.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.520
So we have this whole
collection of letters,

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:34.260
and but in the end
Shippen is courted also

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:39.890 position:56%
by Henry Livingston who's presumably
the most eligible bachelor

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.900
in the United States at the time.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.690
He's a military veteran from
a very well connected family,

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:50.720 position:56%
Nancy chose him, Otto was devastated

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.380
and writes saying how could this
possibly happen, I thought you know

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.590
that you and your parents had
allowed me to visit you every day

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.380
that meant that everything
was going along

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.420
and she gets married the next day.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.820
Her father won't even let
him see her because he's sure

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:12.150
that this will turn
Nancy back to Otto.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:16.130
Well, Nancy and Henry did
not live happily ever after.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:20.030 position:56%
Based on her letters home, which
again are downstairs, to her parents

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:24.410
and her brother from her
new home on the Hudson.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:31.560
Let me just read you a bit of that.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.810
So, there are two years of
disguised references and whispers

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.960
and Nancy Shippen Livingston
learned from her mother-in-law

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.860
of Livingston's plans to
install his illegitimate children

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.290
of whom there were apparently
many, in their household

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.530
to be raised alongside
their daughter.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:53.990 position:56%
If her husband had known [inaudible]
fit the bill of a stated ruffian

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:57.820
of a Henry Fielding novel,
then it followed in her mind

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.140
that she was quote
the virtuous female

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.780
in distress, the wronged wife.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.360
Although she ached after her
daughter she ended up going

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.440 position:56%
to her mother and having to leave
her daughter with her mother-in-law.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.640
Nancy Shippen Livingston
was so convinced

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.980
that her husband would make her
miserable at home with his taunts

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:21.070
of infidelity that she chose to
endure solitude in Philadelphia.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.640
So again we've got the letters

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:28.330
between Nancy Shippen
and her mother-in-law.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.160
It's really in keeping with the
novels that were in the earlier,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.200
the chapter just before that by
Wollstonecraft and [inaudible].

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.210
And Wollstonecraft's novels
are not things you want to read

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:41.120
on rainy days in Brussels,
they were --

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:47.220
And in fact like Nancy Shippen all
the characters end up going crazy

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.320
and dying prematurely and that
is indeed what happens to Nancy.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.040
Not so Otto, so I learned
from a chance reference

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.660
in some diplomatic papers in
[Foreign language] in Paris

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:05.040 position:56%
that I was reading for the last
chapter on diplomatic correspondence

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.940
that Otto married the
amazingly named daughter

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.680
of the famous writer,
St. John de Crevecoeur.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:19.040
Her name is America Francis de
Crevecoeur, she was known as Fanny.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.490
And Thomas Jefferson was
their principle reference.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:26.480
Her story is pretty amazing
and you can piece it together

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.720
from her father's papers also
at the Library of Congress

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.210
which had been exchanged
with [Foreign language]

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.370
with some Jefferson documents.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:47.080
So what we do know is, this is
from de Crevecoeur writing, quote,

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.020
cruel death had taken their
mother, the misfortunes

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.850
of war had driven their
father to Europe,

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:59.570
the flames of savages had reduced
their paternal house to cinders.

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.240
The subsistence that he
had left them was destroyed

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:09.230
and then this Fellows who's
had, the father of two boys

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.850
that he rescues came to their aid.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:15.010
He took them under his roof and
placed them among his own all

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:18.880
because five Americans had escaped
their imprisonment in England.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.080
Four feet of snow had prevented
Crevecoeur's immediate departure

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.250
from Boston when he finds out
that that's where daughter is.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:30.810
But the evening that he arrives the
Crevecoeur family is together again

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:36.240
at the Fellows household in Boston
and Crevecoeur adds for the benefit

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.000
of his European readers, quote to
this image of domestic happiness,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.220
he describes them dancing
with violins playing.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:50.980
To this image he says must we
join those of order of economy,

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.620
of cleanliness and of industry,

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.680
and that's what all American
households look like.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.310
And he adds, quote, this
happiness was to be found

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:01.610
in almost every American household.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:06.270 position:56%
What it contrasts then to this salon
centered society that he described.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:12.840
So that set me on what turned
out to be a four year long search

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.550
because what I wanted
to find was I knew

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.670
that Otto then ends up in France.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:24.280
Right after St. John de
Crevecoeur is over there,

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.220
that he ends up in Berlin and that
there are long periods of time

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:34.390
where he's separated from Fanny
but I could find no letters.

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:37.950
They just, she just like
disappears without a trace and so

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:41.970 position:56%
of course part of the problem is
how do you trace someone who's maybe

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:46.390
America Francis de Crevecoeur,
maybe American Francis de St. John,

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:51.140
maybe America Francis Otto, maybe
Fanny Otto, maybe fanny Otto,

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:57.270
maybe Mrs. Louis Otto, all
of these attempts but --

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:00.670
Louis Otto's papers are very
clearly carefully cataloged,

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.860
the diplomatic ones
are preserved in Paris.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.780
So I found various, you know
those tantalizing hints,

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:13.370
for example the family of a Boston
merchant had rescued her as a child

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:17.080
from the snowdrifts and they
had written their memoirs.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.030
It's a funny little book called
Fanny St. John a Romantic Incident

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.100
of the American Revolution.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.290
And then in a familiar
story all of those who work

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:29.580
with manuscripts they had
been loaned to a friend,

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.250
the letters and gone missing.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:34.010
Did they ever exist, did
they go missing what happened

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.730
to them, we don't know.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.430
But I didn't find them.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:43.750
We find great nephews who had
papers that he supposedly loaned

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:45.880
to various people writing histories

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.120
of the letters from
an American farmer.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.950
I knew they had been written
but nobody could find them.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.530
And the break came in 2009

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:59.760
when Barbara Baer then acting
early American specialist

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.120
in the manuscript division
here found notes indicating

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.310
that the Crevecoeur papers
had been for sale in 1976.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.390
This was just like I couldn't
believe it, it was like yes.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:14.400 position:56%
You know you look for these forever,
but unfortunately they were offered

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.080
at such an exorbitant price

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.800
that neither the French nor the
Americans, meaning here the Library

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.740
of Congress could afford them.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.680
So the letters were
auctioned individually.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.950
And widely dispersed on
the autograph market.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:35.760
But I have to say that Barbara
Baer was dogged on my behalf

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.580
and her notes tracing the
family papers are invaluable.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:44.050
The Library of Congress is an
amazing resource for those of us

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:47.300
who are doing historical research.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.180
At the end of how to
do historical research,

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.110
is what we tell our students not to
do, you know when you get bored one

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.840
of those random Google
searches, I did find,

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:02.600
I hit the right combination of
phrases that the French ministry

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.400
of foreign affairs had recently
acquired some of the letters.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.200 position:56%
As soon as I found that I rushed and
wrote my email in all my best French

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.690
to say could I please look at them.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.670
And they were moving out of Paris

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:17.920
so they were closed
for a year and a half.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.130
So, I patiently waited for a
year and a half and the last week

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:26.420
of my term in December a year and
a half later in the rain I showed

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:31.300
up at the doors of the [inaudible]
yes I can finally look at them.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:35.670
I had written that I was coming
of course and they said oh yes,

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:37.700
they were almost warm
in welcoming me.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.690
Here we will take you up
to read the microfilms.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.340
I said the what?

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:46.400
The microfilms and I said no, and
I luckily I could convince them.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.900
That I needed to see how the
letters were put together

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.850
and we all have our ploys, right.

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.390
To see how they were folded

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.480
and so they actually did
then let me see the originals

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.370
and work with the originals.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:03.380
And it really was worth
all of that wait because in

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:07.100
that I could actually see
then who this woman was

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.160
and it showed me a lot
about this relationship.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.060
That had gone from America to
France and the couple that was said

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.670
to be the model of an
American household in Europe.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:23.250
First in revolutionary
Paris and then in Berlin.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:26.260 position:56%
So I did come to know them and I
think maybe it's one of those things

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.500
where it becomes all
that much more important

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.230
because you've spent
so long looking for it.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:38.320
So those are the kind of documents
that are at the center of the book.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.780
And what I've tried to do also
is to talk about how we find

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:46.890
out documents, not
only how we read them.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:50.770
So it's these documents that reveal
what I can see is an alternative

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:55.990
political spear, so it's not only
that it's crossing borders but it's

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:58.160
that it is not founding fathers.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.700 position:56%
That is this is the time when we
really need to expand our definition

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:05.520
of what we mean by political
because it's the time

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:11.030
when Miraw [phonetic] talks
about removing of the blindfold.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:18.810
When everyone does become
involved in discussions of politics

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:22.690
from the people who brought
me there in the first place.

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:27.160
The merchants and the
small tradesmen in London

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:33.090 position:56%
who had put a penny in the cup after
smoking their pipes after dinner.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:40.290
And gather to discuss the politics
in London of the French revolution.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:43.080
And because they crossed borders
these are all also the people

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:50.400 position:56%
who will call into question what
the compromises that seem so obvious

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.720
to founding fathers
who stayed at home.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.020
So it's the ones who call

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:58.410
into question whose ideas sometimes
they seem like Don Quixote's ideas.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:02.680
And other times now they
seem so common place.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.800
When the Yale graduate Abraham
Bishop returns for example

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:13.230
from France and he's back and
he can't believe when he hears

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:18.150
that under Thomas Jefferson
that we're opposing the freeing

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:19.600
of slaves in Saint-Domingue.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:25.290
That the U.S. could possibly
be standing against freedom.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:30.900
And so those are the kind of
documents that I wanted to find.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:35.980
So my book has been really also
an argument for cosmopolitanism.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.580
It's a challenge to nationalism as
our only modern political story.

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:46.490 position:56%
And it's arguing against I think the
historians who have a lot at stake

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.480
in perpetuating their view

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.290
of a revolutionary world
of the founding fathers.

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:55.610
Who are defending claims
of nationalism

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:59.080
and I think these historians
are sometimes as virulent

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.660
as saber rattlers on the
stage of foreign policy.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:08.450
So my argument is that history
restricted then to founding fathers

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.010
as was said in the introduction

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:17.260
that that history limits the
way we understand our own world.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:22.230
That we need to instead study
the history of dead ends,

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:25.030
we need to understand
history of revolutions

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.400
that fizzled out because otherwise.

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:33.790 position:56%
I think we assume that revolutionary
movements against autocratic regimes

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:38.340 position:56%
of our own day will eventually,
with just a little assistance follow

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.810
in the steps of George
Washington or Robes Pierre.

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:45.870
I think then we're baffled by
uncertain outcomes of uprisings

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:50.670
of Tunisia, in Libya, we're
surprised by Egyptians or Syrians

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:54.060
who like the 18th century
revolutionaries

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.530
in [inaudible] or Geneva
or Freetown.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.690
Borrowed their ideas of
citizenship from dispirit sources.

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:03.190
Sometimes from their
neighbors often times

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.930
from legends of their own past.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:09.840
So what I'm suggesting is we can't
just look for liberal democracy

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.810
in every upheaval from
Romania to Egypt.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:18.170
Because if we do we will inevitably
be frustrated by what we find.

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:22.000
Revolutionaries who challenge
dictators will not necessarily turn

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.460
out to be liberals.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.730
Nor will their struggle follow a
path any of us had expected based

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:31.820
on what we know from our
national history as we tell it.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:36.510
So as a historian I'm boldly
suggesting that understanding flows

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:40.930
in both directions, from the past
to the present and from the present

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:44.660
to our understanding of the past.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.280
To forget the messiness of
the past is to be condemned

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.230
to judge the present
limited by the blinders

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.880
of a small set of national
narratives.

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.610
And my friend John
Bowle,[phonetic] from the Center

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:00.480
for Muslim Christian
Understanding suggested

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.200
as I was finishing the book

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.470
that like the 18th
century revolutionaries

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:06.150
who ventured beyond borders.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:09.900
In John's words, quote,
Muslim militants are working

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.930
to create nonnational
revolutionary narratives, and many

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:18.830
or our policy makers have
difficulty in understanding that.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.420
Revolutionaries from out of
the way places who struggled

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.580
against unbeatable odds 200
years ago have much to say

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:32.640 position:56%
to readers living in a world where
revolutions of all sizes had varied,

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.200
unpredicted and interconnected
outcomes.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.510
I'm suggesting that we ignore
them at our peril, thank you.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:49.050
[ Applause ]

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:51.490
Some questions, yes?

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:56.730
&gt;&gt; Have you as you're doing your
research for your various books,

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:00.730
do you find that you [inaudible]
that you're looking for

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:03.120
and so you go to an institution.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.430
Possibly outside the country
or is it that you know

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:11.700
that certain institutions might
have interesting stuff and you go

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.210
to those institutions to
see what you might find?

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:21.770
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: Probably -- oh so
when I go to a different library,

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:27.540
do I go looking for
certain documents or do I go

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:30.460
because I know they might
be an interesting repository

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:36.120
that would house documents that
might prove of interest, is that?

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.870
And I would say it's
both, usually I'd go

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:42.990
because I know they have a certain
document, a certain set of letters.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:48.100 position:56%
I know from looking through catalogs
that they have a certain set

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.020
of pamphlets for example.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:54.150
But while I'm there
I never stop at that.

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.990
I mean you always have
to give yourself time

00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:01.550
to see what you will just upon by
serendipity as I did when I started

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:04.210
out by finding those
letters by Thomas Paine.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.990
Not usually because I've
ordered the wrong folio

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:11.040
but you know you'll look through,
in the old days, you know looking

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.180
through the cards to
see what they have.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:18.810
It's often by talking with
librarians and archivists to find

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:21.170
out what's there as well.

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:25.750
I was working on a biography
of a study of the finding

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:34.190
of social democracy at the end of
the 19th century and I was working

00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:38.860
in the archives of the
socialist party in Belgium

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.040
and the archives is in Brussels.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.750
And she said oh you might be
interested in these boxes,

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.780
you know we didn't have
any place to put them,

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.930
I mean and we all have
these stories, you know.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:52.570
We didn't have any place to
put them and you're in luck

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:54.450
because they're in
the women's restroom.

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:59.580
And there they were you know,
there was this pile of boxes

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.750
and there was this whole
great set of correspondence

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.530
that no one had yet had time.

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:10.650
Or the funding to again, that's
a major issue, to catalog.

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:14.610
So, I think it's both but
that's a great question, thanks.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:15.910
Yes, please.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:19.960
&gt;&gt; It strikes me that at least
among the American revolutionaries,

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.070
which is a group that
I'm familiar with,

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:24.540
there were some definitely
identified

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:28.270
with the international
revolutionary impulse [inaudible]

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.730
where others very much did not.

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.220
And of course as you know Paine
in part because of his rejection

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:38.220
of traditional Christianity,
was close to being a pariah

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.880 position:56%
by the time he came back to the U.S.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.950
at the very beginning
of the 19th century.

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.610
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: Right and yeah
I think what's interesting too is

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:46.910
if you look at overtime.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:52.190
I mean it's the 1790's where you
really find the sort of strident,

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:58.780
we aren't French, we're Americans
and you find that rhetoric,

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.090
the national rhetoric I think

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:06.360
that becomes distinguished
from everything else.

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.470
That's outside there
whether it's the Caribbean,

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:11.560
which is even more
frightening than France.

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.340
And I do tell my students

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:19.400
that if think political rhetoric is
charged now, they read the accounts

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.840
of Thomas Paine trying to
come back to American shores

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.140
when he wants to come back.

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.520
There are these great newspaper
accounts of Paine being caged

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:38.090
in France with the animals in a
zoo and being fed you know handouts

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:41.530
and -- yeah I mean Paine is,
well because he had taken

00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:46.260 position:56%
on George Washington saying --
Paine almost went to the guillotine.

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.890
And he appealed to George
Washington to help him get out.

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:54.400
Paine's cell mate Cloots did go to
the guillotine, Paine was too sick

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.730 position:56%
so actually just barely escaped but
Washington wouldn't help him at all.

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:03.280
So he wrote an open letter
attacking George Washington.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.380
So if you're faced with who do
we side with, George Washington,

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.420
Thomas Paine, guess who
won, George Washington.

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.690
And so then Thomas
Paine comes across --

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:15.920 position:56%
yeah part of it is his religion and
part of it also is that he had dared

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.850
to take on national institutions

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:20.380
and he doesn't find the revolution
going the way he wants to.

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:23.180
So he ends up being denied
to vote which I think is one

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.530
of those really telling stories.

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:34.800
So yes, and I guess the
other answer to your question

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:39.910
about the nationalism is that as
these revolutions develop that's

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.670
where I do see the
nationalism come and so

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:47.270
to say there's cosmopolitanism is
not to say there's not nationalism.

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:51.820
I think it's -- I mean I think Cont
[phonetic] defines cosmopolitanism

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.970
in this period precisely
because it is a period

00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:57.200
where nationalism has
its roots as well.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.360
So that's an important point.

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.980
Other questions, yes?

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:05.900
&gt;&gt; Looking at documents in French
and English, did you [inaudible]

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.180
or primarily French and English?

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.580
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: Yeah, so what
languages were my documents in?

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:20.750
The ones I could read were in
French and English and Dutch

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:24.010
and Spanish and some German.

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:31.200
Some Latin actually, some
of the Belgium pamphlets.

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:37.200
When I got to Polish I ran into
trouble, but I happened to be

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.910
at a conference in Budapest where
they needed someone to represent --

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:47.140
it was for Central European, this
was years ago looking at roots

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:51.380
of liberal democracy
in western Europe.

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:55.100 position:56%
Where arguing could nationalism and
liberalism work together and to find

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:57.380
that they went back and
looked at the 19th century.

00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.640
But they couldn't find someone to
represent both halves of Belgium

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.540
so they ask me to do it,
which was really exciting.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:08.970
That was great fun but so I
had colleagues that were there

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:15.450
that were native Polish speakers
and so I called on their skills.

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:17.070
But language is something that --

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:20.720
I mean that's one of those things
I keep telling my students you need

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.480
languages, John Bowle
has made a career

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.270
of telling our students
that as well.

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:32.660
That they really -- those
languages are absolutely essential,

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:38.030
so yeah I did have to read
in other languages as well.

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:39.590 position:56%
But now it's going to be just as bad

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:43.980
with our students who
can't read cursive.

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:47.510 position:56%
So I can't write comments on my
papers anymore I have to hand write,

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:49.300
I mean I have to print them.

00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:51.950
And I think how are they going to
read, how are they going to come

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:54.800
down to manuscripts
and read the documents?

00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.140
That will be a really
interesting issue, so yeah.

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:05.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Was the handwriting by Americans,

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:09.620
I would like to think better
back then than it is today?

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:16.070
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: Yeah it's more
regular so that's absolutely true,

00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:18.810
but you know obviously it's
different from one country

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:23.860 position:56%
to another as well, from one culture
to another so you get used to it.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:28.800
And you forget how hard
it is, I was just working

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.450
on a legal case actually
in my neighborhood

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:35.170
where we had some documents
from 1913 that had been written.

00:59:35.170 --> 00:59:38.560
And I was so excited I scanned
them, I sent them off to the lawyer

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.260
and I said look I found the
documents that described the garden

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:43.950
that went with the house.

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:47.650
And he said well I can't
read these and I thought oh,

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:53.460
to me they were just as clear as
you know typing but they couldn't.

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:57.620
&gt;&gt; You obviously have [inaudible]
real educational niche opportunity

00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:03.340 position:56%
for somebody to teach a new language
called the way we used to write.

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.400
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: My Grandmother
would have taught that.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.290
&gt;&gt; I must apologize, sort of missed
my question because I don't want

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:13.850
to take away from the subject
matter you specifically discussed

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:17.520
in your book which definitely
[inaudible] a copy of that,

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.860
it's a wonderful book, a
fascinating presentation.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:27.150
But I was also struck during
it by the fact that it seems

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:32.890
like we might be living in
an age of international,

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:40.600
non-nation state based cultural
revolutionized [inaudible]

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.700
of the west.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.250
Almost like Marks again or I mean

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:50.090
and the question I have
for you is [inaudible].

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:51.430
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: To John, yes.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:01:02.480
&gt;&gt; Is where might one go to
be informed about the kinds

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:12.300 position:56%
of interconnections and the kinds of
elements in thinking there are going

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:16.260 position:56%
to have to be synthesized or
they're attempting to be synthesized

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:23.580
or not being very well
synthesized now in this era?

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.540
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: So where do
we go to understand a world

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:32.050
that crosses borders in this
particular age when we think

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:34.200
so much within national borders.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.090
And we think that the way to
solve things is just fortify

01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:38.390
national borders.

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:40.220
&gt;&gt; Somehow maybe there's some
answers, some useful pieces

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:44.520
of information, I'm wondering
what you're aware of in terms

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.300
of the work that's
being done in that?

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: Well, I will defer
to John on that because I think one

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.440
of those interesting things
about how do you go from history

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.810 position:56%
to understanding our world is more
that what history teachers us is not

01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:00.870
to expect what we expect.

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:06.250
And to always be prepared for
something completely different

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:08.260 position:56%
and the fact that we do have learned

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.070
to understand the past
in our own way.

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:15.520
Does give us those skills I think
to understand what we see around us

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.110
but it's never what we've
seen before and John --

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.090
&gt;&gt; Would you like to
add to that please?

01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:23.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah,[inaudible] in
terms of contemporary.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:29.430
I think there is, to me there's an
18th century model that's slightly

01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:32.650
different that comes out of
the scientific revolution.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:36.070
And there was an old phrase
called the invisible college

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:40.680
which were people who
had interconnections

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.990
that Janet is talking about.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:48.920
And now the difference is
that the informal gossip

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:55.330
and rumors stuff can now be
available on the internet.

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:59.740
But as I like to tell my graduate
students in particular I say

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:02.670
if your name is Aukmed
[phonetic] or Mohammad or something

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:07.720
like that don't spend too much
time on the internet looking

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.220
at the Islamic state website

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:16.500
because Homeland Security
might come and visit you.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.940
But it's now it's scattered, the
difference is that there isn't

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:26.390
yet a full Library of Congress
collection that I can go

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:30.550
to for the contemporary
Islamic state stuff.

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:34.050
But the process is still the same.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.860
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: Forever.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.200
&gt;&gt; John Cole: All right
well thank you John

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.510
or thank you Janet in particular

01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:46.630
[ Applause ]

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:50.870
You book is wonderful and you're
also a terrific speaker giving us

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:53.680
your enthusiasm and
also your knowledge.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.610
And your own conclusions which are
also in the book but it was great

01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:01.640
to hear you in person and
to have a chance to host you

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.250
at the Library of Congress.

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:06.860
I forgot two items that are
out there, we also would love

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:10.370
to have you fill out if you have
a chance after you buy the book

01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:12.280
and are waiting for the autograph.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:17.510
The event survey and we also
have a list of our future talks

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:21.010
that I see needed replenishing,
but I'll bring it back down

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:25.180 position:56%
and for the signing [inaudible] time
when you're filling out the form.

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:29.240
But let's give Janet one more round
of applause for a wonderful book

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.990
and a wonderful performance.

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:32.890
&gt;&gt; Janet Polasky: Thank
you very much.

01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:35.680
&gt;&gt; This has bene a been a
presentation of the library

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.120
of Congress, visit us at loc.gov.
