00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.380
Watching the Academy Awards this year, it
felt like a foregone conclusion that Leonardo

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.270
DiCaprio would win for his chilling, bison-chewing
performance in The Revenant. Not because his

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.970
performance was so great, but because after
six nominations, everyone agreed he was due

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.140
for a win. Sometimes it seems like the Academy
gives Oscars to reward a body of work more

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:32.890
than a particular performance, or as an attempt
to correct overlooking past performances.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.000
Because of this it often feels like the actor
doesn’t win for the movie they should have.&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.460
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Actors who won
Oscars for the Wrong film.&nbsp;

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.829
Jeff Bridges for Crazy Heart&nbsp;
By the time Jeff Bridges won an Oscar for

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.850
playing washed-up country star Bad Blake in
2010’s Crazy Heart, he’d had a career

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.430
that had spanned five decades and several
classic roles. He’d received four nominations

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.350
prior to this, but none of these were for
his most iconic role of all time. Comedies

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.210
are often overlooked by the Academy, but there’s
no denying that The Big Lebowski would not

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.750
be the cult favourite it is today were it
not for Bridge’s bang on hilarious performance

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.990
as the film’s lead. He may have won for
being Bad Blake, but Jeff Bridges will always

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:28.640
be The Dude to us.&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.950
Jennifer Lawrence for Silver Linings Playbook
2012 was a breakout year for Jennifer Lawrence.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.360
She picked up Katniss’ bow and arrow for
the first Hunger Games film and picked up

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.220
an Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook. While
she charmed her way into mainstream America’s

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.230
heart, more serious film fans already knew
her for the dark indie hit Winter’s Bone.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.610
At 20 years old, Lawrence gave an unflinching
performance as a young woman trying to keep

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.550
a roof over her dysfunctional family’s head.
Give the academy credit for going off the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.170
beaten path and giving Lawrence a nomination,
but she was still the new kid in town and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.710
the award went to the more established Natalie
Portman for Black Swan.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.970
Christian Bale for The Fighter&nbsp;
It’s no secret that Christian Bale goes

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.110
full tilt into any role he plays. Known for
his physical transformations, Bale took home

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.360
gold for his role as a drug addicted boxing
coach in The Fighter, but being gaunt and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.090
twitchy wasn’t nearly as impressive as what
he did with the Patrick Bateman character

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.500
for American Psycho ten years prior. Bale
shed his child star persona to play this pumped

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.610
up narcissistic psychopath with perfection
in a film that was probably a little too out

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:37.160
there for 
the Academy.&nbsp;

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.730
Russell Crowe for Gladiator&nbsp;
If Titanic taught us anything, it’s that

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.601
the Academy likes to reward box office success.
It seemed like this was the case in 2001 when

00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:50.320
Gladiator won Best Picture and Russell Crowe
took home the Oscar for his lead role as Maximus.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.320
While Crowe did nail some intense scenes in
this epic movie, it was primarily an action

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.910
hero role which came between nominations for
two performances widely considered as much

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:08.750
stronger demonstrations of his talent: The
Insider in 2000 and A Beautiful Mind in 2002.&nbsp;

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.300
Denzel Washington for Training Day
Russel Crowe and Denzel Washington should

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.690
probably just swap Oscars. In the year that
Crowe won for Gladiator, Washington was snubbed

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.200
for his tour de force performance as Ruben
Carter, a boxer who was wrongfully imprisoned

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.310
for almost 20 years. They both found themselves
in the race again the following year when

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.209
Washington beat out Crowe’s Beautiful Mind
performance with his over-the-top dirty cop

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.030
role in Training Day.&nbsp;

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.630
Jennifer Connelly&nbsp;for A Beautiful Mind
Crowe was about the only major player in A

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.900
Beautiful Mind who didn’t take home gold
that year. Ron Howard won best director and

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.950
Jennifer Connelly won best actress for playing
his wife. While Connelly did an admirable

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.500
job portraying Alicia Nash through the decades,
the intensity level never came close to what

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.510
she achieved in Requiem for a Dream two years
earlier. Her brave depiction of addiction

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.490
shocked viewers who still saw her as the little
girl for Labyrinth and established her an

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.540
actress with chops and longevity.&nbsp;

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.849
Al Pacino for Scent of a Woman&nbsp;
Al Pacino delivered Oscar nominated performances

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.410
in such modern classics as The Godfather,
The Godfather II, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.530
and Glengarry Glen Ross, so it may surprise
you to learn that the one he actually won

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.340
for was The Scent of a Woman. Sure the blind
retired army lieutenant gave us Pacino’s

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.620
trademark “whoo-ah”, but the hammy performance
hasn’t aged nearly as well as his more subdued

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:40.850
Michael Corleone.&nbsp;

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.810
Morgan Freeman for Million Dollar Baby&nbsp;
It seems like the Academy has a soft spot

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.120
for boxing films. In 2005, Million Dollar
Baby nearly swept all of the major categories,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.340
which meant a best supporting statue for Morgan
Freeman. A decade has past and most people

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.400
probably can’t quote a single line from
this film or even recall that Freeman narrated

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.590
it, yet his narration and character from The
Shawshank Redemption are forever etched into

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:11.181
the consciousness of the millions who hold
that film close to their heart. Red was the

00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:19.030
guy who could get it for ya, and Freeman definitely
delivered.&nbsp;

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.330
Sandra Bullock for the The Blind Side
In 2009 Sandra Bullock gave an impressive

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.590
performance as a woman who adopts a homeless
African American boy in The Blind Side, earning

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.900
herself an Oscar nod from the Academy. As
good as she was, the film was mostly carried

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.700
by its emotionally manipulative movie of the
week narrative, whereas a film like Gravity

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.220
really depended on Bullock’s performance
to carry us through. What was essentially

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.690
a one woman show in front of a green screen,
Bullock brought great gravitas to her role

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.400
in Gravity, while The Blind Side already feels
dated.&nbsp;

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.169
Leonardo DiCaprio for The Revenant&nbsp;
As the inspiration for this list, we’d be

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.290
remiss not to mention Leo. The trophy eluded
DiCaprio for so long that it became a running

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.740
joke and internet meme. Most of the press
around The Revenant was about the lengths

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.410
Leo went to for this role, and how it all
seemed like the actor was just clawing his

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.350
way towards Oscar glory. But by putting himself
in these real, harsh conditions, it would

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.139
seem that the role required more reacting
than actual acting. The character of Hugh

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.580
Glass didn’t feel as fully realized as some
of Leo’s past work, particularly What’s

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.090
Eating Gilbert Grape, the film that earned
Leo his first Oscar nomination at 19. As Arnie,

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.620
a mentally disabled teenager, DiCaprio created
a character that was funny, tragic, and heartfelt

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:39.770
whereas Glass was just… cold.
