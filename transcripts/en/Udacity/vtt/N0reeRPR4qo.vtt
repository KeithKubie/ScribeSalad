00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.216
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right, let's build off our knowledge from the last problem. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know

00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:08.656
that here we had an equal sign here last time, so when this was equal x had to

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:12.966
be two. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So there is one solution, but we don't have an equal sign here, we

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:17.336
have an in equality sign. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I want this right side to be larger than eight.

00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:21.496
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If x was two, I get eight. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that means if x was any number bigger than

00:00:21.496 --> 00:00:25.894
two, then this side would be larger than eight. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm going to try plugging in

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:29.650
3. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I plug in 3, I get 9 plus 2 on the right. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So 8 is less than 11. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.597
This is great. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a solution that works. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And in fact, any number

00:00:33.597 --> 00:00:37.468
bigger than 3 would give me a number larger than 8 when I plug in. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So,

00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:41.692
there's gotta be more than one solution. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; There's not just 1 or 2, there's

00:00:41.692 --> 00:00:45.784
infinitely many. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; There's more than three. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you choose this one, nice

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:50.709
work. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You might be skeptical just looking at this one solution. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let me

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:55.641
show you four. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; When I plug in 4, I get 8 is less than 12 plus 2, or 8 is less

00:00:55.641 --> 00:01:00.600
than 14. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Plugging in any number bigger than 2, like 3 4 5 or even 500 would

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.467
work. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's why there's infinitely many solutions here.
