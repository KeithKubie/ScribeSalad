00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.909
So my current research is focused on the spinnaker project

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.490
Spinnaker is a crude

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.989
Contraction of spiking Neural Network Architecture [well] the goal is [to] build a machine

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.630
incorporating a million arm processor cores

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.868
Which we can use for real-time brain modeling applications now with a million cores we only get to about

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.600
1% of the scale of the human Brain [or]

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.000
[as] I [prefer] to think of it 10

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.799
Whole mouse brains which gives you some idea of the scale of the problem that that we're taking on here

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.329
The physical machine occupies or will occupy 10 19-inch racks, so these are

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.040
Standard [datacenter] cases about 6 [to] 7 feet tall [a]

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.629
Bit over 90 inches wide and about a [metre] deep the machine will be built here in [Manchester] and be based in Manchester

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.820
We this stage we have one of those racks populated so a hundred thousand cores

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.980
Which is about one mouse brains worth in terms of Network complexity [of] course?

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.369
modeling a real mouse brain requires lots of biological detail that's that we won't be going into and

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.519
knowledge of the Network that doesn't currently exist, but

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.389
Just gives you a feel of the scale of network that we can model on the machine

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.368
the physical design of Spinnaker is really reasonably conventional and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.939
We have the chips each of which has 18 cores on

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.909
We mount 48 of those chips on the circuit board which is about the size of an A4 sheet of paper

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.209
so that gives you the [order] of a thousand processors on a circuit board and then we stack the

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.869
circuit boards in card frames, so they're plugged into

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.170
into standard racks

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.879
Quite close together and which we can do because we've been very careful to keep the power consumption under control

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.360
So there are no real [hotspots] on the board and therefore, it's quite

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.949
Easy to [air-cool] even when they're spaced quite closely together so [we] can get 24 boards across the width of a 19 inch card frame

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.159
And we can stack those

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.279
[5] frames high in A 19-inch rack

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.819
Including allowing space for cooling and so on and and that gives you

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.329
120 boards each with a and [864] processors, which is a hundred thousand?

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.020
over 100,000 processors in the 19-inch rack

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.749
so with the PCBs

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.820
Look pretty conventional. They're just lots of little black plastic packages and sold it together in a slightly unusual irregular array

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.239
The thing you'd notice about the board is it is highly regular I can show you one if you want it would love to see

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.809
One yeah is the one yeah yeah can we show [sigh] yeah, so this is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.110
One of the Spinnaker boards this one's packaged

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.630
in its own acrylic box

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.270
you can see the spinnaker chips the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.920
the name gives us an

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.729
Obvious logo of a spinnaker sail which is quite attractive and easy to put on the chip so you can see there are 48

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.999
Chips on this board it may look [like] they're arranged in a square, but actually

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.399
Topologically they're in a hexagon, so the board is a hexagonal sub surface of the toroid

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.110
the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.459
the boards have high speed connectors on the Edges and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.660
That allows us to connect multiple boards together to build the larger systems

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.110
So when we put a hundred thousand cause in a rack all the boards in that rocker arranged on a single continuous toroid

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.229
Which keeps the communication efficient.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.720
So, so this is a [nineteen] inch card frame with [twenty-four] spinnaker boards in twenty thousand arm processors

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.040
And you can see the boards are all linked together through high speed links which puts the chips into a continuous single

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.180
toroidal surface

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.519
And then the boards are connected through a network switch to an ethernet system. Which is

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.389
Used for loading software onto the machine on the top of the box

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.339
there's a robot with a single spinnaker card on its back the robot is built by

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.969
your conrad at the technical university of Munich and it has a couple of

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.249
vision Sensors from Toby dell Brook at the University of Zurich on the front and that can be used to build simple Neural robot

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.380
controllers that run on the spinnaker board

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.890
That's a [single-car]. That's basically controlling the robot twice eight hundred and sixty four processors. Which is more than

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.470
a robot will usually get

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:31.249
Are we going now? I'll show you the big machine. That's sir. Yes, so we're walking through the it building here and

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:42.088
So this is a [hundred-thousand] processor spinnaker machine

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:48.479
it has five [of] the card frames that we

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:56.129
Saw in the previous shot [and] now you can see the wiring that wires them together. That's got a lot more complicated and stringy

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:03.118
The primary problems is it all the wiring yes? It's quite complicated to wire it took a phd student

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.838
[four] hours to wire the machine up in the front the machine is basically connected [to] the ethernet

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.709
So you can control it remotely

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:17.518
You need some kind of host machine to compile the network on and you download it over the net onto

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:19.799
the Spinnaker machine itself and then

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:27.179
The thing then runs and the network evolves in real time even the small card frames a bit noisy

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.328
[we] were very careful about the power consumption that

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:35.729
It was still packing it together sufficiently densely that it needs a bit of a draft to keep it cool

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.698
Apart from the communications network the spinnaker architecture looks reasonably conventional is it's a massively parallel

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:50.129
Computer each node is an arm processor with a certain amount of code memory and a certain amount of Data memory

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:58.079
And so programming the processor caused themselves is reasonably conventional because we're aiming for real time

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:05.308
We use what's called an event-driven programming model. So instead of having a single program [that] runs and loops around

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:12.598
The programmer writes a number of event handlers which a little bit of little bits of code that get invoked

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:18.328
When particular events happen such as an incoming packet arrives from another neuron

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.569
That in that calls a little bit of code which says well

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.928
What do I do when this input spikes and what I do is I?

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:28.378
Look up the synapse is that are connected to that import?

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:32.129
And I pass the relevant level of signal through to the neurons that [are] modeled here

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.589
and

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:38.458
that may or may not cause some [of] those neurons to spike and if they do then I drop more packets into the fabric and

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:42.328
So on the design objective of spinnaker was to model about a thousand neurons

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:50.008
In real time on each arm core so with a million core machine we get to a billion neurons in total now

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:58.459
at the moment we're still tweaking the efficiency of [the] software and the current software implementation maps about

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.279
[256] Neurons to each core so so we aren't at the efficiency

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.609
We're ultimately aiming for but we're close the basis of human memory [is] not really well, understood

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.730
I mean computer memory is relatively very simple

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.169
We arrange a silicon structure and we have a cell where we can store a naught or a 1 and we know exactly where that

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.860
[information] is and if the cell breaks we lose that information

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.700
Human memory doesn't seem to be like that human memory seems to be much more distributed

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.020
we all

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.040
through adult life losing about a neuron a second

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:43.310
And so if he any in your wrong was critical to a memory then each neuron we lost will be some memory going

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.539
And that doesn't seem to be the case it seems to be that

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:55.759
[biology] has found ways [to] store information in distributed ways, so if you lose small components

00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:01.038
you don't lose the memory the aim of building the spinnaker machine was to contribute to the

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:08.090
Scientific ground challenge [of] understanding how the brain works we have we each have this thing inside our heads that

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.550
Is clearly vital to the way we perform our daily tasks

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.249
But we don't know how it works fundamentally as an information processor. We don't have

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:25.759
Deep Knowledge, we know lots about the fine detail about about the neurons and the cellular biology

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.849
And we know quite a lot about how activity moves around inside the head, but the interesting stuff about

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.080
For me as a computer scientist is how information is processed

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.549
And that's the levels that we can't access either from the bottom up or from the top down

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.219
So [really] the only instruments we have for

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.370
increasing our understanding are

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.380
computer models now of course

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.890
The computer models have to be informed by what we do know about

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.790
Neuroscience, so

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.990
so this work is very much a collaboration between

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.080
disciplines and Neuroscience computer science

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:04.878
psychology, all come into play with quite a lot of mathematics -

00:09:08.369 --> 00:09:10.160
It's a little bit similar to the yellow one

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.290
so we put it'll be closer to the yellow one and then comes another data item and no this is obviously quite similar to the

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.290
Yellow one to be put it closer to here

00:09:18.929 --> 00:09:21.169
don't want to just - something off, but I

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:28.548
Read it off make [sure] that my sentences are well constructed and spelled correctly and so on so it took a long time and it

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:30.649
Turned out that. I was spending

00:09:31.319 --> 00:09:34.969
You know I would start out with an idea of what I could do that day, and then four hours later
