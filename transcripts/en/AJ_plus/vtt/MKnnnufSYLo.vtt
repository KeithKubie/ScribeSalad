00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.130
The case of Thomas Drake represented a turning
point in the relationship between the executive

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.670
branch of government that stands over the
intelligence agencies and the actual, ordinary

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.380
Americans who comprise the workers of those
agencies.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.710
From Day One, when you enter on duty at any
of these places, it's beaten into you again

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.210
and again in policy training and in repeated
training requirements that if you see something

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.820
that's illegal, you see something that's unconstitutional,
waste, fraud and abuse, you have to stand

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.879
up and say something. You have not just the
right but the obligation to try to correct

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.030
those improper activities.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.920
And despite that, here we had a guy who did
absolutely everything right. He placed his

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.260
faith in the system. He saw, you know, the
warrantless wiretapping of hundreds of millions

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.740
of Americans, he saw corruption in procurement
processes and standards adoptions and things

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.650
like that.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.710
He brought it to the IG, he brought it to
the Congress. And rather than protecting him

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.750
against retaliation from some low-level manager
or whatever, they actively retaliated against

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.840
him in the most public and aggressive way
to send a message to everybody in the workforce

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.609
that things are different now.

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:43.560
What matters less is what's right and wrong,
and what matters more is who ordered it.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.200
We no longer had a system in the intelligence
agencies that was based on righting wrongs

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.560
at the lowest level and instead transitioned
to a system where, when you see something

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.939
wrong, you know the advice that you get is,
"That's above your pay grade. You need to

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.189
not worry about that."

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.520
It doesn't matter whether or not it looks
unconstitutional or unlawful to you, because

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.319
somebody somewhere said this is OK and you
simply have to accept that.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.790
And that lesson that the system is broken
is something that everybody – at every desk,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.400
in every agency – internalized immediately.
We all understood the shift, you know, we

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.840
could feel the wind changing, and that included
myself.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.660
It's fair to say that, if there hadn't been
a Thomas Drake, there couldn't have been an

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.980
Edward Snowden.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:46.670
And I think, as we move into the future, until
this changes, until these structures are reformed,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.310
the next whistleblower, you know, the next
person to stand up to real illegal activity

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.819
is probably going to have learned the same
lessons.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.659
When I realized what was going on with mass
surveillance, and in my own experience tried

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:15.599
to bring it forward and get somebody to address
these concerns, I encountered a very, very

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.680
different world from what was taught to us
in training.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.560
Every colleague that I discussed this with,
everybody in my supervisory chain, everybody

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.980
in leadership who saw these things said, "Wow,
you know, that is a problem. That doesn't

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.790
seem right. Seems like we've sort of gone
too far here."

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.920
And then immediately follow up with, "But
look, you really don't want to get involved

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.170
in this, you know that's not your job, let
this be somebody else's problem. If you put

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.549
your name on this, they're gonna destroy you."

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.200
And I think there's a tragedy in that, particularly
by how systemic it became, that in the wake

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.609
of Thomas Drake, how this became a part of
the institutional culture. In 2014, a year

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:12.519
after sort of I went public and the debate
about the operation of mass surveillance domestically

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.660
in the United States began, the inspector
general of the NSA at the time, George Ellard,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.550
did an interview with the press where he said,
you know, he really wished I had come to him

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.130
because, what he would have done was, he would
have made sure that none of this saw daylight.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.030
He would have told me that I just didn't understand
the programs, that these were completely lawful,

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.390
they were completely constitutional, and that
you know, we could, we could tamp this down,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.450
we could make sure that nobody hears about
this and all move on and continue with business

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.560
as usual, and I would have a very successful
career, you know, as long as I sat in place

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.730
and kept my mouth shut.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:05:00.010
But in 2015, those cases had finally been
litigated in the court, and the court said

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.380
that George Ellard was completely wrong – the
inspector general who said these programs

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.230
were constitutional and nobody should say
anything about them – [and the court] said

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.600
that not only were they likely unconstitutional,
they were Orwellian in scope, they were comprehensively

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.220
unlawful, they had to be stopped. And Congress,
which is the biggest cheerleader for the NSA

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.580
in the country, agreed.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.510
They actually shut down the program and prohibited
the NSA from collecting Americans' communications

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.220
in this way.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:42.690
The questions that linger most powerfully
for me about the Tom Drake case and the comments

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.830
of, you know, the NSA inspector general and
the DOJ and everybody who's institutionalized

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:58.090
this, this war on whistleblowers, is that:
If the institutions that are meant to curtail

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.330
the unlawful or unconstitutional operations
of government instead become complicit in

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:24.440
suppressing them, what does that mean for
the future? Where do we go?
