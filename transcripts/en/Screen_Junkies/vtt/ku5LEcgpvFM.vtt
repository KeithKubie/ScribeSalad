00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.980
Before you see the movie about an evil fictional technology company,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.120
see the story of Facebook: a real-life evil 
technology company.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.980
The Social Network

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.120
Experience the world's smartest film about
 the world's dullest premise

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.500
"Did you answer affirmatively when Tyler 
and Cameron Winklevoss

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.420
and Divya Narendra asked you to build harvard connection?"

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.880
"Did you say yes?"

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.740
In this dark Shakespearean drama about the website you're crazy aunt post minion memes on.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.720
That uses snappy dialogue.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.120
I deserve your attention -You have part
 of my attention. You have the minimum amount.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.260
Slick directing and great performances to make a story

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.580
where young millionaires sue each other for more money feel really high stakes

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.580
What was honorship share ?dialuded? down to?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.500
"Point zero three percent"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.720
That's still millions you greedy a**hole! C'mon, I'd sell my kidneys for point zero three percent of Neopets

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.320
Journey to Harvard, 
where no one ever lets you forget.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.760
It's Harvard.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.060
"This is John Harvard. -We're gentlemen of Harvard."

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.280
Girls wanna get with guys who go to Harvard."

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.020
Harvard.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.540
Harvard.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.080
Harvard.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.580
Harvard.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.380
"This is Harvard."

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.140
And meet Mark Zuckerberg, a star student with a mind of a calculator, the heart of a troll

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.300
"Erica Albright's a bitch."

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.480
And the wardrobe of a comfy hobo.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.480
He's determined to do two things with his life

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.480
Make a world respect him and
 make sure Jesse Eisenberg

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.920
gets every awkward Know-it-All nerd Role in Hollywood.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.320
Take that Michael Cera! "Ha!"

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.380
Coasting off Mark's talent are a succession
 of hot dudes in suits, like:

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.660
Eduardo, the only Brazilian
 who doesn't know how to party.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.199
"You think this is such a good idea?"

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.800
"You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down before we get into trouble?"

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.400
"You want to end the party at 11." 
"I'm trying to pay for the party."

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.200
Sean Parker, the man on the side 
who gets in the way of their bromance

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.740
And the 'Winklevii', who briefly got your hopes up that Armie Hammer had an identical twin.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.400
Or to put it another way...

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.360
Lex Luthor dumped Spider-Man for N-Sync and pisses off the Lone Ranger

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.640
If you want to know the real story behind Facebook,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.760
watch something else, because they're bending the truth harder than the news your uncle posts on his wall

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.640
In a film that makes up the ex-girlfriend who 
supposedly inspired the site.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.200
Makes up an obsession with final clubs 
that tears Mark's friendships apart.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.300
"Tell me this isn't about getting into 'The Phoenix'?"

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.980
And makes him into an awkward scowling 
robot where in real life

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.389
he was a normal dorky college kid. 
-"Within a couple of weeks

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.230
Two thirds of the school had signed up

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.900
So, at that point, my roommates are kinda like,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.420
'you know, this is pretty cool' 
like whether this work at other schools."

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.560
But hey, don't let facts get in the way

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.960
I'm sure the real Sean Parker love seeing himself as a paranoid,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960
coked-out, cowardly, maybe sorta statutory rapist.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.360
"How old are they, Sean?" -"It's not polite to ask." 
-"Sean how old are they?"

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.960
So gather round for a film that's not really about Facebook.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.620
It's about friendship, that still nails what 
t's like to use the website

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.320
In this masterpiece of craft that proves Aaron Sorkin could make boring litigation exciting

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.040
"You stole our whole goddamn idea" -"Fellas..."

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.280
David Fincher could make applying for 
an internship look awesome.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.760
"Welcome to Facebook."

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.040
And Trent Reznor could make rowing down a calm river feel epic

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.400
[Electronic version of "In the Hall of the Mountain King" plays]

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.240
'Man, I wish they'd make another Facebook movie', is a sentence. I never thought I'd say in this lifetime

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.820
Starring...

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.830
Jesse Eisenberg as himself

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.680
Andrew Garfield, the Brazilian Jew?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.400
Tim, from Jurassic Park

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.000
The cloned ranger

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.270
A single shade of Gray

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.240
He's a dick who knows DOS

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.960
And all the laptops who gave their lives so David fincher could get the perfect shot.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.600
Site club

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.100
[Chat nearly muted out by club music]

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.500
I know it's realistic and everything, but trying to understand Sorkin dialogue at a loud bar,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.820
is like your grandma trying
 to understand how Facebook works.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.060
"No, Nana, ugh, the search bar is not the same as the status update. Gah!"
