00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
I’m here in uh Tonopah…and 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:11.533
I’m here in Tonopah, Nevada and we stayed last night at a fairly infamous motel 

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.833
 A place called the Clown Motel 

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:17.400
 and here it is

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.600
 It’s a little bit hard to capture 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.733
 with standard photos so 

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:31.233
I thought I would try to use this 360 camera... 

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:42.800
 ...what you can’t see right now is the old miner’s cemetery 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.533
 just off to the right of me.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:51.866
 Each room comes supplied with clown portraits. 

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:55.866
 Catering to bikers, truckers and other long haul travelers 

00:00:55.866 --> 00:01:00.100
 the Clown Motel is final port of call before another long stretch of unbroken desert. 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:10.766
The check-in room we are approaching has over 700 clowns in it 

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:19.699
The entire office is covered in shelves and bookcases full of dolls, statues, and stuffed clowns. 

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:27.300
A full sized clown sits in the corner.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.699
 It is a mirthful menagerie staring down at you from every angle. 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.933
Remarkably, there are not many stories, horror or otherwise about the Clown Motel 

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:47.533
 It is possible that this paucity of history is because is simply arose, fully formed 

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:55.000
from the dark parts of the American subconscious...

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:04.000
Or it could be because so few have made it out alive…
