00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.780
I'm now going to telephone
a colleague of mine

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.180
and he happens to be
the director of research

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.940
of the Post Office.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.760
And with a bit of luck
I'll be able to telephone him here.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.560
I'll have a go anyway.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.760
I'll switch it on
and you can hear the noise.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.480
And I'm now going to dial,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.860
[MECHANICAL CLICKING NOISE]

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.080
you can hear it.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.360
[RINGING NOISE]

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.700
[STATIC NOISE]

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.920
He's answered, hello Professor Bray?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.000
[SLIGHTLY DISTORTED AUDIO]
– Hello Geoffrey, how good to see you
as well as hear you.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.760
– Well isn't it remarkable,
now this is a surprise

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.720
you see, I pick up a telephone
and now I see you sitting there.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.220
Professor Bray look, we're going to want
to talk to you a little more

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.180
about this remarkable thing
the videophone.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.000
But I've just been talking
about fibre optics and I think

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.620
that you at [INAUDIBLE] are rather
interested in fibre optics too,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.620
am I right?

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.380
– We are indeed Geoffrey,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.220
and I shouldn't be surprised
one day you know,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.480
to see these viewphone pictures
coming into people's homes

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.980
through a glass fibre.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.400
But not only that of course,
providing them with telephone communication

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.500
and vision communication
as well.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.160
– How very interesting.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.940
Well now look there's
somebody here I think

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.200
would like to ask you a question.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.380
Yes here we are.
Now if I press this button

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.640
'self-view' I believe,
I can see myself

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.496
and with a bit of luck
I'm going to see you too.

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:40.060
so I'm going to try it .

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.180
And you come down,
oh there we can see each other.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.760
And you can still see us?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.140
– Yes I can see you fine.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.100
Well isn't that remarkable.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.200
Now you ask a question
we'll go back to Professor Bray.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.140
You ask, what was your question?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.200
Oh yes you want the phone don't you,
of course.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.040
– Hello sir

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.980
– Hello Matthew

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.600
– Can you tell me when video phones
will be in our homes?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.960
Well the one we're using now Matthew
is quite an experimental one,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.340
and it'll take a few years
to turn this into a device

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.860
which is low enough in cost
for people to use on a large scale

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.380
but it will not be many years
I think before a view phone

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.980
will come into service.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.860
– How much will it cost?

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.880
– Well that's rather a difficult question
at this stage,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.240
clearly it's got be a cost that
people can afford

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.360
in terms of the service
the view phone will provide.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.680
– Thank you very much.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.720
– Thank you Matthew.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.120
Well thank you very much John,
a couple of very awkward questions

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.480
when are thing's
right in the research phase.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.420
[LAUGHS]

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.820
– It is in the research phase
as you say Geoffrey, but

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.204
there are many developments
of viewphone that I think

00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:52.880
would interest people,
I expect it to be able to provide

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.120
in clear, high definition,
copies of documents for example.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.740
And by pressing a button
to get a printed copy when you want it.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.760
– How very useful.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.360
– For business people you see,
as well as people in the home,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.860
I think this is going to be
a very important communication tool

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.720
of the future.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.740
– Well I'm gonna say
thank you very much John

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.740
for talking to us and hang up,
good bye.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.460
–Thank you Geoffrey, good bye.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.500
– Switch it off.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500
[APPLAUSE]
