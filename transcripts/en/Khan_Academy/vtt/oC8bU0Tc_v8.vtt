00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:02.291
- [Instructor] Here we have
an actual free response

00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:05.405
question from a previous
AP economics exam.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:08.306
And it tells us, utility
and price elasticity

00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:10.384
of demand are important concepts

00:00:10.384 --> 00:00:12.691
in explaining consumer behavior.

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.187
I buy that.

00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:17.192
Now, part A, they say
define marginal utility.

00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:18.556
So before I do that, pause the video

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:19.731
and at least think about it.

00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:21.283
How do you define it in your head?

00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:22.938
Or even better, try to
write it down in words

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:24.197
because this is what you would actually

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:26.795
have to do on an AP exam.

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:29.966
So we have defined it in
previous videos in more depth,

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.255
but if I were taking the exam,

00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:33.066
I would write something like,

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.399
the incremental,

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:38.222
incremental benefit,

00:00:40.148 --> 00:00:42.231
or gain, or satisfaction,

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:46.969
satisfaction

00:00:48.403 --> 00:00:49.986
from one more unit,

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:52.599
from one more unit

00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:57.784
of something.

00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:02.542
I think that is a good definition

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:05.645
of a shorthand for marginal utility.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.106
And the marginal tells us that's what's

00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:09.963
for the next thing, not in total,

00:01:09.963 --> 00:01:11.935
but just for the next thing
that you're gonna get,

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:15.298
how much gain or satisfaction
are you going to have.

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:16.798
Now let's try part B.

00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:19.099
The table below shows
the quantities, prices,

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:20.972
and marginal utilities of two goods,

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:23.769
fudge and coffee, which Mandy purchases.

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:25.721
So we see, I guess so far she's bought

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:28.754
10 pounds of fudge and
seven pounds of coffee.

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:29.870
Fudge is $2 a pound.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.746
Coffee is $4 a pound.

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:33.037
And then the marginal utility

00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:37.453
of the last pound of fudge
is 12, is 20 for coffee.

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:38.778
And this is interesting because you notice

00:01:38.778 --> 00:01:40.774
marginal utility doesn't have units.

00:01:40.774 --> 00:01:42.774
It tends to be unit-less

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.897
or it kind of has your
marginal utility units.

00:01:46.897 --> 00:01:50.837
And what matters more
is how it might compare

00:01:50.837 --> 00:01:52.895
from the first pound to the second pound,

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:55.127
as opposed to the absolute value here.

00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:57.620
But we're gonna, I'm suspecting
before even reading this,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.139
that we're gonna make
use of this in some way

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.113
in this next part of this question.

00:02:02.113 --> 00:02:06.134
Mandy spends all her money
and buys only these two goods.

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:08.583
In order to maximize her utility,

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:10.235
maximize her utility,

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:13.818
should Mandy purchase more
fudge and less coffee,

00:02:13.818 --> 00:02:16.163
purchase more coffee and less fudge,

00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:19.918
or maintain her current consumption?

00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:20.751
Explain.

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:23.546
Okay, so some of you
might immediately say,

00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:24.379
all right, I'm just gonna look at

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.057
how much gain, satisfaction she gets

00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:31.347
for the next pound of coffee
versus the next pound of fudge.

00:02:31.347 --> 00:02:34.526
It looks pretty clear
that 20 is higher than 12.

00:02:34.526 --> 00:02:35.715
And so you'd say, all right,

00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:38.843
she should just buy more coffee.

00:02:38.843 --> 00:02:40.613
But that would be a mistake.

00:02:40.613 --> 00:02:43.740
And to realize it, let me
give you another example.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.740
If your marginal utility

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.004
of a Rolls-Royce is going to be higher

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.598
than your marginal
utility of a strawberry,

00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:55.204
so if you use that logic that you just

00:02:55.204 --> 00:02:57.343
directly compare marginal utilities,

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:58.424
you would always buy more

00:02:58.424 --> 00:03:00.630
Rolls-Royces and less strawberries.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.167
And the key idea here is, what matters is

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.486
marginal utility per dollar,

00:03:05.486 --> 00:03:08.569
or marginal utility divided by price.

00:03:09.512 --> 00:03:10.583
Then, all of a sudden,

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:12.492
a strawberry might be able to compete

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.560
a little bit more with a Rolls-Royce.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.576
So we want to do the
exact same thing here.

00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:17.844
And on a test like the AP exam,

00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:19.752
you definitely wanna show your work.

00:03:19.752 --> 00:03:22.585
So let's say for fudge, for fudge,

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:27.172
we could calculate the marginal utility

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:29.932
per price is going to be equal to,

00:03:29.932 --> 00:03:31.771
here they give the
utility of the last pound.

00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:32.710
I guess this could be indicative

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.279
of also the next pound.

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.641
So this is going to be 12 divided by $2,

00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:40.196
which is equal to six.

00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:42.529
And then for coffee, coffee,

00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:47.602
it is the marginal
utility divided by price,

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.956
is going to be equal to 20

00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:52.702
divided by four, which is equal to five.

00:03:52.702 --> 00:03:55.113
And so I would say that Mandy,

00:03:55.113 --> 00:03:56.488
so I would circle that,

00:03:56.488 --> 00:03:59.728
and I would say, so I would say,

00:03:59.728 --> 00:04:01.061
Mandy should buy

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.972
or purchase more fudge,

00:04:06.972 --> 00:04:08.139
buy more fudge

00:04:11.278 --> 00:04:13.861
to maximize her utility because

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.713
the marginal utility per dollar

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.233
is higher than coffee.

00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:30.278
And we'd be done.
