I have never known a dead man
who gets himself in more (bleep)

I just want to say that
for the record.

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.916
<i> hinting that the War on Drugs
 had a hidden purpose--</i>

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.218
<i> that President Nixon saw
 the drug crackdown</i>

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:22.188

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.526
<i> they were lying about drugs.</i>

-(audience oohing)
-Now... I know, I know.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:32.398
This may sound shocking
to a lot of people out there,

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.201
but to most black people,
this just confirms

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.336
what they
already suspected, okay?

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.439
Now, to give
his thoughts on this,

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.141

let's go out to Mike Yard

Okay, uh, Mike...

Mike, your thoughts
on the Nixon aide's admission

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.621
that the War on Drugs
was based on lies

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.824
and really about
oppressing black people.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.792
Yeah, no (bleep).

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:00.893
WILMORE:
Okay.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:02.361
Sounds about right.

That's the shortest
news program ever.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.286
Now, the Nixon aide in question
is the late John Ehrlichman,

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.756
who admitted that the
War on Drugs was created in 1971

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.825
to silence Nixon's
greatest opposition groups.

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:34.561
Ehrlichman said-- and I quote...

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:46.339
<i> I know.</i>

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.474
Now, look, guys,
I just got to say,

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:51.911
I have to formally apologize
to any conspiracy brother

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:55.414

a conspiracy that I dismissed.

the moon landing, at this point.

Yeah, which I-I just assume
was produced by Paramount.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.990
You're right, brother,
you're right.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:06.692
Sorry, Buzz, that was
some good acting, okay?

if the man was able to pull off
such an elaborate conspiracy

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:41.861

then that must mean...

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.530

Nixon chose to keep black folks
under control

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.839
by arresting their leaders,
raiding their homes,

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.941

I'm telling you, America,

Because, to be clear,

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.571
if Trump gets elected,

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:40.005
it's the American people

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:42.371
who are the hell
and the high water.
