00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.290
Let's practice computing these costs and

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.920
extracting the alignment
with an exercise.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.810
We'll align SNOWY with SUNNY,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.180
and we'll use an alpha value of 1.5 for
flipping a character.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.800
This makes flipping a character more
expensive than an insertion or deletion.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.640
Compute the minimum cost by
filling out this table here, and

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.900
write out the alignment here
using a single dash to indicate

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.410
where a character isn't matched.
