ListView and GridView are perfect
if you want to scroll through a list

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.861
or a grid of items separately.

00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:15.121
But what if you want to list
and grid this scroll together

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:18.168
or create some other complex 
scrolling effect?

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.438
That's what SliverList
and SliverGrid are for!

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:24.608
A Sliver is just a portion
of a scrollable area

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:27.400
and goes inside a custom scroll view.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.229
Because Slivers can lazily build each item
just as it scrolls into view,

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.917
Slivers are particularly useful

00:00:32.917 --> 00:00:36.111
for efficiently scrolling through
large numbers of children.

00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:38.166
SliverList takes a <i>delegate</i> parameter,

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.541
which provides the items in the list
as they scroll into view.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:46.020
You can specify the actual list of children
with a <i>SliverChildListDelegate</i>.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.731
Or build them lazily
with a <i>SliverChildBuilderDelegate</i>.

00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:52.860
SliverGrids also can specify
children with a <i>delegate</i>,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.557
or an explicit list.

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:59.001
But there's some additional formatting
for the <i>crossAxis</i> dimension on a grid.

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.369
Use the <i>count</i> constructor

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.750
to specify how many items
across the grid it should contain.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.167
Or specify the maximum width of items

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:08.722
to determine how many
you should fit across a grid

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.861
with the <i>extent</i> constructor.

00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:14.850
