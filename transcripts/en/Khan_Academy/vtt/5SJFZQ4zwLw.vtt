00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.516
- [Instructor] Where we left
off in the last few videos

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:05.875
we saw the Empire of the Mongols

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:09.196
fragment into the various Khanates.

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.478
In the east you have the Yuan Dynasty

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.387
established by Kublai Khan.

00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:15.468
And then in the west you
have the Golden Horde,

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:18.076
the Chagatai Khanate
and then the Ilkhanate

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:21.631
in much of the Middle East and Persia.

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.429
Now as we go a little bit
further into the 14th century,

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.332
and in particular the
1330s, you might remember

00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:32.051
when we studied Europe, that
the bubonic plague hits,

00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:35.253
and it doesn't just hit
Europe, it hits Asia.

00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:39.317
And one of the causes often
given for the rapid spread

00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:43.493
is that you had relative
stability formed by these Khanates

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:46.644
so that trade was able to
happen, but with that trade

00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:49.644
you also have the spread of disease.

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:52.821
And so the bubonic
plague, or the Black Death

00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:56.117
of the 1330s, in particular does damage

00:00:56.117 --> 00:00:59.879
to the Ilkhanate in Persia
and the Middle East.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.545
Not only the Emperor but his sons

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:04.956
all die from the bubonic plague.

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:07.711
And so you see here on
this timeline the Ilkhanate

00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:11.933
goes into a rapid decline
because of the Black Death.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.261
And at the same time,
in the southwest corner

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:18.428
of the Chagatai Khanate, a
future conqueror is born.

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:24.673
Timur, which means iron,
he's often known as Timurlane

00:01:24.673 --> 00:01:27.189
because when he was young he was injured

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.831
in both the hand and leg
by arrows which impaired

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:32.731
his movement and which
is why the Europeans

00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:37.430
called him Timur the Lame,
which became Timurlane.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.625
But despite his physical
impairments he's able to conquer

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:44.950
much of the Chagatai Khanate eventually

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.117
and the Ilkhanate and
establish a dynasty of his own.

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:54.269
The Empire gets established
in 1370 when he gets

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:58.630
effective power over much of
the western Chagatai Khanate.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.828
He comes from a Turko-Mongol tradition.

00:02:01.828 --> 00:02:05.173
Now you'll hear these
terms Turko-Mongol a lot,

00:02:05.173 --> 00:02:07.380
because even though the Mongols conquered

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.660
this large swath of territory, they did so

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.021
with the significant help of people

00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:16.283
speaking Turkic languages
from central Asia,

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:20.727
Turkish being the most well
known of the Turkic languages.

00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:22.625
And so many of the conquerors,

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.030
especially the Muslim conquerors

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.947
of central Asia and Persia of this period

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.614
are of a Turko-Mongol ethnicity.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.522
Even though there's no
evidence of him being

00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:38.116
a direct descendant of
Genghis Khan, or Genghis Khan,

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:41.092
he views himself as the successor,

00:02:41.092 --> 00:02:44.842
he wants to recreate
the great Mongol Empire.

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:48.974
By the time of Timur's
death, the Timurid Empire

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:52.788
encompasses much of Persia, central Asia,

00:02:52.788 --> 00:02:55.538
the Caucasus and the Middle East.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.787
His legacy is a bloody one,
as he expanded territory

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:01.757
and took over cities it was not uncommon

00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:05.317
for his soldiers to kill tens,
if not hundreds of thousands

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:09.925
of civilians who revolted
against Timur's rule.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:12.908
His forces famously attacked
the Delhi Sultanate,

00:03:12.908 --> 00:03:17.574
not hoping to conquer India,
but to take its spoils.

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:22.317
In 1398 he was able to
successfully defeat the Sultan

00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:25.739
who had battle elephants and
he was able to defeat them

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.116
by sending camels that had flames

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:30.652
on their backs to scare the elephants.

00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:33.509
And famously, when his forces took Delhi,

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.592
they killed 100,000 to 200,000 people

00:03:37.525 --> 00:03:40.192
and took the spoils of the city.

00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:45.157
There are some estimates
that Timur's forces killed

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:49.324
as many as 17 million people
as the Empire expanded.

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.243
To put this into
perspective, this is roughly

00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:57.410
five percent of the world's
population at that time.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.843
Now once Timur dies in
1405, you can see from

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:06.926
this timeline that the
Empire does not last long,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.051
as we get to the second half of

00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:12.968
the 15th century, it is in decline.

00:04:14.373 --> 00:04:16.988
Now some of his descendants
end up ruling over

00:04:16.988 --> 00:04:19.891
fragmented portions of this Empire,

00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:22.141
and as we get into the 16th century

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:24.817
we'll see one descendant in particular,

00:04:24.817 --> 00:04:28.487
his grandson's great grandson takes on

00:04:28.487 --> 00:04:32.230
the Delhi Sultanate and
established the Mughal,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.494
which is Persian for
Mongol, establishes the

00:04:35.494 --> 00:04:38.244
Mughal Empire in northern India.
