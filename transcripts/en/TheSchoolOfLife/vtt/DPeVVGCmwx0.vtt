00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
People have been making pornography for a very long time.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.500
It's been on the sides of temples in India,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.160
on Greek vases, in Roman bedrooms,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.000
in German drawing rooms.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.700
But a decisive moment in it's history came in 1839

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.200
with the french artist Louis Daguerre's invention of the photograph,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.520
known at first as the daguerreotype,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.400
which transformed the availability and realism of sexual imagery.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.820
It was not long before the new technology

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.340
was being put to use to explore a variety of explicit scenarios.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.560
One of the earliest,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.460
a series of lesbian encounters,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.080
was made in Paris in the spring of 1844.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.060
For a time the pictures were extremely expensive.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.500
In the early 1850s

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.940
one daguerreotype cost a week's salary for a French worker.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.780
It would point that one observer

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.400
have been cheaper to hire a prostitute for the day

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.380
than to buy an image of her.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.540
But prices eventually came down

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.440
and the trade grew exponentially.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.480
By 1860 there were estimated to be 400 shops selling pornographic photos in Paris.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.880
They were available in packs of 5

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.620
on sale from an army of women

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.240
who kept them under their dresses at all the big train stations.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.220
Heterosexual packs typically contains a selection of nude poses,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.420
some cunnilingus,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.000
some anal sex and some light bondage.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.800
Looking at the images there can be a basic surprise,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.840
a symptom of our agonistic sense of uniqueness

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.140
that they could truly have got up to this sort of thing.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.740
Our ideas of the past are likely to be so dominated by thoughts of politics,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.880
warfare and the machinations of horterly atired aristocrats,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.200
it can take a moment to remember that our ancestors were, of course, far more than this:

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.860
there was a lot of cunnilingus

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.100
and a good deal of anal in the year of the great exhibition

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.320
and the charge of the Light Brigade.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.180
History teachers are always attempting to bring the past to life.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.680
They try, in a quest for a more intimate sort of history,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.460
to show us what houses looked like

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.940
and what an evening meal might have consisted of.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.940
They know how much top hats can inhibit our powers of empathy.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.720
But there is no quicker way to bring the 19th century vividly to our imagination,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.569
no more efficient bridge across centuries,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.500
than to be confronted by tangible evidence that they were, in their deepest self,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.310
despite all the Gulf and ideology and manners,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.540
substantially just like us

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.760
in our more explicit and most animate moments.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.540
We may even start to look at other centuries and times with newfound empathy.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.760
Beneath the forbidding exterior of the 16th century Doge Andrea Gritti,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.900
painted by Titian,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
with someone who might have shared the gamut of our interests.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.640
We may have to rely on Alessio Baldovinetti's portrait

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.000
for an idea of a fifteenth-century Florentine lady,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.660
but (empowered by the lessons of nineteenth-century porn)

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.700
we can guess that things would not really have been so formal and so otherworldly.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.140
Our peculiar and extreme sexual imaginations

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.760
(with all the complications and joy they give us)

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.880
have been thrumming within our species long before YouPorn.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.200
We can feel at once connected up to our ancestors,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.800
and less frightened of having lost our innocence

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.520
at the hands of our new technologies.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.920
There's something else about photography

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.540
with particular indications for pornography.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.020
Photography's genius lies in it's ability to offer us a sense of what feels like the present.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.620
It is a frozen moment of time,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.400
rescued from the dissolving force of the years.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.340
But this is also what makes photography especially poignant

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.100
when it's viewed across decades or centuries.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.840
We sense with particular clarity the vivasity and immediacy of people in old photos.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.440
Against which the one irrevocable fact we have in mind

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.900
(that they've all died)

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.760
then stands out with touching starkness.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.160
Their photographic liveliness makes their eventual deaths all the more tangible.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.820
Here are two people chatting in a street in London in the 1870s.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.700
For a moment they live again

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.580
and then they (and everything about their world)

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.840
is washed away in the river of time.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.800
As far as the eye can see, there are people stretched out on a Coney Island beach in the 1920s.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.500
Fit, beautiful energetic, with plans for dinner, a sense of fun, worries and intrigue.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.720
Every one of them swept into oblivion by the tsunami of history.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.480
The poignancy is even more acute around photographs of children.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.660
They have, as they gaze at us, so much of a future ahead of them

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.740
and yet already it is gone.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.920
Everything they were was eventually reduced to nothing.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.100
Without knowing quite how it could happen (we never do),

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.940
they grew, married, became little old ladies

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.520
and were laid out in their coffins one day.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.560
All these feelings tend to be heightened with porn,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.040
because having sex is the ultimate activity of the moment

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.600
when we stand to forget time and lose ourselves in the present,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.080
absorbed by everything that is contrary to the implacable eternal.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.640
The figures in the porn of the 19th century are our contemporaries,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.040
they're no different from us

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.800
(sucking, thrusting, defiling, lost in the emotions of now)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.120
and we will eventually go just the way they went.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.600
Yet there is in porn also heroic and redemptive defiance of the grim future.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.240
In their moment of pleasure,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.460
the figures are denying what's going to happen.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.920
They don't, right now, care that they will grow old and die...

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.920
and perhaps they are inviting us not to either.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.500
We can watch them holding onto their pleasures

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.180
and simultaneously hold onto our own with newfound gratitude.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.660
These people weren't awed by their negligible place in the implacable movement of the centuries;

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.400
they had a penis to suck,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.200
a vagina to explore, some stockings to put on...

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.100
and, for a time, wisely knew how to forget the upcoming apocalypse.
