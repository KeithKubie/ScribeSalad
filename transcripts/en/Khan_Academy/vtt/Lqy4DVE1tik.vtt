00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.800
- Let's talk about third
parties in the United States.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.890
And I put the word
third in quotation marks

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.980
because there's more than one third party.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.600
So you could even think
of it as a third, fourth,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.440
fifth, sixth and seventh parties.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.850
But the reason why
people say third parties

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.250
is because in the United States,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.660
you have two dominant parties.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.340
You have the Republicans
and you have the Democrats.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.080
And so any other party is
considered to be a third party

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.700
after those first two
big, dominant parties.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.780
So here are some of the
logos of some of the,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.990
I would say, major third
parties in the United States.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.920
And I'm gonna put major in quotes

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.730
because they don't have much of a say

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.320
in our government today.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.890
You have the Libertarian Party,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.780
that is very focused on
people's individual liberties.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.760
They generally think about the government

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.440
doing as little as possible.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.620
That whenever the government
strives to get bigger,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.300
it infringes on people's liberties,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.890
either in the economic sphere
or in the social sphere.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.780
The Green Party is also
very pro-civil liberties,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.920
but you can also imagine,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.500
because it's called the Green Party,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.820
it is very concerned with the environment.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.580
Now, this third, third party,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.560
and there's many more
than just these three.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.370
This is the Reform Party.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.640
And the Reform Party is really interesting

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.410
because it was started
by Ross Perot in 1995.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.290
And this was after, in 1992,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.850
Ross Perot ran as an Independent
candidate for President.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.690
And he did surprisingly well.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.850
He got nearly 20 percent
of the popular vote.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.910
But an interesting question is

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.440
even though he got 20 percent
of the popular vote in 1992,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.130
and even though in the Reform Party,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.520
it had some reasonable support
even in the 1996 election,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.830
how come we don't see Congress people

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.870
who represent the Reform Party?

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.180
And there's two real answers here.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.130
One is, the winner-take-all system.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.120
Winner - take - all.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.530
So if we're dealing with a situation

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
where even if a third party
gets 20 percent of the vote,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.710
they're not going to get
any representation for it.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.010
And you can contrast that

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.150
with a proportional representation system

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.200
like you have in some Parliaments.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.370
So in some countries,
their Parliament is elected

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.400
by proportional representation.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.670
So let's say that 20 percent vote for

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.290
Party A.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.350
Let's say 70 percent vote for

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.090
Party B.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.970
And then the remainder, 10
percent, vote for Party C.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.070
In a Parliamentary proportional
representation system,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.790
Party C would get roughly
10 percent of the seats

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.170
in the Parliament.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.070
But that's not the way it
works in our government.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.430
In our government, in
almost any jurisdiction,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.690
if you had a voter breakdown like this,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.140
well, Party B would win.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.910
Or maybe sometimes Party A would win,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.380
and even if Party C does get some votes,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.950
it's never going to cross the threshold

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.290
to actually get representation.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.880
Now, with that said, this
doesn't fully explain

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.080
why we don't we see more
third party representation

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.800
in say the United States Congress.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.060
Because there are countries that have more

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.660
third party representation,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.590
even though they don't have
proportional representation.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.410
Now another reason that's often cited for

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.450
why we don't see third
party representation

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.770
is that the major parties,
the Republicans and Democrats

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.850
oftentimes incorporate
the third party's messages

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.793
into their own.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.670
To get a sense of this, I'm gonna show you

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.200
a little bit of an excerpt
from a Reform Party ad in 1996.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.240
And at that time, they were saying things

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.030
that neither the Democrats
or the Republicans

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.520
were saying very strongly.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.530
And I want you to think
about, when you hear it,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.070
whether some of those
messages have, later on,

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.440
become parts of either the
Republican or the Democratic

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.210
candidate's messages.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.160
- Washington is selling our
future to the special interests.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.890
- Don't waste your vote on
someone who will sell you out.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.530
- Ross Perot is the only
candidate who will work

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.310
- For our interests, instead
of the special interests.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.860
- Just vote for Ross.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.430
- Because you own this country.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.220
- So as you saw in that
ad from the Reform Party,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.540
there's a lot of talk about

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.400
the influence of special interests

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.790
and how people need to
take their government back.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.730
And if you fast-forward to the
2016 Presidential election,

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.040
you had two major forces,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.670
actually one on the Republican side

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.880
and one on the Democratic side.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.480
On the Republican side,
you have Donald Trump,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.120
who's echoing the need to
focus on special interests.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.470
That Washington is a swamp,
that it needs to be drained.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.250
It wasn't obvious from that ad,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.150
but Ross Perot in 1992 was
ringing the alarm bells

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.980
about NAFTA and free trade and saying

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.880
why it would be bad for the United States.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.090
And in 2016, you heard
many of these same things

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.380
from the Republican
candidate, Donald Trump.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.090
Same thing with Bernie Sanders
on the Democratic side.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.360
He echoed the need to take
a second look at free trade.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.363
And that special interests
had taken over Washington.
