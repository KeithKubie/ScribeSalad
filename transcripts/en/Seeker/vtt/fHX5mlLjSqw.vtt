00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.380
Ever take you dog to the vet to get dewormed?

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.370
Yeah fun facts, humans get worms too.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.470
Lots of them.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.670
So what are these parasites inside us?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.469
hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.230
Worms are some of the least loved creatures
on this planet.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.380
From earthworms, to the parasites that live
inside of us, they just seem creepy, crawly

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.380
and slimy.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.689
But as disgusting as they are, we’ve evolved
with them, and getting rid of them completely,

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.010
might just make us sick.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.930
But first, let’s talk about how these parasitic
worms do harm to our bodies.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.210
Pinworms, a small intestinal parasite, which
the Journal of Dermatology says 30-50% of

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.630
the world has, doesn’t often cause serious
illness but can cause some uncomfortable itching...when

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.330
it comes out of your anus to lay its eggs.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.860
We get tapeworms, another intestinal parasite,
that sneaks into our bodies when we eat undercooked

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.280
beef or pork.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.180
They cause stomach pains, nausea, and weight
loss.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.650
Hookworms latch onto the insides of your intestines
and suck out the blood.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.350
Which can lead to anemia, slower cognitive
growth, and malnutrition.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.730
And whipworm, which in heavy infestations
cause intestinal problems like diarrhea and

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.730
dysentery.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.240
Yet probably the most dreaded worm is the
nasty Guinea worm.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.080
A worm so heinous, that President Jimmy Carter
led the fight to eliminate it in 1986.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.870
When Carter’s quest first begin, there were
around 3.5 million cases in the world.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.840
Last year, there were only 22.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.870
So pretty successful campaign.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.400
The worms typically get into your body by
drinking contaminated water.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.890
Horrifically, the worms will later crawl out
of your skin, typically in the legs.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.480
And it CAN TAKE DAYS TO PULL THEM OUT.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.480
DAYS.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.130
When leaving the body, the wounds they create
can sometimes lead to deadly infections.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.280
So I agree with Jimmy Carter and say good
riddance to these guys.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.840
But how do our bodies not get rid of them?

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.690
I mean, humans evolved with some of these
parasites for at least 10,000 years according

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.840
to a study published in the journal Science
Translational Medicine.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.440
We might even have a symbiotic relationship
with them.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.540
They scratch our backs, we scratch theirs.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.080
Or more like, we give them a home and food
and they calm down our immune systems.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.659
Seriously there’s evidence.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.200
Well one study published in the journal Nature
found that some parasitic worms actually change

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.690
our immune systems.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.930
And according to the book, “The Th2 Type
Immune Response in Health and Disease“ several

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.880
studies in mice show that parasitic worms
suppress the immune system.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.430
They promote certain populations of regulatory
cells in the body called Tregs and B regulatory

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.430
cells.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.830
These cells play important roles in reducing
the severity of autoimmune diseases and allergic

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.870
inflammation.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.400
By dampening down the immune systems, the
worms won’t be attacked, while at the same

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.480
time, the mice get a break from allergies
and other autoimmune diseases.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.180
As for how parasitic worms affect humans well,
that’s more complicated because infected

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.880
humans with parasitic worms doesn’t seem
like that fundable of a study.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.569
But that didn’t stop one guy.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.430
A case study published in journal Science
Translational Medicine found that one person

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.900
voluntarily infected himself with Human whipworm
and claimed it successfully treated his ulcerative

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.900
colitis.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.460
Basically the worms lowered uncomfortable
gut inflammation and promoted mucus production,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.620
which is important for healing.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.830
One of the authors of the paper told NPR that
other studies suggest parasites keep the immune

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.270
system in check and “prevent it from going
wild and attacking healthy tissue.”

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.220
While that’s just one guy, another recent
study published in the Journal of Allergy

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.230
and Clinical Immunology found that hookworms
reduced the symptoms of celiac disease, another

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.760
autoimmune disease.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.990
So while parasitic worms seem pretty nasty,
okay they are really nasty and have caused

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.630
a lot of a harm, maybe by keeping our immune
systems in check,so they can continue to live

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.360
inside of us, they actually give us a little
benefit too.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360
Gross.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.290
If you don’t find it all that gross why
don’t you start your own website like wormsarentgross.com

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.980
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

While I’m not going to go around popping

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.190
worm pills to treat my allergies, it does
make us stop and think.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.770
Maybe we’re living too cleanly.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.990
In fact that’s the premise of the hygiene
hypothesis, that figures our modern cleanliness

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.390
might be giving us allergies.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:15.390
