00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If I go ahead and execute this and print the result,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
it comes out: 13/27.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Wow! Where did that come from?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So that' surprising--first of all, it's not 1/3,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which you might have thought should be the answer

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
if you believe the argument that Tuesday doesn't matter.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And secondly, not only is it not 1/3,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but it's much closer to 1/2 than it is to 1/3.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So just having the birthday there really changed things a lot.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
How did that happen? Well, I wrote up a little function here

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to report my findings, and here's its arguments.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You can give it a bunch of cases that you care about--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the predicate that you care about

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and whether you want the results to be verbose or not.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And it just prints out some information--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and, by the way, as part of this,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I also looked at the question of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
what's the probability of two&lt;u&gt;boys,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
given that there's one boy born in December

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so I threw that in as well.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And here's the output I get: 2 boys, given 1 boy is 1/3;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
2 boys, given at least 1 boy born on any day is still 1/3;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and born on Tuesday is 13/27,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and born in December is 23/47.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, I can turn on the verbose option to report

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In that case, here's what I see:

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The probability of 2 boys, given at least 1 boy--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
born on Tuesday--is 13/27.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And here's the reason--at least 1 boy, born on Tuesday,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
has 27 elements--and there they are--

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and of these, 13 are 2 boys--and there they are.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And so, you can't really argue with that.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You can go through and you can make sure that that's correct,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and you can look at the other elements of the sample space

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and say no, we didn't miss any--

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
so that's got to be the right answer.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It's not quite intuitive yet, and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'd like to define my report function

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so that it gives me that intuition

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but right now, I don't have the right visualization.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So I've got to do some of the work myself.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And here's what I came up with:

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We still have the four possibilities that we showed before

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but now we're interested, not just in boys--

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we're interested in boys born on Tuesday.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So there's going to be some others over here

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
where there's, say, boy born on Wednesday,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
along with some other partner--

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
maybe a boy born on Saturday.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But we're not even considering them; we're throwing all those out.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We're just considering the ones that match here.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And like before, we draw 2 circles:

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
one of the right-hand side of the event--

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of the conditional probability.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And so how many of those are there?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Well, there's 7 possibilities here

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because the boy has to be born on Tuesday--

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
there's only 1 way to do that--but there's 7 ways for the girls to be born.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So there's 7 elements of the sample state there;

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
likewise, 7 elements over here.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Now how many elements over here?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Well here, either one of the 2 can be a boy born on Tuesday.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So really, we should draw this state

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
as either a boy born on Tuesday, followed by another boy

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
or a boy, followed by a boy born on Tuesday.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And how many of those are there? Well, there's 7 of these

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
by the same argument we used in the other case,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and of these, there's also 7

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
but now I've double-counted because in one of these 14 cases

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is a boy born on Tuesday, followed by a boy born on Tuesday.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So I'll just count 6 here.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And so now it should be clear: 7, 14, 21, 6, 27.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
There's 27 on the right-hand side,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and then what's the probability of 2 boys,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
given this event of at least 1 boy born on Tuesday?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Well, 2 boys--that's here--so it's 13 out of the 27.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So that's the result.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Seems hard to argue with.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Both the drawing it out with a pen

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and the computing worked out to the same answer.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Now why is it that we have a strong intuition

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that, knowing the boy born on Tuesday

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
shouldn't make any difference?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I think the answer is because we're associating

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that fact with an individual boy.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We're like taking that fact

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and nailing it on to him--and it's true.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
If we did that, that wouldn't make any difference.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But, in this situation, that's not what we're doing.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We're not saying anything about any individual boy.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
If we did that, the computation wouldn't change.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Rather, we're making this assertion

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that at least one was born on Tuesday--

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
not about boys, but about pairs.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And we just don't have very good intuitions

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
about what it means to say something

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
about a pair of people,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
rather than about an individual person,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and that's what we did here--

00:04:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that's why the answer comes out to 13/27.
