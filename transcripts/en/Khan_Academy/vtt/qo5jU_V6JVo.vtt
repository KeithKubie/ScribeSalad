00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.680
Jordan is a cat enthusiast.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.190
She currently cares
for several cats,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.020
but she just can't
say no to adopting

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.500
another cute little face.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.710
After moving into
a bigger house,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.190
Jordan started adopting
cats at a constant rate.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.180
The number of cats
in Jordan's house, C,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.410
as a function of time
since she moved in days, T,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.650
is plotted below.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.717
So this Jordan, she just
keeps adopting cats.

00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:30.300
Her house is just getting more
and more and more full of cats.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.040
I guess that's got to
stop at some point.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.539
But for this question,
they just say

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.270
she keeps adopting them
at a constant rate.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.160
So let's look at
the choices here

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.290
and see which of these
statements is true.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.850
Jordan had 10 cats
when she moved.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.970
So let's see this is time
from when she moved in.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.220
So time equals 0 is right
when she moved in her house.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.429
And it does look like,
yes, she had 10 cats right

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:53.220
where she moved in.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.090
So that first part of
the statement is true.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.730
And after moving, she
adopted 2 cats each day.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.170
So let's see the rate at
which she's adopting cats.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470
And I'm going to find
another point on here.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.830
So we know that the point
0 comma 10 is on here.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.220
So on day 0, when time
equals 0, she already

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.292
had 10 cats, which seems to
be more than enough for me.

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:15.750
But let's see how
many she gets to.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.860
So all of these other
ones, it's hard to read.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.740
Well, it looks like here,
this is definitely on day 15.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.520
On day 15, she had 40 cats.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.120
So let's see.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.770
After 15 days, when her
change in time was 15,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.210
what was the change
in her number of cats?

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.340
Well, she went from
10 cats to 40 cats.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.660
So she went up to her change
in the number of cats--

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.110
and we could call that
delta C-- is equal

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.180
to-- she went from 10 to 40.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.490
Her change in cats is 30.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.500
So her change in cats over
change in time is 30 over 15.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.720
Or you could say, 2 cats
per unit time, per day.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.700
So it does look like
she got 2 cats per day.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.779
After 15 days at 2 cats a
day, she had 30 more cats.

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.550
She went from 10 to 40.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.927
So this statement looks right.

00:02:11.927 --> 00:02:13.260
And this one is multiple choice.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.884
So these other ones
are probably wrong.

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.390
But let's verify that.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.014
Jordan had 3 cats
when she moved.

00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:18.930
Well, that's not true.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.430
3 would have been
right around here.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.750
So that's not right.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.500
Jordan had 10 cats
when she moved.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.920
And after moving, she
adopted 1 cat every 2 days.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.020
Well, that would
be 1/2 a cat a day.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.620
And we know that
that's not the case.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.700
She adopted 2 cats a day.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.130
After 15 days, she had 30 cats.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.744
So this isn't right either.

00:02:37.744 --> 00:02:39.160
Jordan had 3 cats
where she moved.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.118
Well, we already know
that that's not the case.

00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:43.430
So we know it's
the first choice.
