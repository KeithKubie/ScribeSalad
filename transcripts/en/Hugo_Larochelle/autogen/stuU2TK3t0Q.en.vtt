00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 in this capsule we will start 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.569
 the part of the course on agents 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.360
 smart then among the goals 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.790
 for this part so suddenly we go in 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.910
 To define too much the notion of an agent 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.010
 intelligent we will talk among others about the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.609
 concept of rational agents we will cover 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.640
 the analysis p as major performances in 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.240
 paramount pictures and thank you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.830
 will then distinguish different types 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.929
 of environment and finally your 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.000
 distinguish different types of agents 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.219
 smart then in intelligence 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.980
 artificial one can distinguish two 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.329
 holly branches two goals are 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.250
 come in intelligence research 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.739
 artificial 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.260
 the first is to understand what 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.190
 question him years and specifically 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.100
 human intelligence 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.680
 so people who among other things 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.090
 focus on more aspects 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.800
 neuroscientist of intelligence are going 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 develop mathematical models of the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.350
 brain function then 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.660
 development of mathematical models 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.390
 among others neurons and their 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.670
 functioning in cognitive science or 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.320
 in psychology we will rather 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 focus on understanding the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.630
 human reasoning is among others this 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.130
 we want to do is 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.960
 develop models of reasoning 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.689
 human to predict the performance 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 of a human in a given task of which 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.530
 which among others 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.750
 the architected actors that allows between 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.119
 others to assess what is the risk 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.549
 run by a person who speaks to 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.829
 phone while doing the driving of 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.990
 cars so in this case behind the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.070
 current architecture the ability to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.860
 mobility model forgiveness 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.450
 the cursed tasking so a situation where 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.060
 someone does several tasks at the same 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.430
 time and therefore developing good 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.290
 models of human reasoning one can 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.630
 maybe hope to able to evaluate 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.020
 what are the risks behind this genre 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.479
 situation the 1 1 human being does a 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.280
 some reasoning but we what is going 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.410
 really interested us in the race 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.030
 and create intelligent agents so 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.070
 to replace us eventually he 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.840
 make decisions possibly to 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.700
 our place or to help us take 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.530
 decisions and therefore want to develop 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.180
 finally software that has some 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.940
 fundamental capabilities associated with 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.160
 intelligence as the perception the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.239
 knowledge representation 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.220
 learning reasoning 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.970
 then the ability to take 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.970
 rational decisions 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.519
 we give you here some examples 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.820
 intelligent agents so we have to 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:39.500
 example decision support system 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.330
 which is right here we also have a 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.850
 robotic platform that can be 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.320
 move on a given piece of land another 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.250
 robotic platform in what if in 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.670
 the space exploration framework 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.080
 we also have super mario so a 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.480
 artificial intelligence in a game 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.120
 video all these are examples 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.590
 of intelligent agents and noticed between 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.959
 other than an intelligence agent has not 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.459
 need to be necessarily a robot 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.670
 a robotic platform that can be 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.850
 as much a software swimmer as in a 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.980
 software environment that a swimmer 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:20.120
 physical that interacts with with the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:21.829
 real world finally so before 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.630
 talk about money to people why is 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.340
 what we would like to develop agents 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.340
 people why would we want 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.440
 give a software a capacity 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.579
 artificial intelligence 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.900
 in fact this question is a pond 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.799
 the finals why are we 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.140
 wish to make the decision 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.980
 automatic finally gave software 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.860
 the ability to make decisions 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.100
 automatically versus program and we 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.060
 what is the actions that our 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.380
 software could take so what we 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.100
 means by programming of actions 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.410
 it will be among others 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.020
 screaming script or script 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.390
 could describe all the possible 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.650
 context in which our agent for himself 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.960
 find and then at each context 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.190
 enumerated ourselves by hand what is it 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.700
 the actions that should be taken 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.290
 by our software 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.700
 we could make an approach maybe 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.200
 a little more sophisticated we would have 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.270
 machines was finished we would be in 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.030
 able to describe maybe so 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.350
 less exhaustive or a little more compact 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.200
 what kind of context in which 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.820
 could be our agent but in 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.470
 does this approach is going to be 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.270
 require a lot of work then 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.130
 often it will be impossible to describe 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.660
 all the context in which our 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.570
 smart money could be 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.470
 find on board to make decisions 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.210
 and that's why we're going 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.920
 particularly interested in actually 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.860
 to the needy who can take 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.110
 decisions automatically so we 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.760
 wants the actions performed this not 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.690
 not scripted or programmed at the 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.730
 sale 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.160
 we want money to decide for itself 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.040
 that is to say that from a certain 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.780
 calculation that is able to make a 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.220
 reasoning something that one 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.310
 we as a human being we could 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.780
 associate with an ability to reason 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.000
 so really here the bear who is at 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.650
 heart of intelligent agents it's from 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.020
 give their computers 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.460
 the ability to make decisions and 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.140
 have no program and expressive 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.380
 threats what are his decisions to 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.380
 take
