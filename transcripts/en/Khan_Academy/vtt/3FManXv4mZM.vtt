00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.594
So quadrilateral ABCD, they're
telling us it is a rhombus,

00:00:04.594 --> 00:00:06.260
and what we need to
do, we need to prove

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.120
that the area of this rhombus is
equal to 1/2 times AC times BD.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.040
So we're essentially proving
that the area of a rhombus

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.970
is 1/2 times the product of
the lengths of its diagonals.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.020
So let's see what
we can do over here.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.800
So there's a bunch of
things we know about rhombi

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.370
and all rhombi are
parallelograms,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.920
so there's tons of things that
we know about parallelograms.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.980
First of all, if it's a rhombus,
we know that all of the sides

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.080
are congruent.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.390
So that side length is
equal to that side length is

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.460
equal to that side length is
equal to that side length.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.500
Because it's a
parallelogram, we know

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530
the diagonals bisect each other.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.145
So we know that
this length-- let

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:46.370
me call this point
over here B, let's

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.130
call this E. We know that BE
is going to be equal to ED.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.370
So that's BE, we know that's
going to be equal to ED.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.570
And we know that
AE is equal to EC.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.410
We also know, because
this is a rhombus,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.579
and we proved this
in the last video,

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.870
that the diagonals, not only
do they bisect each other,

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.840
but they are also perpendicular.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.910
So we know that this
is a right angle,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.660
this is a right angle,
that is a right angle,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.760
and then this is a right angle.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.860
So the easiest way
to think about it

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.690
is if we can show that
this triangle ADC is

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.230
congruent to triangle ABC,
and if we can figure out

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.480
the area of one of them,
we can just double it.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.000
So the first part is
pretty straightforward.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.430
So we can see that
triangle ADC is

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.300
going to be congruent
to triangle ABC,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.720
and we know that by
side-side-side congruency.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.640
This side is congruent
to that side.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.320
This side is congruent to
that side, and they both share

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.940
a C right over here.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.630
So this is by side-side-side.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.640
And so we can say that the
area-- so because of that,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.400
we know that the
area of ABCD is just

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.304
going to be equal to
2 times the area of,

00:02:09.304 --> 00:02:10.720
we could pick
either one of these.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.270
We could say 2 times
the area of ABC.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.110
Because area of ABCD-- actually
let me write it this way.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.100
The area of ABCD is equal to
the area of ADC plus the area

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.687
of ABC.

00:02:27.687 --> 00:02:29.270
But since they're
congruent, these two

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.103
are going to be the
same thing, so it's just

00:02:31.103 --> 00:02:35.520
going to be 2 times
the area of ABC.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.190
Now what is the area of ABC?

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.200
Well area of a triangle is
just 1/2 base times height.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.010
So area of ABC is just
equal to 1/2 times the base

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.200
of that triangle times its
height, which is equal to 1/2.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.040
What is the length of the base?

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.670
Well the length
of the base is AC.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.670
So it's 1/2-- I'll
color code it.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.470
The base is AC.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.310
And then what is the height?

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.910
What is the height here?

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.400
Well we know that this
diagonal right over here,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.470
that it's a
perpendicular bisector.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.750
So the height is just
the distance from BE.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.350
So it's AC times BE,
that is the height.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.320
This is an altitude.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.500
It intersects this base
at a 90-degree angle.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.590
Or we could say BE is the
same thing as 1/2 times BD.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.220
So this is-- let me write it.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.080
This is equal to, so it's
equal to 1/2 times AC, that's

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.060
our base.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.100
And then our height is
BE, which we're saying

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.620
is the same thing
as 1/2 times BD.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.000
So that's the area
of just ABC, that's

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.506
just the area of this broader
triangle right up there,

00:03:56.506 --> 00:03:58.130
or that larger triangle
right up there,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.332
that half of the rhombus.

00:03:59.332 --> 00:04:01.290
But we decided that the
area of the whole thing

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.920
is two times that.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.280
So if we go back, if we
use both this information

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.220
and this information right over
here, we have the area of ABCD

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.460
is going to be equal to
2 times the area of ABC,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.269
where the area of ABC is
this thing right over here.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.459
So 2 times the area
of ABC, area of ABC

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.500
is that right over there.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.709
So 1/2 times 1/2 is
1/4 times AC times BD.

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:33.250
And then you see
where this is going.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.760
2 times 1/4 fourth is
1/2 times AC times BD.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.826
Fairly straightforward,
which is a neat result.

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:42.700
And actually, I haven't
done this in a video.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.880
I'll do it in the next video.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.290
There are other ways of finding
the areas of parallelograms,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.789
generally.

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.710
It's essentially base times
height, but for a rhombus

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.780
we could do that because
it is a parallelogram,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.050
but we also have this
other neat little result

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.716
that we proved in this video.

00:04:56.716 --> 00:04:58.590
That if we know the
lengths of the diagonals,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.800
the area of the rhombus
is 1/2 times the products

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.480
of the lengths of the diagonals,
which is kind of a neat result.
