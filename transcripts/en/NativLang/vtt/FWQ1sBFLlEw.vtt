[inaudible]

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.610
<v 1>here's a friend of mine, she doesn't talk a lot,</v>

3
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.580
but when she does it's usually about something interesting.

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.990
So you better pay attention.

5
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.210
This kind of suspicious character over here is listening in.

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.110
Now he can make out what she's saying and he gets it.

7
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.000
And when she notices this lurker and turns around to chastise him,

8
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.600
he knows exactly what she's saying. Freeze.

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.050
This is an example of language in action,

10
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.990
but what makes this language,

11
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.370
both of them are able to speak to and understand each other using their mouse

12
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:49.550
ears and brains.

13
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.110
That ability gets called language and it's at the heart of a ton of things worth

14
00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:59.030
learning about humans, about communication, about science, philosophy,

15
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.740
logic, and much more.

16
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.450
They're using that general ability called language,

17
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.720
but they're also using a specific language.

18
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.720
They're speaking and hearing English,

19
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.050
but we don't think that this language over here,

20
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.260
English is the same thing as this ability to speak and understand over here.

21
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.303
After all,

22
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.340
they could be speaking French or Swahili and still be using language.

23
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.230
So what is it that sets language apart from all these languages?

24
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.810
The characteristics of our human language ability or the subject of intense

25
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:42.620
debates. And here's some of the questions that get the brawl started,

26
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.140
is our ability to speak something we learned or something we inherited.

27
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.390
Does it fit snugly in a wider context alongside body signals, emotions,

28
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.200
or other social behaviors and even animal communication?

29
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.780
Or does human language sit way up here all distinct and elevated? Like,

30
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.970
and how does language relate to thinking like the kind of everyday thinking we

31
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:12.230
do and we have a specific thought, like those flowers are really,

32
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.220
really red.

33
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.240
And also the abstract thinking we do in the logic and mathematics,

34
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.130
logic and math allow us humans to think about things more abstractly and

35
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.490
universally instead of just those roses.

36
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:29.210
I can think about all roses or all xs,

37
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:31.670
or even just the variable x.

38
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.080
So it looks like language is a tricky concept,

39
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.750
but what about languages? Surely they're clearer at least.

40
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.073
<v 2>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.500
