00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:02.725
Two to six percent of people self-identify as

00:00:02.725 --> 00:00:05.155
having predominantly homosexual attractions

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:08.455
and, while there are many social and political theories on why,

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:11.575
what does science say?  Is being gay genetic and,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.440
if so, do we all have a gay gene?

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.860
In the nineties, two studies using the human genome project

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.060
found that gay men have a higher number of homosexual relatives compared to heterosexual men

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:24.035
and that gay siblings have similar linkages

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.045
on their X chromosome, showing a high level of genetic heritability.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.140
A more recent study of four hundred and nine

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580
gay siblings also found linkages in a specific region

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.815
of the X chromosome labelled Xq28

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.220
and in another region of chromosome 8.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.515
Furthermore a 2014 analysis of fifty years of research

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.325
found gay men are more likely to have gay brothers

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:46.265
compared to straight men and lesbian women are more likely to have

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:48.860
lesbian sisters, further suggesting the traits are

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.340
genetically linked and passed on.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.160
But, if homosexuality is, in fact, genetic,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.700
doesn't this create a paradox?

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.420
While some gay people, still have children,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.800
overall they have 80% less children

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.300
than heterosexuals, so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.620
wouldn't the genes not be passed down and eventually die out?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.480
Well, a recent UCLA study used epigenetics

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.080
to propose that everyone has a gay gene,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.280
but it's whether or not the attachment of a methyl group to specific

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.320
regions of DNA is triggered and turns it on.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.880
Epigenetics is the study of how your environment

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.840
can chemically modify your genes.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.160
Like, how a queen ant's nutrition and pheromones

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.580
can chemically alter an ant embryo to either produce

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.900
a soldier or worker ant

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.800
based on what's needed for the colony.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.520
The UCLA study used gay and straight male twins

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.580
and found that a specific methylation pattern was closely linked

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.100
to sexual orientation.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060
The model was able to predict the sexuality of men with 70% accuracy,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420
but this data used a small subset of people,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.540
and there is some controversy around the research.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.620
Ultimately, a specific gay gene has not been found, but scientific evidence

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.120
does suggest that human sexual orientation

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.820
is strongly linked to genetics and tightly regulated at the molecular level.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.220
It's even been found that giving birth to a son

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.120
increases the odds of homosexuality in the next son

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.100
by 33% relative to the baseline population.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.095
If an older brother is from a different mother, there is no effect seen.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.820
This has led some researchers to believe that male pregnancy

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.080
triggers a biological mechanism that affects the mother's successive births.

00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:14.565
A meta-analysis also found that

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:16.720
statistically, homosexual men

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.420
have more older brothers than heterosexual men.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.140
Another study found that women exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.620
have higher rates of being not straight.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.280
So, why does this happen?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.420
The gay uncle hypothesis suggests that gay members of a family that don't reproduce

00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:34.305
still increase the prevalence of their family's genes

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:35.460
in future generations

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.680
by helping to provide resources for offspring that they're related to.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.720
After all, it's not just survival of the fittest individual,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.680
but the fittest family.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.540
Studies also show that there are lower levels of hostility

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.780
and higher levels of emotional intelligence,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.760
compassion and cooperation in gay men,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.400
which may also increase altruism and survival in human groups.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.600
Another hypothesis suggests that genes from homosexuality

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.720
are ultimately coding for attraction

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.200
meaning female relatives of gay men who share the same gene

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.200
will also have stronger attractions to men,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.495
providing an evolutionary advantage.

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:10.945
And, studies have shown that these females have more babies on average.

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:13.895
The same would be true of lesbians and their straight male relatives.

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:16.425
The famous scientist E.O. Wilson once said

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:18.780
"Homosexuality gives advantages to the group.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.020
A society that condemns homosexuality condemns itself."

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.240
Historically, science has not been kind to the queer community.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.180
In the past, it was generally accepted that the

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:30.185
brains and bodies of homosexuals were presumed to be

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:33.375
of lower status, with a popular belief that homosexual behaviour

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.500
was a result of defective development.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.280
Even some LGBTQ2S people fear that scientific research

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.020
could "other" the community

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.020
and be used to exploit or hurt people.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.700
Even from the available research, it's clear that most

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.040
studies only focus on gay men and neglect other groups.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.120
But more research on the genetic and epigenetic factors of homosexuality

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.560
will decrease homophobic laws around the world

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.940
by further proving that being gay is not a choice.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.340
But, could we ever genetically get rid of homosexuality?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.380
Watch our second video where we discuss if it's possible and the implications

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.180
of continued study into this field.
