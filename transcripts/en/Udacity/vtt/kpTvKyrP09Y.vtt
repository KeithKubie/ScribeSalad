00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.330
So, we just talked about horizontal and
vertical lines.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.540
Let's go back to lines that
are neither horizontal nor vertical.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.140
Lines with a certain steepness.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.940
And to get us thinking about steepness,
or

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.620
what we're going to call slope,
let's look at a set of stairs.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.880
Or actually,
let's look at two sets of stairs.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.100
So now that we have two staircases, I
want to know which staircase is steeper.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.840
Is it this one or is it this one?
