TODD KERPELMAN: Hello.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.190
I'm Todd Kerpelman for
the Developer Show,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.560
and this is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.360
news from Google.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.080
Over 50% of professional Android
developers now use Kotlin.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.030
It's the fastest growing
language on GitHub,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.309
and many new Jetpack
APIs and features

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.350
are going to be offered
first in Kotlin.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.450
So to help you dive
deeper into Kotlin,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.390
we're happy to announce a series
of community-driven events

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.100
focusing on the
potential of Kotlin

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.710
on all platforms called
Kotlin Everywhere.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.200
To find out more about these
events and how to join in,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.920
check out the
details in the post.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.720
If you're building a
progressive web app,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.550
you probably know that
on Android devices,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.640
a Chrome system dialogue called
the mini-infobar will appear

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.320
at the bottom of
the browser screen,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.050
prompting your users
to install your PWA.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.090
While this can be helpful
in driving installs,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.160
developers wanted more
control around when

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.570
they ask their users
to install their app.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.830
So in Chrome 76, you can
prevent that mini-infobar

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.630
from appearing normally
and have it show up

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.250
at a time of your choosing.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.380
To find out how, be sure to
see the details in the post.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.280
At Google I/O this
month, the Android team

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.390
announced dark theme
support in Android Q,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.543
a system-wide dark UI
mode toggled by the user.

00:01:08.543 --> 00:01:10.960
And the good news for all you
Flutter developers out there

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.810
is that the Flutter team already
added support for the Android

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.650
dark theme back in February.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.410
And you can enable it
in your Flutter apps

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.750
just by adding a property
to your widget tree.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.800
Which property, you ask?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.340
Well, you'll just have to
check out the post to find out.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.260
Kubernetes applications
are enterprise-ready,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.930
easy to deploy,
containerized applications

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.590
that can run in any
Kubernetes environment.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.310
The Google Cloud
Platform marketplace

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.740
offers a wide range of solutions
as Kubernetes applications.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.500
Everything from
databases to security

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.620
to developer tools and more,
with pricing agreement options

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.902
designed to meet your
enterprises' needs.

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:45.610
So to find out more,
be sure to check out

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.220
the details in the post.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.980
Developer Student Clubs provide
thousands of student developers

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.110
around the globe the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.200
they can use to grow as leaders,
advance their skills in Google

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.393
and open source tech, and
solve real-life problems.

00:01:59.393 --> 00:02:01.810

problems in your community

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.685
