00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.170
How much are you concerned about how

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.343
other people view the information that you might

00:00:04.343 --> 00:00:06.560
find out? Is this information you're comfortable

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.350
sharing with anybody only your family, only yourself?

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.500
&gt;&gt; I'm extremely concerned about insurance

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.900
companies getting a hold of this information.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.140
And that, that preexisting condition aspect. because

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.760
I really, really need my insurance company.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.540
Currently and in the future.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.730
&gt;&gt; So you're most concerned that they would essentially not

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.380
they wouldn't carry you any more for.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.640
&gt;&gt; Right. And especially if there were a job

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.560
change. And, and we're, we're starting with a new insurance

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.580
company. Now, you know, supposedly Obamacare kind of does

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.540
away with that, but, what happens when Obama goes away?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.540
&gt;&gt;

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.330
[LAUGH]

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.210
Any other thoughts specifically about insurance companies from anybody?

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.839
&gt;&gt; I just think there's, like she's saying, there's a lot of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.440
potential for some, for people to

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.650
take this information and exploit, exploit people

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.260
with certain traits. Or certain thing, with certain, yeah, with certain traits

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.310
or with people who are confirmed with certain conditions. So I think, yeah.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.570
&gt;&gt; You're the one who would be a potential employer.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.900
You know if they had the information that we

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.980
could be out on medical leave a lot for

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.800
surgeries, for our children surgeries. I think one thing

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.010
that is also different about me than you all is

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.000
that there are five of us in our family

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.680
with Achondroplasia, so insurance companies are a really big deal

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.640
in our house. The thought of losing that and,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.065
and, or my husband losing a potentially a job offer,

00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:47.710
if the employer said to himself or herself, hm, this is going to

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.310
be a very expensive employee. Our rates are going to go up, and he's

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.510
going to be out of work a lot dealing with either his surgery

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.760
or one of his four family members. we better not touch this one.
