00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.840
There's no better place to have breakfast
than at the MoMA.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.960
We planned it ahead of time.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.960
Oh, this one's yours.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.880
How did I do that?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.980
This is just a go-to.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.920
You have to come here, you know?

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.320
You get refreshed, and get it all figured
out, then go on from there.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.360
You know until you walk in front of a piece
that suddenly grabs you, you know, you haven't

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.680
really experienced art.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.220
I mean there's tons of work.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.560
Not all pieces grab.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.080
But when you find that 1 out of 10, or 20,
or that one artist who you really connect

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.600
with, it's amazing.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.820
Sometimes when you get up in the morning,
you get up, you are thinking about so many

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.320
things that you wanna do.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.160
And when you walk into Gallery 9, and you
look around you, you look at one side, it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.160
looks dark.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.100
And you look at the middle, you see...you
know.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.660
And I went back, I remember a couple of years
ago, I was looking into Monet.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.680
And I found out that that this painter actually
was dated back to the 20th century.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.440
I think it was 1899.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.840
And then I think Monet died in 1926, if I
recall correctly.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.140
It's been a while.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:47.040
But look at it today, what was painted over
a century ago, we're still deriving pleasure,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.880
happiness from it.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.220
Sometimes when something bothers my mind,
when I walk to this gallery, sometimes I will

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.580
just sit on one of the benches and I will
be looking.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.580
And if you look from one end to the other
end, you will see something different, and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.120
something that kind of console your mind,
something that makes you feel like, "You know what?

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.260
This is kind of impressive."

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.200
I like the impressionist, Van Gogh, Matisse.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.140
I also like Klimt, but I asked and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.520
they borrowed the masterpiece of Klimt that
they have here in MoMA.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.660
So today I'm not going to see Klimt.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.880
I'm upset.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.500
Well, next time.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.360
Well, I was studying a little bit of history
of art in my country, Peru.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:56.860
So I have all my stuff here, and next, I like
Calder over there.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.480
I don't like so much but it's good.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.240
Perhaps there are masterpieces that you don't
like, but if they make you feel something,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.900
it's okay.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.260
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.100
Hi.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.020
My name is Devin Malone, and I'm the public
program's fellow in the educational department

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.720
here at MoMA.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.240
Welcome to #ArtSpeaks.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.420
#ArtSpeaks is a day of community where 
staff members choose works of art on display,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.560
and discuss how they resonate with those works.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.320
And then we follow it up with Q&amp;A.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.860
It occurs every last Tuesday of the month.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.480
Today I'm introducing Paola Antonelli, the
senior curator of architecture and design

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.500
here at MoMA, and the director of research
and development.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.340
And she'll be talking about the hoodie.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.560
Thank you, Devin.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.080
It was a great introduction.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.280
And it's true.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.980
We pick objects that resonate with us as human
beings, not only as curators.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.700
And more than resonating with me, I live with
this object as we all do.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.960
So, let me give you first a little bit of
introduction about this exhibition.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.000
You are in an exhibition that, you know, is
called "Items."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.100
And it's about 111 items of clothing that
had a strong impact on a New York-centric

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.400
world in the past 100 years.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.240
It is an exhibition about people.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.100
And it's an exhibition about how garments
and fashion interact with people and enable

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.380
people to express themselves and to live in
the world.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.580
So there are many different examples in the
show of everyday items like the white t-shirt,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.060
like the Levi's 501, or any kind of sneakers.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.040
And then there are examples of high fashion
from Yves Saint Laurent to Kawakubo all the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.100
way to Armani.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.500
So there's a little bit for everyone.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.340
I like the stone in the water.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.820
And they have a new sculpture over there.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.500
Well, I haven't been, I just arrived.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.280
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.540
This sweatshirt, I just bought it just in
Ogunquit, in Maine.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:25.120
I saw it there, and what I like about it is
that it's faded, you know?

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.340
And I thought it was another great statement
for what's happening in this country.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.840
I came here with Ford.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.420
Ford?

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.360
1976.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.700
I went through Reagan, and Clinton, Clinton,
Bush, Bush, and Obama.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.680
And I thought it was a great country to live
in.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.400
I'm not sure any longer.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.200
And this is my way of expressing my thoughts.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.380
I'm not good, now I’m good.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.460
I think I'm gonna stand here, because
we like this one, and I like that one.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.260
Yeah.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.900
My name?

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.180
Kar-Lai

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.480
And he don't have English name.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.900
Gé Yôu Yuán, his Chinese name.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.600
I come from Beijing, and I'm a actor.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:25.720
We met each other in America, but we have
a similar experience with China, because we

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.940
work in Beijing, and I had been to Beijing
a lot of times.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.400
And our hometown in China is very close to
each other, only around four hours by driving.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.540
We just met each other on the street, is that okay?

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.960
Art can change our life especially...it
depends on how you treat art, and how you

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.400
treat the art in daily life.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.460
You can think more.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.800
Same thing, you will think more than the other
people.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.560
My name's Manish Engineer.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.440
My last name is actually Engineer.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.440
My father was an engineer, my grandfather
was an engineer, and I work in the IT department.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.360
And so now you are all here to hear me talk
about art.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.300
So, hopefully this will go well.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.460
Thank you for coming.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.300
And we're gonna talk about this Franz Kline
painting, "Number 2," that he did.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.700
And why did I pick this painting?

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.580
So for me, this was kind of the start of my
journey into art.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.820
In junior high, I took a school field trip
to the Cleveland Museum of Art, and I saw

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.840
this painting there, not this painting, a
painting by Franz Kline there, and it was

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.800
just unlike anything else I had ever seen.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.840
And I thought it was beautiful.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.820
It wasn't like a realistic painting.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.680
It looked kind of like Japanese calligraphy.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.360
And the color was different, the brushstrokes
were just so big and different.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.620
I was just captivated by it, and I thought
it was beautiful.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.800
I think I was about 16 or 17 at the time.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.400
Around that time at 17, I had a very, like,
life traumatic experience.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.060
I had this open heart surgery.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.660
It was, like, a big thing.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.340
And afterwards, I was just thinking about
it, and I told my dad, you know, I wanted

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.360
to go back to the museum and see this painting.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.500
And I went there with him.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.060
And I walked up to the painting, and I see
it, and I'm staring at it.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.120
And there's this woman in a wheelchair next
to me, and the two of us were staring at this

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.300
painting, and she just says to me, "It's very
powerful, isn't it?"

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.620
And I felt like we were on the same page,
and we shared this moment, and it was just beautiful.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.200
And just looking at these paintings, they
kind of, like, draw you in.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.040
And I just fell in love with the work.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.100
And then of course, my dad eventually made
his way there.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.260
And as I said, he's this mechanical engineer,
a very practical guy.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.060
And I'm like, "Hey, Dad, here's the painting."

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.700
This is like this beautiful work of art, and
my dad of course goes, "No, not good.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.760
I don't like it."

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.200
And we, like, walk throughout the museum,
and we got to a painting of George Washington.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.080
And my dad goes, "See?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.360
This is a good painting.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.520
It looks just like George Washington."

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.580
And because of that, it like made me like
this abstract expressionism even more.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.900
The fact that my dad hated it, you know?

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.060
It's the kind of thing when you're a teenager,
you wanna rebel.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.180
The title is either "Black Widow" or "Spider."

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.060
I think it was done in 1959.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.600
But just the concept is not actually that
abstract, like when you look at it, it's pretty

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600
clear what it is.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.560
I do wanna go kinda into it.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.160
Obviously, I'm not that tall.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.620
I think people are like, if they don't know
enough, then they feel they shouldn't experience

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.980
it or they won't experience it properly.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.120
And I think it's whatever you get from it.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.660
And if you get a good experience and you wanna
go deeper, then you can go deeper.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.660
But I think that people can relate to it at
all different levels.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.340
I may not be interpreting this right the way
the sculptor or whoever made it to be interpreted,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.880
but at the same time, I think he knows that
whoever will look at it can interpret it whatever

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.760
they want from it.
