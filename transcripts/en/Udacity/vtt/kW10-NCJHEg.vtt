00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.210
Okay. If each one of these represents a different

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.330
deoxynucleotide, then all we have to do, is look at the variable region,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.030
here, which is the colored part. And you'll notice that we only see one. Two,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.840
three, four different types. We

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.370
see a blue type, a red type, a green type and a yellow type.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.370
So four is the correct answer.
