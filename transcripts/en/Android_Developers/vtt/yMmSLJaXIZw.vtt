00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.180
I'm Joanna and I
believe that creating

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.570
a functional Android app
and a great Android app

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.630
are two different things,
but only one of them

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.730
will help you engage
and delight users.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.800
And that's why Udacity
partnered with Google

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.890
to produce Advanced Android App
Development, which explains how

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.580
to make an app stand out
with the kind of polish that

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.960
leads to success in
the Google Play store.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.080
Students will learn how
to improve the appeal

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.570
and speed of their app's
UI, with material design

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.900
features and helpful
libraries, as well as

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.740
how to widen their audience
and reach all sorts of users

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.670
with simple localization
and accessibility updates.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.045
They'll also learn how to
expand their apps functionality

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:35.753
by building an app
widget and integrating

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:38.720
with Google Cloud Messaging for
efficient server and network

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.550
use.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.370
So check it out.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.038
It's going to be awesome.
