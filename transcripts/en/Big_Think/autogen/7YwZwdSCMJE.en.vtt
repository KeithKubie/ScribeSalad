I'd like to label power problems for

when we look at the importance of memory

when we look at the importance of memory
 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.920
when we look at the importance of memory
let me give you an example for a very

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930
let me give you an example for a very
 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.210
let me give you an example for a very
long period of time we thought that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220
long period of time we thought that
 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.890
long period of time we thought that
sharing stuff on the internet is

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900
sharing stuff on the internet is
 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.050
sharing stuff on the internet is
somewhat dangerous because it's not just

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060
somewhat dangerous because it's not just
 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.510
somewhat dangerous because it's not just
our friends that have access to it but

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520
our friends that have access to it but
 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.219
our friends that have access to it but
it's everybody around the world that has

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229
it's everybody around the world that has
 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.020
it's everybody around the world that has
access to it hundreds of millions of

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030
access to it hundreds of millions of
 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.610
access to it hundreds of millions of
people and thousands of jurisdictions

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620
people and thousands of jurisdictions
 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.530
people and thousands of jurisdictions
and somebody somewhere might actually be

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540
and somebody somewhere might actually be
 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.230
and somebody somewhere might actually be
offended by what we had to say and I

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240
offended by what we had to say and I
 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.280
offended by what we had to say and I
might get a court to agree and then we

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290
might get a court to agree and then we
 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.200
might get a court to agree and then we
find ourselves having to defend our

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210
find ourselves having to defend our
 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.899
find ourselves having to defend our
actions much like the Google managers

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909
actions much like the Google managers
 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.120
actions much like the Google managers
had to do a few weeks back when they

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130
had to do a few weeks back when they
 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.429
had to do a few weeks back when they
were successfully sued and convicted in

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439
were successfully sued and convicted in
 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.950
were successfully sued and convicted in
a Italian court for what they did or

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960
a Italian court for what they did or
 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.450
a Italian court for what they did or
didn't do on YouTube and and so that's

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460
didn't do on YouTube and and so that's
 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.580
didn't do on YouTube and and so that's
been around that view has been around

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590
been around that view has been around
 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.340
been around that view has been around
for a couple of years it's called the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350
for a couple of years it's called the
 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.179
for a couple of years it's called the
panopticon the panopticon basically is

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189
panopticon the panopticon basically is
 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.030
panopticon the panopticon basically is
an idea that has been with us for a

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040
an idea that has been with us for a
 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.120
an idea that has been with us for a
hundred and some years invented by

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130
hundred and some years invented by
 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.719
hundred and some years invented by
Jeremy Bentham and Britain the idea is

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729
Jeremy Bentham and Britain the idea is
 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.429
Jeremy Bentham and Britain the idea is
it would be great to create a prism in

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439
it would be great to create a prism in
 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.800
it would be great to create a prism in
which the prisoners don't know when the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
which the prisoners don't know when the
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.020
which the prisoners don't know when the
prison guards watch them they have to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
prison guards watch them they have to
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.520
prison guards watch them they have to
assume that they're always watched and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
assume that they're always watched and
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.140
assume that they're always watched and
therefore they have to behave all the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150
therefore they have to behave all the
 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.500
therefore they have to behave all the
time similarly because we don't know who

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
time similarly because we don't know who
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.110
time similarly because we don't know who
is watching us online we have to behave

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120
is watching us online we have to behave
 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.160
is watching us online we have to behave
all the time

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
all the time
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.800
all the time
to the lowest common denominator and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810
to the lowest common denominator and
 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.370
to the lowest common denominator and
therefore our behavior is skewed as

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
therefore our behavior is skewed as
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.190
therefore our behavior is skewed as
constrained and many people have been

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
constrained and many people have been
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.830
constrained and many people have been
writing about that but I believe there

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840
writing about that but I believe there
 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.140
writing about that but I believe there
is with digital memory something much

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
is with digital memory something much
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.140
is with digital memory something much
more problematic coming up and that has

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
more problematic coming up and that has
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.750
more problematic coming up and that has
to do with the longevity of digital

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
to do with the longevity of digital
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.259
to do with the longevity of digital
memory so we have to face the fact that

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269
memory so we have to face the fact that
 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.110
memory so we have to face the fact that
what we say and do online today will not

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
what we say and do online today will not
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.670
what we say and do online today will not
only be viewed by the hundreds of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
only be viewed by the hundreds of
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.259
only be viewed by the hundreds of
millions of people that are online today

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269
millions of people that are online today
 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.660
millions of people that are online today
but might be viewed and interpreted

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670
but might be viewed and interpreted
 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.600
but might be viewed and interpreted
differently by people and institutions

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610
differently by people and institutions
 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.120
differently by people and institutions
ten years 20 or 30 years down the road

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130
ten years 20 or 30 years down the road
 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.360
ten years 20 or 30 years down the road
when we're no longer young and we might

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
when we're no longer young and we might
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.229
when we're no longer young and we might
not be as engaged in public discourse

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239
not be as engaged in public discourse
 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.140
not be as engaged in public discourse
and protest anymore but we might want to

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
and protest anymore but we might want to
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.479
and protest anymore but we might want to
apply for a well paid investment bankers

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489
apply for a well paid investment bankers
 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.030
apply for a well paid investment bankers
job and then they might just Google us

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040
job and then they might just Google us
 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.210
job and then they might just Google us
and find out at 15 years earlier we said

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
and find out at 15 years earlier we said
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.400
and find out at 15 years earlier we said
something that wasn't so complementary

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410
something that wasn't so complementary
 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.979
something that wasn't so complementary
to the banks or so so therefore a

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989
to the banks or so so therefore a
 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.150

comprehensive digital memory creates

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160
comprehensive digital memory creates
 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.250
comprehensive digital memory creates
what I call a temporal panopticon it

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260
what I call a temporal panopticon it
 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.370
what I call a temporal panopticon it
creates a situation in which we have to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380
creates a situation in which we have to
 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.949
creates a situation in which we have to
fear that we are not only watched today

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959
fear that we are not only watched today
 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.220
fear that we are not only watched today
but we are watched by future generations

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230
but we are watched by future generations
 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.069
but we are watched by future generations
by our future and that really

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079
by our future and that really
 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.960
by our future and that really
dramatically constrains what we ought to

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970
dramatically constrains what we ought to
 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.750
dramatically constrains what we ought to
do online and pushes us towards

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760
do online and pushes us towards
 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.699
do online and pushes us towards
self-censorship exactly when we don't

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709
self-censorship exactly when we don't
 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.740
self-censorship exactly when we don't
need self-censorship because we need

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750
need self-censorship because we need
 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.259
need self-censorship because we need
robust public debate online that's what

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269
robust public debate online that's what
 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.559
robust public debate online that's what
online discourse is all about

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569
 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.140
well let me give you an example of what

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150
well let me give you an example of what
 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.000
well let me give you an example of what
happens already today so there's people

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010
happens already today so there's people
 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.539
happens already today so there's people
who lose their jobs who relationships

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549
who lose their jobs who relationships
 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.630
who lose their jobs who relationships
