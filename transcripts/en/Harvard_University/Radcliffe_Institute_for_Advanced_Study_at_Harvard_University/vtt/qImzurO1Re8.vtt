00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.240
-Good evening, everyone.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.720
What a great crowd
we have tonight.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.590
I'm thrilled.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.520
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.430
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.340
and I am so pleased to welcome
you all here tonight for Plays

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.680
With Words.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.490
This night of comedy opens our
conference, Ways With Words,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.020
exploring language and gender,
which will continue here

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.610
at the Knafel Center tomorrow.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.030
Every year, the
Radcliffe Institute

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.800
hosts a conference to
examine a timely issue

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.190
through the lens of gender.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.080
In so doing, we
affirm our connection

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.320
to the stark mission
of Radcliffe College,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.530
but we also host a
gender conference

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.930
because the interdisciplinary
environment of our Institute

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.820
for Advanced Study is
precisely the right place

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.970
to grapple with the multiple
dimensions of gender

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.500
in society.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.660
Where else would you
find performers, poets,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.600
computer scientists,
transgender rights advocates,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.130
political scientists, and
more, deep in conversation?

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.490
No such effort comes
together all on its own.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.690
So I am grateful to John
Huth, our conference chair,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.970
co-director of our science
program here at the Radcliffe

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.850
Institute, and Donner
Professor of Science

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.910
in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences here at Harvard.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.810
Thank you also to everyone
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.820
And believe me, it took
everyone, especially

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.810
Rebecca Wasserman
and her staff, who

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.830
worked so hard to organize
this ambitious event.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.420
In recent years, our
gender conferences

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.930
have explored a wide array
of prominent public issues,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.250
migration, public health, and
violence, just to name a few.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.210
And all of our
gender conferences

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.550
have begun with an arts event.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.600
We choose art as
our first encounter

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.570
with critical social, political,
and cultural topics for reasons

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.170
that go beyond the aesthetic.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.460
Art demands that we approach
a subject in a new way,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.310
and we see it differently
than we did before.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.600
One year, a dramatic
reading by Eve Ensler

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.930
propelled our inquiry into
gender and the public's health.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.310
At a conference
on immigration, we

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.430
launched it with a
musical performance

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.930
by Quetzal, a bilingual rock
band from east Los Angeles.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.580
This year, we open
with performances

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.890
by Aparna Nancherla
and ImprovBoston.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.510
I want to thank them all,
as well as Professor Glenda

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.415
Carpio, and local WBUR
radio host Robin Young,

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:02.290
who will be leading
our discussion.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.230
More arts programming
accompanies this conference,

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.850
and it surrounds us here
at Radcliffe in general.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.820
And I urge you to
visit, in particular,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.910
an exhibit that has just gone
up, "A Language to Hear Myself"

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.250
Feminist Poets Speak, which is
next door at the Schlesinger

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.850
Library, and it will be
open throughout the spring.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.160
One week from tonight, just
to mention one more event,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.590
on Thursday, March
10th, Luci Tapahonso,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.590
who is the poet laureate
of the Navajo Nation,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.850
will be giving a poetry reading.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.000
The calendar cards on your seats
will list more upcoming events,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.150
and I hope you will join
us for many of them.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.340
Tonight's evening of comedy has
brought students and faculty,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.760
artists and alumni,
social workers and CEOs,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.790
electrical engineers, medical
practitioners, activists,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.420
and more, together here
in the Knafel Center.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.660
You represent nine
different Harvard schools,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.440
nearly two dozen local
universities, and several area

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.770
public schools.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.110
You have come from
all over New England,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.810
and as far afield as the
University of Notre Dame

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.090
and the National
Theater of Canada.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.360
I know that others are watching
our live webcast tonight,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.420
and that many more will watch
the video on our website

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.910
in the months and years to come.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.230
The breadth and
diversity of our audience

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.660
tells us something about
the genre of comedy.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.560
The urge to laugh is universal.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.070
Humor can soothe
tensions, cross divides,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.490
and unite people through the
medium of shared laughter.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.660
But paradoxically,
what makes people laugh

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.540
is not universal at all.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.770
A joke that is funny in one
time, place, or culture,

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.080
does not automatically translate
across time, space, or context.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.790
And while the action of laughing
can bring people together,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.310
the content of jokes can
sometimes drive people apart,

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.600
or divide them into groups
of ridiculers and ridiculed.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.040
Comedy then might make
us feel light hearted,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.250
but it is no
intellectual lightweight.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.980
It does important social
and cultural work,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.350
and activists of
all kinds know that.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.090
In 2014, for example,
transgender advocates

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.900
petitioned Jon Stewart
and Stephen Colbert to,

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.590
and I quote from their demands,
"reject transphobia and respect

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.520
gender identity."

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.110
The petitioners wanted support
from Stewart and Colbert

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.970
on transgender
rights because they

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.830
knew that the popularity of
The Daily Show and The Colbert

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.580
Report had contributed, in the
words of their petition, to,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.280
and I quote, "the
recent cultural shift

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.450
toward support for equal
rights for LGBT people."

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.010
In other words activists
sought to recruit

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.010
two popular humorists precisely
because they understood

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.900
how much comedy matters.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.150
One reason why comedy
matters is that it tells us

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.280
a lot about the
state of language.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.370
Jokes are only funny
if you understand them.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.410
Frequently, understanding
jokes requires understanding

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.820
the words used to tell them.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.640
But words are not stable.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.040
Their meanings change over time.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.440
New words come into existence,
and then they fade away.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.080
Ideas about gender
change over time too.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.580
The social roles
assigned to individuals

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.060
on the basis of
sex and assumptions

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.610
about relationships
among and between sexes

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.950
are in constant flux.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.490
They also vary widely from
place to place and culture

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.790
to culture.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.380
So comedy can reveal a lot
about sex, gender, and sexuality

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.040
in a particular
historical moment.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.360
It reveals even more
about how we use language

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.030
to discuss challenging issues.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.660
So let me give you
three examples.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.020
We know that William
Shakespeare played to the pit,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.410
so even the most serious history
plays or catastrophic tragedies

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.520
were peppered with jokes that
would be funny to cheap seat

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.870
audiences.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.930
Take Henry the
Fourth, where scenes

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.680
featured the portly
knight Falstaff

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.440
and the barmaid
Mistress Quickly.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.250
Today, the humor
in their dialogue

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.090
is not immediately apparent,
unless we have an Elizabethan

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.020
dictionary by our side.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.720
When Falstaff says to
Mistress Quickly, and I quote,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.250
"there is no more faith in
thee than in a stewed prune,"

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:00.860
the phrase stewed prune sounds
mildly entertaining to us,

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.450
but we don't split
our sides laughing.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.670
In contrast, 16th
century audiences

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:11.510
did laugh uproariously,
because they, unlike us, all

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.340
knew that Falstaff had just
called Quickly as faithful

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.210
as a prostitute.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.000
Here's another example.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.400
In the spring of
1865, a comedy called

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.620
Our American Cousins was playing
at Ford's Theater in Washington

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.930
DC.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:33.440
That play contained a line, "you
sockdologizing old mantrap."

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.840
That line doesn't mean
very much to us today,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.840
but John Wilkes Booth was
an accomplished actor who

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.070
knew that script
inside and out, and he

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.200
knew that that line
would get the most

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.510
laughs in the entire play.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.450
He shot Abraham Lincoln
at that exact moment, when

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.350
that line was delivered, because
he assumed the audience would

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.790
laugh so hard that nobody
would hear the gunshot,

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.980
and he would have
precious time to get away.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.510
It turned out he was right.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.930
A more contemporary
example comes

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.610
from Seinfeld, the hit
television comedy of the 1990s.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.890
In one episode,
Elaine agrees to pose

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.520
as the girlfriend of a gay
man who has a homophobic boss.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.810
After a pleasant
evening at the opera,

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.480
Elaine decides that she
will convert the man, that's

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.860
her language, and she asks
him if he ever considered

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.640
what she calls changing teams.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.750
Now that we know about
the pernicious phenomenon

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.940
of subjecting boys to abuse
of so-called conversion

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.210
camps in efforts to cure
them of their sexuality,

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.460
we in 2016 have a very
difficult time hearing

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.770
that line as light or funny.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.500
This last example is recent
enough for many of us

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.240
in this room to remember,
which reminds us

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.580
that there's evolution
of both language

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.900
and gender happens constantly.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.450
It is happening now.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.030
What is funny today may
not be so amusing tomorrow.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.650
Noticing when we laugh
and when we don't can

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.020
provide valuable insight
into the state of language

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.610
and gender at this
precise moment

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.240
in time, which is the
subject of our gender

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.400
conference this year.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.280
I said at the beginning
of these remarks

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.630
that the purpose of
our gender conference

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:33.420
is to look at an important
topic through a lens of gender.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.210
To return to that
metaphor, comedy

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.370
calibrates the
prescription for that lens

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.150
with exquisite delicacy.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.600
By looking through it,
we can see our own moment

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.110
in our own cultural context
with heightened clarity.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.870
I can think of nobody more
qualified to help us do so

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.750
than the talented performers
and insightful commentators

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.970
we have with us this evening.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.900
Your program contains
informative biographies

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.800
about all of them,
and I encourage

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.690
you to take a good look at it.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.180
So here is how the
evening will proceed.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.940
First, Aparna will treat us
to a stand up performance.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.590
Next Robin Young, co-host
of WBUR's Here and Now

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.820
will moderate a discussion
between Aparna and Glenda

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.390
Carpio, professor of English
and African and African-American

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.380
studies here at Harvard.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.280
Then we will enjoy a performance
by the improvisational comedy

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.420
group ImprovBoston.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.620
After their performance,
ImprovBoston members

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.380
will join in the conversation
with Aparna and Glenda.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.660
And finally, the floor will be
open to you for your questions.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.570
If you would like
to ask a question,

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.640
please form a line behind
the microphone that

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.370
will be put in the center
aisle, identify yourself,

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.420
and ask your question.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.920
In closing, let me just say
that I hope to see you all back

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.580
here tomorrow for
a day of continued

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.360
discussion at our Ways
of Words conference.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.070
So please join me in
welcoming Aparna Nancherla.

00:12:13.386 --> 00:12:16.560
-Hello, thank you for having me.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.870
What a warm up.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.920
Give it up for you're-- I know.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.700
Well I want to jump
right into things.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.720
I feel like we don't have a
lot of time left here on earth.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.040
Things are ending, so it's
good to get to the point.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.420
Well, I know this is
an academic conference,

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.740
and usually I perform
in bars and various also

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.690
classy locations,
but I wanted to,

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.280
in the spirit of the
conference, put together

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.320
my version of a lecture
of just my experiences

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.100
with comedy and language.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.310
So I'll just jump right into it.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.270
OK, here it is.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:05.470
You Had Me At YOLO, and
it is a big exploration

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:10.360
of how language exists in
an ever evolving landscape.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.150
And of course this title
I just got through a Ted

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.358
talk random title generator.

00:13:17.358 --> 00:13:20.850
But I thought it
sounded pretty official.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.260
And you know, for
laypeople, is basically

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.210
pondering as on why does
that detective emoji only

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.410
come in one skin tone,
but the blond man in emoji

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.560
comes in all of them?

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.290
And of course, that
begs for pictures.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.810
So there you go there.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:46.120
There he is in all of his
depth and then versus why?

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.670
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to
get an answer to this question,

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.350
but it does seem
like you would need

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.600
like a multicultural
sleuth on the case.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.800
And unfortunately, all we
have is a boy band to help us.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:11.350
So just a disclaimer right off
the top, because I can't get

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.200
sued again.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.310
I just don't have the time.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.890
I have many naps to take.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.570
So I just want to
cover all my bases.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.250
I know this is a
conference on language,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.260
but I just wanted to say I
cannot speak highly enough

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.150
of images.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.240
I'm a big image
fiend, and I wanted

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.610
it to not take any power away
from images before delving

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.100
into language.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.460
Here is just a photo that
I love that I've taken

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.100
in New York City, where I live.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.870
This is one of my
favorite photos,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.020
because it kind of
symbolizes everyone's attempt

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.935
to just make it work.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.692
We're all kind of
doing the best we can.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.440
I think that.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.730
And of course, I don't
want to take anything away

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.080
from Kimojis, which are the
newest type of emoji that's

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.280
out, which is a way to
express your feelings

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.030
through our Supreme
leader Kim Kardashian.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.520
And there's really
something for everyone.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.090
You can blow gum or, see
no evil, or even graduate.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:20.560
I feel like that one is a
little bit sarcastic, honestly.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.700
I don't know when you
would ever use that.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.690
And then lastly, of
course, foremost keepers

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.940
of words and
language are authors,

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:37.120
and even an author can't
resist a nice headshot.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.430
The author photo is
something that you can never

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.480
take away from them.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.450
This man seems to be
floating in space,

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.465
and this woman is
coming out of a tree.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.750
So I just wanted
to cover my bases.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.530
And then of course, I know,
language is playing with words

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.460
and very much about
words, but I know

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.990
there are a lot of people who
are into numbers and hard data,

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.020
and I just want to make
sure to give you guys

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.960
something to rest your
eyes on for a second.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.050
So there's just some
figures for you.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:19.495
This is just a light smattering
of research that I did.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:26.540
So, yeah, so now let's
get into the real stuff.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.550
So who am I?

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.147
Like language as
a whole, I think

00:16:30.147 --> 00:16:31.730
you can say that
language is very much

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.560
informed by who is speaking it.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.190
Like, the identity of
the speaker is big.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.600
So a little bit about me
and some of the lenses

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.460
that I come from.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.310
I'm a comedian.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.030
I'm a daughter.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.599
I'm a sister.

00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:46.140
I'm a friend.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.820
This is pretty much going to
read like a really long Twitter

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.180
bio.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.490
I'm an anxious depressive.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.050
I'm an introvert.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.690
I'm a feminist.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.360
I'm a heterosexual.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.170
I'm a cis woman.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.040
I'm a person of color.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.550
And I gently-floating fuzzball.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.220
That one is for tax purposes.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.530
And then I'm a florfp.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.300
I recently started
identifying as a florfp.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.869
I don't know what it is,
by definitely I am one,

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:17.780
so that's part of
my identity now.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.250
So we live in a very
exciting time for language.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.150
I feel like the internet
has really opened up

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.599
the gates in terms of
just allowing people

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.560
access to a variety of things.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.880
For example, you can just
slap a caption on a photo,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.900
and just give an animal
a rich inner life

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.333
that it didn't have before.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.950
Yeah that one's
pretty undeniable.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.350
It's doing the work for me.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.270
But even just in interacting
with people, like Facebook

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:53.010
recently came out with
a new set of reactions.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.390
So instead of just liking
things, you can also love,

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.770
ha ha, yay, wow, sad, angry.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.010
Which incidentally, this is
also kind of a life cycle of me

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.560
on Facebook.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.870
Like at the top of
my news feed versus

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.600
how I'm feeling by the end.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.710
But it's interesting,
after this came out,

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:13.480
I made a tweet
joke that was this,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.950
"why is there no Facebook
reaction for razbliuto,

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.140
the Russian word meaning
the hollow feeling

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:25.020
for someone you used to love
but no longer do," which I think

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.590
applies to a lot of the
posts I check on Facebook.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:33.720
And then I learned, after
posting that, that razbliuto is

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.320
not a Russian word at all.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.260
It was somehow
incorrectly appropriated

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.750
to the Russian
language, and then

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.940
spread so quickly on the
internet that is has now

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.170
become a word in its own right
that is attributed to English,

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.060
but it has fake Russian roots.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.380
And I guess we've
all been there.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.820
We've all claimed to be Russian.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:02.960
So I understand, but it
was a funny little study

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.385
in how quickly
language can change.

00:19:06.385 --> 00:19:09.570
And of course language
is the key to accessing

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.100
lots of things, like in
the most literal sense,

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.320
a Wi-Fi password gives you
access to the internet.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.100
Captcha is a word that proves
that you're not a robot.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.720
So these are literal
uses of language.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.280
But then I want to spend the
next part of the presentation

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.200
just talking about how language
and communicating with me

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.350
and technology has sort of
fallen into place recently

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.910
in my life.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.420
Does anyone, let me just poll
the audience really quick,

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.185
does anyone text with their
parents and or children?

00:19:43.185 --> 00:19:44.190
Does anyone?

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.100
Oh, very polite.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.520
OK, great.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:52.140
So you all will know
that I texted my mother,

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.720
and it's not always easy.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.170
It can be challenging.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.450
Usually people don't even
cheer when you ask them.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.560
Like if they text
with their parents

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.393
they're just like,
please respect my privacy

00:20:01.393 --> 00:20:02.555
during this difficult time.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.770
But I've been
texting with my mom,

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.370
and I feel like she went through
a journey of learning to text.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.570
Like this was one
of her first texts.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.990
It was pretty much
like an email.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.200
Like she would put my
name in the subject,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.410
and then and then
she'd put the message.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.670
And this one was at
the very beginning.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.700
"hope Nashville was fun, when
we got married dad would,"

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.260
and that's it.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.710
We never learned
what dad would do.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.970
We never got closure
on this message.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.700
But then she got a
little bit better,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.280
and she started using it as
kind of a tracking device.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.500
Like this is when we were, I
believe, in the MOMA together.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.490
She was like, "are
you on level 4?"

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.850
And then I tried to tell her
where I was, and then she

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:58.520
said, "already on ground
floor and hungry please,"

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.980
which really feels
like a metaphor

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.827
for the struggle in general.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.140
And then, lastly, she
just put my sister

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.270
and I on the same text
chain and was like,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.380
this is just what
you're going to get.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.860
"I did what you guys suggested.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.090
For the first time in my life
I went to a movie by myself.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.770
Gone Girl is a powerful movie.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.410
I liked it."

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:26.310
So she's just basically
blogging in a very tight circle.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.300
I'm really proud of her.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.340
But then she did
get very advanced.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.850
She started sending photos.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.580
Like one day she just sent
the moon for some reason.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.860
I guess she just clicked
in her lunar cycle finally,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.260
"bigger and brighter
moon today lovelies."

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.040
That was it.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.250
That was the whole.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.980
That's all she wanted to say.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.710
And then she actually reached
an end point recently,

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.210
a few months ago, where
she just sent this,

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:57.320
"texts are not satisfying,"
which essentially just feels

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.968
like she broke up with me.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.300
So it feels like she really
had a whole eat, pray, love

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.900
adventure on her phone.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.630
And then meanwhile to
compare her to my dad,

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.550
this is the range
of my dad's texts.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.450
This is a classic.

00:22:16.812 --> 00:22:20.080
That one's a good one.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.930
It's either that, or it's just
very pointed questions that

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:28.200
don't-- really, you don't know
what they're in reference to.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.340
But you know that it demands
an answer immediately.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.340
So family, that's kind of
communicating with my family.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.390
And then I was like,
OK, well what else?

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.830
Love, people are
looking for love.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.510
Is anyone currently
online looking for love?

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.070
OK it's fine.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.469
No one ever cheers for that.

00:22:46.469 --> 00:22:47.760
I have to find the right noise.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.560
I have to be like, if you're
on there make a quiet hiss.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.410
I don't know what the noise is.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.400
I haven't found it yet.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.150
But I'm on all the sites.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.630
I'm on OkCupid.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.220
I'm on Tinder.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.190
I spent a few weeks on Yelp.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.800
I just wanted to
go through a couple

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.870
of the messages I've
gotten, because I

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.600
feel like I stopped responding.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.399
And it got to a point where
I'm like, well these man,

00:23:13.399 --> 00:23:14.940
they're putting
themselves out there,

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.920
and if they don't
have a voice here,

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.560
then where are they going to
find that in society, you know?

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.980
So I just put together sort of
an in memoriam montage of those

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.070
we have lost in the past year.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.530
This one's a classic.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.240
"Hello dear lady.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.630
You're appealing beauty, cute,
sober, and captivating face

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.940
has forced me to send
a message to you.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.510
Can we tread on the path
of friendship together?

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.290
I like you much."

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:49.090
So this is clearly a robot
who somehow got an account.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.320
I don't know what happened.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.819
But it doesn't
really improve even

00:23:53.819 --> 00:23:55.610
when you know they're
human, like this one.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.760
"There, how are you?"

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.000
It's clearly a cut
and paste gone wrong.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.150
There, what happened to hi?

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.547
Someone else got that one.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.285
"There, how are you.

00:24:09.285 --> 00:24:11.450
I enjoyed reading your profile.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:16.040
I feel we have few
things in common."

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.780
Oh, then I think we're
pretty much done,

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.990
with the few things
that we have in common.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.180
This one is a profile of
a man who messaged me.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.810
"I'm a man looking for
more than most men are,

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.650
which is someone
who wants the same,

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.850
but wants to have
fun getting there,"

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:39.520
which is basically just a
riddle from a bridge troll.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.710
None of that makes sense.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:48.210
And then he writes "I
am a work alcoholic."

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:53.490
I think a work alcoholic
is just a comedian,

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.905
it's just a fancy way to say it.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.100
This one is to the point.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.930
"Come smoke weed."

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.250
But it's more when it was
sent, which is on Christmas.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.160
Again, it's like men communicate
differently, you know?

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.380
Clearly that was his
gift for that year.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.870
And then this man, not
a man of many words.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.390
He sent a frowny face.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.680
But then, like a gentleman,
followed up three months later

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.410
with, "we should
definitely talk."

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:34.330
He felt like he got
off on the wrong foot

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.880
with the frowny face
three months ago.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.270
"I can teach you how to golf."

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.118
And then this man and just
straight up wrote a poem.

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.120
We don't have to read it.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.950
There's no time.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:52.330
But basically, the
gist is that love

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:57.710
is like a sword fight between
your heart and these eyes.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.740
So men clearly
communicate differently.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.660
I hope you garnered
some of that distinction

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.360
through some of those messages.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.300
And if you're not online,
please get on there.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.700
You're missing out.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.010
Another thing that happens
a lot as a comedian

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.850
is you get a lot of
internet comments.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.310
Mine pretty much
range from hate,

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:23.460
which is like this one, "what
it is your problem," which

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.390
was really in
reference to nothing,

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.610
to just mild confusion
of you entirely.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.970
"That's so true, Doug."

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:31.790
Who is Doug?

00:26:34.565 --> 00:26:36.540
This is never answered.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.940
She just wrote this on my wall.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.310
I think it's someone's aunt.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.690
But basically, let's
see, how am I on time?

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:48.910
OK, I have to wrap it up.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.850
So I'll skip this
next-- OK, well I

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.890
just wanted to do
real quick, these

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:55.790
are some new words
that I learned today,

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.010
just to help you guys.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.910
I was like, I need to
learn some new slang words,

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.190
so just that so everyone
can learn with me.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.830
Here's some.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.230
Netflix and chill, if you
want to casually hook up

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:07.585
with someone.

00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:10.390
Snatched, on point,
it's the new fleek.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.330
Fleek is done.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:14.770
You heard it here first.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.370
There's extra, where
you're trying too hard

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.960
or being over the top.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.310
Ship is two people you want to
be in a relationship together.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.740
Like if you're like, I
ship Kevin and Tracy,

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.610
then that means you want
them to find true love.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.190
Sleeved, someone with
undeserved confidence.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.470
And OTP, one true
pairing, a couple

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.890
you are emotionally invested in.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.450
Clearly a lot of these
are sort of female driven.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.290
But here's the twist,
one of them I made up.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.952
Care to wager a guess?

00:27:48.891 --> 00:27:50.040
-Sleeved.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.570
-Sleeved, you're right.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.950
OK, I've got to go back to the
drawing board with my attempts

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.870
to influence language.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:03.040
And then, basically, in
conflusion, which is a word

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.540
I made up that means
confused conclusion,

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:10.380
because I don't think I really
came to any true points here.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.830
This is quote from Jay Z,
known wordsmith and rapper,

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.510
"remind yourself, nobody built
like you, you design yourself."

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.090
And that can be about you,
or it can be about language.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.180
Think about it.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.810
OK that's going to be if for me.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:27.770
Thanks guys.

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:28.547
Thanks a lot.

00:28:37.989 --> 00:28:39.030
-OK, let's do that again.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.500
Aparna Nancherla, people.

00:28:43.794 --> 00:28:45.210
I think what's
going to happen now

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.100
is they're going to bring
up chairs and things,

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.433
and we're going to all sit here.

00:28:48.433 --> 00:28:49.630
I'm not sure that's a chair.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.490
I believe that's a stool,
but I think we're going to--

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:53.020
-It is.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.890
-84,000 Twitter followers.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.031
I mean, again applause.

00:28:59.031 --> 00:28:59.530
-Thank you.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:28:59.990
Thank you.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.090
-While we're getting
ready to sit down--

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.010
-Yeah.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.640
-Why is your Twitter
handle aparnapkin?

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.820
-Oh, aparnapkin?

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.750
It's because I was on Twitter
before people were using it

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.740
as a professional tool.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.910
So I was still trying to be cute
when I came up with my handle.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.880
It still haunts me today.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.740
-You define yourself
as a crumpled napkin?

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.600
-Yes.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.370
-That's sad.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:26.447
-Is it?

00:29:26.447 --> 00:29:27.030
-I'm not sure.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:27.600
We'll discuss.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.840
But first, I want to let people
know who's up here with us.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.890
Glenda Carpio, professor
of English and African

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.840
and African-American
Studies at Harvard,

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.940
and she's got a terrific
book, Laughing Fit to Kill,

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.510
in which she's looked at
comedy and through a very

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.110
interesting filter of race.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.110
And so we're going
to get started here.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:48.450
Why a crumpled napkin?

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.760
You're not a crumpled napkin.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.650
-No I think I just
like it because it's

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.710
like something that you
absorb things and ideas,

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:02.261
and then you're muddled, but
you're sifting through things.

00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:02.760
-OK

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.100
-Yeah, and that's what you do.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.730
I was noticing one of your
tweets, you talk about emojis.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.840
You sent one out, "why is
there only one white snowman?"

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.860
-I know.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.820
It's a real problem.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:16.550
-Real problem, so the
overarching conversation

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:21.810
of the two days is how language
changes over time, maybe

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:25.500
because as issues of
sexuality and gender

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.140
maybe bend the language a bit.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.320
When you're doing your
comedy, do you feel it evolve?

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.430
I was thinking, for
instance, might it

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.790
be OK to do a joke now
about Caitlyn Jenner,

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.240
because she's one
and she's powerful,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.150
but it might not have
been OK a while back?

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:49.000
-Yeah, I mean, I think comedy
is very influenced by time.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.630
I remember reading
an article where

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.360
it was someone was studying
how soon after a tragedy,

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.920
like a Twitter
joke, became funny.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.740
Like it wasn't funny hours after
this natural disaster happened.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.260
But then it was like, he
looked at it five weeks later

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.150
and it was like,
then it was popular.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:10.560
So I do think there's an arc
of people's emotional journey

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.380
of being able to accept
something as funny once they've

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.940
sort of distanced themselves
from the grief, or the tragedy,

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.670
or the struggle of something.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.460
-Well the struggle,
and that brings

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.140
to mind something I wanted
to talk to you both about.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.723
Glenda, I know you want to throw
out some thoughts about this,

00:31:26.723 --> 00:31:27.460
the Oscars.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.170
Did you all see Chris
Rock do the Oscars?

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.150
I mean, right in the opening
monologue, Glenda, there

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.490
he is saying, you might wonder
why we weren't protesting

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.710
not enough blacks previously.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.430
Well back in the
day we were too busy

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:45.100
getting raped and lynched
to care who won best

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.520
Oscar for documentary short.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.950
I mean that was hilarious, but
talk about that, well when it's

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.330
time for something.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.720
-Well a statement
people hear often

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.490
about comedy is that comedy
is tragedy plus time,

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:06.250
but racial inequality in
America is not over, right?

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:10.280
So if there's no time,
so it's constantly

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.500
floating between tragedy
and comedy, right?

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.880
So the moment in
which Chris Rock

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.850
says that, it's a moment
that some feel the tragedy

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.820
is still there, still so urgent.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.290
It's not ready for comedy,
and others feel differently.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.460
People laugh and out of
synchronicity, right,

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.420
from different vantage points.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.250
But I think that's one of
the most powerful aspects

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.680
about humor, is that it
doesn't always just entertain.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.730
It makes you feel
incredibly uncomfortable.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.394
-Well he then kept going.

00:32:40.394 --> 00:32:42.310
I mean after he talked
about African-Americans

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:45.180
getting raped and lynched,
we're too busy, uneasy laugh.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.960
And then he says, when
your grandmother's swinging

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.620
from a tree, you don't care.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.890
He just kept going and
kept going all night.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:53.430
-Yeah.

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:56.480
-In fact, you featured a skit
of his in one of your books,

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:56.980
I think.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:02.230
-Yeah, I mean he was
talking about when

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:06.330
slaves go on vacation.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:07.542
It's like--

00:33:07.542 --> 00:33:08.250
-Should we laugh?

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.760
-You go around to
the well, and you

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.325
meet the other slave who's
also taking a vacation by going

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:15.420
around the well, you know?

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.470
I mean one of the things
about comedy, about races,

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:23.450
and especially about
labor, it's like, again,

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.230
the discussion of reparation is
still very much alive, right?

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:32.810
Wall Street was the place
where that New York slave trade

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.820
market was on.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.140
Literally the
geographical space, right?

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.970
Wall Street itself, the wall,
was built by slaves, right?

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.020
Nearby there's an
African burial, right?

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.990
So there's the fact
of America been built

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.095
by slave labor is true, right?

00:33:49.095 --> 00:33:52.200
And so riffing on
taking a vacation

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.810
if you're a slave in
the now with Chris Rock,

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.480
and this is partly
one of the things

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.990
I wanted to talk
to you about, which

00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.823
is one of the things
about Chris Rock that's

00:33:59.823 --> 00:34:02.890
really amazing as a comedian
is that he, like Richard Pryor,

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:07.600
is this little body
with this voice.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.840
And the contrast
between the lightness

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.110
of his body, the things he
says, and the voice itself, I

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:18.739
think also makes for a very
pungent kind of comedy,

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:19.633
you know?

00:34:19.633 --> 00:34:22.600
-Do you think about your
physicality when you're--

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.159
-Yeah, but I don't
think it's as-- it's

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:29.580
more of the thing of you're
being perceived sort of outside

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.250
in, whereas when
you're performing

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.010
you're sort of
thinking inside out.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.320
So I don't take it
into consideration

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.179
when I'm thinking
through my act.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:41.230
But I think often
it's put on you.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.440
Like identifiers are put
on you as a performer.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.790
-Well you acknowledge that.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:47.400
I think I just dinged, sorry.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.889
Well you acknowledge-- sorry.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.885
-Are you texting someone?

00:34:52.885 --> 00:34:54.259
-I was tweeting
your whole thing.

00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:55.710
It was great.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.160
But you had knowledge that,
if I'm reading correctly,

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.230
when you come out do
your regular stand up,

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.130
you kind of say
something like, I know.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:02.630
-Yeah.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.840
-What are you saying I know to?

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.710
-Just because people
have an expectation

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.030
of what they think
a stand up comedian

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.540
should look like, or what a
performer should look like.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.916
And I think I had performed
enough times that I sort of was

00:35:15.916 --> 00:35:17.540
like, OK well I'm
just going to address

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.140
that so I can move on to what
I actually want to talk about.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.590
And it's like OK, I get it.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.700
I don't like what you
think I should look like.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.330
-I know, Mindy Kaling and me.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:26.830
-Yeah.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:27.750
-Right, that's it.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.990
But let's find out about you.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.260
The daughter of two doctors.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:37.020
Did I understand, you
actually chose between West

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.690
Point and Amherst College?

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:39.550
-Yeah.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.390
-That's funny.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.603
-I know.

00:35:41.603 --> 00:35:43.110
-That's funny, isn't it?

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.510
-Really pushing the
indecisiveness of myself

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.140
to a bit.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.890
-Which one, by the way?

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:51.390
-Did I go?

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.750
Amherst.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:52.375
-Amherst, yeah.

00:35:52.375 --> 00:35:54.670
-Yeah, yeah, I don't
think there would be here

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:55.030
if I went to West Point.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.790
-Well what did that
tell us about you?

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.260
Indecisive, but what more
did the tell us about you?

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.490
-I think just that
I think I have

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:07.140
distinct ideas of identities
I want to inhabit.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.080
I was interested in
West Point as a kid

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.710
because I was really interested
in leadership and survival,

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.310
and for some reason
I was fixated on,

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.360
if I was dropped in the middle
of the woods, could I hack it?

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.410
I had that, and
then I had like, I

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.440
want to lose myself in a book.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.597
Like so I had these
two sort of identities,

00:36:28.597 --> 00:36:29.930
and I think I just had trouble--

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.600
-So you were basically a
comedian from the get go.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.370
-Yeah, I mean it all
was in my head, too.

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.550
Because it is like it comes in
a sort of unexpected package,

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.570
so I think it surprises people.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.190
-Yeah, I know
Glenda, before, one

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:49.920
of these you want to talk
about is language and the most

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.560
prominent women that
we're seeing right now,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.790
Hillary Clinton.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.960
What are some of the questions
that are being raised for you?

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.390
-She's so stiff, right?

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:05.112
I mean, and so lacks a
sense of self comedy.

00:37:05.112 --> 00:37:06.570
I mean not that
she has to have it,

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:10.560
but what does it mean to
hold the platform as a woman?

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.180
I think you can
become that stiff.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.263
One of the things that was
immediately funny to me

00:37:14.263 --> 00:37:18.940
by your set up was doing
lecturing as a woman.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.430
I mean, especially
when I started here,

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.300
when I was fresh
out of grad school,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.800
I looked like a
grad student, right?

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.580
So getting up on the
podium to lecture

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:31.100
was already a kind
of funny situation.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:36.530
I had to perform the idea of
a Harvard professor, right?

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.340
And I didn't look the part.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.680
What I loved about
your piece was how you

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.380
did like the fake etymology.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.010
The whole thing, the
whole idea, of a genre

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.200
of the lecture that
people expect, and you

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.690
twisted it around.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.130
Thinking about Hillary
Clinton, what kind of scripts

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.300
does she have to
follow, you know?

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.280
What is as a political animal?

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.660
How does she have to hold back?

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.300
How does she have to--
I mean you were saying,

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.330
what if a woman was saying
the same things that Drumpf

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:06.570
is saying, you know?

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.670
-Well yeah, I mean what
if a woman came out

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.580
and she was older, in her
70s, with wild graying hair,

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.750
and she talked in
exclamation points like that.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:20.964
-We looked up at the mash up
of Drumpf's and Clinton's face.

00:38:20.964 --> 00:38:21.630
-You've seen it?

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.220
-If you want to be
terrorized, you go.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.510
If you have the kind
of perverse desire to--

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:30.450
-They've mashed
their faces together.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.620
-Yeah, it's horrible.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.640
-But, I mean, did you feel
this ever as a comedian?

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.330
Because we were talking
about how Hillary Clinton,

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:41.530
in many ways-- she comes out
and it's this wonderful moment.

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:45.470
And I've been privileged to meet
her, personally, many times,

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:48.250
and she's loose and
sweet and small.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.740
And just the completely-- but
you feel as if she's being

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.257
forced into jackets, and
pantsuits, and a certain--

00:38:55.257 --> 00:38:56.090
-Horrible pantsuits.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:57.756
-Kind of thing, so
that she'll come out.

00:38:57.756 --> 00:39:01.100
I mean, the first thing, if you
win a primary, the first thing,

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.380
you walk on the stage,
and people are cheering.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.160
Would you say,
immediately, thank you,

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.940
I am going to build a ladder.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.670
Is that the first
thing you'd say?

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:15.880
No, you'd say, oh,
isn't this great or wow.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.660
But if feels like she's been
robbed of that language.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.210
-Yeah, I mean I also feel
like women, in general,

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.910
are fed so many
contradictory messages.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.744
At the end, it does
drive you crazy.

00:39:26.744 --> 00:39:28.410
And you're like, I
don't know how to be.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.490
I'm just going to be a robot.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:33.590
I'll just be a robot so
no one can criticize.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.900
-Well another thing we
wanted to ask you about

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:40.310
is, remember in August
when Naomi Wolf wrote

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:43.504
a piece in The Guardian
about vocal fry?

00:39:43.504 --> 00:39:45.995
Some of you familiar with that?

00:39:45.995 --> 00:39:48.150
It was a criticism of
young women in particular.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.320
They show up a lot on
This American Life,

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.280
And they talk like that,
and they have vocal fry.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.800
And Naomi felt that
this was just an affect,

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.360
and that young women
should get over it,

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.880
that it was demeaning to them.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.484
And it was much like
it wa-- she said

00:40:04.484 --> 00:40:06.900
it was like a valley girl who
had gone to a rave the night

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.280
before and lost her voice.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:13.854
Well I called a
professor at Oxford,

00:40:13.854 --> 00:40:15.520
her name escapes me
right now, but she's

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.449
a feminist and a linguistic
professor in the UK.

00:40:19.449 --> 00:40:21.740
And I thought she was going
to say, yes it's important,

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.380
much like up talk at
the end of sentences.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.560
And instead she said, do
not do this to young women,

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.490
because it's just like shaming
them for the way they dress.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.190
And don't shame
the way they talk.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:38.769
And further, young
women change language.

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:40.810
They're some of the leaders
in changing language.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:44.020
You had some thoughts
about that, that we--

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.760
-This is a broad
generalization, but it

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.240
works for ethnic groups,
racialized groups,

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.950
there's a standard
way of speaking

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:55.650
which is often connect to
a standard race or class.

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.280
I mean the way that
people in Europe

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.100
have a sense of
social difference

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.400
is dialect and accents, right?

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.630
The way we do it here
is phenotype, right?

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.100
And we do it phenotype
and language, right?

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.490
And so it's gender, race.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:13.260
We hear all of that in
the way people speak.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.655
-I realize I love to
say, "and I'm all."

00:41:16.655 --> 00:41:18.090
I love that.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.090
He was all this
and I was all that.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:20.950
I love it.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.655
That came from a young woman.

00:41:23.655 --> 00:41:25.870
I interview Nobel
Peace Prize winners

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.750
and they begin their
sentence with so.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.410
You know, so your
thoughts on that.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:33.160
Speak more as this woman
that I'm talking about.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.790
-Yeah no, I agree with that.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:38.940
I agree with not shaming
women for how they talk.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:43.330
And just language in itself
is such a fluid changing thing

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:49.030
that I think to put
restrictions on how people talk,

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:54.420
or how they sound, is such
a way of holding people

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.910
down or silencing them.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.630
Of being like, oh
well how you talk

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.280
is really annoying to everyone,
so maybe don't talk as much.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.520
That's basically what
you're saying to women.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.420
You're like, don't
talk, we don't like it.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.990
I'm like, I thought
we were past that.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.580
We can vote, you know?

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.100
-Well it's like the
perennial question

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:18.470
that people often get asked,
women get asked, in comedies.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.840
Are women funny?

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.430
It's an insane question
that keeps getting asked.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.692
Really the under commentary
is, are you human?

00:42:27.692 --> 00:42:28.192
-Yeah.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.820
Its current now, or I guess
we're in the ebb of it,

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.871
because it is
like, Amy Schumer--

00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:39.370
-Tina Fey.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:42.380
-Tina Fey, Kristen
Wiig, but it is

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.600
like this argument that
comes up like every 17 years,

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.160
like cicadas or something,
where it's like, we

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.500
have to solve this again.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.520
It's like nothing changed.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.865
-I know, right?

00:42:52.865 --> 00:42:54.610
-What about physical
humor, though?

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.340
You were saying that
it's still hard--

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.320
-I mean, think of
Eddy Murphy, right?

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.200
He got on stage.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.420
He came out, and one of
me students in Black Humor

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.390
said that he looked like
a human condom, right?

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.320
Those leather
outfits that he had,

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.070
he was like a walking penis.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:12.970
He would hold his penis,
you know, and all that.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:17.100
I mean, it's the kind of stuff
that, if you do that, you are,

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.610
as a woman, and it's a totally
different scene, you know?

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.910
I mean Wanda Sykes
does a amazing bit

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:27.540
about going to a titty
bar in Florida, right?

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.120
And she's amazing in the
physical comedy of it,

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.720
but there are very
few women who can

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.960
risk that because
it has-- you're

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.740
sexualized anyway, right?

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.370
But if you draw attention
to it through comedy people

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.630
are going to this stop
at the sex and kind

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:48.655
of let go of the humor somehow.

00:43:48.655 --> 00:43:50.256
I mean, it's crazy.

00:43:50.256 --> 00:43:52.380
I mean, someone like Louis
CK could make comedy out

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.980
of his belly, right?

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.580
But think about a fat woman
coming out and doing comedy

00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.860
about a belly, right?

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:04.560
There's so much baggage around
women and their physicalness,

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.460
that I think people can't
even really even laugh at it,

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.090
you know?

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:11.880
-Yeah, well I think even
between men and women,

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.110
specifically in those
I guess binary terms,

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:18.850
I feel like there is a
masculine sense of humor,

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.970
and way of being,
and then there's

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.610
like a more feminine
sort of character

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.380
driven and subtle
nuanced way of joking.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.400
And I do feel like both
male and female comedians

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.830
weave between the two, but
I do think that it is often

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.300
female comedians are
expected to adapt

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.950
more masculine
traits and qualities,

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.400
whereas more men
don't cross over.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.630
Because I will see sometimes
men in the audience

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:49.300
check out during a
female comedian's set,

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.059
but it's only because her style
is not the same like setup

00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:55.100
punch line, set up punch
line, set up punch line.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.030
And they're just like,
I don't understand.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.810
And they like sort of,
this is not for me.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:04.480
But it's like, it shouldn't
be like female comedy is

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.160
like a niche thing.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.420
We're all human, so it's
like it's all one spectrum,

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:13.440
but it is like that is what
stand up started as chiefly,

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.455
so that's what like
people think stand up is.

00:45:15.455 --> 00:45:17.330
-But it's crazy though,
because if you really

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:19.730
think about comedies,
let's just take

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:24.040
the example of American culture,
some of was minstrel stage,

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.320
and so much of it was like
people crossdressing, right?

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:27.820
-Yeah.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:33.860
-So it was like white men
playing black and playing

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.110
female, right?

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:39.210
And so it's all of this getting
very close to all these taboos

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:45.100
that are then all be
constantly alive, right?

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:49.040
And so when you have to stand
up without the minstrel set up,

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.910
it's interesting that we
can't go to those taboos,

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:55.820
or that they're alive on
stage in a very different way.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.545
-Right.

00:45:57.545 --> 00:45:59.670
-I just had a couple
questions, because again we're

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.937
going to have a performance
from ImprovBoston,

00:46:01.937 --> 00:46:02.770
which we can't wait.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.890
And I think, I don't know
if I've got this right,

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.040
but I think that
they're actually

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.630
going to be playing off some of
the things we've said up here.

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:09.129
Oh joy.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.100
-I somehow am thinking parody.

00:46:16.407 --> 00:46:18.240
-And also we're going
to get your questions.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.810
But I just had one, every
word that you spoke,

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.830
you may not want to let
us inside your process,

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:28.690
but every word that you spoke
when you did this was perfect.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:29.360
It was.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.040
-Whoa.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.630
-It was.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.340
It was, wasn't it?

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.880
-I'm going to really have
to dig into that therapy

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.540
exercising, accepting
a complement.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.937
-Breathe.

00:46:41.937 --> 00:46:42.520
No but it was.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:47.660
And so is it is not because you
spent hours making sure that--

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.910
do you craft it that way?

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:53.400
-I mean, I feel like
stand ups have--

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.830
someone come to it from a more
sort of organic of like talking

00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:59.200
their ideas out on stage.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:04.610
I think I have a more writerly
mind and sort of control issues

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.990
where I have to know what I'm
going to say for the most part

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.780
ahead of time.

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:12.300
So I think I do latch
on to like phrases

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.500
and I like love language
and I love word play,

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.300
so I think I sort of
build my jokes and ideas

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.540
around just like a set of
words, or a set of phrases.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.450
So I think that sort of
runs through what I do.

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:28.570
-And this was a
language lecture.

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:31.150
But I just loved how
you seem to love words.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:35.690
What's that one that's over,
because I didn't know that it--

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:36.390
-Fleek.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:37.080
-I'm sorry?

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:37.900
-I'm fleek.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.570
-What?

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:40.180
What is it?

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:40.680
-It's OK.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.760
I was, when I made
that slide, I was

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.480
like I don't know if you're
reading the room right.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.640
-No, I'm not the room.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.130
What does it mean?

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:54.990
-On fleek is like on point.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:56.110
Like if you're like--

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.300
-Tom Ashbrook.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.640
I'm sorry.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.640
That's a Boston-- sorry.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.580
Go ahead.

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.650
-But yeah, it look
like it's spot on.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:07.010
-Oh, but if I start
using it now, it's--

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:08.949
-It's usually more about
someone's appearance

00:48:08.949 --> 00:48:09.490
or something.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:10.500
-But it's over.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.383
That word is over.

00:48:11.383 --> 00:48:14.680
-Yeah, apparently it's snatched.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:18.215
-And one last thing,
do either of you,

00:48:18.215 --> 00:48:22.490
you work with words, you work
with words, I work with news,

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:24.440
and work with words that way.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.799
We had a crazy day today.

00:48:25.799 --> 00:48:26.840
I don't know if you know.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.580
Mitt Romney's got up and
excoriated Donald Trump.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.350
Unbelievable, and
then Donald Trump

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.510
got up and excoriated him back.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:39.040
And I was working,
trying to, because we

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.540
update for different time zones,
and we're trying to listen.

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.360
And I looked up at
one point, and you

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.010
know how CNN has the banner
that goes across the bottom,

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:51.720
and it said, Trump colon,
and I ruined my carpet

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.300
endorsing Romney."

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.690
I know, and apparently he had
a fundraiser for Mitt Romney,

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.314
and people come with muddy
shoes, and ruined his carpet.

00:49:02.314 --> 00:49:03.980
And so he'd got a
whole screen about how

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.350
he should bill Mitt Romney
for his carpet from the time

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:08.190
he'd helped.

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:11.650
And then you could tell someone
at CNN was just like lost

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:12.480
their mind.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:18.310
So Trump, I ruined my
carpet endorsing Romney.

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:21.820
Do you ever find it's
like too hard to be funny,

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.960
because real life's so funny?

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.820
-It's like a joke on a joke.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.520
-What do you do with that?

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.501
That, he really said.

00:49:31.501 --> 00:49:32.000
-I know.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.550
I know.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.490
I mean, it's funny.

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:39.210
With all of that going on right
now, it is like, as a comedian,

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:40.020
it's interesting.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.360
Part of it is almost like we
are living in a fever dream.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.620
And like do you
make jokes about it,

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:52.362
or you just like let's us
put cold towels on our faces?

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.190
But I still think
we can make a joke

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:03.720
on-- as a comedian your
goal is to heighten

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.410
whatever the reality is.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:09.987
So I think if he said
that about his carpet,

00:50:09.987 --> 00:50:11.320
what else would he say it about.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.880
There's always some
direction to go.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.120
-Well that is just the
set up for a sexual joke.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:16.870
-Yeah.

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:19.770
-Like, I ruined my carpet.

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.790
-Yeah there's something
distasteful there.

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:24.012
-So weird.

00:50:24.012 --> 00:50:25.810
-What?

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:28.765
-OK let's stop there.

00:50:28.765 --> 00:50:34.400
Glenda Carpio, Aparna
Nancherla, wonderful.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.400
So want we're going to do is,
we're going to take our seats,

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.557
and we're going to invite
members of ImprovBoston

00:50:39.557 --> 00:50:40.140
to come on up.

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.732
And guys, why don't we
start making the transition?

00:50:42.732 --> 00:50:43.680
We'll move the chairs.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.280
ImprovBoston, ladies
and gentlemen,

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.020
have you been to Central Square?

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:52.910
One of the great
shining jewels of Boston

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:56.350
over there in Porter
Square, and they also

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.480
visit hospitals in
different places,

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:03.610
taking their fun stuff to
places where it really lands.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:05.820
But I have a feeling, now
they're going to skewer us.

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.020
And so, ImprovBoston.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.949
-Thank you so much.

00:51:12.949 --> 00:51:13.990
Thank you so much, Robin.

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:17.460
We are ImprovBoston
My name is Deana.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.190
-I'm Kelly.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.840
-Hey, I'm Greg.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.680
-My name is Corey.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.400
-I'm Sara.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.030
-Rosena.

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:22.600
-And I'm Mike.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.216
-Thank you so much for your
smattering of applause.

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:29.510
So Aparna is a brilliant
stand up and a writer,

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:32.420
and as Robin said, her
words were perfection.

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.650
So Aparna spent a lot
of time making sure

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.870
that every word she says up here
was going to be exactly right.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:40.670
We do a different
style of comedy

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.120
called improvisation, where
we haven't prepared anything

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.370
at all, and we
have no idea what's

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:45.703
going to come out of our mouths.

00:51:45.703 --> 00:51:47.290
-However, it's still perfect.

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:51.060
-Oh well, we'll let them
be the judge, Corey.

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.650
We hope that's the case,
and we assume it will be,

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:56.520
but the audience is
ultimately the judge of that.

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.612
So what we're going to
do is an improvised set.

00:51:58.612 --> 00:52:00.070
And as Robin
mentioned, we're going

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:03.470
to take our inspiration tonight
from what we have all just

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.430
experienced.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:06.324
So we're going to use
what Aparna had to say.

00:52:06.324 --> 00:52:08.490
We're going to use what
Glenda and Robin had to say,

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:10.640
and other information
about the conference.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.010
And we're going to be
completely making everything up

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.620
on the spot.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.460
So what you're about to see
has never happened before.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.480
I assure you it will
never happen again.

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.230
Everything is going to be
improvised just for you,

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:23.870
and that means we
may need your help.

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:27.220
So throughout our 23
minutes and 45 seconds,

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.656
we might be coming to you
all for some suggestions.

00:52:29.656 --> 00:52:30.780
We've got some microphones.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.550
We can run right
out to the audience.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:34.050
All of you look
afraid right now.

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.286
It's fine.

00:52:35.286 --> 00:52:37.930
I promise, it will
be completely fine.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:39.930
So let's just get a little
bit warmed up, right?

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:43.164
So just for everyone, I'll
just ask what your name.

00:52:43.164 --> 00:52:45.080
And on the count of
three, you'll yell it out.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.260
It'll be very easy.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.230
What is your, one, two, three?

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.660
All of you are name Jennifer.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:52.512
I don't know.

00:52:52.512 --> 00:52:53.720
That was a terrible question.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.894
I couldn't hear any of it.

00:52:54.894 --> 00:52:56.060
You're all named Glenda now.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.940
So we're going to
start our set tonight.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.230
We just heard some
really inspiring things

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:02.980
by Glenda and Aparna and Robin.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.740
What is, from someone
in the audience,

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.772
something that you heard in
their discussion, one word that

00:53:07.772 --> 00:53:08.480
stuck out to you?

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.647
This is the language
conference after all.

00:53:10.647 --> 00:53:11.780
-Carpet.

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:12.350
-Carpet.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:12.890
-Carpet.

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:13.390
-Great.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.890
-Thank you.

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:14.596
-Thank you.

00:53:14.596 --> 00:53:15.096
-Carpet.

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:20.410
-It's just, it's ruined.

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:22.240
The carpet is completely
ruined right now.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.530
-I feel like this
is like the time

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:28.021
that I spilled coffee on my
pant suit and no one told me.

00:53:28.021 --> 00:53:28.520
And--

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.460
-Do you know how many
pant suits I have ruined

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.860
endorsing political candidates?

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.034
-You've got blond hair.

00:53:38.034 --> 00:53:38.534
-Yeah.

00:53:38.534 --> 00:53:39.986
-I got blond hair.

00:53:39.986 --> 00:53:42.278
-Yeah, you want
start a boy band.

00:53:42.278 --> 00:53:46.220
-I also have blond
hair, just saying.

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:49.400
-I'm just going to rest
this joke here for a second.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.534
In five hours, it'll be funny.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:57.670
-Hello, my name is Sara.

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:01.730
I will be playing the part
of your professor today.

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:05.330
I might not look
like your professor,

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:07.630
but that's who I will
be playing today,

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:09.970
because I am a performer.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:11.012
-Hello, my name is Deana.

00:54:11.012 --> 00:54:12.928
I will be playing the
part of a student today.

00:54:12.928 --> 00:54:13.430
-OK, quiet.

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:15.440
It's my turn.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.270
Professor Ship is-- did
you have a question?

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:21.272
-I just wanted to say that
I actually went to Emerson,

00:54:21.272 --> 00:54:23.480
so it's a miracle they're
letting me in this building

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:23.790
right now.

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:24.289
-Yes.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.560
-You guys, several times I was
telling you about things that I

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.030
wanted to tell you about.

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:35.000
-Hey, excuse me--

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.455
-I just wanted to say--

00:54:36.455 --> 00:54:38.400
-Sometimes--

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.068
-Can you please not.

00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:41.884
You're literally
shaming me right now.

00:54:41.884 --> 00:54:45.750
-I ordered a coffee and it
only came as a latte soy upside

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:46.750
down frappuccino.

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:51.117
-I was thinking that it would
be good if we all were to just

00:54:51.117 --> 00:54:51.617
get--

00:54:51.617 --> 00:54:54.730
-Freeze, Corey and
Sara, switch characters.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:02.360
-So you were saying in a
normal human speech pattern--

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:02.860
-Right.

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:03.360
-Right.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.650
-My thesis is about several
things that have to do with

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:08.150
comedy--

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:09.392
-As the head of--

00:55:09.392 --> 00:55:11.080
-Freeze.

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:14.665
Kelly and Sara switch character.

00:55:14.665 --> 00:55:22.425
--[INAUDIBLE] I didn't
get a piece of corn.

00:55:22.425 --> 00:55:25.805
-So what you're saying is--

00:55:25.805 --> 00:55:26.305
-Freeze.

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:30.540
Greg and Dina,
switch characters.

00:55:33.426 --> 00:55:35.370
-It's OK.

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.024
-Are you upset?

00:55:37.024 --> 00:55:38.896
I'm having a hard time.

00:55:38.896 --> 00:55:41.314
What the emotion?

00:55:41.314 --> 00:55:45.690
Do you need-- do you feel--

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:53.720
-Mrs. Clinton, I just
need you to understand,

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:59.890
as our country's first major
contender to be president,

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:03.660
who is a woman, we are so
honored to have you bring--

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.630
-I'm sorry, I have Mrs.
Clinton's update ready.

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.455
-It's just, we want
you to be warm.

00:56:09.455 --> 00:56:10.590
-Enjoy version 2.3.

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:11.090
-OK.

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.870
-Freeze, every time
Miss Clinton speaks,

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.820
she can only speak
in a certain number

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.870
of words between one and 30.

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:18.650
How many words?

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:19.950
-Five.

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:20.770
-I heard five.

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:23.170
Every time Miss Clinton
speaks, it's in five words.

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:23.950
No more, no less.

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:26.030
Continue.

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:30.290
-Mrs. Clinton, we need you
to be warm and also cold.

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:32.830
And we need you to be hard,
and we need to be soft.

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:36.250
And we need you to be strong
and weak, all at the same time.

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:38.440
We need to be vulnerable
but impenetrable,

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:42.320
and we need you to be
an achiever, but also

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.580
an underachiever.

00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:46.690
We want you to be successful
and unsuccessful all at once.

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:48.630
We don't want you to
have too much experience,

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:51.810
but we need you to have
all the experience.

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:55.590
-How are you all doing out--

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:01.340
-Do we have another update
for Mrs. Clinton, or is this--

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.220
-That was unfortunately
the last one.

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.190
-OK.

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:05.660
-This is Clinton 4.0.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:10.240
-OK, well I'm sure
the people would love

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.390
to hear what you have to say.

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:15.520
So I know I have some
questions for Mrs. Clinton.

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:19.720
-Mrs. Clinton, excuse me, in as
many words as you possibly can,

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.696
what is your vision for America?

00:57:21.696 --> 00:57:26.687
-America is a place.

00:57:26.687 --> 00:57:27.270
-That is true.

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:28.380
America is a place.

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.005
Does anyone have a question for
Mrs. Clinton, from the audience

00:57:31.005 --> 00:57:31.504
here?

00:57:31.504 --> 00:57:33.370
Would like to ask Mrs.
Clinton a question?

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:33.870
-Question?

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:35.022
Any question at all?

00:57:35.022 --> 00:57:35.856
Any Question at all?

00:57:35.856 --> 00:57:36.438
-I've got one.

00:57:36.438 --> 00:57:37.530
-Yeah, we've go one here.

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:40.160
-Yeah, so what would
be the first thing you

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.900
do when you get into office?

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.198
-Very good question.

00:57:43.198 --> 00:57:49.338
-Great question,
more Ellen Show.

00:57:49.338 --> 00:57:50.337
Woot.

00:57:50.337 --> 00:57:51.191
Woot.

00:57:51.191 --> 00:57:53.500
-Finger on the pulse of America.

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.336
-Woot.

00:57:54.336 --> 00:57:55.510
Woot.

00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:56.010
Woot.

00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:57.060
-Great, I think we've got
another question here.

00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:59.530
-Oh good, because she'll
woot for rest of the hour.

00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:02.020
-Who will your first
cabinet appointment be?

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:02.900
-Great question.

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:03.380
Cabinet appointment.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.379
-Cabinet appointment,
first cabinet appointment.

00:58:05.379 --> 00:58:09.430
-My husband, Bill, of course.

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:12.560
-Mixed reaction from the room,
not sure that's a good idea.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.509
-If we're going to be
fielding questions here,

00:58:14.509 --> 00:58:16.050
I only think it's
appropriate that we

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:18.939
have everybody involved.

00:58:18.939 --> 00:58:19.865
It's me, Donald.

00:58:19.865 --> 00:58:21.310
You didn't recognize it?

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:23.755
-Oh, I mean the--

00:58:23.755 --> 00:58:24.705
-It's spot on.

00:58:24.705 --> 00:58:26.130
-It's spot on.

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:27.080
Spot on.

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:31.960
Well, does anyone have a
question for Mr. Drumpf, today?

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.850
Who has a question
for Mr. Drumpf?

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:38.660
No one wants to talk
to-- right here.

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:45.229
-You said earlier that you
were upset about your rug,

00:58:45.229 --> 00:58:47.020
could you tell us a
little more about that?

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:51.160
-I had a perfectly
nice finished basement.

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.640
Beautiful, beautiful
finished basement.

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.210
Had a corner bar and everything.

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:56.994
Muddy feets all over place

00:58:56.994 --> 00:58:59.874
-Only rug I see on head.

00:58:59.874 --> 00:59:00.374
-Yep.

00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:12.300
-Oh my goodness,
face is on fleek.

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:13.540
-You must be Tom Ashbrook.

00:59:16.547 --> 00:59:17.380
-You're so snatched.

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:23.370
-Are you two ship?

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:23.880
Shipping.

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.680
-OTC is what we are.

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:30.265
We're trying to get
together at this party.

00:59:30.265 --> 00:59:33.810
-Guys, what about your sleeved?

00:59:33.810 --> 00:59:35.861
-Nice try, nice try, that
was mad extra though.

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.980
-I'm not sure about the
Halloween costume I got.

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.650
I mean, it was the
last one at the store.

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:50.420
It's a walking penis.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.490
-Fix the hat.

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:52.750
Switch it around.

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:54.435
Put it around on the other side.

00:59:54.435 --> 00:59:56.910
Put it around to the other side.

00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:58.360
Yep, I like it.

00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.810
This is less
aggressive, I feel like.

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:02.990
-Does it-- oh there we go.

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.984
-You don't have to be
sexy for Halloween.

01:00:04.984 --> 01:00:06.400
-You don't have
to be sexy at all.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.600
-I'm just trying
to have a costume.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.950
It's the only costume they had.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:09.660
-Freeze.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.975
Greg, let's hear your
Oscar winning moment.

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:18.920
-There's a lot of people at
this party I want to impress.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.752
I don't have a lot of friends
and well it's a costume party,

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:23.960
and you can't go to a costume
party not in a costume.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.460
So I said, what
costumes do you got?

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.427
And he said, well it's the day
of Halloween, not much, man.

01:00:28.427 --> 01:00:30.010
He said, I got one
for you, my friend.

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:32.090
I got one.

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:35.650
It's a walking penis costume.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:36.430
I said, how much?

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:38.660
And he said, the
deposit was $350.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.560
I said, I only got
250, will it work?

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.930
He said, sure but you
don't get the balls.

01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:47.822
-Back to the scene

01:00:47.822 --> 01:00:53.200
-Son, you've always
been what we've wanted.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.840
You don't need a costume.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.170
-Proud of you just
the way you are.

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:03.010
I would ditch that dick
outfit, and I would move on

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:05.660
to something else.

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:11.570
Like being just
you, perfect you.

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.350
-No costume at all.

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:14.360
-None.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.090
-Except the one that
I wear every day.

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:19.830
You know, the way
society views me.

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:21.110
It's the costume that I wear.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:21.780
-Right, your mask.

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.200
-Right, it's the
mask that I put on.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:23.630
-How they make you.

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:25.040
-There's really no way
to remove it, right,

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.610
it's the way that I'm viewed.

01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:28.320
-Most people don't
understand it anyways.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.278
-A lot of people are
unfamiliar with semiotics.

01:01:30.278 --> 01:01:31.430
I definitely am.

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:32.450
Went to Harvard.

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.930
-And they're making assumptions
about you all the time.

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:35.160
-Right

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.030
-People make assumptions
about you all the time.

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:36.660
-Freeze.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:39.930
Kelly, let's hear your
Oscar winning moment.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:43.104
-Just want my child
to feel empowered,

01:01:43.104 --> 01:01:46.270
to be whoever they want to be.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:53.270
I want ze to grow up and
feel happy about the person

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.866
that they've become.

01:01:54.866 --> 01:02:02.390
I feel like it just takes a
little bit of courage, and just

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:05.940
the basic common sense to
be the human that you are,

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.665
and that I know you can be.

01:02:08.665 --> 01:02:10.905
-Just takes a bit of courage?

01:02:10.905 --> 01:02:11.881
-Just a little bit.

01:02:11.881 --> 01:02:12.672
-Back to the scene.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:16.980
-Now clean this
up, because mommy

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.288
doesn't like a messy floor.

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:33.419
-Sweetie, please don't go
see Fifty Shades of Nonsense.

01:02:33.419 --> 01:02:33.918
Send.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:42.880
-I just got the weirdest
text from my mom.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.630
-Dot send.

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:46.780
-Oh she means it.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.235
She put a period in there.

01:02:48.235 --> 01:02:49.700
-Whoa.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.520
-Yeah, Yeah, I know.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:56.930
-Does that say I just acted out
Fifty Shades of Grey with dad?

01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:59.000
-Yes that's exactly
what it says.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.020
-That can't be what
she meant to type.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.542
-Is that what you meant?

01:03:02.542 --> 01:03:04.020
-Space, space,
space, space, space.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.880
-She's typing.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.730
-My thoughts are very loud.

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:08.430
Send.

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:12.065
-Tell her I like
chicken pot pie.

01:03:12.065 --> 01:03:13.750
-Send.

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:15.930
-I don't know if they're
asking me to dinner,

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:17.280
or what is happening here.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.671
-Take a picture of my earlobe.

01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:20.087
It's gotten bigger
than the other.

01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:26.243
-Oh God, what is that body part?

01:03:26.243 --> 01:03:27.150
-I don't know.

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.944
I don't know.

01:03:27.944 --> 01:03:28.740
-What is that.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.710
-I don't know.

01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:33.650
-I feel like we're really
communicating, right?

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:36.360
-No, no, no, no, no,
no, you guys, it's fine.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.370
We just got dropped in
the middle of the woods.

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:41.610
Go read your books.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:44.640
I'm just going to build
this fire by myself, OK?

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.200
-Would it help you to know
that I'm reading a book

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.100
in the Little House
on the Prairie series,

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.450
and there might be some
valuable information about--

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:51.740
-That would help--

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.880
-How to live in the wilderness.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.574
-Would it help, or
just be more ironic,

01:03:54.574 --> 01:03:56.398
if I burned this copy
of Fahrenheit 451?

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:03.991
-That would be both ironic
and hopeful, Chad, yes.

01:04:03.991 --> 01:04:04.490
-Look.

01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:05.140
-What?

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.710
-We didn't all apply to West
Point together for no reason,

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:08.465
OK?

01:04:08.465 --> 01:04:13.440
-Hey, I have a safety
school of Amherst college.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.970
-Again, I just really
want to go to Emerson.

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:17.590
-West Point was our dream.

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:18.700
That's why we're here.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.302
-Sometimes dreams change.

01:04:22.302 --> 01:04:24.270
-Say it again, Chad.

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:25.728
-Sometimes dreams change.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:28.160
-One more time.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.636
-Sometimes dreams change.

01:04:33.805 --> 01:04:40.000
(SINGING) When I
look all around,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.631
I think that this
used to be my joy.

01:04:43.631 --> 01:04:44.475

His joy.

01:04:46.175 --> 01:04:52.500
-(SINGING) But now I
know with you by my side,

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.246
I don't need to
go to West Point.

01:04:56.246 --> 01:04:57.200
-(SINGING) West Point.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.190

-(SINGING) Just a little
house, and it's on a Prairie.

01:05:36.544 --> 01:05:40.037
This particular
book in the series

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:48.021
isn't helpful, because it's
mostly about my sister, Mary.

01:05:48.021 --> 01:05:50.017
Things change.

01:05:50.017 --> 01:05:51.514
-(SINGING) Things change.

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:53.011

no way out, no
car, train, or bus.

01:06:26.943 --> 01:06:29.062
Sometimes things change.

01:06:29.062 --> 01:06:29.937
-(SINGING) Sometimes.

01:06:32.931 --> 01:06:34.428

Thank you so much

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:12.352
Just going to ask you a few--
oop, sorry, that's my phone.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.100
-Verily.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:26.020
Verily she is a
saucy pomegranate.

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:30.392

01:07:30.392 --> 01:07:32.816
Well I've forgotten the

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:35.700
Play to the pit.

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:40.815
-Well poops and fun and

01:07:40.815 --> 01:07:43.110
-Well done, Miss.

01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:46.340
-Yes, word from the

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.370
Everyone on the court has died.

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:50.830
It's very tragic, very sad.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:54.570

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.840
-Geoffry, come in

Your offending a lot of people

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.480
-It's the script.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.265
It's the script.

01:08:02.265 --> 01:08:05.770
-The script says stewed prune.

01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:07.997
-Well thank you, I've
been calling for line

01:08:07.997 --> 01:08:09.190

01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:10.830
-Do you understand
the sort of people

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:12.121
that you've offended thus far?

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:12.620
-What?

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.120
Who?

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.819
Think about it.

01:08:26.819 --> 01:08:27.319
-I will.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.587
I apologize.

01:08:28.587 --> 01:08:29.170
One more time.

01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:29.630
What's the line?

01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:30.550
Hit me with the line.

01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:31.740
One more time, I've
forgotten again.

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.010
-You've got it deep down.

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:34.384
-Nope, I've already
forgotten it.

01:08:34.384 --> 01:08:35.830
-Whenceforth--

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:37.500
-Oh, you've forgotten it too.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.267
Oh yes.

01:08:38.267 --> 01:08:38.767
Yes.

01:08:38.767 --> 01:08:39.267
-No.

01:08:39.267 --> 01:08:40.439
-Yes.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:41.490
-Never.

01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:44.189
-Blood hell, it's
kumquat serve spot.

01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:45.750
Is that it?

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:46.524
-We're all trying.

01:08:46.524 --> 01:08:48.899
We're all trying to gain an
understanding of the language

01:08:48.899 --> 01:08:50.270
and how it works today.

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:51.779
I get this.

01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:55.410
But we have to be true.

01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:56.609
Now say the line.

01:08:56.609 --> 01:08:57.310
-Very well.

01:09:03.094 --> 01:09:06.138
It's not soggy plums, but
I think it's soggy plums.

01:09:06.138 --> 01:09:07.106
-It's not.

01:09:07.106 --> 01:09:08.558
It sounds like--

01:09:13.398 --> 01:09:16.687
-Seat belt. Cut it.

01:09:16.687 --> 01:09:18.090
I'm so sorry.

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:20.950
-I just want to say,
I just want to say,

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:22.438
your words are perfection.

01:09:25.306 --> 01:09:28.155
-Thank you.

01:09:28.155 --> 01:09:29.109
Take the compliment.

01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:36.530
-It just keeps going.

01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:38.148
It just keeps going.

01:09:38.148 --> 01:09:39.082
Keep going.

Yes, that's it.

01:09:41.946 --> 01:09:44.359
It's perfect thing

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.986
-Keep this going, I'm just
going to change the recording.

01:09:46.986 --> 01:09:47.780
That's my laptop.

01:09:53.567 --> 01:09:57.360
-Play to the pit.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.130
-OK.

01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:03.470
-Pumpkin spice lattes
and all good rubbish.

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:04.252
I don't know.

01:10:07.144 --> 01:10:09.790
-How are these now
for the fellow.

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:13.310
What are you this here
burnt marshmallow?

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:16.150
-Corey, take the couplet back.

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:16.900
-Oh my.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:21.090
-What must I say there sitting

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:23.840
just one extra salty hot dog.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.490
-Corey, take that couplet back.

01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:31.210
-Sure, When I said you
must have been the lob,

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:34.570
I want to skewer you,

01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:37.570
-Corey, take that couplet
back, but this time rap it.

01:10:40.276 --> 01:10:43.840
-All right, yeah, yo
I'm looking at you,

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.645
but I don't want to make you
cry, because you a nice piece

01:10:46.645 --> 01:10:49.440
of fluffy apple pie.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.210
Yeah, I'm saying it's a dream,
and you're just some piece

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:54.298
of nice vanilla ice cream.

01:10:54.298 --> 01:10:56.570
[INAUDIBLE] I'm
saying they are true,

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:59.500
And I just know that you
are different kinds of food.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.000
I'm going to tell
you, I'll tell you

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.980
this quick, pour up a nice
glass of that little liqu- or.

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.300
It gets you in a funk.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.350
-What's this I hear?

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.350
Oh is this guy a
rapper Shakespeare?

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.520
-To the pit I say, I'm
just a portly milk maid.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.830
-From whence from
the belt and I jam,

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:27.000
I'm still saying
princess of Bellingham.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.480
And I don't even say
that I'm not gentry, oh,

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.690
but I'm just helping.

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:36.610
Oh what has happened to
me, I think I'm dying.

01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:40.600
I think I might be,
drowning in the ocean.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.770
What is this [INAUDIBLE]
I feel like a basket

01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:47.155
of dried up figgy pudding.

01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:57.792
-I got, I got expelled.

01:11:57.792 --> 01:11:59.050
-You did?

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:01.964
Is it because your
label fell off?

01:12:01.964 --> 01:12:06.460
-Maybe, but they said it-- one
of the teachers told me to man

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.080
up, and I told him--

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:08.650
-What?

01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:11.210
-Yeah, so I told
him to woman up.

01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:11.870
-Yes.

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:12.370
-Yes.

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:14.216
-That is how I
raised my daughter.

01:12:14.216 --> 01:12:15.430
-Thank you.

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:16.241
-Man up?

01:12:16.241 --> 01:12:16.740
-Right.

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.660
-We push children out.

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.735
-Yeah, that's what women do.

01:12:21.735 --> 01:12:22.465
-That's power.

01:12:22.465 --> 01:12:23.415
-Thank you.

01:12:23.415 --> 01:12:24.590
-So woman up.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:25.810
-So that's what I said.

01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:27.570
I got right in his
face, and I was

01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:31.104
like, you've never pushed a
baby out of your parts, buddy.

01:12:31.104 --> 01:12:32.800
Who's tough now?

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.590
And then I started
naming the parts, which

01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:37.150
may be while I got expelled.

01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:39.330
-That was a little far,
but I'm proud of you.

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:39.830
-Thank you.

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:41.650
-Because that's really
nice, but I think

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:43.525
I need to have a meeting
with your principal.

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:44.370
-Oh.

01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:45.890
-We need to have a conversation.

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:47.810
-I know what's going to happen.

01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:48.568
He's going to cry.

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:55.174
-Thank you for joining me.

01:12:55.174 --> 01:12:55.674
-Welcome.

01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:03.120
-What is the meaning
of expelling my child?

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.990
-What is the meaning
of anything really?

01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:08.670
What does expelled mean?

01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:11.143
-She's a third grader
and she said labia.

01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:15.967
-You should be proud
that I know what that is.

01:13:15.967 --> 01:13:16.550
-That's right.

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:19.540
This is America.

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.040
-Go on.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.640
-It is the land of free speech.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.390
And my daughter had
something to say, and she--

01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:26.942
-This is a common
misinterpretation.

01:13:26.942 --> 01:13:29.150
Free speech means that you
can say whatever you want,

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:31.066
but you need to face the
repercussions of what

01:13:31.066 --> 01:13:32.120
you do inevitably say.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.013
-What?

01:13:33.013 --> 01:13:33.512
-What?

01:13:33.512 --> 01:13:35.090
That's the definition
of-- that's

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:36.440
literally what free speech is.

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.440
That's how it's defined.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.080
-Excuse me.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:38.740
-Wait.

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:42.730
-I will not stand in America
that will not let my daughter--

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:43.770
-Well than, have a seat.

01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:49.590
-Good point.

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:53.883
My point is, I raised
her to speak her mind.

01:13:53.883 --> 01:13:54.790
-Yeah.

01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:57.300
-I raised her to
be a strong lady.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.040
-Yeah.

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:01.590
-OK, and she's going
to come here tomorrow.

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:02.140
-Yeah.

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:05.240
-Because you're going to
revoke that expulsion.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.830
-I'm here right now.

01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:11.730
-And she is going to speak
her mind all day, all day.

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:14.165
Matter of fact, she should
have your job, Mr. Principal.

01:14:14.165 --> 01:14:14.665
-Yeah.

01:14:14.665 --> 01:14:16.040
-Again, she's a third grader.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.560
I don't think that
would be wise.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.130
And I respect your
fervor here, but can we

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:26.060
agree that you're mad
that I said man up,

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:30.975
which arguably is me
exercising my own free speech?

01:14:30.975 --> 01:14:32.400
-Wait a minute.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.570
-I'm just saying is all.

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:40.150
I'm just saying, it's a kid
phrase that I like to use,

01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:40.776
just saying.

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:41.628
-Hey, Rosena?

01:14:41.628 --> 01:14:42.480
-Yes.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.890
-I just wanted to say, you
said expulsion earlier.

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:47.488
Your words are perfection.

01:14:47.488 --> 01:14:50.026
-Oh my gosh, thank you, Sara.

01:14:50.026 --> 01:14:52.677
-Hey Rosena, I wanted
to call that out too,

01:14:52.677 --> 01:14:54.585
but I didn't know if
it was appropriate.

01:14:54.585 --> 01:14:55.539
-Totally appropriate.

01:14:55.539 --> 01:14:57.496
-But you're perfect.

01:14:57.496 --> 01:14:58.798
-Thank you, Corey.

01:14:58.798 --> 01:14:59.464
-You're welcome.

01:14:59.464 --> 01:14:59.964
-Hey, Kelly?

01:14:59.964 --> 01:15:00.620
-Hey, Sara.

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.270
-You know what you're
reminding me of right now?

01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.770
-What?

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:05.824
-That Kim K graduation emoji.

01:15:05.824 --> 01:15:07.698
-You know what that
makes me feel like doing?

01:15:07.698 --> 01:15:08.198
-What?

01:15:08.198 --> 01:15:11.682
-The Kim K cry emoji.

01:15:11.682 --> 01:15:14.420
-You know what that
makes me feel like doing?

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.945
That Kim K
highlighting emoji that

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:17.590
exists for some
reason, where you

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:19.970
see all of the makeup on my
face, but in different parts.

01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:22.840
-I think that's actually
a contouring emoji,

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.310
which implies that her
face is fat in some way.

01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:28.420
-I thought it was a kitty cat
emoji, and those were stripes.

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:31.620
-I think it's just another
way for people to make people

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.800
feel bad about themselves.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.970
-You know what, I think it's
just another way people change.

01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:38.470
-I'm not clear on emojis.

01:15:41.568 --> 01:15:42.440
-Hey, Sara.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:42.940
-Yeah?

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:43.606
-Say that again.

01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:44.508
-I will.

01:15:44.508 --> 01:15:45.568
People change.

01:15:45.568 --> 01:15:46.484
-Say it one more time.

01:15:46.484 --> 01:15:48.460
-One more time.

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.942
-(SINGING) People change.

01:15:49.942 --> 01:15:51.424
-(ALL SINGING) People change.

01:15:51.424 --> 01:15:52.906
-(SINGING) People change.

01:15:52.906 --> 01:15:54.882
-(ALL SINGING) People change.

01:15:54.882 --> 01:15:57.352
-(SINGING) You might think
they're going to say one thing

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:58.834
but they don't.

01:16:01.798 --> 01:16:03.280
-(SINGING) People change.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.762
-(ALL SINGING) People change.

01:16:04.762 --> 01:16:06.518
-(SINGING) People change.

01:16:06.518 --> 01:16:07.726
-(ALL SINGING) People change.

01:16:07.726 --> 01:16:13.160
-(SINGING) You want to
say one thing, but you--

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.642
-(SINGING) People change.

01:16:14.642 --> 01:16:16.618
-(RAPPING) Yeah, we've
got something to teach.

01:16:16.618 --> 01:16:19.582
Please express your
freedom to all free speech.

01:16:19.582 --> 01:16:23.120
It doesn't matter what you say
or what you will recover, just

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.352
know that there's repercussions
that you must suffer.

01:16:27.352 --> 01:16:34.762
-(SINGING) People change.

01:16:40.706 --> 01:16:43.682
-(SINGING) People change.

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:45.170
-Thank you so much.

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:48.146
We are ImprovBoston.

01:16:48.146 --> 01:16:52.270
Come see us at our home theater
in Central Square, Cambridge.

01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:54.690
We're going to kick
it back over to Robin,

01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:56.650
and enjoy the rest
of the evening.

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.110
-How scary is that?

01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:07.150
I was starting to sweat.

01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:09.730
-People do tell us that a lot,
that they sweat watching us,

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:10.900
that they're nervous for us.

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.750
That because we
don't know what we're

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:18.190
going to say, a lot of people
cringe when we first start.

01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:22.300
They're rooting for us to
succeed, which is great.

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:24.050
We do a lot of kids
classes, and the thing

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:26.180
we tell the kids when
they're getting nervous

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.720
before they come out
to do their shows

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.170
is, nerves and
excitement are actually

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:33.850
the same chemical in the body.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:37.120
So just convince yourself that
you're actually really excited,

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.060
and then let that propel
you on to the stage.

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:42.480
So we are nervous,
but mostly we're

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.040
just fooling ourselves that
it's going to be a good time.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.156
And then it is.

01:17:47.156 --> 01:17:48.530
-Well it's also
probably because,

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.904
if there's no script, who
knows what's going to come out,

01:17:50.904 --> 01:17:53.400
which means that who knows
what you're thinking.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.530
I mean it's also a
reflection, and the audience

01:17:55.530 --> 01:17:56.970
knows that there's chaos.

01:17:56.970 --> 01:17:59.460
It's entropy, right?

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.770
That's what humor does,
it allows entropy.

01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:04.080
And improv is all
about that, right,

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.070
letting the unconscious
out as well.

01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:11.020
So you sign up for
the unexpected,

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:15.590
both from the side of
the stage, but also

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.310
from the side of the audience.

01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:19.769
-I personally find that
to be a great relief.

01:18:19.769 --> 01:18:21.560
Tonight, I get to
moonlight as the pianist,

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:24.480
but my full time job is artistic
director of the theater.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:27.170
So we think a lot about this
idea of being in the moment.

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:30.410
And for me, I was trained
as a traditional actor,

01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:31.930
and having a script
is terrifying

01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:33.680
because there's a right
answer, there's a wrong answer.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.290
You either do it
right or you don't.

01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:38.079
And in improvisation,
there is no right answer.

01:18:38.079 --> 01:18:39.120
There is no wrong answer.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.661
There's only what
we create together.

01:18:40.661 --> 01:18:42.786
So that sense of, oh we're
going to go out on stage

01:18:42.786 --> 01:18:44.244
and we're going to
have a dialogue.

01:18:44.244 --> 01:18:45.130
That's simple enough.

01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:46.546
You're always
prepared to do that.

01:18:46.546 --> 01:18:49.968
-Well there's also going-- you
open up yourself for a flop.

01:18:49.968 --> 01:18:50.467
-Yeah.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.090
-Richard Pryor did
a lot of improved

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:56.920
before he became
Richard Pryor, right?

01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.990
He found his voice
by doing improv,

01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:02.974
which is a way of kind of
failing and finding the voice,

01:19:02.974 --> 01:19:03.890
and doing that, right?

01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:07.670
But it takes a lot of courage
to fail in front of everybody.

01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:09.395
-Not that you did.

01:19:09.395 --> 01:19:09.895
Ever.

01:19:09.895 --> 01:19:10.890
-Thank you, Robin.

01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:12.140
-We probably did a little bit.

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.250
-I'm sweating now.

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.890
-I do think that's important,
though, the idea of failure

01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:20.600
being something that we
actually strive toward.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.120
The idea that we're not
taking risks as comedians,

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.650
then we're not
actually doing our job.

01:19:25.650 --> 01:19:28.200
And particularly in
a setting like this,

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.960
where we know that there's
this big overarching theme,

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.292
and it's really important,
and what everyone is here

01:19:33.292 --> 01:19:35.500
to do tonight and tomorrow
is to talk about something

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:39.570
so serious, and so
important to what's

01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:41.450
happening in society right now.

01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:46.950
There's a lot of pressure
on us walking into tonight.

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:48.930
We don't want to offend anyone.

01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:50.570
What if we say the wrong words?

01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:52.490
What if we get it all wrong?

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:55.430
And the thing that we try
to keep in mind tonight

01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:58.920
is, the second we're in our
heads about getting it wrong

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.146
and saying the wrong thing, we
won't be able to say anything.

01:20:02.146 --> 01:20:03.270
-You won't be funny either.

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:06.340
-Right, so just see
what happens, and hope

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:09.540
that, if we've
offended someone, they

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.680
understand that it
was unintentional,

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.870
and come talk to us after,
and we'll apologize.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:17.410
And we'll have a
beer or something.

01:20:17.410 --> 01:20:18.390
-Or they'll punch you.

01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:20.140
-Or that, yeah, maybe.

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.610
-You seem very angry at us.

01:20:21.610 --> 01:20:25.270
Do you want to talk
about something?

01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:28.240
-I was thinking too, that we
were talking about physicality

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.290
and women, and here we had a
woman being a penis Halloween

01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:31.879
costume.

01:20:31.879 --> 01:20:32.920
Beautifully, I might say.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:33.600
-Thank you so much.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.266
-You're welcome.

01:20:34.266 --> 01:20:35.840
-It was my best work.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.530
-Your best work, right.

01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:40.410
So a lot of the things we were
talking about just, in comedy.

01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:43.670
I just want, Aparna,
do you do improv too?

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:47.190
-Yeah, when I started, I
took improv classes too,

01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:51.550
and did that alongside
stand up for a long time.

01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:52.940
-What did it do for your--

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:55.900
-I mean, for me, it
was really helpful in,

01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:01.770
like you guys were saying, just
letting go the control as much,

01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:04.300
and sort of just
exploring where things go.

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.100
That's, I think,
the beauty of improv

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:08.720
is you never know where
you're going to end up.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.370
And you sort of trust
the people around you,

01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:16.520
and yourself, to know
you'll land on your feet.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:17.200
-Or not.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.101
-Yeah.

01:21:19.101 --> 01:21:20.850
-Don't forget that
we're going to ask you,

01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:23.050
if you have questions
for anybody you up here,

01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:25.120
to be gathering
them so that we can

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.130
do that in just a few minutes.

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:31.170
So you didn't take any notes,
and you remembered more

01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:34.050
about our talk than I
remembered about our talk.

01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:37.420
-Well here's the great thing,
improvisation is a team sport.

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.700
So it wasn't on any one of
us to remember all of it.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.790
Each one of us
grabs something that

01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:45.510
resonates with them,
something that speaks to them.

01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:48.550
So if we all have a handful of
things, there's seven of us,

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:52.340
so it will feel like we
all remembered all of it.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.300
Yeah that's our secret.

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:56.680
-Another part of the improv
training is active listening.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.454
Most of us go through our
lives and have the experience

01:21:59.454 --> 01:22:01.620
of waiting to talk, which
is different than actually

01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:02.430
listening.

01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:04.580
And so you are, if
you do this year in

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.500
and year out, you're learning
to really hone in on,

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:10.610
what is the person next to
me or across from me saying?

01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:12.260
How can I listen to that idea?

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.835
How can I incorporate that idea?

01:22:13.835 --> 01:22:15.960
In improvisation, we're
also interested in the idea

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:19.570
of owning that idea, so
your idea becomes my idea.

01:22:19.570 --> 01:22:21.180
The idea of a cell
phone going off

01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.680
in the middle of moderating
is may be terrifying to you,

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.935
but to us it's gold.

01:22:24.935 --> 01:22:28.426
Oh there's a piece we can pick
up on, and then we can own it.

01:22:28.426 --> 01:22:29.926
-That's what that was.

01:22:29.926 --> 01:22:32.050
-And then all of us have
our cell phones going off.

01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:34.980
So now we have
this owned concept

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.720
that comes through
just really listening

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.180
as closely as possible.

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:43.690
-And we also have a notion
that every single word, as

01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:45.020
improvisers, is a gift.

01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:47.960
Every single word our scene
partner uses is important.

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.980
One word can change the
meaning of an entire sentence.

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.380
Improvisation is founded
on the idea of a concept

01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:54.300
called, yes and.

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:58.130
We say yes to our scene
partners idea, and we add to it.

01:22:58.130 --> 01:23:01.540
And the difference between,
yes and, and yes but is

01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:02.310
night and day.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:05.080
There's a huge distance
between yes and, and yes but.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.610
So for us, every
single word matters.

01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:10.060
Which is why, for us
to be at a conference

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.430
like this when we're talking
about the actual evolution

01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:14.680
of language in real
time, is fascinating.

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.846
Because as improvisers,
we're having

01:23:16.846 --> 01:23:18.220
to key into all
of those changes.

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:19.700
People are coming
to our theater,

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.114
and we're asking
for suggestions,

01:23:21.114 --> 01:23:23.280
and they're yelling out
words that we may have never

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.710
even heard before,
but they're words.

01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:27.570
They're real words
that people are using.

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:29.870
So it's important for us
to be actively involved

01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:32.192
in the listening and
the conversation.

01:23:32.192 --> 01:23:34.650
-With the theater, we serve
the community through laughter.

01:23:34.650 --> 01:23:37.310
That's part of our mission
statement in ImprovBoston.

01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:40.460
I can tell you, everybody that
performed for you tonight,

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:43.570
the performers, we actually
work a lot with children.

01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:48.240
Corey O'Rourke, our wonderful
rap master MC, he and I

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.180
both do a lot of the
summer comedy camps.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:52.660
And last summer, we
would break for lunch,

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.350
and have to meet and say, they
said this, this, and this.

01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:57.137
I don't know what
those things are.

01:23:57.137 --> 01:23:57.970
Did you google them.

01:23:57.970 --> 01:23:58.640
I did.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.277
They still don't
make sense to me.

01:24:00.277 --> 01:24:01.860
I feel like they're
very inappropriate

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.580
and we should be writing
letters home to parents.

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:05.496
-I'm not the only one.

01:24:05.496 --> 01:24:07.100
-It's just, it's
moving so quickly,

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.110
and keeping up with it
can be very challenging.

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:11.040
-Well that's what
you were talking.

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.630
I mean, do you feel you have
to do that as a stand up

01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:18.370
comedian, with 84, 86, probably
90,000 followers by now.

01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:20.395
Do you feel you have
to be on top of that?

01:24:20.395 --> 01:24:23.990
-Well, I think you sort
of find the middle ground

01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:26.740
of your point of view
and the world around you,

01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.540
and your space in it.

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:33.420
And I think sticking to that
is sort of like your guiding

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.950
light of where you land.

01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:39.070
Because if I only
wanted to play to teens,

01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:42.620
then yeah I probably would
be more linked in to slang.

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:46.070
But you sort of learn
from your audiences, too.

01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:48.510
You see what works and what
doesn't, and you sort of

01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:49.680
adjust accordingly.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:50.945
-Because it is a real divide.

01:24:50.945 --> 01:24:53.570
I mean, I remember when all the
texting and everything started.

01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:58.250
For the longest time I thought
LOL meant lots of love.

01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:01.220
So I'd been writing my
nieces and nephews like,

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:04.640
oh I really hope you do
well in school today LOL.

01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:16.050
I mean, I'm wondering if you
feel that divide in comedy too?

01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:18.460
Like, oh there is somebody
out there who really is not

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:20.950
getting what we're doing,
because we are in a language

01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:21.490
divide.

01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:25.570
I mean, there's a whole
language that's been created.

01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:27.790
-I mean, I think that you
have to present yourself

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:28.790
as a person.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:32.170
And I think that was funny
watching the panel before.

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:35.550
I've know Aparna for a
while, and follow her work,

01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:41.166
and that question always does
come up, are women funny?

01:25:41.166 --> 01:25:42.440
Nope, they're just people.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.810
They wear pants sometimes.

01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:46.990
Be a human first.

01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:50.660
I think, be a person, be
relatable, and find your voice,

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.787
choose what you want
your voice to be,

01:25:52.787 --> 01:25:54.370
and I think that
that's what we should

01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:55.840
be doing in life as well.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.560
I think comedians
are gifted and lucky.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.710
And I was talking with a few of
the guests prior to this event,

01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:05.980
and I said, it's not
lost on me how lucky

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:08.700
we are that we get
to use words and we

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.060
get to present our ideas.

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:11.460
And things inspire us.

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:12.720
We get to share them.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.470
And we get to also
flip them on their side

01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:16.535
and find the funny part of it.

01:26:16.535 --> 01:26:18.680
-I think the piece of
what Kelly is saying,

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:22.540
about the storytelling
component, is so important.

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:25.020
Before I got to ImprovBoston,
I was with The Second City

01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:26.640
in Chicago for about a decade.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.220
And when you get hired to The
Second City, you get a salary,

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.790
and you get a subscription
to the Chicago Tribune.

01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:35.090
And your goal is to
be as on top of all

01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:38.240
of the news and current
events as humanly possible.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.040
And the time I was there,
the newest timeline

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.540
was speeding up so quickly.

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:45.619
What Glenda was saying
about the tragedy plus time

01:26:45.619 --> 01:26:48.160
equals comedy, well time gets
shorter and shorter and shorter

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.150
every year.

01:26:49.150 --> 01:26:52.130
And what we were struggling with
at Second City, in those days,

01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:55.910
was actually finding the
humanity behind the news story.

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:57.720
You can't just
regurgitate the facts,

01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.000
because now it takes three
months to produce a Second City

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:01.860
review.

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.710
By the time that three
months has elapsed,

01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:05.897
the news cycle is old, old, old.

01:27:05.897 --> 01:27:07.480
So what you're looking
for is, what is

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.850
the humanity behind the news?

01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:11.280
How do you create
characters and relationships

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.950
that will stand the test
of at least six months,

01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:15.290
if not the test of time?

01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:18.131
And I think on some level,
even in improvisation,

01:27:18.131 --> 01:27:19.380
that's what we're looking for.

01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.254
What is the humanity?

01:27:20.254 --> 01:27:21.010
What is the story?

01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:23.440
What is the real human
interest behind this?

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.042
And when you can expose
that and explore that,

01:27:26.042 --> 01:27:27.750
the audience is going
to be on your side,

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:31.700
even if you're dealing with a
really touchy, edgy material

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.090
that maybe not everyone in
the audience is on board with.

01:27:34.090 --> 01:27:36.300
If you present
humans interacting,

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:38.160
you have this empathy
and this connection.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.870
And I think it was true for
what Aparna was doing too.

01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:43.510
She's just so relatable.

01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:46.960
She could say literally almost
anything and I'm, oh yeah.

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.890
Oh that's great.

01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:48.820
Oh good point, right?

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.880
She just draws you.

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.410
I think that's really important
as opposed to-- sorry?

01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:55.080
-People change.

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:55.900
-People change.

01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:58.484
So maybe tomorrow,
it's not the case.

01:27:58.484 --> 01:27:59.400
-It changed right now.

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:01.566
Aparna, we're going to have
to ask you to step down.

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.596
-I just think too, that when
you start thinking about words,

01:28:06.596 --> 01:28:09.410
and we were before we came
here, is everything starts to

01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:13.720
just-- if you can see the humor
in it, like I was tweeting

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:17.820
your last name, which is Carpio,
and it kept coming up carpool.

01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:18.320
-Yeah.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.130
-And so it's like, OK.

01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:19.980
-Professor Carpool.

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:20.960
-You're Glenda Carpool.

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.550
I mean, just going
with it, and going

01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:28.890
with where the words, whatever
they are, where they take you.

01:28:28.890 --> 01:28:30.120
We've got just a few minutes.

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:34.230
I know you all want to race back
and see the Republican debate.

01:28:34.230 --> 01:28:38.350
First time Trump faces
Megyn Kelly, come on.

01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:42.430
But what we'd like you to do, we
can put a microphone somewhere.

01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:43.300
-Middle aisle.

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.330
-Yes middle aisle here.

01:28:45.330 --> 01:28:47.925
The great people who are,
by the way, taping this.

01:28:47.925 --> 01:28:50.140
This entire event is going
to be able to-- yeah,

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.590
so it's going to be, all of it.

01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:53.370
Thank you so much.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:54.420
Going to be running.

01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.890
So come on on
questions for anybody.

01:28:56.890 --> 01:29:00.540
Maybe you've read Glenda's
terrific books, Laughing Fit

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:05.180
to Kill, about comedy through
an African-American prism.

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:09.720
Or if you're a Twitter
follower of Aparna,

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.810
or you want to leave.

01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:14.340
Fleeing from the microphone.

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:15.467
Oh my god, they're racing.

01:29:15.467 --> 01:29:16.300
Witness protection--

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.149
-This is that improv
fear everyone has.

01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:19.190
I didn't plan a question.

01:29:19.190 --> 01:29:20.182
I should go.

01:29:20.182 --> 01:29:21.590
They're all sneaking out.

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:22.536
Thank you.

01:29:22.536 --> 01:29:25.380
-Here comes the pity question.

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:27.300
-Thank you for saving us.

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.155
-Hi.

01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:31.990
-Hi, I'm a premed student
at MCPHS University

01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:36.797
and I just happened to see
this talk on my news feed,

01:29:36.797 --> 01:29:39.595
very relatable.

01:29:39.595 --> 01:29:43.440
So back to the serious
question of, how would you, I

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.386
guess, ask a woman to take
off the couple of layers

01:29:46.386 --> 01:29:48.530
that society kind
of places on them

01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:53.270
and show their real selves?

01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:54.010
-Good question.

01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:55.220
-That's tough.

01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.846
That a tough question.

01:29:57.846 --> 01:30:01.400
-Or like, what do you
think of Trump's hair too?

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:01.900
-Thank you.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:05.272
-I mean, I think, I'll just
say in all seriousness,

01:30:05.272 --> 01:30:06.980
I think it starts with
not imposing those

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.750
on women in the first place.

01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:12.120
So it's being more
aware as parents,

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:19.440
as educators, that our young
children don't have to grow up

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.510
with one or the other.

01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:24.899
They don't have to grow up
with things put on them.

01:30:24.899 --> 01:30:26.440
Let them be the kids
they want to be.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.240
And I'm not a hippy parent who's
like, don't give them rules.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.490
I have two kids.

01:30:30.490 --> 01:30:32.910
They have some rules.

01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:37.655
But I have tried to
let them be the people

01:30:37.655 --> 01:30:38.530
that they want to be.

01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:40.340
And I know that's
difficult once they

01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.130
leave the safety of my house.

01:30:42.130 --> 01:30:45.410
And I was the mom who walked
into preschool and said,

01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:48.080
he does not have to be what
you're telling him to be.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.480
He does not have to play sports.

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.080
He does not have to do that.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:51.990
Let him sing.

01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:53.344
That's what he wants to do.

01:30:53.344 --> 01:30:54.760
Let him be the kid
he wants to be.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:55.260
And

01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:57.110
Then doing the same
thing for my daughter,

01:30:57.110 --> 01:31:01.134
and teaching her that
she should have a voice,

01:31:01.134 --> 01:31:02.550
and she should be
a self advocate,

01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:05.100
and she should stand up
and say, I don't want that.

01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:05.850
You can't do that.

01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:06.890
Don't do that to me.

01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:08.980
And it's something that
our schools don't often

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:10.440
encourage in kids.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.140
But I argue that
is the way to raise

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:17.640
adults that are going to take
action and be great citizens.

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.410
I heard a quote once
that, in school we

01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:21.369
tell kids to sit
down and be quiet,

01:31:21.369 --> 01:31:22.910
and no one has ever
changed the world

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:24.796
by sitting down and being quiet.

01:31:24.796 --> 01:31:26.170
We need to teach
them to stand up

01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:28.400
and say what's on their minds,
and say what they believe,

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.260
which is a very long
answer to your question.

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:31.968
I don't know the answer
to your question,

01:31:31.968 --> 01:31:33.510
but that's how I would start.

01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:37.430
-I mean, it's a powerful
question that goes pretty deep,

01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:42.760
and we're grappling with it on
our own level at ImprovBoston.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.497
We have about a
year long course,

01:31:44.497 --> 01:31:45.955
if you want to
study improvisation,

01:31:45.955 --> 01:31:47.460
with a bunch of
different levels.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:50.800
And we've begun to
actually bake some of that

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.617
into the curriculum itself, so
when you walk through the door,

01:31:53.617 --> 01:31:55.450
one of the first things
you're going to hear

01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:57.650
is, you can be anyone
you want to be here.

01:31:57.650 --> 01:31:58.980
This is a safe space.

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:01.366
We're all kids on the
playground playing pretend.

01:32:01.366 --> 01:32:02.990
Ultimately, what we
did up here tonight

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:04.850
is to play make
believe for 25 minutes,

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:06.590
and get paid a little
bit for it, right?

01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:09.260
It's pretty impressive to
make a career out of that.

01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:13.400
The extension, for the many
comedians or aspiring comedians

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.540
who come through our
doors, is this idea

01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.120
that, for at least
three hours, this day,

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.150
this week, you can be absolutely
anyone you want to be,

01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:23.550
and no one in your
class is going

01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:25.150
to tell you can't be that.

01:32:25.150 --> 01:32:27.647
And on top of that, you've
got a little taste of it

01:32:27.647 --> 01:32:29.480
tonight, where we did
the switch characters,

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.896
and then Greg
jumped in and he was

01:32:30.896 --> 01:32:32.490
doing the vocal fry at the end.

01:32:32.490 --> 01:32:35.160
So we'll do a lot of
that sort of switching

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:38.690
role play in classes
to expand the horizons,

01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:41.472
not just of the ensemble,
but of individual players who

01:32:41.472 --> 01:32:43.930
can step out of their comfort
zone, and maybe try on a role

01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:46.540
that it would never
occur to them to play.

01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:49.540
The only stipulation is
that, any role you step into,

01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:51.970
you're playing with
integrity, and you're

01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:53.950
playing to the top
of your intelligence.

01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:56.700
So you're never punching
down, and you're never

01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:59.260
scoring a laugh at, isn't
funny that a woman might

01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:00.520
be playing the president?

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.900
Or isn't it funny
that a guy might be

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:04.380
playing a woman in the scene?

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:06.490
That's never where
the humor comes.

01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:08.220
Does that make sense?

01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:13.680
-Just, if I may, as a performer.

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:17.850
So I came to ImprovBoston
to do improv late in life.

01:33:17.850 --> 01:33:21.550
And prior to that, and still
now, I do stand up comedy.

01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:24.200
I think it's important to get
out there and perform and set

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:28.090
an example to people to
be exactly who you are,

01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:29.910
no apologies.

01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:30.880
This is who I am.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.150
This is the body I have.

01:33:32.150 --> 01:33:33.580
This is the person I am.

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.660
This is the voice I have.

01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.860
It's sassy.

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.030
It's Kelly.

01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:40.130
And I'm going to say
what inspires me.

01:33:40.130 --> 01:33:43.190
I'm going to talk about the
things I want to talk about.

01:33:43.190 --> 01:33:45.970
I'm going to play my belly in
front of a roomful of people,

01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:48.290
because it was appropriate
to what we were doing.

01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:51.970
And that I was inspired by
that through the conversation.

01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:55.050
Set an example to be
who you are, and it

01:33:55.050 --> 01:33:57.787
will set an example for other
people to be accepting of it.

01:33:57.787 --> 01:33:59.870
And it will inspire people
to want to do the same.

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:05.280
Thank you so much.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.410
-Trump's hair is
ridiculous, by the way.

01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:10.430
-Yeah, how is that?

01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:11.288
It's not hair.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.740
-So this isn't
actually my question,

01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:18.840
but you were talking
about going to school,

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.500
and telling them saying,
let my child be creative.

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:24.360
I just want to let you know that
there is a study that shows,

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:29.630
this is true, they can
tell with 99% accuracy

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:32.720
whom you're going to vote
for, Republican or a Democrat,

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.890
based on whether you
feel your child should

01:34:35.890 --> 01:34:38.620
be creative or obedient.

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:41.040
So when you're going
to certain states,

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.590
I would say don't
tell that story.

01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:50.680
But my question is, Aparna
I spent many years in India,

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.950
and I don't know if
you go, but I'm just

01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:56.700
wondering, when you do--
because the humor there

01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:59.910
is, in some ways similar, but
in some ways very different.

01:34:59.910 --> 01:35:02.510
I just wondered if
you ever go to India,

01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:07.370
and whether you change
the way you do humor

01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:10.400
based on that difference
in the audience?

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:13.990
-Well I actually
haven't performed there.

01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:16.480
I have family there
still, so I've

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.550
visited, but not
in that context,

01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:21.800
so unfortunately I
can't speak to that.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.190
But I know that stand
up is now a thing there,

01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:27.850
and it's sort of
burgeoning, but it's still

01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:29.730
sort of in a initial phase.

01:35:29.730 --> 01:35:33.940
So I am very curious to go
and try to do comedy there.

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:35.280
-Where is your family from?

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:35.780
-Hyderabad.

01:35:38.874 --> 01:35:40.350
Yep, you're welcome.

01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:42.800
-Hi, I'm Sarah.

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.580
I'm a local documentary
video producer.

01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:48.760
I was thinking
about what I believe

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:51.849
Robin said at the
beginning about,

01:35:51.849 --> 01:35:53.640
or actually I remember
it was that said it,

01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:57.273
but talking about I think the
transgender rights group that

01:35:57.273 --> 01:36:00.540
had asked Stephen Colbert--

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:01.670
-It was Elizabeth.

01:36:01.670 --> 01:36:03.960
-Yeah, it was
Elizabeth, wasn't it?

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:08.100
Asked Colbert and Jon Stewart
to openly work with them

01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:12.530
on influencing, because
humor has power.

01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:14.050
And I just wanted
to kind of hear

01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:21.070
your guys' thoughts about
the potential power of humor

01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:24.960
as-- somebody asked Neil
Gaiman once, I think,

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.690
what he said people always
think the opposite of funny

01:36:29.690 --> 01:36:32.710
is serious, but it's
actually not funny.

01:36:32.710 --> 01:36:36.890
And I just want to hear
your guy's thoughts about,

01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:39.300
especially in this very
politically charged time,

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:44.780
about kind of the role of humor
in challenging existing power

01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:46.790
structures, whatever
that might be.

01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:50.060
-Yeah well I think
we've seen Jon Stewart

01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:53.800
and his show has been
a huge, huge cause,

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.880
a huge sort of lightning
rod for so much change

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.150
in the last few years.

01:36:58.150 --> 01:37:00.532
And most young people
getting their news,

01:37:00.532 --> 01:37:02.240
when he was still
running The Daily Show,

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.364
from The Daily Show than
any other source, I think,

01:37:04.364 --> 01:37:06.200
is pretty powerful.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:11.460
I think satire and parody
can be hugely powerful,

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:15.930
and nothing changes society
faster than holding a mirror up

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:18.220
to it and saying, can you
see how ridiculous this is?

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:19.544
Do you see it right here?

01:37:19.544 --> 01:37:21.210
I have a friend right
now who is touring

01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:27.530
the country in a satirical
Trump Sanders debate.

01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:29.812
It's called Trump
versus Sanders.

01:37:29.812 --> 01:37:31.270
It's touring the
country right now.

01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:36.129
He's playing the
Wilbur in a few weeks.

01:37:36.129 --> 01:37:37.670
This is a guy I went
to college with.

01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:39.840
He is a staunch
Sanders supporter,

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.970
and he's playing Trump.

01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:43.550
And the reason why he's
doing it is not for laughs,

01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:44.760
although it's hilarious.

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.600
He's doing it because
he feels like there

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.610
is such a short distance
between actual Trump

01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:52.060
and something really bad
that's about to happen,

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.770
that he's taking the character
to its logical satirical

01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:55.780
conclusions.

01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:58.580
You can go online and look
at transcripts of the show,

01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:00.780
and it is so powerful.

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.730
And the audience is laughing,
and they're uncomfortable,

01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:05.650
and they're not sure
what to make of it.

01:38:05.650 --> 01:38:09.400
But they walk out either
loving the show or hating it,

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.357
but they walk out
knowing that they

01:38:12.357 --> 01:38:13.940
were delivered a
message, whether they

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.090
intended to get one or not.

01:38:15.090 --> 01:38:17.420
And I think one of the great
things about comedy is,

01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:20.110
we get away with saying a lot of
things that other people can't.

01:38:20.110 --> 01:38:22.150
So we're not standing
up and saying,

01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:24.120
come hear us preach
about politics,

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.747
or come learn this
valuable lesson.

01:38:26.747 --> 01:38:28.080
We're saying come laugh with us.

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.980
And then we're sneaking
the other stuff in.

01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:32.720
Because when you
are laughing, you're

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.740
more open to hearing a message.

01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:38.344
-Yeah, I worked on this
show called Totally Biased,

01:38:38.344 --> 01:38:39.760
that's no longer
in the air, but--

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:40.450
-Just a little show.

01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:41.310
Just a little show.

01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:43.230
-It's a little mom and pop show.

01:38:43.230 --> 01:38:48.120
No, it was on FX, but it was in
the spirit of The Daily Show.

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:51.180
Is like a late night
talk show, but addressing

01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.960
sort of the intersection of
comedy and social justice.

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:58.190
And the host was like this
liberal, San Francisco

01:38:58.190 --> 01:39:00.210
comic named W Kamau Bell.

01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:03.600
And I think it was
just really amazing

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.160
in that it brought voices to TV
that hadn't had a place there

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.660
before.

01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:12.010
And just the fact that
someone was delivering

01:39:12.010 --> 01:39:15.350
these viewpoints who
had not traditionally

01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:17.980
inhabited that space is huge.

01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:21.790
So I think it's also, it's not
just bringing social justice

01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:24.240
and comedy together, but
it's also like, who are we

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.570
giving a platform to do that?

01:39:28.570 --> 01:39:32.540
-I do think you have to take
into consideration the context

01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:35.280
of the human rights.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.370
The Jon Stewart show is gone,
and so is The Dave Chapelle

01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:42.370
Show, so there's a
kind of limited span

01:39:42.370 --> 01:39:47.880
in which comedy can be effective
before it gets commodified,

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:52.250
even before time blunts
its edges, right?

01:39:52.250 --> 01:40:00.110
So you do have to think about
the longevity of social justice

01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:01.240
and humor.

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:06.420
It can happen in a
flash before it actually

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:09.960
goes into feed the very
thing that it's critiquing.

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:14.360
So that's a complicated
thing about social justice

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.030
and comedy.

01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:16.510
-And I think it's
important, also,

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:18.980
to keep in mind that, for
everyone in this room,

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:21.320
we're talking about
comedy's power

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:26.120
to speak to social justice
or to speak truth to power,

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.420
but comedy is just a
vehicle, and that vehicle can

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:30.000
carry pretty much anything.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.200
So when you look at, what is
the mass American consumption

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.214
of comedy right now,
it's not actually

01:40:35.214 --> 01:40:37.130
The Daily Show, as much
as we'd like it to be,

01:40:37.130 --> 01:40:39.640
or Samantha Bee's incredible
new show, Full Frontal,

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.160
which if you're not
watching you need to.

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:47.720
It's Two and a Half Men, it's
Jeff Dunham, it's Blue Collar

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.460
TV, right?

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:54.920
It's comedy that doesn't seek to
inform or enlighten or elevate

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.560
the conversation,
it's comedy that

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.150
seeks to score a laugh
at whatever expense.

01:40:59.150 --> 01:41:00.900
And it sounds like I'm
talking down to it,

01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:02.274
and I don't mean
to, because that

01:41:02.274 --> 01:41:05.130
is a very large swath of the
comedy industry right now.

01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:07.640
So it has the power to
do a lot more than that.

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:11.750
It also has the power to
punch down and just derive

01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:13.755
a laugh at any means necessary.

01:41:13.755 --> 01:41:16.130
-I think we're going to take--
what do we have three more

01:41:16.130 --> 01:41:17.632
questions, I think?

01:41:17.632 --> 01:41:18.840
I'm trying to gauge the line.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.360
Yeah, so let's make
that the next three.

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.720
-Thanks, so my name is Tina, and
I'm here at Radcliffe this year

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.660
doing a fellowship,
but in my regular life

01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:30.780
I'm in profession
where I'm almost always

01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:32.610
the only woman in the room.

01:41:32.610 --> 01:41:33.690
I'm a neurosurgeon.

01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:40.960
And I'm kind of
humorless, but I think

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:42.820
that there are many
situations where

01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.820
people are
uncomfortable with you

01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:47.380
where humor really is helpful.

01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:48.850
Can people learn it?

01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:49.490
-Yes.

01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.990
-Yes.

01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:52.500
-Oh thank you for the softball.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.800
-You should take a class.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.700
-I just coached-- this is
so funny, because I just,

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:02.590
through ImprovBoston,
had a one-on-one coaching

01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:07.402
opportunity last year for
a lovely woman who had gone

01:42:07.402 --> 01:42:08.610
through our stand up program.

01:42:08.610 --> 01:42:15.750
And she needed one-on-one
coaching and, similar to you--

01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:18.320
many degrees, I'm assuming you
have, to be a neurosurgeon.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:21.940
That seems pretty big.

01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:25.000
Very intelligent, super
intelligent woman, and we

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.450
basically sat and had sessions
where I was helping her just

01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:33.100
tap-- she was hilarious.

01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:36.320
And she just didn't quite
know how to flip a switch.

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.110
That's the only
difference between someone

01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:41.035
who says that they
don't have humor

01:42:41.035 --> 01:42:43.280
and this group,
basically, is that we know

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.960
how to flip a switch, right?

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.980
We can turn it on a
little bit, and we're not

01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:49.350
afraid to fine the words.

01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:51.890
And yes, you can be
taught, is I'm telling you.

01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:52.813
Please see us after.

01:42:52.813 --> 01:42:58.956
-And I'll just say that I came
to this work through classes.

01:42:58.956 --> 01:43:02.570
I was a teacher and
wanted something

01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:05.270
that was going to be fun
for two hours a week.

01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:07.329
And I googled it and
found ImprovBoston.

01:43:07.329 --> 01:43:09.120
And thought, I'll sign
up and take a class.

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:09.750
That'll be fun.

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:10.589
I'll never perform.

01:43:10.589 --> 01:43:12.630
I'm just going to do that
and go home to my kids,

01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:14.440
and that'll be great.

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:17.890
And what I found by week
three of my first eight week

01:43:17.890 --> 01:43:23.295
class was, oh this is exactly
what I'm supposed to be doing.

01:43:23.295 --> 01:43:25.170
And this is going to
changed my life forever.

01:43:25.170 --> 01:43:27.250
And it wasn't because
they were specifically

01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:28.560
telling me to be funny.

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:31.710
It's because they were telling
me to be myself and find

01:43:31.710 --> 01:43:34.390
the truth in myself,
and then the comedy

01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:36.350
will come from there.

01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:39.490
So I cannot say enough
about improv classes.

01:43:39.490 --> 01:43:40.998
They completely changed my life.

01:43:40.998 --> 01:43:43.123
We do have the largest
comedy school in New England

01:43:43.123 --> 01:43:45.640
so please visit us online
at improvboston.com.

01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:48.910
And again we're not
teaching you to be funny.

01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:50.599
We're teaching you
to tap into what it

01:43:50.599 --> 01:43:51.890
is in you that's already funny.

01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:55.060
And I would argue, just
based on the timing

01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:58.260
of how you delivered I'm not
funny, brilliantly funny.

01:43:58.260 --> 01:43:59.882
This room laughed, right?

01:43:59.882 --> 01:44:00.840
-You know what you did.

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.072
-You got a huge
laugh from this room.

01:44:02.072 --> 01:44:03.030
-You know what you did.

01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:04.135
-You're fine.

01:44:04.135 --> 01:44:05.390
-She's walking out.

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:09.040
-Hi.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.690
-Hi, my question kind of
falls off of that question.

01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:14.147
My name's Dana, and I'm a
perennial student, a bit

01:44:14.147 --> 01:44:15.230
of an intellectual magpie.

01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:18.496
But right now I'm home
with my 13-month-old baby.

01:44:18.496 --> 01:44:19.930
-Yay, congratulations.

01:44:19.930 --> 01:44:20.530
-Thank you.

01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:22.020
We were at a mom and baby
group, because they're

01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:24.206
mom and baby groups, not
parent and baby groups.

01:44:24.206 --> 01:44:24.706
-Right.

01:44:24.706 --> 01:44:27.010
-And my baby was wearing lots
of blue, blue diaper bag,

01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:27.760
blue water bottle.

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.530
And one of the other moms with
a baby dressed in frilly pink

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:34.179
says, what your child's name?

01:44:34.179 --> 01:44:35.595
And I said, her
name's Evangeline.

01:44:35.595 --> 01:44:37.610
And she said, oh so she
has an older brother.

01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:40.480
And I said, no we just
like all the colors.

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:43.020
And then turned to the
other woman the other side

01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:45.360
and said, I thought,
because of the blue,

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.230
I thought it was a boy.

01:44:47.230 --> 01:44:49.240
And I find what you're
saying about comedy

01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:51.760
holding a mirror, I
always struggle to come up

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:53.530
with a response to that.

01:44:53.530 --> 01:44:57.140
How do you find a balance
between being comedic enough

01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.180
to hold up a mirror
and not being

01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:04.870
offensive that it causes someone
to double down and not listen?

01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:06.890
-That's a great question.

01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:10.240
I don't know that I always do
that successfully, especially

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:11.760
in moments like that.

01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:16.920
I was yelled at by a woman in
her 70s at the grocery store

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.660
once, because my child, my
baby, was wearing yellow.

01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:26.090
And the woman came up and said,
your daughter's beautiful?

01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:28.720
And I said, thank you,
this is my son Jackson,

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.570
and she yelled at me.

01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:32.150
You shouldn't put him in yellow.

01:45:36.613 --> 01:45:37.112
What?

01:45:37.112 --> 01:45:39.580
That makes no sense.

01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:44.175
And my retort to her in that
moment was not very clever.

01:45:44.175 --> 01:45:46.050
I think I said something
to the effective of,

01:45:46.050 --> 01:45:47.030
you should wear yellow.

01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:49.930
Like it wasn't funny at all.

01:45:49.930 --> 01:45:52.130
But I don't have,
in those moments,

01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:53.330
a lot of impulse control.

01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:56.060
-I've realized that I need to
have a repertoire of something

01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:58.950
I can say so I'm not
just doubling down and--

01:45:58.950 --> 01:46:07.130
-Yeah, I think they're the ones
bringing their own stuff to it.

01:46:07.130 --> 01:46:09.840
So hold up a mirror to them.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:12.910
You said her child was in like
all this ridiculous pink stuff.

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:18.090
Make fun of her
baby is my advice.

01:46:18.090 --> 01:46:18.640
I'm sorry.

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.960
I shouldn't-- I don' know.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.460
Don't make fun of her baby.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:24.400
I don't know.

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:27.160
-But that occurred
to me, but I didn't

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.165
want to make her get
even more defensive.

01:46:29.165 --> 01:46:30.290
-Well I think you're right.

01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:32.510
So your original
question, before I

01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:35.980
told you to make fun of another
infant, was how do you--

01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:36.900
-My baby's got teeth.

01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.640
What's your baby got?

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:43.040
-Yes, just turn it into a game
of who's got the better baby.

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.470
You would win, obviously.

01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:49.690
But you very seriously asked,
how do you not provoke people?

01:46:49.690 --> 01:46:52.260
How do you use humor and
then not just provoke

01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:59.460
the beast and the situation
becomes worse, right?

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:01.299
And I think all
of us, as humans,

01:47:01.299 --> 01:47:03.840
have to figure out where that
line is of where it's not worth

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.660
it.

01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:09.270
My job as an improviser and
a comedian and an entertainer

01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:11.000
is ultimately to entertain.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.360
My job as a person is to be true
to myself and have integrity.

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:18.050
And those two have to align.

01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:20.630
As an improviser, I'm not going
to purposely get up on stage

01:47:20.630 --> 01:47:23.570
and offend anyone.

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:25.070
But if you're making
fun of my baby,

01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:26.570
I'm probably going
to say something.

01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:28.770
-But I wonder if you didn't
handle that beautifully.

01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:29.311
-Yeah.

01:47:29.311 --> 01:47:29.810
-Yeah

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:32.260
-Yeah, because I feel
like you did, right?

01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:32.850
-Thank you.

01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:34.270
-We really like blue.

01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:36.750
We like all the colors.

01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:39.930
I guarantee you she was standing
at Starbucks later being like,

01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:42.950
my baby can wear all the colors.

01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:43.676
-Yeah.

01:47:43.676 --> 01:47:44.668
-I hope so.

01:47:44.668 --> 01:47:45.660
I hope so.

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.320
-Like, I think you did exactly
what you were supposed to do.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:56.280
You were lovely and pleasant,
and you didn't have to like,

01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.090
well my baby wears blue,
and your baby's wrong.

01:48:00.090 --> 01:48:02.490
I think you just
gave the answer.

01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:03.320
It was the honest--

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.920
-That was my best answer yet.

01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:06.420
-Yeah.

01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:08.970
I mean I have a stepson.

01:48:08.970 --> 01:48:11.800
And as soon as people find out
that I'm a step-mom they go,

01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:14.632
oh.

01:48:14.632 --> 01:48:15.554
-What is that?

01:48:15.554 --> 01:48:16.470
-You know what I mean?

01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:18.756
But it's the same
type of thing where

01:48:18.756 --> 01:48:20.470
they've got these
buckets that they think

01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:22.320
everybody belongs in, right?

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.100
Like oh you're just
his stepmother.

01:48:27.656 --> 01:48:30.210
You know what I mean?

01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:31.500
So I always correct them.

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:34.250
And I've actually, I fell
like I'm getting off topic,

01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:36.199
but I want to give
you the example.

01:48:36.199 --> 01:48:38.490
He's 10 and a half, and I've
been with him a long time.

01:48:38.490 --> 01:48:42.280
And he even knows now what to
say, because I say at home,

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.150
and we believe it
and mean it, right?

01:48:44.150 --> 01:48:45.860
Whether he was my
stepson or adopted

01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:48.735
or whatever the situation
is, my birth child

01:48:48.735 --> 01:48:52.660
or whatever, he will
now say to people,

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:55.360
she's my mom by
love, not by blood.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.628
So, I know right?

01:48:59.430 --> 01:49:03.190
Literally, I think
you're handling--

01:49:03.190 --> 01:49:07.345
why can't we say in a nice
way, exactly what we think?

01:49:07.345 --> 01:49:09.470
-That is better advice than
making fun of her baby.

01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:11.980
-Although I would
love-- you seem so nice,

01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:14.890
I would love to see her
throw down about babies.

01:49:14.890 --> 01:49:16.620
Your baby so bald.

01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:18.830
I would love to see it.

01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:19.845
-Maybe one day.

01:49:19.845 --> 01:49:21.470
-Come take a class,
and we'll teach you

01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:24.310
how to make fun of
other people's babies.

01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:25.130
-Thank you.

01:49:25.130 --> 01:49:25.630
Thank you.

01:49:25.630 --> 01:49:27.421
I think we have time
for one last question.

01:49:27.421 --> 01:49:29.010
Thank you.

01:49:29.010 --> 01:49:30.650
-All right, I've
been standing up here

01:49:30.650 --> 01:49:32.940
trying to think about
how to make this concise.

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:33.460
-OK.

01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:36.760
-My name is Amelia, and I work
for The Theater Offensive,

01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:39.880
and a lot of what you
all have been talking

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:43.820
has been stirring and firing
connections in my brain,

01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:48.120
and one thing I was thinking
about is this idea of people

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:51.170
change, language
change, stuff changes.

01:49:51.170 --> 01:49:55.990
And then we sort of talked about
people creating that change.

01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:59.780
And one play that--
I'm a theater artist,

01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:02.500
and one play that came
into my mind around this

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:05.640
is Brahman/i by
Aditi Kapil, where

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.740
Brahman, who is a trans,
intersex young person

01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:13.370
plays with, messes
up, throws in our face

01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:17.400
our ideas of binary
gender, and does it sort

01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:20.050
of through the stand up lens.

01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:23.770
So the whole show
is in stand up.

01:50:23.770 --> 01:50:26.000
I watched that show
about a year ago,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.710
and it's against the backdrop
of so many trans women of color

01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:35.920
being murdered, and the real
deep danger and risk in truly

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:38.970
being yourself, in
showing your true colors,

01:50:38.970 --> 01:50:42.850
and in participating in
that radical self creation.

01:50:42.850 --> 01:50:47.780
So I'm curious how, either
as scholars, solo artists,

01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:50.930
or as a group, you
can kind of balance

01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:55.110
risk and locate yourself
in the skin you're in,

01:50:55.110 --> 01:50:57.220
in the body you're
in, in the space

01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:00.330
you're in, to be
that agent, making

01:51:00.330 --> 01:51:02.340
that change through language?

01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:07.611
Kind of a complex question,
but anyone go for it.

01:51:07.611 --> 01:51:09.610
-I will put in a plug for
The Theater Offensive.

01:51:09.610 --> 01:51:11.110
If you're not familiar
with their work,

01:51:11.110 --> 01:51:12.240
go online and look them up.

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.550
They do amazing, amazing work.

01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:17.190
I can't thank you enough
for the work you guys do.

01:51:17.190 --> 01:51:21.290
It's fantastic stuff.

01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.790
Yeah.

01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:23.248
-All right, I'll
take a stab at it.

01:51:23.248 --> 01:51:26.250
I think improvisers have it
easier than in some other art

01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:29.170
forms, because all you
have to do is show up

01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:32.400
and be brave enough to
trust your own voice

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:35.290
in an ensemble of other voices
with people also trusting

01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:35.790
their voice.

01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:39.020
And then whatever
weird casserole

01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:43.480
we make on stage together is
what it is in that moment.

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:44.970
It's certainly,
I think, trickier

01:51:44.970 --> 01:51:49.330
for playwrights or
performance artists who

01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:50.930
have to get every word right.

01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:51.690
-Or professors.

01:51:51.690 --> 01:51:55.520
-Or professors, who have
to deliver a lecture that

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:56.410
has to be spot on.

01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:58.035
You know you're going
to get challenged

01:51:58.035 --> 01:52:00.480
by every student in your class.

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:04.200
With improvisers, once you learn
to trust yourself, and trust

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.030
the ensemble, you know
that whatever experiences

01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:10.590
you have that lead
you in your life

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:13.520
up to this point are going to
be respected and celebrated

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:14.370
on stage.

01:52:14.370 --> 01:52:17.772
And ideally, with the kinds of
crowds we get in improvisation,

01:52:17.772 --> 01:52:19.480
the audience is going
to connect with you

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:20.970
and celebrate right
along with you.

01:52:20.970 --> 01:52:24.670
We don't get a lot of laughs
with derogatory or scapegoating

01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:26.760
or punching down sorts of humor.

01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:34.160
The art form in that sense makes
it a little bit more supportive

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:35.050
for us.

01:52:35.050 --> 01:52:37.880
What's most interesting
is, when we step outside

01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:42.280
of our improv bubble, we do a
lot of anti-bullying workshops

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.039
in schools across New England,
social inclusion workshops,

01:52:46.039 --> 01:52:47.580
and that's where
we're trying to take

01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:50.390
the principles of
improvisation, support, trust,

01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:52.960
saying yes to yourself,
saying yes to everyone else,

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:56.430
and then seeing that play out
in a real world seventh grade,

01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:59.580
eighth grade, 11th grade,
12th grade scenario where

01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:01.260
those principals
are not necessarily

01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.110
agreed on, not just
by the students,

01:53:03.110 --> 01:53:06.860
but dare I say the teachers
and some of the higher level

01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:07.990
management as well.

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:10.370
That's where the
rubber meets the road.

01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:14.190
And it is not easy, but we
keep fighting the good fight

01:53:14.190 --> 01:53:17.460
in trying to change
minds one at a time.

01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:19.620
-I think one thing
that I've found

01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:23.370
tricky as a stand up and an
improviser, and just a comedian

01:53:23.370 --> 01:53:26.830
in general, I mean
if you're a stand up,

01:53:26.830 --> 01:53:28.940
you're just bringing
yourself to stage,

01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:31.900
and really just you being
authentic to whatever

01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:35.480
you believe and who
you identify as is

01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.050
being honest as a performer.

01:53:37.050 --> 01:53:40.220
But I think, sometimes, in
both stand up and improv,

01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:45.527
and comedy in general, people--
sometimes in improv, it

01:53:45.527 --> 01:53:48.670
would come up where it was
like some person playing

01:53:48.670 --> 01:53:51.380
a character of a different
race, or a different sexuality,

01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:55.440
and it's like, where is the line
of appropriateness between them

01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.670
playing it authentically
and them sort

01:53:57.670 --> 01:54:01.350
of doing a caricature just based
on their frame of reference,

01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:03.490
and not intended to be harmful?

01:54:03.490 --> 01:54:06.160
But I think sometimes the
audience will tell you

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:07.250
where that line is.

01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:11.610
But there's definitely--
I've seen failure of like,

01:54:11.610 --> 01:54:18.180
don't do that accent
of don't walk like.

01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:20.500
Comedy involves a lot of
failure, unfortunately,

01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:23.660
and making people uncomfortable,
and finding those lines,

01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:26.056
societally, where we're at.

01:54:26.056 --> 01:54:28.070
-Well, at the highest
level, it really

01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:32.410
involved literally being
willing to get burned,

01:54:32.410 --> 01:54:35.080
as you probably know if you know
the work of Richard Pryor, who

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.780
I've been invoking throughout.

01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:38.394
He literally set
himself on fire.

01:54:38.394 --> 01:54:40.310
But one of the ways in
which you can read that

01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:44.140
is that he talked so
much about the toxic mix

01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:48.210
of American racism that he
bitterly burned up through it.

01:54:48.210 --> 01:54:53.030
I mean the comedian is
someone-- comedy is a ritual.

01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:59.480
People gather to ritualize all
kinds of aggressiveness, right?

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:02.060
And laughter is
the cathartic means

01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:05.930
by which we get rid of some
of that aggression, right?

01:55:05.930 --> 01:55:12.820
And I think that, in his case
is a really intense example that

01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:14.310
speaks to your
question, what does

01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:19.870
it take to be able to speak
to your truest self, right?

01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:21.570
In his case, it was
really a willingness

01:55:21.570 --> 01:55:26.360
to walk this fire line, right?

01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:28.630
And he fell, right?

01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:34.460
And I mean, in terms of
who we are as performers

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:38.610
of every different kind, you
know Robin is a performer,

01:55:38.610 --> 01:55:42.300
improvised, as comedians, as
just the everyday performance

01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:46.690
of the self, right, it requires
that you know how far you

01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:50.840
can go, want to go, right?

01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.102
One of the things
that I find most,

01:55:54.102 --> 01:55:56.310
it's going to sound like a
really weird non-sequitur,

01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:58.020
but one of the
things that I found

01:55:58.020 --> 01:55:59.960
most interesting about
teaching at Harvard

01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:05.490
when I first got here is that,
with principal fear in students

01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:09.190
is their fear to fail, right?

01:56:09.190 --> 01:56:11.212
But you're never
going to learn if you

01:56:11.212 --> 01:56:12.670
don't know how to
get off the horse

01:56:12.670 --> 01:56:14.010
and get back on it, right?

01:56:14.010 --> 01:56:17.090
So I think in every
kind of performance

01:56:17.090 --> 01:56:20.490
is that playing with
a fire of failure.

01:56:20.490 --> 01:56:24.120
Will it get you to learn
and go to a higher place,

01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:28.660
or mean that you're just
burned, and you're done, right?

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:34.620
And that playing with that
line is where a lot of humor

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:37.680
comes from, I think.

01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.650
-Thank you.

01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:41.280
What a great evening
with great questions.

01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.602
Thank you so much.

01:56:43.602 --> 01:56:45.060
I'm just going to
thank you, again.

01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:48.230
I think that Dean Cohen
has some thanks as well,

01:56:48.230 --> 01:56:50.300
and here she comes.

01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:53.430
-Well I just want to
ask you all to join me

01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:56.630
in thanking everybody
who participated tonight

01:56:56.630 --> 01:57:03.210
in giving us a wonderful,
wonderful evening,

01:57:03.210 --> 01:57:05.710
and showing us, I
think, that they have

01:57:05.710 --> 01:57:08.450
an incredible way with words.

01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:10.870
I hope you will join
us tomorrow, when

01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:13.190
we go deeper into these topics.

01:57:13.190 --> 01:57:17.010
But once again, let's give
them a great round of applause.
