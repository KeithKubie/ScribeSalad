00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Modeling the effect of wind seems to be pretty straightforward.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It looks as though we simply have to push the fire through the forest with a certain velocity.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If the left curve is the temperature distribution at times 0 after 1 time step, h will be shifted

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to the right curve, and the amount of shift amounts to the time step times the velocity.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
As we are storing these values in an array, the wind will simply shift their position in the array.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The tricky thing, however, is that the time step times the velocity is really small.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We would have to shift these entries by a fraction of a step. How would you do that.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Here comes a different approach.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I want to get the new value, the value on the right curve at the position X₀.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I get that new value by looking it up on the original curve step size times velocity to the left from here,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and now the trick is to use the derivative of this function.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Let's write down what this new value is.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The new value after 1 step time equals the time step h.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
At this position, x₀ is approximately the old value T(0, x₀) and now we have to take care

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
of the difference between these two, and if we estimate it using the derivative,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
so all our correction the length of that green line will be step size times velocity this length

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
times the derivative--this slope of our tangent.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The derivative is the partial derivative of temperature with respect to x

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
at times 0 and position x₀, and we have to be a bit careful about the sine.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
If the derivative is negative such as in this case, we have to go up,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
which means we need a minus sign in front.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So that's the trick, we use the spatial derivative to accomplish this shift.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
As usual, however, as with all these methods, we have to be careful about not taking too large steps.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This value with step size in time times the velocity has to be reasonably small.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
In particular, it should be pretty much smaller than our grit size Δx.

00:02:09.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The way to compute this derivative is, of course, to use a central-difference formula.
