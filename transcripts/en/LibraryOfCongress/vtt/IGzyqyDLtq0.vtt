00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.530
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

in reading promotion.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.150
I'm Kathryn Mendenhall, Director
of National Programs here

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.120
at the Library of Congress,
which is in the National

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.200

organizational in this service unit.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.640
You are all here to demonstrate
how your impassioned work can be

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.840
replicated and shared with others

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.570
to achieve the extraordinary
success we're celebrating today.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.090
Our hope is that new
partnerships will be formed,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.560
new dialogue will be held, not
just with the Library of Congress,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.910
but among yourselves
and with each other

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.340
so that you can see what others
are doing and use their ideas

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.510
to make your programs even better.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.650
It's really a unique
opportunity to have all

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.690 position:56%
of you here today from near and far.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.620
Since its founding in 1800,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.360
the Library of Congress's
mission has been one

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.670
of disseminating knowledge.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.370
Thirty years ago, in transmitting
a report to Congress in response

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.040
to a congressional
resolution authorizing a study

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.700
of the changing role of the book
in the future, what the Librarian

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.380
of Congress at the time,
who was Daniel Boorstin,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.990
stated in his transmittal
letter is applicable today.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.810
He said, "What we do
about books and reading

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.020
in the next decades will crucially
affect our citizen's opportunities

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.550
for enlightenment and
self-improvement,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.060
their ability to share in the
wisdom and delights of civilization

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.270
and their capacity for
intelligent self-government.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.730
There could be no more appropriate
effort to fulfill the hopes

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.570
of our nation's founders nor
any more appropriate celebration

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.630
of the Bicentennial
of our constitution

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.270
than to aim to abolish illiteracy."

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.800
The Literacy Awards
benefactor, David M. Rubenstein,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.150
established these awards
with the idea the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.430
by recognizing outstanding literacy
efforts both in the United States

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.700
and abroad, public
attention will be drawn

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.820
to the continuing need
for literacy services.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.230
Mr. Rubenstein was unable
to be here with us today,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.220
but he sends his hardy
congratulations

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.400
and gratitude to you.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.280
As you all know, it is difficult
to learn if one cannot read.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.450
So, I too applaud you
and congratulate you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.400
for making it possible for people
to reach their full potential

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.030
by learning through reading.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.330
Thank you.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.650

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:29.610 position:56%
so I've asked her to say a few words
before we start the presentations

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.910
and the program.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.210
Leanne, I can't see you.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.510
Where are you?

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.810
There you are.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.110
Thank you.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.410
Let's give her a hand.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.710
[ Applause ]

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.310
Good afternoon.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.610
Thanks so much.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.910
I explained to John that
there were a couple of things

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.700
on my agenda this afternoon that
made me have to shorten my time.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.550
One is we are hosting the
very first online conference

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.950
for teachers tonight
and tomorrow night.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.180
And we've got programs
running from 4 O'clock

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.900
until 8 O'clock tonight
as well as tomorrow.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.360
And my son broke his collar
bone on Saturday night.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.360
So, my schedule at home
has shifted a little.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.520
And the beauty of the online
conference is I can be involved

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.820
at home.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.140
So, later I'm going to go
home, get my son, get him home,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.370
get him comfortable, and then
I'm going to get to work.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.710
We have a session tomorrow
night at 6 O'clock

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.930
on Literacy in Primary Sources.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.240
So, if any of you are available
and want to participate

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.580
in an online conference, feel free
to join us tomorrow night at six.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.380
If you go to the Library's website,

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.270
do a search on online
conference, you'll get the link.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.860
It will also be recorded and I'll
be sure to share the link with John

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.760
so he can share that
with you as well.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.210 position:56%
Wanted to say a couple of other
things beyond the online conference.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.010
As John said, my team
and I work very closely

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.310
with classroom teachers.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.670
And our job is to alert them to the
online resources in the collections

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:48.970
of the Library of Congress.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.530
We're all about teaching
with primary sources.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.860 position:56%
And more and more we're finding that
the teachers that we work with are

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:00.500 position:56%
so committed to literacy efforts and
are finding some very clever ways

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.560
of integrating primary sources
and their literacy outreach,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.740
whether it's identifying
primary sources that help

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.630
to illustrate novels that their
teachers are working with,

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:16.390
whether it's identifying
writing strategies that can come

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.140
from working with primary sources.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.130
Some really creative things
are going on and we are trying

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.770
to reflect more and more of those
best practices within our blog.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.280
I've got some bookmarks for you.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.660
If you go on the Library's
website and you just go

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.650
to the loc.gov/teachers section,
that's where you can sign

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.070
up for the RSS feed of our blog.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.770
Really encourage you to do that.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.870
We love finding out what
you're doing and I have

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.120
to say I love this event and
I so regret not being able

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.420
to hang out this afternoon.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.020 position:56%
And I need to tell you that my folks
are coming to visit for Thanksgiving

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.360
and we're going to build
ourselves a little library.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.650
So, the fact that the Little
Library folks are here,

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.310
my dad's actually pretty tickled.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.340
He's one of those -- you know, he's
one of those retirees who got rid

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.760
of all of his tools
and saws and things.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.520
And then he comes to my house
and wants to do projects.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.200
This is the perfect Thanksgiving
project so thank you for that.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.890
Congratulations to all of you.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.640
If you ever have an interest
in working with educators

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.080
and more closely with the primary
source materials on the Library,

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.560
please reach out to me and my team.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.300
We are really excited about
what you're doing and know

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.640
that there's some terrific
opportunities for great synergy.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.940
Congratulations again.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.740
Thanks for your time.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:34.500
[ Applause ]

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Leanne.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.100
You can see that Leanne is --

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.020
her energy carries over to all of
our programs and we're very pleased

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.830
that she's working closely with
us, with the Center for the Book,

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.370
and with the Literacy programs.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:08.480
Let me say a couple words about
what we're going to do next.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.620
We thank you all for working
hard to develop on quick notice,

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.040
short presentations about
your best practices.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.680
I know that some of you have
Power Points, some of you do not.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.340
But what we are going to do
is to invite you to the podium

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.950
and John Regan [assumed spelling]

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.730
who is our audiovisual
specialist has your PowerPoint

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.810
if it has been given to him.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:45.530
If not, we will proceed with
your particular best practice.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.140
The note -- the idea was
that you would present

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:53.510
for at least five minutes about the
idea of yours and you would have

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.560
at least five minutes
to take questions

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.800
and answers from the audience.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.780
If not, I may have a question.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:06.180 position:56%
And this will be a warmup for the --
the idea is that we will do as many

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.550
of these brief presentations
as we can.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.190
We hope to do them all eventually.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:17.120
We will take a break part way
through and then we'll come back

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.540
to our discussion tables where
we will have either members

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.900
of our board at those tables.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.780
And I'll remind you
of the specialties

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.620
that some of our board members.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.220
Karen will be at one of the tables.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.180
Karen will be at the table actually

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.160
where we know we have
some best practices people

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.040
who would like to meet her.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.990
A word about best practices
if I may before we start.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:48.550
The literacy program from the
beginning knew that we needed

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.520
to honor more than just the
three winners because the purpose

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.400
of this literacy awards program
is to raise awareness in society

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.540
in general, nationally
and internationally,

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:06.060
about the importance of
literacy, promoting it,

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.110
and also finding new
organizations to be involved in it.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.260
And Mr. Rubenstein's
idea was two-fold.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.430
One was we do honor
those organizations

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:21.490
that are already involved in
the battle against illiteracy.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:26.370
We do hope that it draws
new attention to literacy

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.300
and brings new groups in.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.770
His feeling was that
literacy, while --

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.960
when Kathryn earlier read from
Dr. Borstein's statement --

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.670
that was the man who created
the Center for the Book,

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.970
the Librarian of Congress.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:45.290
And that was back in -- it
would have been the early '80s

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.270
from the report on the future
of the book, we were worried

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.930
about the future of
books and reading then.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.950
Then the technology that
Dr. Borstein addressed

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.570
and we were starting
to worry about --

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.980
this was before the
internet -- was television.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.130
And when television came a
lot of people thought, "Uh-oh,

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.570
this is going to be
the end of the book."

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:12.750
And one of Dr. Borstein's
charges when we did the Book

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.800
in the Future was to will
at the problem and to look

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.840
at the current technologies
and to propose some solutions.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.970
And his solution, which ran
through a little bit of the quote

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:28.320
that Kathryn read, was that
the problem isn't technology.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.440
The problem that actually
technology can be combined and used

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.870
to promote books and reading.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.230
And that's what is really
the symbol of the Center

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.790
for the Book's interest in part.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:46.100
But that the real problem was
illiteracy and what our country did

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:51.200
about illiteracy in the long run
was what was really important.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.930
And that is reflected actually
by Mr. Rubenstein two --

00:21:54.930 --> 00:22:00.600 position:56%
almost a decade and a half later who
felt that literacy was falling off

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.090 position:56%
of the national agenda as a problem.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:07.930
And that it didn't get as much
attention as it had in the past.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:12.210
And that another reason
for our program in addition

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:17.850
to raising the awareness and
congratulating the winners is

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:24.150
to involve more groups, expand the
definition of literacy into society

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:28.170
so society realizes how
important literacy is.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.920
And just a final example from
our literacy awards program,

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.350
we are reaching out and doing
symposia and how I've met a few

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.840
of you was -- one was through
the symposium we did on literacy

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.270
and poetry which brought
in poet groups interested

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.260
in promoting poetry and literacy.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.500
We're doing one in the spring
on health and literacy.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.580
Again, trying to expand
the definition

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.170
of literacy the point
out, in this case,

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:03.480
how health in many ways
is a literacy problem

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.960
and that world should be
involved in literacy as we are --

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.040
as either educators or librarians
or people who've had a record

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.180
of being involved in the field.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.650
So, it's with that in mind that
I not only congratulate you,

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:26.390
but am eager to pick up
ideas that are in this book.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:29.140
So, a further reference
will always be --

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.010
for your organization,
your page in this book.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.930
But also this will
be the basis, I hope,

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.570
for some of the discussions this
afternoon where when you sit next

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:44.680
to somebody who is from another
organization, that you will be able

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.580
to see what they do and that by
the time the day is finished,

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.450
we'll know more about
each other's programs

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.490
and perhaps some new partnerships.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:59.170
The program will end -- this
discussion will end at 4:30 when,

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:05.040
in fact, for our guests
we are providing tours

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.780
of this beautiful Jefferson
Building, which you're part of.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.500
Which opened in 1897
when the Library

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.700
of Congress really
assumed its national role.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.640
And the day doesn't
conclude with that.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.900
We will have a reception
over in our other --

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.760
another building across the
street, the Madison Building.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.710 position:56%
You will be led there by your guide.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:34.600
And another -- after the reception,
which is between 5:30 and 6:30,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.970
Lisa Scol -- help me, somebody.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.270
Scottoline.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.150
Sorry. I was thinking of the food.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:48.450
Lisa Scottoline who is a famous
mystery writer and a friend

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.200
of the Library of Congress,
a frequent visitor

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.330
to our National Book
Festival has a new book,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.090
but she's also a literacy
advocate and she is going to talk

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.690
to us a little bit about literacy.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:05.690
But a lot of her fans will be there
because this is publication day

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.300
for a new Lisa Scottoline mystery.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.560
And there will be a
book signing following.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.180
And so I hope you can
stay for that as well.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.100
And we will be done at 7:30.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.970
All of that said, I now want
to begin the presentations.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.370
And we're going to follow the list

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:27.350
that Guy developed
which is alphabetical.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.960
And the first person
I'm going to call

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.910
on is Basarat Kazim, Kazim perhaps.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:38.790
Sorry about the pronunciation
ahead of time.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.090
All right.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.110
And it's at the Laila
Book Bus Society.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.480
All right.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.780
Thank you.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.080
But you are from Pakistan.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.380
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.680
&gt;&gt; I have that part right.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.980
So, please come on up.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.000
And we'd like to learn
about your best practice.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.840
Let's give her a little
encouragement.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.500
[ Applause ]

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.410
&gt;&gt; Yes. Literacy and why literacy?

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:19.840
In a country like Pakistan where
the literacy rate is really low,

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.500 position:56%
we felt very strongly that -- sorry.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.220
I turned it off?

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.680
Yeah [laughing].

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.260
So, will you just run
the next slide then?

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.360 position:56%
We did feel very strongly that books
and children need to come together.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:43.740
And since 1978, that's what the
Alif Laila Book Bus has been doing.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.580
Next please?

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.700 position:56%
Before this, there were no libraries
-- children's libraries in Pakistan.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.320
And this library that started off
in a double decker bus with books

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.100
as passengers was stationary.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:06.500
And it drew children to it
like it was a magnet really.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:12.210
Also, friends of children,
adults who had retained the child

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.050
within ran to this place.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.920
And I think they gave it
their stamp of approval.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.490
And that is how a very
poor project --

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.760
because it was I think even
poorer than a church mouse.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.800
We had no money at all.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.670
And it continued to run.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:37.730
And I suppose that you know
when something is 37 years old,

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.890
there's stories and stories and
stories -- next slide please?

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:50.560
So, the library took on a life of
its own and it continued to grow.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:56.880
Whereas because once people
were tickled by it and they felt

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.060
that you know, "What was this
old double decker bus all about?

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.880
Why was it drawing children?"

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.930
And at that time even the governor

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:09.900
of the Punjab sent some
[inaudible] there and said,

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.700
"You know we have really
big libraries.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.980
There's a Punjab public library
and that's always sad and gloomy.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.410
And I believe this children's
library attracts a lot of children.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:21.710
So, what's happening there?"

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.660
And they found out
that it was just trust.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.810
It was a belief in the children.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.480
It was a belief in books.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.420
It was a belief that a
connection between a child

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.870
and a book was a very vital thing.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:42.900
And so the governor then gifted
to the society a building

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.380
which become the reference
library and that happened in '84.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.570
Next please?

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.640
After that, we also felt

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.320
that because libraries were
committee centers essentially

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.640
and there were lots of activities
that could happen in libraries,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:08.840
we started the hobby clubs project
which was actually skill based.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.410
And the wonderful thing was
that we were drawing children

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:19.650
from the public sector where I'm
very sorry to say that teaching is

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.910
by rote and children
were having to memorize.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.770
Sadly, they still do.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:35.010
So, to our minds at Alif Laila,
this was not really learning.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:40.370
This was being forced to
maybe pass exams perhaps.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.680
And sometimes, I mean,
it's really so ridiculous

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.760
that children even need to memorize
the commas and the full stops

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.030
in the sentences, in the textbooks.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:56.400
So, the hobby clubs were actually
project based learning centers

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.700
where the children could invent,

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:04.750
innovate through low cost
materials, build things.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:09.990
And we were pretty
ambitious because in the '80s,

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.290
Alif Laila was the first
project to have computers

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.190
for children in Pakistan.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:18.550
And then we did electronics
and we did mechanics

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.270
and we did craft and art.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:26.440
So, through all these
projects they also learned

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.950
that book knowledge could actually
be translated into practice.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:34.070
And if certain models or
things were going wrong,

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.380
they knew how to correct them.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.150
So, they were thinking and
that's what we wanted them to do.

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.040
Next please?

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.200
Yes. And then the mobile
library came

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.010
in which was called
the Story Teller.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.310
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.480
-- In Urdu, which means,
again, the story teller.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.810
This goes around to school.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.180
Because they don't have libraries.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.740
And this is a mobile program
which become very very successful.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.940
And I'm really really
happy to tell you

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.760
that the government is
hoping to replicate it.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.450
So, it's out in the newspapers.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.120
It's on our Facebook page
as well that the government

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:16.280
of Punjab has said that they will
start a mobile library program.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.730
They don't want to acknowledge us.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.430
We don't mind as long
as they do that

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.320
and they let the libraries
run all over.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.620
Next.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.430
Next slide, please?

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:37.300 position:56%
Yes. We had a rather bad
earthquake two days back I Pakistan.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:42.120
But fortunately the epicenter
was not heavily populated

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.010
so there was not a lot of loss.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.960
But in 2005, in [foreign
language spoken].

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:54.120
Sorry. The earthquake was terrible.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.110
And at that point in time Alif
Laila's also the Pakistan chapter

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:05.940 position:56%
for IBBY, which is the International
Board on Books for Young People.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.170
And IBBY gave us the
funds to set up a library

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.130
for these children in Bagh.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.020 position:56%
And that's the library you see here.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.440
It was called [foreign
language speak], rainbow.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.480
And, again, I mean there's
just so many beautiful stories

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.070
because so many children who
were completely traumatized

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.270
because the earthquake happened
when they were in school.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.100
And I remember myself
going and working with them

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.760
through puppets and play.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:38.220 position:56%
And one child was very scared to
come anywhere near a crowd kept sort

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:43.900
of standing outside and then all of
a sudden, when she saw the puppets,

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.410
she ran in and she stayed.

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:47.720
And then when she ran out

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.700
and she told her mother,
"I passed the exam."

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:55.450
So, that was her exam of being
able to overcome her fear.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:56.750
Next please?

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:06.590 position:56%
Yes. These are, again, the different
libraries, the different looks.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:10.370
Because we do set up libraries
all over Pakistan now.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.670
Next please?

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:23.080 position:56%
This was a project that we did which
was called Scheherazade Ka Khazana.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:28.000
The Alif Laila gets its name
from the Thousand and One Nights.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.640
And, of course, Scheherazade
told those thousand

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.260
and one stories to
keep herself alive.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:40.700
And actually, you know, changed
the way that the king thought

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:45.070
because he was not a good king
at all before he got involved

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.200 position:56%
in her stories and then married her.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.620
So, Alif Laila, the project
itself has been struggling

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:58.560 position:56%
like Scheherazade and keeping itself
through telling of different tales.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:04.590
And so we named one project
Scheherazade Ka Khazana,

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.920
which means Scheherazade's
treasure trove.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.080
And actually did a thousand
and one books and sent them,

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.920
again, all over Pakistan.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.100
This we did with Save the Children.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.440
And they were the funding
organization.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.590
Yes, next please.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:25.010
So, the -- this is a library that
we did in Sheikhupura which is

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.420
on the outskirts of Lahore.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:32.710
And, yes, now we have small mobile
libraries going into those areas

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.640
where the big story
teller bus cannot go.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:40.810
And the children of the community
come out and they take their books

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:48.530
and they read and then it visits
them every week or every two weeks.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.740
Yes, next please.

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.910
These are libraries that
we started in Madrassah.

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:56.290
Madrassahs are religious schools.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.050
And the children from
the Madrassahs, again,

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.500
just learn the Qur'an by rote.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:09.190
And we felt that it was necessary
for them to know a little more

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:14.410
and to be excited about the world
and books and other children

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.650
to get a better understanding
of the Qur'an.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:21.030
So, these are libraries
that we've set up there.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.470
Next please.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:25.290
These are Rickshaw libraries.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.680
These little three-legged
rickshaws that go into, you know,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.620
very -- are my five minutes up?

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.920
&gt;&gt; Yes, they are.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.220
&gt;&gt; OK. I'm done [laughing].

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.280
Yes. So, any questions?

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.980
&gt;&gt; We have time for one question
but I think we're going to have

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.240
to limit this to no more
than 10 minutes total.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.640
And you've managed to
give us more information,

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.400
but part of it was
in your Q and A time.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.700
So, if you don't mind.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.000
&gt;&gt; No. I don't mind.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.300
I don't mind.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, if there's time -- if
there's one question, we'll take it?

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.340
If not, let's thank her and we
will continue the discussion,

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.500
as I said, later after the break.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.800
But thank you very much.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.100
That was [inaudible].

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.400
&gt;&gt; And I'm really sorry
I took more time.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.280
I never ever do, but I think
this crowd was so phenomenal

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.990
that I just wanted to keep talking.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.290
Thank you.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.090
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:20.260

Family Reading Partnership.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.020
Katrina?

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.360
&gt;&gt; We're two, we're a team.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.660
We're a team.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.960
&gt;&gt; We're a team.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.510
&gt;&gt; OK. Hi, I'm Katrina and this is

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:48.120
So, we're happy she can be here
to share the award with us.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.710
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, Family
Reading Partnership.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.990
We do more than give
books, we change lives.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.730
And to just try to
quickly tell the story

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:00.290
of this amazing organization
in five minutes.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:04.380
It started with -- sure.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.680
Here?

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.980
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.870
&gt;&gt; OK. It started with,
again, our founder hearing

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:11.250
from kindergarten teachers
in our community

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.440
that children were
still entering school

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.620
with little or no book experience.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.130
And she convened community
members and said,

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.790
"What can we do about this?

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.090
What can we do to insure
that all children

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:24.670
in our community have
early, frequent,

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:28.970
and pleasurable experiences
with books at home?"

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.450
So, that is how the
story began 18 years ago.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:36.070
And our goal is, our mission
is to create a culture

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:40.150
of literacy one book, one
child, one family at a time.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:41.580
And this is what this looks like.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:46.660 position:56%
We really are focusing on supporting
family reading practices at home,

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.500
ensuring book ownership for
children, and really working

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.840
within existing partnerships
within our community.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.500
That's how the magic happens.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.560
And the way that works, we do
have 12 different programs.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.230
Whoops. I get to say
one second about that.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.910
We did bring materials with
brochures that go in more depth

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.770
about the programs, but we
start before the beginning.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.160
So, in our community every
expectant family receives a book

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.800
from their obstetrician or
midwife encouraging them

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.330
to start reading even
before the baby's born.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.790
At birth, they are gifted with
The Very Hungry Caterpillar,

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:23.880
which Eric Carle calls
a story of hope.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.040
And it's in a bag that
says, "Love me,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.970
feed me, take me to the library."

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.710
we have a program really
modeled after Reach Out and Read

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.570
but we call it Books to Grow On.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:42.020
And whoops, again, in our
community, every child beginning

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.930
at their two month well
child checkup receives a book

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:47.860
from their pediatrician with
the prescription, "read to me,"

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.170
signed by the pediatrician.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.530
Again, we recognize that
when books are given

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:55.500
through trusted partnerships the
value of that book is increased.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.080
And also that all children

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.320
in our community are
receiving the same books.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.070
So, we are building community
through gifting these books.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:06.110
Also, each of these books is
sponsored by a local business

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:11.500
or foundation so that it's a way to
include everybody in this process.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.450
OK. We like to mark
special occasions.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.730
So, children are welcomed to
kindergarten, again, county-wide --

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:23.980
whoops -- with a Welcome
to School book.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.280
And this is what it looks like.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.580
So, kinds in our community --

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.860
all kids in our community
receive all these books.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.350
This is the collection
that they have

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:34.730 position:56%
by the time they are four years old.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:41.360
OK. We also realize that it's
important to have book access

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.900
and our goal of creating a culture
of literacy means that books --

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.330
there has to be an
abundance of books everywhere.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:50.310
So, we have 50 Bright
Red Bookshelves,

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:53.160
which circulate gently used
children's books throughout

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.460
the community.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.850
And what's special about this
is each bookshelf has a tender.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.150
It might be a family.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:02.180
It might be an organization.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.240
But throughout the
year we do book drives.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.280
April is Faith in Books Month
for Family Reading Partnership

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.760
so all the religious
congregations collect books.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.310
They come back to our organization.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.210
Volunteers clean them, sort
them, put them on bookshelves.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.630
Then our Bright Red Bookshelves
tenders can come collect them,

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:22.960
and bring them out
there to their shelf.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.370
OK. We have an annual
event in two weeks.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.340
You're all invited
in Ithaca, New York.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.800 position:56%
I forgot to say we were from Ithaca.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.050
Kids' Book Fest, a
celebration focusing on books.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:36.390
Every school aged child
-- actually pre-K

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:39.970 position:56%
through 3rd grade receives the
featured book, which this year is --

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.910
out theme is The World of Eric
Carle, The Mixed-Up Chameleon.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:45.950
And the entire community
celebrates this --

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.860
celebrates books and reading.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.750
OK. We recognize that in
creating this culture we also need

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:56.050
to have more resources for
families with greater need.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:00.540
So, during the holiday season,
we have Give the Gift of Reading.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.580
Families at WIC sites can choose
a brand new book, wrap it,

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.170
and have it as part of their
children's holiday celebration.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.670
We have a new Welcome to WIC book.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.970
So, Rah Rah Radishes.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.500 position:56%
If you haven't read it, you need to.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.800
It's fabulous.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.370
It's the joy of vegetables
in a ruckus chant.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:21.560
And, again, this weaving of books
throughout family's life throughout

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.860
the community.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.280
We have a wonderful program
called Read Along Songs,

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.260
which goes out to Headstart
and Pre-K kids.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.960
And, again, it's a tool
for family engagement

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.150
in that it uses music along with
children can hear the books,

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:40.090
they can read the pictures or
they can hear the books sung.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:43.780
And I'm going to have Katrina just
speak briefly about these next --

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:48.270
these next materials which are
tools for family engagement.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:52.540
Yeah. We developed three special
tools for family engagement.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.950
First one is a Read to Me Calendar.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:00.590
This is -- hopefully some of
you have it because we have it

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:04.330
in our packets that you're
welcome to take back with you.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:05.630
This is -- oh.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:06.930
Just.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:08.230
&gt;&gt; It goes by itself.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.530
&gt;&gt; Oh, it does?

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:10.850
Oh, OK. OK.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.570
Well, anyway the calendar
is filled with illustrations

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:17.320
from nationally known children's
book illustrators and all

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.940
of them are about reading together.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:24.270
So, the calendar goes to
Pre-K and Headstart families.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.970
In December, they get to take it
home and wrap it for their families

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.320
and bring it back as a gift.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.720
They also have it in the classroom

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.910
so they can make a
school to home connection.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:37.240
Then -- did we miss one?

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.540
OK. So At Home with Books.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.170
I had the pleasure of
writing and illustrating.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.570
It's a story about the bear family

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:45.900
and all the fun they
have reading at home.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:51.090
But woven into the story is our
tips for parents on how to read.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:56.570 position:56%
So, it gives ways and methods of how
you can have fun with reading aloud.

00:42:56.570 --> 00:43:01.740
And we also developed materials so
that Headstart and Pre-K classrooms

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.370
and home based programs
can use this as a way

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:08.450
to develop a culture
of literacy in homes.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:15.910
And Love Those Letters is
-- it does go by itself.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:18.230
OK. Love Those Letters is a book.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:23.950
It's a brand new alphabet book
that was borne out of a need

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:28.460
in our community to have a
consistent key words throughout the

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.090 position:56%
community so that when children went

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:34.070 position:56%
to school they all learned the
alphabet through different keywords,

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.950
the same keywords from
school to school.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:40.540
And there is -- this was a
big collaborative effort.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.910
We have someone who
made a dance and a song.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:46.300
I did the illustrations
for the book.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.690
We also have school materials
that are used in classrooms.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.260
So, that's given to
Pre-K and kindergarten

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.130
and Headstart families
in classrooms.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.430
&gt;&gt; And, again, the idea is

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:03.000 position:56%
about having children not just learn
the alphabet but love the alphabet,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.640
really connecting families
and children

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.340
around the joy of learning letters.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.590
OK. So, we should have
been done, but we weren't.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:14.420
We recognized all of these
things were happening and

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.760
yet we needed to start earlier.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.590
So, our newest initiative is called
Every Baby Every Day Talk Sing

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:20.890
Read Play.

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:25.800
And we created a community call to
action with an envisioning, again,

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.620
what would it take in our
community to have every baby grow

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.460
up surrounded by words, songs,
and stories right from the start.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.970
What would we need to do?

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:37.520
So, we created a community-wide
invitation, giant,

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.390 position:56%
nine by 12 foot banners on buildings
throughout our community saying,

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:42.690
"Spread the word.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:43.990
Be a part of it."

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:46.450
We -- there is going up
at our grocery store.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:49.400
Lawn signs, we have 500 lawn signs.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.130
We put them in flocks
and said, "Take one!

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:53.430
Share the message.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:54.730
Bring it home."

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:56.030
And people did.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:57.800
And our mayor has a lawn sign

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.680 position:56%
and we had all our community leaders
record public service announcements

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.980
and say, "Come on.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:04.280
We can do this."

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.770
Very compelling messages.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:08.570
And we train -- we recognize
that babies and toddlers,

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.050
there's often empty waiting
for them in places like WIC

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:15.470
and social service agencies
and even in child care.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.320
So, we trained baby reading
buddies to be people that went out

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.940
and did talk, sing, read,
play, modeling and supporting.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.090
Families through our
home visiting program

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:28.740
through the health department
receive a special bag of books

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:33.560
from their nurses at their
seven month visit prenatally.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.330
And there they are happy to bring
our message out with their message.

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:40.360
And our last part of this
is we convened all six

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.540
of our county libraries for this
initiative called Babies Belong

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:47.700
at the Library and issue a Baby's
First Library Card with that book

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.650
at birth, our Welcome Baby book.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:53.230
These libraries also agreed
that there would be no fine

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:56.570
on board books to really
encourage all families

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.970
and our message was, "Come.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:45:59.310
Stay. Play.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.380
Let the libraries be
one of the first places

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.670
that families bring babies
and never stop going."

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:06.210
So, that is our reading magic.

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:14.330 position:56%
OK. A little more than five minutes.

You know, I'm creeping up behind,
but I think we need a new bargain

10 minutes max and I'm going

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:33.000
to start edging up
about seven minutes.

take the 10 minutes,

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.570
there will just be no questions.

do it in five minutes,

we'll have a chance
to have questions.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.990
But, as I said, the real other
way to look at it is we're warming

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:47.860
up for the discussion and if
you have further questions

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.860
about the group, look at --
sit at the tables together

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:55.520
and you can do kind of a round
robin, "I'd like to know more

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.630
about something," and we'll make
that a different kind of discussion

for everyone to get in.

00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:48.960 position:56%
And they change subjects rapidly and
I think we all need a little time

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.360
to absorb what we're seeing and
think about it a little bit in view

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.870
of the discussion that's coming up.

00:56:55.870 --> 00:57:01.770
So, we will now have, I
believe, speaker number four.

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:05.060
And that's Sapargul Mirseitova

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:08.310
from The Kazakhstan
Reading Association --

00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:11.440
Reading Association, yes.

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.740
Thank you very much.

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:17.510
Sapargul. Give her a hand.

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:25.040
[ Applause ]

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.030
&gt;&gt; Actually we started
earlier in 1997.

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:34.730
It was in the international
program, Reading and Writing

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:38.470
for Critical Thinking,
which brought us together.

00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:42.900
And on the initiative of
the first participants,

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:48.240
we established Kazakhstan
Reading Association in 2002.

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:53.500
The aim was to engulf
our teachers more

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:59.260
in leadership and problem solving.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:08.770
So, here you see that we have legal
entities in each regional center.

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:13.250
So, for teachers all
over the country to be --

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:21.700
to be easier to get support from
our trainers in these centers.

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.670
The next one.

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:28.440
So, what is KazRA in numbers today?

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:32.840 position:56%
More than 40,000 teachers are
certified by the Reading and Writing

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.920
for Critical Thinking program.

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:41.340
Each year we have about 3,000
members not considering that many

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:45.000
of our teachers defended
doctoral dissertations,

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.240
they got career promotions,
and higher teaching categories.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:55.430
And what is the focus of KazRA?

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:59.670
Each year we have national
and regional conferences.

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:05.630
And this year we had the 15th
national conference on reading.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:12.080
Teacher research different vision
on July 2015 in Western Part

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.380
of Kazakhstan [inaudible].

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:17.290
So, we moved from one part
of the country to another

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.750
to have our national conference
to involve more teachers

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:24.430
to give them chance to participate

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:28.660
if they cannot travel
longer distances.

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:32.730
Next one. We also publish --

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:40.680
and this is our issue of quarterly
journal, Voice and Vision.

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:45.330
It is a professional
journal of teachers.

00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:50.670
And very popular among
teachers in the country.

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:55.540
So, and also we publish
books and 16 titles

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:58.440
of books were published so far.

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:05.930
And they are in two languages
in Kazakh and Russian.

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:13.810
So, and each year at the national
conference one evening is devoted

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.110
to the auction.

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:19.480
Money collected from the
auction, we use for KazRA awards.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.440
Teachers bring souvenirs and
drawings from their students.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.790
So, we try to use all of
these at these auctions.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:37.830
So, we have the best KazRA reader
of the year, the best KazRA writer

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:44.260
of the year, and the best
KazRA illustrator of the year.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:52.630
So, this is our Executive Director
and she is together with the winner

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:57.910
as the best writer in 2015.

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:01.390
And this is the best
reader with her teacher.

01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:06.120
And she's also the KazRA trainer.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:13.660 position:56%
Thanks. These are students, the
best writer and the best illustrator

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:17.600
with their teacher
also a KazRA trainer.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.910
So, I would like to
read what they wrote

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:23.970
for our quarterly journal,
Voice and Vision.

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:25.900
Some of these winners.

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:30.310
"I became a winner of many contests
this year, but I have enjoyed none

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:35.080 position:56%
of them except this one because here
I was doing not what I had been told

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:39.740
to do, but what I wanted myself
and felt how it should be."

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.070 position:56%
Camilla Kulmaganbetova, grade eight.

01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:46.380
Thanks. The best writer.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.910
"First, I've got confused
because there are

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:51.660
so many talented students around.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:56.750
Then I realized it might be that
my work worthies to be valued.

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.720
I became proud of myself.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.390
Though, what is pride?

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:02.980 position:56%
Today you may have it, tomorrow not.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.540
Therefore, need to
continue writing."

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:12.210
I want to add that this student,
Yana, she wrote a piece --

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:18.830
a wonderful piece of continuation
of To Kill a Mockingbird.

01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:22.490
First, I just was reading
and saying, "So, what is it?

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:23.930
The same style.

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:25.720
The same wording, you know?

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.240
And then just different events."

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:34.980
And so she imagined that it is 10
years past and this little girl,

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.490
she came from another city,
New York, is a student.

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:41.050
University student.

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:48.000
And she -- and her vision now after
growing up about your childhood

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.730
in some kind of reflection
on all this.

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:55.210
So, she is very talented.

01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:56.560
Thank you.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.510
That's it.

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:05.370
[ Applause ]

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:07.530
&gt;&gt; So, I was quicker [laughing].

01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:08.830
&gt;&gt; Well, is there a question?

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:12.650
We actually have a couple minutes.

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:13.950
All right.

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:15.250
Well, thank you very much.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:18.990
And we'll continue the discussion.

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:22.400 position:56%
Our next speaker is Charmead Schella

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.230
from the Literacy Alberni
Society of Canada.

01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:32.500
[ Applause ]

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.260
&gt;&gt; You're not the first.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.600
That's all right.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.740
Thank you.

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.800
Thank you.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.700
Fabulous. Oh, that's the end.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:52.180 position:56%
But that's OK [laughing] because you
know what I don't think I'm going

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.500
to use it anyway.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:58.310
I would like to try
to exercise brevity.

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:04.670 position:56%
Literacy Alberni Society is located
in Port Alberni on Vancouver Island.

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:06.680
We've actually been in
the news since Sunday

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.880
because there was a tragic whale
watching tour boat that capsized

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.380
and five tourists were killed.

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:17.420
Anyway, that's not why I'm
here but it's been shocking

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.990
because I've been here since.

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:24.870
But I would like to offer a
very brief thumbnail sketch

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:26.170
of Port Alberni.

01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:31.180
Port Alberni is tiny with a
population of 18,000 people.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.950
Our illiteracy rate
is a shocking 42%.

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:38.350
People tend to be a little
bit shocked when I say this

01:04:38.350 --> 01:04:41.800 position:56%
as a Canadian because we are a
developed country in the first world

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.400
and yet our illiteracy
rate is so high.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:51.240
So, as such, we do have a bit
of a slog in Port Alberni trying

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:56.560
to address the issues that sort
of create this illiteracy rate.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.700
As such, we have a
myriad of programs.

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:04.080
I am the Executive Director
at Literacy Alberni Society

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.910
and we don't offer sort
of one best practice.

01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:13.420
We have a myriad of things
that we try to use to help.

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:18.370
So, the first one that
we use is called CALP,

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:21.740
and it's our Community
Adult Literacy Program

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:26.500
under which fall any programming
that basically addresses people

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.610
who are 18 years and older.

01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:34.290
We employ methods that
address computer literacy,

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:37.930
nutritional literacy, which is
like cooking classes and that kind

01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:41.660
of thing, family literacy,
which is the big one.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:47.050
Basically monitoring for
parents who perhaps had children

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:49.430
at a very young age,
which happens quite a bit

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:52.700
in my community and such.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:58.080
So, the second program
that's very popular

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:07.220
at Literacy Alberni is our ESL and
settlement assistance programming

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:11.430
because we also offer a great deal
of literacy support to immigrants

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.980
who are new to the community.

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:19.690 position:56%
So, we offer programming at not just
in terms of language acquisition

01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:22.340
but also in terms of orientation

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:26.030
and becoming familiar
with the community.

01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:33.230
As you can imagine, as a very
isolated forestry based community

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:36.670
on the very isolated West
Coast of Vancouver Island,

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:42.520
it can be a big jarring to come
from metropolitan China or Iran

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.160
or Pakistan or India or
a myriad of other places.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.300
So, this program's very
popular at our center as well.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:55.530 position:56%
And I was delighted to meet Tom at
my table who's from Little Libraries

01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:58.920
because we have just introduced
the Little Library program

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.570
to Port Alberni.

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:02.890
Brand new actually in September.

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:07.260
We've just introduced 26 Little
Libraries into the community.

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:12.740
A very very big step for the
community, which seems minor,

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.860
but it's actually quite large.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:19.650
I was marveling at the first
presentation because I can relate

01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:23.350
so closely to the idea
of just providing books

01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:26.850
and the accessibility to
books whether that be free,

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:30.410
whether that be lending,
whatever that case is.

01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:33.040
So, a really quick
story before I finish.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.620
I really don't want
to speak too long.

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.610
Our Little Libraries,
we built 26 of them.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:40.910 position:56%
And put them out into the community.

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:46.230 position:56%
And two of the Little Libraries went
as far west as we can on the island,

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:49.250 position:56%
specifically to Ucluelet and Tofino.

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:53.600
And we sort of thought
that's where they would stop.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.530
Two of our First Nations
communities out there thought

01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:58.750
that they would have a better home.

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.750
So, they popped them
on a fishing boat

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:05.120
and took them very far northwest

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.790
to two First Nations inaudible
communities called Uchucklesaht

01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:11.090
and Opitsaht.

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:14.600
And Opitsaht is a community
of about 200 people.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.010
And our Little Library is the first
library they've actually ever had.

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:21.580
I know! So, it's a
really lovely story.

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:24.300
Anyway, we do have
other programming,

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.810
but I am going to stop there.

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:29.760
And I will take any
questions if there any.

01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:34.510
Thank you.

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:39.500
[ Applause ]

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:47.910
&gt;&gt; Our next speaker is Danielle
Verbiest from the Literacy Council

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:49.450
of Montgomery County, Maryland.

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:53.510
Danielle. Let's give
her some encouragement.

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:58.500
[ Applause ]

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.540
&gt;&gt; All right.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.900
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.200
So, my name is Danielle Verbiest.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.420
I'm the Executive Director
of the Literacy Council here

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.810
in Montgomery County, Maryland.

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:15.330
So, we are local.

01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:18.670 position:56%
We're a part of the greater DC area.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:20.900
Let's move -- let's see
if I can navigate this.

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.590
Yes! I want to start real
brief by giving you an overview

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:28.550
of the organization as a whole
before I start giving you some more

01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:31.770
information about the program
that we're recognized for.

01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:37.450
So, the Literacy Council Montgomery
County, short MCMC, was established

01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:42.700
in 1963 initially as a
one-on-one tutoring program.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:49.450
So, the -- the founder was Beth
Kilgore and she saw a great need

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:52.010
in our community for
basic literacy services.

01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:57.570 position:56%
The county grew, a lot of
immigrants moved into the community,

01:09:57.570 --> 01:10:01.180
and we added ESL tutoring
services to that.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:06.580
So, right now, just to give
you a sense, we are serving

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.780
about 1,600 adults every year.

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:13.860
Since inception, we have
served 18,500 adults.

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:19.170
Most of our students
are ESL students.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:21.230
So, they're mostly immigrants.

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:26.270
Last year we had people from
85 plus countries represented

01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:29.370
in our student base
including the United States.

01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:33.730
Most of our students
are female, 75%.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:38.900
And we do all of this together
with a vast volunteer base.

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:44.280 position:56%
We have trained and supported over
9,000 volunteers since our inception

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:48.810
and currently we have about
650 active volunteers.

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:50.170
Let's see.

01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.220
So, to give you an overview.

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:55.530
So, as I mentioned, we have our
one-on-one tutoring program.

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:58.800
The one-on-one tutoring program
is entirely volunteer based

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.870
and we use a curriculum that's
called the [inaudible] method.

01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:06.700
We also have intensive
standards based ESL classes.

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:10.120
Last year we did 49
classes county-wide.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.530
We also have an English
for daily living program,

01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:16.700
family literacy program where
we partner with local schools

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:21.300
and we have a GED online
preparation program.

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:26.500
We have conversation classes where
we offer students the opportunity

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:31.090
to practice speaking English
as they wait for a tutor

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:34.200
or as they try to advance
their skills.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.590
We also have workplace
literacy classes.

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:38.130
We have two models.

01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:42.740
The main model is where we
actually work with employers.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:46.120
We are currently working with the
Maryland National Capital Parks

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.900
and Planning Commission
to offer a couple

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.580
of classes to their employees.

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:54.830
And we piloted a new program last
year that is sort of a hybrid

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:59.840 position:56%
between tutoring and classroom where
we actually go out to, in this case,

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.400
a restaurant where we meet
the students between lunch

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.180
and dinner shift and
provide tutoring services.

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:11.670
And then the one that
we are recognized

01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:14.550
for here today is our
Health Literacy program.

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.510
So, we started last year.

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:18.330
Let's see.

01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:21.700
So, we started last
year with a pilot.

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:25.150
We got funding from the
National Libraries of Medicine.

01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:27.990
We started the English
for Health program.

01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:31.950
The English for Health
program teaches adults

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:36.490 position:56%
to navigate the health care system
and maintaining good health not only

01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:40.020
for themselves but of course
also for their families.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:44.340
The curriculum was actually
developed in Wisconsin.

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:49.040
They were recognized for that
in 2010 as a best practice.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.460
We purchased the curriculum.

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:54.180
We made some adaptations to
that for our student base,

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:57.090
and it's been going very well.

01:12:57.090 --> 01:13:00.160
We are partnering with
local community's clinics

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.100
as well as a hospital.

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.650
So, it's really a partnership.

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:05.440
They help us with outreach.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.640
They provide also some
presenters from the field.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.320
We do that, you know,
very well in this program.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.490
We get presenters to focus

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:18.580
on the actual practical
part of going to the doctor.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.740
We have mock clinics which is one

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:24.390
of the favorite components
of this program.

01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:29.440
So, here you see some pictures.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:31.860
So, with this English
for Health program,

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:36.590
we directly address low health
literacy rates among adults here

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:38.330
in our community.

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:43.390
And we also see that by bringing in
the professionals from the field,

01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:46.150
it's a win-win situation
because they also get

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:50.660
to experience what it really
means to communicate effectively

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.500 position:56%
with adults with low literacy rates.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:59.210
So, we, you know, of course, we
are here today and we look forward

01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:01.470
to connecting with
more of you here today.

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:04.750
So, I'm joined by our Director
of Programs, Christine Neil.

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:08.980
So, if you have any questions,
you know, just please come over

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.510
and we'll look forward
to talking to you.

01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:18.500
[ Applause ]

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:28.580
&gt;&gt; I would just like to point out
that thus far, this first third

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:32.040
of our -- or first half
of our presentations

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.710
that we have really hit on
organizations and they've come

01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:41.220
at you alphabetically as best we
can figure out our score card here.

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:47.380
And we've hit four of the
five categories by chance,

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.900
but it in fact they should all be
here by the time we're through.

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.870
But here are the five
categories the way

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:57.140
in which you are organized
according to our best practices.

01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:01.740
Literacy in the service of social
goals, creating a community

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:07.890
of literacy, literacy working with
government policy makers -- oops!

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.290
I missed one.

01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:11.050
But we'll have to all
look at our books.

01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:14.750
Another one coming up is
providing access to readers

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.900
with physical disabilities.

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:21.160
And by the time we're through,
we'll have examples from each

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.460
of these categories
of best practices.

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.490
We had a discussion this
morning with our advisory group

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:33.840
about the evolving idea of best
practices and how last year

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.620
when we gave these awards,
we had different categories.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:42.180
They're all related to literacy and
literacy promotion, but they depend

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:46.360
in part on the applications
we get each year.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.170
This is our third year.

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:52.040
The first year we were
overwhelmed with applications.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.060
We had over 189.

01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:58.660
But it turned out that
because it was our first year

01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.870
and various problems
in working that out,

01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:06.100
a number of them didn't
prove to be eligible.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:09.390
Most of them were, but there
was a number that were not.

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:14.680
The next two years, we've had more
along the lines of 90 applications.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:18.530
This is both from the
US and from abroad.

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:23.020
But by and large as -- they
have been better applications

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.540
and fewer have been
disqualified, very few.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:33.060
And we have still been able to
widen the range of categories

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.870
and change the categories,
which is what we want

01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:38.420
to do in continuing this.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:43.110
And I'd like to point out that with
this experience under your belt,

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:48.390 position:56%
I hope that you will encourage other
groups to apply for the awards.

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:53.990
We also are making an effort
to reach deeper into states

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:58.570
on the US side and the same
is true really for countries.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:01.720
We've had a variety
of countries involved.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.040
We're working hard through UNESCO
and other national organizations

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.080
to advertise the program.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:13.680
But one thing we'd like you to help
us do is to encourage more groups

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.020
to apply and that is a way

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:21.920
that we think we can strengthen
the overall picture of literacy

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.340
and literacy promotion
both in our country

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.510
and especially around the world.

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:32.210
We have been surprised, I must --
I'll conclusion my little part --

01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:34.220
this time by the extent

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.620
of international interest
in the program.

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:42.750
And it's made us realize that we
need to continue to encourage it

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:48.060
and to continue to develop some
of these best practices categories

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:52.380
that will help encourage other
countries and other programs

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:58.040
to apply for programs
-- apply for awards.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.200
Well, it gives me a
great deal of pleasure

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.430
to introduce our next speaker.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.400
Many of you have met
in other circumstances,

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:13.500
but it's Mr. Little Free Library
himself, Todd Bol from Wisconsin.

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.510
Todd, Little Free Library.

01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:18.500
[ Applause ]

01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:27.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:28.690
Thank you very much.

01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:30.010
I'm very very honored to be here.

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:32.940
I have to tell you a story.

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:36.530
I was at a literacy
conference in Wisconsin.

01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:41.460
We received a Literacy of the Year
Award and former Governor Doyle,

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.640
from Wisconsin, came up to me.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.910 position:56%
And he said, "You know, what's going
on in America right now is not us.

01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:50.850
We're not this polarized.

01:18:50.850 --> 01:18:53.010
We're not this separated."

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:57.150
He said, "Little Free Library
is more about what we're about."

01:18:57.150 --> 01:19:01.110
He said, "We reach across the
aisle, we reach across the street,

01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:04.110
we help each other,
we lift each other up.

01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:05.650
That's who we are as Americans."

01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:10.130
And when I thought about that
earlier today I realized that's

01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:11.430
who we all are.

01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:12.730
What's unique about literacy

01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:15.790
and the literacy movement
is we have a great we.

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:19.930 position:56%
And we have a great sense of
helping everybody on a global basis,

01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:22.430
on a common goal and
a common ground.

01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:26.980
And what's unique about us is we
have a we without really an other.

01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:28.280
There's no villain.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.580
There's nobody on the other side.

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.880
There's nobody that we're against.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.920
What we're really about
is bringing together

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.340
and it's a better side
of our humanity.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.880
It's a better side of who we are.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.780
And I think that's what's great
about us and I think that's great

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:45.290
about everybody in this room that
I'm so honored to be a part of.

01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:48.090
Little Free Library, as you
instead, it says, "We all do better

01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:49.830
when we all read better."

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.880 position:56%
We borrowed that from Paul
Wellstone, the senator of Minnesota.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.360
He said we all do better
when we all do better.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.920
And we know that reading
is a part of it.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:04.720
By the end of the year, we'll
have 40,000 Little Free Libraries.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.620
We'll be in over 90
countries, 50 states,

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:10.250
200,000 books a day get exchanged

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:15.030
over 60,000,000 --
60,000,000 books a year.

01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:17.290
Yeah. I like that.

01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:19.950
It's a good start.

01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:21.250
That's my mom.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:24.820
Like many of you who've
lost your parents,

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.690
I couldn't believe she died.

01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:28.170
I couldn't believe it.

01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:29.470
I couldn't believe it.

01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:31.620
A great spirit was left.

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:34.880 position:56%
And when she died, at her funeral, I
gave out a little nickels that said,

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:39.750
"June A. Bol, a Dancing
Spirit, 1927 through."

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:41.530
And I never put an end date to it.

01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:45.850
And I consider my mom's dance
to be all around the world.

01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:49.010
The spirit of my mom lives through
each and every Little Free Library

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:52.170
and every time I see one I
seem like I have another child.

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:53.660
It's great.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:58.220
We're all across the globe,
South Korea, Israel, Japan.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.090
And we have a book, a
wonderful book was written

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:02.810
about Little Free Library.

01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:07.590
LA Times said it was almost
perfect literary democracy.

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:13.020
San Francisco Gate said, "It's
one of America's better exports."

01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.320
I like that.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.730
Minneapolis Paper called it
pint sized social justice.

01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:20.030
I like that.

01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:23.540
And last week Amazon.com,
of all things --

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:26.870
and those of you that are in
my age category will appreciate

01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:29.900
that fine complement --
it said it's the best book

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.300 position:56%
since the 1970s Whole Earth Catalog.

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:38.450
It has great signs of hope
and a great future for us all

01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:41.900
because it's leading really
the giving and sharing economy.

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.000
And how great to have that giving
and sharing economy be about books.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.540
We've gotten great reviews.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.840
Pick up the book.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.920
You can find it at
LittleFreeLibrary.com,

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:58.780
at your local bookstore,
and other places.

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.390
Governor Doyle, again.

01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:06.880
It's -- many nice things
have been said about us.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:11.610 position:56%
We've been told that we are a global
sensation, a cultural phenomenon,

01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:14.860
but what I really love is we've
been called the newest micro

01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:16.160
lending system.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.110
We've also been called a revolution

01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:21.740
and neighborhood conversation
and a folk art revival.

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:24.120
I like that.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.600
And, of course, my
kids groan at this one

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.630
and I tell this any chance I get.

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:32.280
We were in 50 Surprising Reasons
We Love America, Bon Jovi,

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:37.030
Bruce Springsteen, number
50, Michelle Obama, 35.

01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:38.890
Sorry, Michelle.

01:22:38.890 --> 01:22:40.610
Bill Gates, number 25.

01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:44.530
And at the heel of sliced bread
-- we're not quite sliced bread --

01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:46.890
is Little Free Libraries.

01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:50.470
All right.

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:53.880
Just after Thanksgiving,
we passed McDonalds.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.440
We're have more libraries
than McDonalds, more locations

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.350
than McDonalds, and of
course you know we have

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:01.270
to say more books than burgers.

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:04.480
Probably get us sued, but
I think that's brilliant.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.780
I can't wait.

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:10.080
And our goal is by 2017 to have

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.530
over 100,000 Little Free
Libraries throughout the world.

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:16.800
Our ultimate goal is to have them
all around the world and serve

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:21.000
as a lightning rod to stimulate
local and grass roots literacy.

01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:28.650
And what we've developed out
of this is something called

01:23:28.650 --> 01:23:30.160
Literacy-Friendly Neighborhood.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.310
And this is our key Marque program.

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:36.330
And what Literacy-Friendly
Neighborhood is designed to do is

01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:41.170 position:56%
to say to neighbors, "You can't take
care of your state or your country,

01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:43.810
each city, but maybe you can
take care of your neighborhood."

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:47.840
And what we've done is taken the
ideas of thousands and thousands

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.150
of Little Free Library stewards
around the globe and put them

01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:54.710
in something called a literacy
friendly neighborhood toolkit.

01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:57.520
It's something that we can all
partner with, we can all use.

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:00.140
It's a form of civil rights.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.400
It's we all have a right to read.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.280
And the neighborhoods
are the key area

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.150
that we have to help each other.

01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:11.740
We are doing something across
the country called Kids,

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.040
Community, and Cops.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.400
We're building 100 Little
Free Libraries in a day.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.540
We're bringing in children.

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.270
We're bringing in Black
Lives Matter.

01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:23.250
We're bringing in policemen and
we're putting these together.

01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:28.170
And in some communities they're
asking via Facebook page,

01:24:28.170 --> 01:24:31.050
"What is your favorite
book about understand?

01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:33.800
How do you build understand
in your community?"

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:37.470
And we're starting to get support
from such groups as the FBI

01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:42.140
and the Treasury Department and
police and corporations and so on.

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:46.180
We plan on doing one in Washington,
by the way, at the end of June.

01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:50.170
And we have one planned in
Los Angeles February 20th

01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:52.480
and Minneapolis February 21st.

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.370 position:56%
We have up to 600 people come in and
put these Little Free Libraries up

01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:59.950
and give them throughout
the communities.

01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:03.290
We put in 11 Little Free Libraries

01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:05.770
in Madison area about
three years ago.

01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:07.600
Now we have over 500.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.370
I put up three Little Free
Libraries in the Twin Cities area

01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:12.230
of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.

01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:15.300
Now we have over 4,000
throughout Minnesota

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:19.020
and it's growing faster and faster.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.220
And there's my Little
Free Library vehicle.

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:27.020
If any of you remember Felix
the Cat, this is our little bag

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:30.550
of tricks, this wagon -- I
mean this trailer and we travel

01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:34.700
across the country and
soon to be a city near you.

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:40.390
Little Free Library, you can
help in all kinds of ways.

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:45.460
I was just down in Mississippi and
I spoke at the library conference.

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.710
And they decided that they are
going to put a Little Free Library

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:51.140
in every small town in Mississippi.

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:54.630
There are over 11,000
towns across America

01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:57.880
without books, no library
whatsoever.

01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.070
So, in Mississippi, they're going
to make sure that they have one.

01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:05.460
I have several groups
from Canada that would

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.290
like to celebrate their 175th --

01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:11.120
including that young
later over there --

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.430
celebrate their 175th
birthday in 2015

01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:18.640
by putting a Little Free Library
in every small town across Canada.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:23.970 position:56%
And so we're trying to do that and I
encourage each and every group here

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:27.340
to use Little Free Library,
borrow our materials, take --

01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.440
go look at Literacy-Friendly
Neighborhood,

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.750
which can be downloaded.

01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:32.050
Take our pictures.

01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:33.350
Take our models.

01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:34.650
Do whatever you want.

01:26:34.650 --> 01:26:37.460
And use Little Free Library to
help improve your community.

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.880
And also come back to help us.

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:42.840
We're interested in materials
and anything you can provide us

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:47.310
because we want to make them
available for everybody.

01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:49.260
Thank you.

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:51.510
[ Applause ]

01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:56.290
Do I have time for one question?

01:26:56.290 --> 01:26:58.800
No? I used all my time, John?

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.200
&gt;&gt; We're in the same
position we've often been in.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:03.800
&gt;&gt; I'm telling you that time is up.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.100
&gt;&gt; But I [inaudible].

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.570
It was 33 seconds.

01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:12.380
&gt;&gt; You did -- well you
want to give a conclusion?

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:13.680
&gt;&gt; Oh.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:16.270
&gt;&gt; In a sentence or two?

01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:17.570
We've done this before.

01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:19.130
&gt;&gt; A gentleman came
up to me and said

01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:21.530
that Little Free Libraries
are like air conditioning.

01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:23.390
You know? And I said, "What?"

01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:24.930
He said, "Yeah, air conditioning.

01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:28.730
What happened to us is in the
'60s we all got off the porch,

01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:32.040
stopped reading, went in the house,
turned on the air conditioning,

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.350
shut the door, shut the
windows, turned on the TV

01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:36.690
and the digital divide began.

01:27:36.690 --> 01:27:39.170
And now with Little Free
Library we're talking again."

01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:42.460
And I think we should all use
that to make things better.

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:44.510
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you.

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:50.110
[ Applause ]

01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:52.250
&gt;&gt; At the National Book
Festival this year,

01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:56.700
Center for the Book plays
a key role in the Library

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.910
of Congress National Book Festival.

01:27:58.910 --> 01:28:02.480
We had a literacy corner
for the first time.

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.700
And Little Free Library
plus a couple

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.870
of our other partners were there.

01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:09.220
And a very popular part of it.

01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:12.720
And we are going to continue
to have a literacy corner

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.160
at the National Book Festival.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:18.160
And I hope that, as the years
role by, that we'll be able

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:24.330
to include more partners and
more of this idea of new ways

01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:30.620
of promoting literacy, innovative
ways that catch the eye and are --

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:32.460
go to places where
there aren't books.

01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:36.580
And I didn't know the Mississippi
story that Todd just told.

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:39.380
We participated this year

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.710
in the Mississippi Book
Festival for the first time.

01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:44.040
People from the National
Book Festival.

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.760
And so we're converging I guess
in Mississippi, but, again,

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.530
with state Centers for the
Book, there's one in every state

01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:54.710
and we talk tonight at the
reception a little bit.

01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:57.380
I'll have a roster
of the state centers.

01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.530 position:56%
And I hope that that's another
connection that if you haven't made,

01:29:01.530 --> 01:29:04.420
you'll consider making
because we are,

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.730
as Todd said, in the same business.

01:29:06.730 --> 01:29:08.540
We just come at it different ways.

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:13.410
And the more different ways that
we can approach it, the better.

01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:16.050
Next, Matt Sironas
[assumed spelling],

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:20.260
Men with a Message Braille Program.

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:22.510
Let's give Matt a hand.

01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:26.500
[ Applause ]

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.890
OK. Good afternoon.

01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:43.820
Thank you for this honor, inviting
us to be here with you today.

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:47.550
If you can read, you can
learn to do anything.

01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:48.850
This is something that the Men

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:51.390
with the Message Program
strongly believes in.

01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:54.990
For the past 26 years, Delaware's
Department of Corrections

01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:59.130
and the Division for the Visually
Impaired's Instructional Materials

01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:02.290
and Resource Center has
made it their responsibility

01:30:02.290 --> 01:30:08.300
to make written material accessible
in alternate formats for the blind

01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.830
and severely impaired
Delawareans primarily K-12 students

01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:14.980
that we serve.

01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:19.930
Each request received is unique.

01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:23.590
But there is a common goal and
that is to help the student,

01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:29.300
young or old, to read and learn
with the hope of them wanting more.

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:30.900
Our program is stationed

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:34.260
in the James T. Vaughn Correctional
Center in Smyrna, Delaware.

01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:35.800
And it's partner, the Division

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.950
for the Visually Impaired
in Wilmington, Delaware.

01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:45.640
Our program began in 1989 with five
members and a part-time proctor

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:48.010
that focused on producing braille.

01:30:48.010 --> 01:30:51.370 position:56%
And they earned their certifications
in braille transcription

01:30:51.370 --> 01:30:53.930
from the Library of Congress.

01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:56.370
The program grew and as the number

01:30:56.370 --> 01:31:01.180
of highly skilled men joining the
team increased, so did the number

01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:05.150 position:56%
of Library of Congress
certifications awarded to these men.

01:31:05.150 --> 01:31:09.200
These certifications are not just
for braille transcription but also

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:14.860
for proof reading the braille codes
in the following formats: Literary,

01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:19.730
math and science, also
known as Nemeth, and music.

01:31:19.730 --> 01:31:24.510
We also developed workshops
that strengthened the skill sets

01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:26.410
of our transcribers in the areas

01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:30.090
of foreign language
and tactile graphics.

01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:34.480
And as the program grew further,
the service of providing material

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.240
in large print was added.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:40.920
And in later years we
offered ink and braille

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.460
on the same page line for line.

01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:47.780
We found that this
format helped engage some

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:52.500
of our sighted family
members and their peers

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:57.570 position:56%
with the braille reader's experience
with reading and learning.

01:31:57.570 --> 01:32:02.310
Historically, hard copy was the
medium requested for our readers

01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:05.020
and we still provide it in
that format to this day.

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:08.830
However, with the advancements
of technology and laptops,

01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:12.450
accessible portable note
takers, IOS devices,

01:32:12.450 --> 01:32:15.390
as they became more readily
available to students,

01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:18.670
we received more requests
for reading material

01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:22.480
to be accessed on mobile devices.

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.970
And so we continued to
adopt new practices.

01:32:26.970 --> 01:32:32.200 position:56%
No longer was it just about having
the written word in large translated

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:37.540
by our team, but by the device
and actions of the end user.

01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:41.500
The trick for us, to get the
hard copy print into a format

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:46.330
that the device could understand,
read out loud, and have it sent

01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:48.250
to a refreshable brain display

01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:52.790
so that the student could read the
material tactually, which leads me

01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:57.150
to say accessibility is not
a future, but a procedure.

01:32:57.150 --> 01:33:01.200 position:56%
I'm amazed at the level of attention
and care that goes to each request

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:06.400 position:56%
that we serve, the pride that the
men take in their work, the proofing

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:10.320
and the quality control
measures that they have in place.

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.060
We do this to insure that the
reading material's not just

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:18.030
accessible but usable so
that the client can read

01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:22.810
and interpret the information
the way the author intended it

01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:24.930
to be read.

01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:29.880
The participants in this program
have always strived for excellence

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.560
in their customer service.

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:36.050 position:56%
They rise to the occasion to
perform above and beyond by learning

01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:40.650
and embracing these emerging
technologies, adopting new methods

01:33:40.650 --> 01:33:46.340
and procedures, mastering new
formatting codes and rules,

01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.240
and monitoring and
training the new members

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:54.030 position:56%
of the program while focusing on the
client who wants to read and learn.

01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:59.690 position:56%
Our current team has 12 full-time
inmate workers and their supervisor,

01:33:59.690 --> 01:34:03.250
four -- including myself -- at the
Division for the Visually Impaired,

01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:07.110
and several, several
hard working volunteers

01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:11.210
who have devoted their countless
hours of their precious time

01:34:11.210 --> 01:34:14.610
to help clients receive
their reading material.

01:34:14.610 --> 01:34:17.670
As a result of our
practices, our blind

01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:19.440
and visually impaired
clients have a better chance

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.760
of reaching their goals
because they continue to read.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.380
In closing -- I know
we're short on time --

01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:30.080
I would like to point out
that all of our program,

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:33.230
all it's accomplished
could not be possible today

01:34:33.230 --> 01:34:36.100
without the pioneering
efforts and accomplishments

01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:40.280
of Mrs. Anne Hitchcock who
we lost earlier this year.

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.500
In May of 1989, Anne
began to lead this program

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:47.040
until her retirement in 2010.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.710
We miss her dearly.

01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:50.160
And we're OK on time.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:51.580
Thank you very much.

01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:52.880
&gt;&gt; You have time.

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.180
&gt;&gt; That's OK.

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:56.030
If there's any questions if?

01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:57.330
Or save them for later because?

01:34:57.330 --> 01:34:58.630
&gt;&gt; You have a question over here.

01:34:58.630 --> 01:35:05.310
&gt;&gt; So, do any of the men get
feedback from the target users?

01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:06.610
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

01:35:06.610 --> 01:35:09.620
We have our -- we work at the
Division for the Visually Impaired

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:13.280
with the teachers or the
requester and, yes, we get feedback

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:19.800 position:56%
and that's how we continue to evolve
or it may be alter future volumes

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:23.720
of the book that we're doing.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.150
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

01:35:28.150 --> 01:35:29.880
To what extent.

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:32.180
&gt;&gt; Let me give you.

01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:33.480
Thank you.

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.780
&gt;&gt; How does -- oh, hello --

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.110
do the inmates who receive
these certifications go

01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:38.660
on to get employment once
they're released and?

01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:42.040
&gt;&gt; We've had people in
our program and, yes,

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.430
we've had someone leave the program
and they came to work with us

01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:48.470
to continue to serve and
use those braille skills

01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:50.770
that took years to obtain.

01:35:50.770 --> 01:35:56.160
And we recently hopefully
having this opportunity again.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.290
And for those who aren't
there, they --

01:35:58.290 --> 01:36:01.070
so we have some members who
have been in that program

01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:04.100
for many years within that room.

01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:09.590
So, you know, we do our
best and they do their best.

01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:10.960
They want to be there.

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.130
We've got people in that
program who've been there longer

01:36:14.130 --> 01:36:17.900
than I've -- and I've been with
the agency 20 plus years, 22 years.

01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:19.200
And they're still in that room.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:26.250
And we've had people who have left
and wanted to help serve the blind

01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:28.030
and visually impaired still.

01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:29.330
So, yes.

01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:36.170
&gt;&gt; How is electronic braille
changing the landscape

01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:37.670
of what you do?

01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:40.030
&gt;&gt; When I -- what I think I'm
hearing you say is that, you know,

01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:44.740
historically, like I mentioned,
everything was on paper.

01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:48.960
Now, our requests are, "I want to
read my book on my iPad or I want

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.880
to read it on my computer."

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:55.010
OK. We have now devices that sync
up to these laptops so we have

01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:58.820
to make sure that the file that
we provide, either we download it,

01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:01.700
we create it, or we have to
take something from scratch,

01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:04.240
chop the spine off, and
run it through our scanners

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.880
and put all that together.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.350
And sometimes they want both.

01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:09.690
Sometimes they want to have
something that they can read

01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:12.370
and something for their
mobile device

01:37:12.370 --> 01:37:13.820
with the refreshable
braille display.

01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.470
And it's always good because we've
had summer reading times, you know,

01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:19.610
it's hot outside and those
batteries tend to fail.

01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:22.480
So, we have some kids who
have the hard copy right there

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:25.550
in case the device
is low on batteries.

01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:29.880
But with all this, our guys in
this maximum security prison,

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:32.820
they're not -- these computers
are not on the internet.

01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.350
They are standalone.

01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:36.870
It's difficult for us
to get things in there.

01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:38.780
The trainings that Anne,
my colleague over here,

01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:42.760
and I help provide them with,
the materials that we give them,

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:48.210
it is a tough battle, but you know
the guys are really embracing this.

01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:52.550 position:56%
It helps keep them in touch with
what's going on outside those walls.

01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:56.770 position:56%
It gives them an idea of the kinds
of material that's now being taught.

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:58.710
You know, math isn't
what it used to be.

01:37:58.710 --> 01:38:02.000
And it's -- they're
learning themselves too

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.620
and they're having a really --

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:10.800
it's amazing seeing the
interest no matter what age.

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:14.460
I've got some braillist in there
that are -- that are seasoned.

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:18.510
And we brought in some devices.

01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:21.210
This is how your books
are being read.

01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:24.100
We have to learn new
ways of making them.

01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:26.310
So, they're following new
recipes, they're embracing them.

01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:27.610
We're happy with that.

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:30.730
But it's a lot of work.

01:38:30.730 --> 01:38:32.030
Anymore? OK.

01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:33.330
Well on time?

01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:35.280
[ Applause ]

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.580
Thank you.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:46.310
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a wide word
that we inhibit isn't it?

01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:51.720 position:56%
Next speaker is Shanti Shovashanka
[assumed spelling] National Resource

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:56.280
Center for Non-Formal
Education in Nepal.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.030
Shanti? Thank you.

01:38:58.030 --> 01:39:00.010
Let's give her a hand.

01:39:00.010 --> 01:39:01.310
[ Applause ]

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:07.790
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everyone.

01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:12.170
Namaste. I don't have any
PowerPoint presentation.

01:39:12.170 --> 01:39:19.180 position:56%
I'm just sharing my feeling and give
a brief introduction of our program.

01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:24.060
I -- it's great to be
here in Washington, D.C.,

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.980
United States of America.

01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:31.910
Such a big country from Nepal,
such a small country [laughing].

01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:35.430
And representing our organization,
National Resource Center

01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:39.220
for Non-Formal Education, NRC-NFE.

01:39:40.450 --> 01:39:45.070
It's a great pleasure
for me, my friend Sheila,

01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:50.630 position:56%
and for our organization to
participate in this awards ceremony.

01:39:50.630 --> 01:39:55.500
And I would like to express
heartfelt thanks to the Library

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:59.000
of Congress on behalf
of our organization

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.770
for providing us this
opportunity to deliver my remarks

01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:06.740
and share our experience.

01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:12.100
Really, it's a great honor
for us to be selected as one

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:18.160
of the best practices
honorees for the 2015 Library

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.610
of Congress Literacy Awards.

01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:24.570
This has been very
encouraging reward for us.

01:40:24.570 --> 01:40:28.940
We are very grateful to
the Library of Congress

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:34.540
for recognizing our effort in
the field of promoting literacy

01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:39.220
and non-formal education through
community learning centers.

01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:45.140
Now, I would like to briefly
share about our programs.

01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:52.450
NRC-NFE, our organization, has
been working for the literacy

01:40:52.450 --> 01:40:55.660
and non-formal education through
community learning centers

01:40:55.660 --> 01:41:01.410
since its establishment in 1995.

01:41:01.410 --> 01:41:06.980 position:56%
Our major theme of the program is to
promote community learning centers

01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:09.550
at a delivery mechanism of literacy

01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:15.990
and non-formal education
programs at grass roots levels.

01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:19.900
CLC means community
learning centers,

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:25.500
is a community based
organization managed and operated

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:30.350
by the community people
for the community people.

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:35.270
It is a multipurpose
organization which plans

01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:41.810 position:56%
and implements different education
as well as other need based programs

01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:46.490
for the benefit of different
target groups of the community.

01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:51.070
And it is continuously
providing learning opportunities

01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:53.840
for the community people.

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.420
Realizing the value of the
CLCs for literacy promotion

01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:01.610
and community development
at grass roots level,

01:42:01.610 --> 01:42:05.280
CLC has become the
national program in Nepal

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:13.600
and there are 2,151 CLCs running
in the country at present.

01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:19.740 position:56%
Main function of our organization in
promoting Community Learning Center

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:25.730
and literacy is to work
as technical backstopping

01:42:25.730 --> 01:42:29.180
which includes activities
like advocacy,

01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:31.740
[inaudible] building
training programs,

01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:35.800
developing teaching learning
materials and resource materials,

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:40.720
and design and implementing various
kinds of need based education

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.370
and other programs
for the communities.

01:42:44.370 --> 01:42:47.620
We have been providing financial
support for various kinds

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:52.440 position:56%
of literacy and non-formal education
programs for various target groups.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.250
For example, basic
literacy, post-literacy,

01:42:56.250 --> 01:43:01.170
vocational skill based literacy,
environmentally literacy, maternal

01:43:01.170 --> 01:43:05.890 position:56%
and child health literacy,
computer literacy, English language,

01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:11.340
and many more skill based training
programs for youth and adults

01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:16.560
and for out of school children
and school dropout children.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:26.380 position:56%
We have open school programs and
particularly, for literacy promotion

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:31.820
in the country, NRC-NFE has been
supporting the government literacy

01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:34.890
campaign programs since 2008.

01:43:34.890 --> 01:43:40.360
Its major role in the government
initiation was developing textbook

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.850
and supplementary materials based

01:43:42.850 --> 01:43:48.170
on learning achievement
indicators defined and supporting

01:43:48.170 --> 01:43:50.520
in the facilitators
training programs --

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:54.250
I mean teachers training programs.

01:43:54.250 --> 01:43:59.210
Thousands of copies of
textbooks in Nepali language

01:43:59.210 --> 01:44:05.150
and other local languages were
printed and distributed nationwide.

01:44:05.150 --> 01:44:11.240
It also encouraged the CLCs to
work as likely implementing partner

01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.800
for the Literate Nepal Mission,
that is literacy campaign.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:23.670 position:56%
Ninety percent of the target has
been achieved in [inaudible] so far.

01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:28.870
Additionally, we have been
helping to strengthen the CLCs

01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:35.330
and promoting them to develop as
lifelong learning center with some

01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:37.250
as green sustainable centers.

01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:42.880
We have deviled some CLCs as
mobile CLCs and developed them

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:45.110
as green sustainable centers.

01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:50.580
This way our organization has been
working hard to promote literacy,

01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:53.950
non-formal education,
continuing education

01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:56.310
through Community Learning Centers.

01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:59.830
And for this it is working
very closely with the Ministry

01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:05.400 position:56%
of Education particularly Non-Formal
Education Center and we feel

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:09.520
that we are successfully
heading to our mission.

01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:15.410
To our mission we have been
supported by our particular donor,

01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:18.540
National Federation
of UNESCO Associations

01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:22.360
in Japan, NFUAJ, since 2002.

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:26.810
So, great thanks to NFUAJ for
providing continuous support

01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:31.320
for the CLC project and also
for encouraging us to apply

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:38.170
for this International Literacy
Award and sending reference letter.

01:45:38.170 --> 01:45:43.530
Our effort has been possible with
the support of NFUAJ [laughing].

01:45:43.530 --> 01:45:50.510 position:56%
We are thankful to our
organization and our boss [laughing]

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:55.120
for sending us to participate
in this event [laughing].

01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:01.930
I believe this would be a good
learning opportunity for us.

01:46:01.930 --> 01:46:06.700
Lastly, I would like to
thank Mr. John Y. Cole,

01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:12.320 position:56%
Chair of the 2015 Library of
Congress Literacy Award and Director

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:18.230
of Center of Book and Miss Jillian
for providing all the required help

01:46:18.230 --> 01:46:21.440
in the way for [inaudible]
this event so far.

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:28.910
So, today, 27th, October 2015 would
be a very special and memorable day

01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:33.160
for me, for my friend,
and for our organization.

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.510
Thank you very much.

01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:45.500
[ Applause ]

01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:50.590
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you
for those nice words.

01:46:50.590 --> 01:46:55.770 position:56%
And I must say I thank everyone here
for agreeing to -- several of you --

01:46:55.770 --> 01:46:59.380
to make the trip and
it's been touch and go

01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:00.830
for several of you to get here.

01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:02.130
I know that.

01:47:02.130 --> 01:47:05.640
But on every effort, I
mean you've made the effort

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:10.120
and I think your presence is
already making a huge difference.

01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:15.530
Our next speaker is Karen Hart from
Picturebooks from South Africa,

01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:17.560
while I'm speaking of
people who've made the trip.

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.510
Let's give her a hand.

01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:25.500
[ Applause ]

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:32.040
&gt;&gt; So, again, I'm going
to say thank you

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.100
for the opportunity for being here.

01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:37.010
It took me 18 hours
to get all the way

01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:40.620
to Washington, D.C.
and it is an honor.

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:45.440
I'm sending photos back as I'm
going along with my family that's

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.060
at home that's really
supported this project.

01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:53.620
And me being here today.

01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:55.740
So, we had to do for
the Deaf community

01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:59.150
in South Africa what
books couldn't do.

01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:02.650
Books are extraordinary
things, but if you are a person

01:48:02.650 --> 01:48:07.500
that doesn't have any language,
a book cannot tell you the story.

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:11.220
All you can do is imagine what is
happening in the pictures and make

01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:14.550
up your own if you have language.

01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:18.530
In South Africa, like many
other developing countries,

01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:21.170
we have a problem with
most of our -- sorry --

01:48:21.170 --> 01:48:26.980
most of our students get exposure
to language the very first time

01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:30.360
when they're walk in to
school with our grade one.

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.080
This means that our teachers
are sitting with students

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:36.540
that have never had any
exposure to language.

01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:38.660
And our government
expects our students

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:41.040
to follow exactly the
same curriculum

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:43.750
as our hearing students do.

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:46.560
But these are students
that have no language.

01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.790
So, my journey became a journey
that involved many more people

01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:56.410
and it was something that was
extremely unexpected for me.

01:48:56.410 --> 01:48:59.080
I created this small
application and went

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:02.540
and visited my local Deaf school
knowing absolutely nothing

01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:07.050 position:56%
about sign language and knowing that
I know nothing, I went to the people

01:49:07.050 --> 01:49:09.230
that I thought would
be able to help me

01:49:09.230 --> 01:49:12.420
and explain how all of this worked.

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:16.670 position:56%
Because I found out in South Africa,
our sign language was founded

01:49:16.670 --> 01:49:19.990
by British Sign Language,
South African Sign Language,

01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:24.770
English Sign Language and in
our other 11 official languages.

01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:28.290
And it was like a tower
that was falling over

01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:30.680
and no support for our community.

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:35.880
So, we had to go further and
see what we could do to create

01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.780
for our Deaf community to learn
the best way that they could.

01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:43.440
And we saw that a book
was not going to do that.

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.390
A paper book wasn't
going to do that.

01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:48.840
But a digital book can
because in a digital book,

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:52.010
we can replace pictures
with animations.

01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:54.740
And we can replace arrows

01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:59.390
of how sign language would
work, with actual videos.

01:49:59.390 --> 01:50:02.570
So, we could show students
what it really looks like.

01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:06.930
Just a simple thing,
the sign for J is this.

01:50:06.930 --> 01:50:10.090
If you don't understand what
that arrow means when you look

01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:13.080
at that little image, you
could get the letter wrong.

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:14.380
That's just a letter.

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:16.210
That's just the alphabet.

01:50:16.210 --> 01:50:17.840
We haven't even thought of words

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:24.120
and expressing ourselves
with sign language.

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:27.650
So, we had to look at another
way of presenting all of this.

01:50:27.650 --> 01:50:30.170
And we ended up with using iPads.

01:50:30.170 --> 01:50:32.730
And in a developing
countries, this was a stretch.

01:50:32.730 --> 01:50:34.860
Everybody said, "IPads?

01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.160
They're so expensive!

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:38.930
How can you do that?"

01:50:38.930 --> 01:50:43.080
And we sad, well, we need the
absolute best device that we can

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:45.930
because we cannot afford
for this project to fail.

01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:49.790
We cannot afford to worry about
the device that's not going

01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:54.680
to achieve the goal that we have
to because we have one shot.

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:57.210
And we started knocking on doors

01:50:57.210 --> 01:51:01.540
and we initially only got
funding for creating apps.

01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:05.980
We didn't have iPads and we
took the stance, if we build it,

01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:08.530
they will come [laughing].

01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:12.530
And we created our first two apps
without having iPads in the school

01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:17.020
and me having three lone iPads that
I would rent to the school and test

01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:21.560
and see if it was working if
we presented it the best way.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:24.500
And I've got a lot of
statistics that I put

01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:29.190
in my keynote presentation that
I can quickly skip through.

01:51:29.190 --> 01:51:30.490
I mean I'll show you what we built.

01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:33.310
But before I skip through
to what we've built,

01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:35.970
I just want to mention
a couple of things.

01:51:35.970 --> 01:51:39.340
Ninety percent of our Deaf kids
cannot speak to their parents.

01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:45.310
This means that these children
spend their whole lives living

01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:48.020
in a very, very small world.

01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:52.370 position:56%
And when they do get to our schools,
they get exposure to sign language

01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:56.330
but they also don't get any
exposure when they go home again.

01:51:56.330 --> 01:51:59.550
So, that language is only
spoken in school time

01:51:59.550 --> 01:52:01.480
or while they're in session.

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.280
Because most students
stay in hostiles.

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:05.700
So, there's very little
reinforcement at home

01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.000
with sign language as well.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.050
We don't have parental
involvement because a lot

01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:14.070
of our parents are
uneducated themselves.

01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:17.820
So, the only source of sign
language is at the school.

01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:21.170
I'm going to skip through to
show you what we've built.

01:52:21.170 --> 01:52:27.390
This is just a quote that I fond
and I think a lot of people think

01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:30.760
that people who are
Deaf, "they've got eyes,

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.060
they can read, they can write."

01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.730
but have you ever thought
of just the sound

01:52:34.730 --> 01:52:39.760
of A. It can be an A. It can
be an R. And we've been exposed

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:41.220
to those sounds in utero.

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:44.010
We start hearing when we
are 26 weeks in utero.

01:52:44.010 --> 01:52:47.000
We get exposure to our mom's voice

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.660
and language develops
from there onwards.

01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:51.730
For a Deaf child, they
never get that exposure

01:52:51.730 --> 01:52:55.050
to the auditory element of sound.

01:52:55.050 --> 01:52:59.830
And we forget how important sound
and languages and the auditory part

01:52:59.830 --> 01:53:02.690
of that to reading, to
understand how to read.

01:53:02.690 --> 01:53:08.090
You have to hear it to know what it
sounds like to be able to read it.

01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:10.690
So, when I started my journey,
I was one of those people.

01:53:10.690 --> 01:53:11.990
I had no idea.

01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:13.960
I didn't know that Deaf people
couldn't read and write.

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:16.750
I thought we're quickly going to
create an app, I'm going to put it

01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:19.720
on the app store and I'm going to
move on and create my other books.

01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:23.950
But the school entrapped
me, they entrapped my heart.

01:53:23.950 --> 01:53:29.950
And they've created a space where
I think I can do my life's work.

01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:33.270
These are some of the students at
Transylvania School for the Deaf.

01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:35.890
They are the most spirited
people I've ever seen.

01:53:35.890 --> 01:53:39.570
And don't ever think that a
Deaf school is a silent place.

01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:44.020
These children have got joy
and laughter and exuberance

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:47.810
and you can see it in
them playing outside.

01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:50.500
These are one of my
grade four students

01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.490
that we tested the books on.

01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:55.620
So, initially when we started out
with the books, we created books

01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:57.590
for grade four and five students.

01:53:57.590 --> 01:54:02.600
And my daughter who's hearing
was grade one at the time.

01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:07.590
And we were testing that with her
reading levels to see where we were

01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:10.650
on the scale of grade one, grade
four, between the reading and --

01:54:10.650 --> 01:54:15.120
between the hearing and
non-hearing students.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.950
And these students were struggling
with a grade one level book.

01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:20.830
So much so that they had
almost no comprehension

01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:23.040
of what they were reading if
we gave them a paper book.

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.720
But then we created these apps.

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.310
I can skip through all of this.

01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:30.780
You'll see this is the first time
they had exposure to the iPads.

01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:34.180
I literally went in with 30 iPads
that we put down in front of them

01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:36.530
and they had never
seen the books before,

01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:38.370
they'd never seen an iPad before.

01:54:38.370 --> 01:54:42.050
And we showed them where the home
button was and we opened the apps

01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:43.380
and they started exploring.

01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:46.580 position:56%
So much so that they found things
that I didn't think they would find.

01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:49.520
They found things like pinching
in and pinching out [laughing].

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:53.080
And I should have known because
these kids are gesture based.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:54.510
You know? They're going
to use their hands.

01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:59.970
They're going to use their skills
to communicate and find things.

01:54:59.970 --> 01:55:01.560
This is the book that we created.

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:04.600
And you'll see that the
book is in my home language

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:07.490
on the left side, in Afrikaans.

01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:11.810
And then on this side it is in
English and that is accompanied

01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:13.230
by South African Sign Language.

01:55:13.230 --> 01:55:16.710
So, this is a trilingual
book that we have created.

01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:18.350
We had to start with Afrikaans

01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:20.560
because the school
initially was only Afrikaans

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:23.890
and used Afrikaans
based sign language.

01:55:23.890 --> 01:55:27.630 position:56%
But then South African Sign Language
became recognized by the government

01:55:27.630 --> 01:55:32.390
and we had to transition from
Afrikaans based sign language

01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:34.830
to English and South
African Sign Language.

01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:38.440 position:56%
So, we created the books in both of
the languages for the older students

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:41.750
and the new younger students.

01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:46.110
So, I'm going to just play.

01:55:46.110 --> 01:55:47.470
&gt;&gt; The Big Carrot.

01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:48.770
&gt;&gt; And that's me [laughing].

01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:51.400
My person that was supposed to
narrate got lost and couldn't come

01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:54.150
to the day of the recording
so I had to do it.

01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:57.610
And, but we started out
by creating a picture --

01:55:57.610 --> 01:55:59.950
with animation introduction
of the characters.

01:55:59.950 --> 01:56:01.250
&gt;&gt; The farmer.

01:56:01.250 --> 01:56:02.550
The farmer's wife.

01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:05.320
&gt;&gt; You can just make
it a little bit -- ?

01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:06.630
&gt;&gt; They work very hard.

01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:10.340
&gt;&gt; And then over here the sign
language interpreter is telling the

01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:13.710
story in sign language, which
is a completely different syntax

01:56:13.710 --> 01:56:15.010
to English syntax.

01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:17.270
And the student can go back to that

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:20.100
and keep rewatching
it as they go along.

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:23.430
Those words, you'll see are
highlighted and if you touch them,

01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:27.960
it shows you both the sign
plus the object or the person

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:30.980
or the action plus the
word underneath it,

01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:33.110
plus the finger spelling
which is Deaf ABCs.

01:56:33.110 --> 01:56:38.770
And we found that this was the most
effective way to make that link

01:56:38.770 --> 01:56:41.630
between English and
sing language and create

01:56:41.630 --> 01:56:46.670
that bilingual environment for
students to see all of the elements

01:56:46.670 --> 01:56:51.220
at once and being able to go back
to it as many times as they needed.

01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:54.610 position:56%
We couldn't have this on an autoplay
where you could just start and play

01:56:54.610 --> 01:56:57.150
through because that's what's
happening with their reading.

01:56:57.150 --> 01:56:58.450
It's autoplay.

01:56:58.450 --> 01:57:01.840
They'll read through it, but
there's no comprehension.

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:05.570
By presenting it in this way,
students could go at their own pace

01:57:05.570 --> 01:57:07.370 position:56%
and they could work through the book

01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:11.020
and really absorb both
the sign language as well

01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:15.870
as the finger spelling as
well as the text spelling.

01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:20.080
And then make that connection
between the English syntax

01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:22.030
and the sign language syntax.

01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:26.150 position:56%
Just a simple example, we would say,
"The man is walking in the street."

01:57:26.150 --> 01:57:28.710
In sign language they would
say, "Man street walk."

01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:34.710 position:56%
So, when we have words in there like
"the" and "and" and "Up" and "wow!"

01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:36.010
and "oops!"

01:57:36.010 --> 01:57:39.430
those aren't words that
really exist in sign language

01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:43.240
and when they see those things,
they get stuck and they don't want

01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:44.540
to read because it's difficult

01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:45.920
because they don't
understand what it means.

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:50.320
And they don't understand what
context that word is used in.

01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:54.380
So, we had to place all of
that in context with a parallel

01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:58.240
of sign language, with a
parallel of English next to it.

01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.750
So, those were the
books that we created.

01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:05.750
I'm proud to say that we created
this with a very, very small team.

01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:10.890
We've had over 18,000 downloads
all over the world actually.

01:58:10.890 --> 01:58:12.190
I'm surprised.

01:58:12.190 --> 01:58:17.520 position:56%
We've got some in Kazakhstan,
Russia, Bermuda, Jamaica, Australia.

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:19.330
It's everywhere.

01:58:19.330 --> 01:58:22.940
And we've had a lot of interest
from the Pakistan government,

01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:27.540
the New Zealand Ministry for
the Deaf to create more books

01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:31.350
because this platform that
we've created, we can just slot

01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:34.370
in the different sign
language and use the stories

01:58:34.370 --> 01:58:38.420
that we've already created
and just put different text in

01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:40.320
and different sign language videos.

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:42.980
And the students all over the
world can get access to it.

01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:48.120
So, this is our little iDeaf
project that started just

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:51.280
as I couldn't walk away because
these students needed help.

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:53.400
Thank you so much for
this opportunity.

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:56.510
I don't know if I have the time.

01:58:56.510 --> 01:59:03.270
[ Applause ]

01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:04.570
&gt;&gt; You've used your time.

01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:05.870
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:13.770
&gt;&gt; So much of this hits home in
the word that we do in the Center

01:59:13.770 --> 01:59:15.900
for the Book as you can imagine.

01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:17.200
We have two networks.

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:22.120
We have a network that includes all
of the states of the United States.

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:24.750
These are reading and
literacy promoters

01:59:24.750 --> 01:59:29.330
that have come together often
in the state library but also

01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:32.400
in other organizations
to help us do our work

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:35.060
of stimulating public
interest in books,

01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:37.450
reading, literacy, and libraries.

01:59:37.450 --> 01:59:41.150
But our second network
is of organizations,

01:59:41.150 --> 01:59:45.330
non-profit organizations, that
already are involved in this work.

01:59:45.330 --> 01:59:48.080
And it changes frequently
project by project.

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:51.960
It isn't quite -- the state
Centers for the Book have to apply

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:56.260
to renew every three years to make
certain that we can keep an eye

01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:58.690
on how they're using the
Library of Congress's name.

01:59:58.690 --> 02:00:02.500
This is what the Library tells
me so I keep an eye on them.

02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:06.250 position:56%
And -- but we do good work together.

02:00:06.250 --> 02:00:10.340
But one of our groups that
we worked with before came

02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:12.780
to visit us yesterday
quite coincidentally

02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:19.590
with Karen's presentation and it's
the Literary Society for the Deaf.

02:00:19.590 --> 02:00:22.940
And it's an organization
that started with Gallaudet

02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:26.460
in Washington, D.C. and
they have regrouped.

02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:29.010
And we lost them for
a little while and --

02:00:29.010 --> 02:00:31.440
but we've agreed to do a project --

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.580
I mean a program with
them next April.

02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:38.240
And so that's one of the things I'd
like to talk to you and to Karen

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:42.420
and to others about because
it's what makes, you know,

02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:45.640
actually this category quite real.

02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:48.220
When you see the people
who are doing the work

02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:51.490
and you suddenly see a way
that one of us, you know,

02:00:51.490 --> 02:00:53.300
can move in a new direction.

02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:57.400
And so this is the kind of
goal I think that overall

02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:00.410
that we should all be
thinking about as we learn

02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:02.540
about each other's programs.

02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:07.710
Our next speaker is Zev
Lowe from Worldreader

02:01:07.710 --> 02:01:10.560
which is based in Barcelona, Spain.

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:15.510
Zev. Let's urge him on.

02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:18.500
[ Applause ]

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.650
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much, John.

02:01:24.650 --> 02:01:27.580
I'm so honored to be
here among all of you.

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:31.300
I also just flew here
from Barcelona yesterday,

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:36.660
but not quite as far
away as South Africa.

02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:42.710
So, really quickly, Worldreader's
mission is to provide every child

02:01:42.710 --> 02:01:47.750
and her family, particularly in
the global south, with the books

02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:50.480
that they need in order
to improve their lives.

02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:52.490
And we work digitally.

02:01:52.490 --> 02:01:56.950 position:56%
Since I think we're hardly alone
here in believing that it all starts

02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:59.640
with a book, so that's what
I want to talk about first.

02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:04.400
We've curated a large library
focused on the global south,

02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:09.490
which for us at the moment we're
focusing on sub-Saharan Africa

02:02:09.490 --> 02:02:11.670
and soon we're moving
into India as well.

02:02:11.670 --> 02:02:18.090 position:56%
But our Global Library has more than
28,000 book titles in 44 languages.

02:02:18.090 --> 02:02:23.280
And here are just some
examples of the book titles.

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:28.690
These are sort of grown up
general sort of literary books.

02:02:28.690 --> 02:02:32.230
There are also a lot
of children's books.

02:02:32.230 --> 02:02:36.300
My favorite one here is Wimbo
Wa Matatu The Matatu Song.

02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:38.160
Matatu's are mini buses in Kenya

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:40.620
that are their public
transportation.

02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:44.380 position:56%
And this is actually a bilingual
book that has a song that goes along

02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:46.250
with it, which I like quite a bit.

02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:50.760
Our books also include
textbooks and, as you can see,

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.120
these are not exactly textbooks

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:54.660
that you would find here
in the United States.

02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:57.010
But for our readers
they're the textbooks

02:02:57.010 --> 02:03:01.160
that are most useful
and immediate to them.

02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:06.020
And, yeah, more sort of general
fiction for adults as well

02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:08.750
as some books about STEM.

02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:10.990
So, you know, we love books.

02:03:10.990 --> 02:03:15.850
And we want to make these available
to as many people as possible.

02:03:15.850 --> 02:03:20.560
And so, we work digitally
primarily in two different ways.

02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:24.290
We have programs that are schools
and libraries using eReaders

02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:27.400
like the Kindle, which in the
five years that we have been

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.730
in existence have come down
in price pretty dramatically.

02:03:31.730 --> 02:03:33.030
And cell phones.

02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:36.010
Turns out that 80% of the
world's population has access

02:03:36.010 --> 02:03:37.310
to cell phones.

02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:41.030 position:56%
The Gate's Foundation says that more
people have access to cell phones

02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:44.880
than have access to toothbrushes.

02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:49.800
So, cell phones really
are absolutely everywhere.

02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:54.690
And we make our books available
through basic sort of future phones

02:03:54.690 --> 02:03:58.210
like those old Nokia brick phones.

02:03:58.210 --> 02:04:03.090
And so here's a picture
of one of our schools

02:04:03.090 --> 02:04:06.950
that is using our sort
of eReader program.

02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:10.140
In these programs, we don't
just provide the digital books.

02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:12.640
We also provide teacher training.

02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:16.710
We provide periodic assessments
and we encourage the schools

02:04:16.710 --> 02:04:19.250
in the training and
launch phase to make sure

02:04:19.250 --> 02:04:24.300
that they are setting aside time
and creating community engagement

02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:27.280
and basically insuring that
children will have safe spaces

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:31.840
in which they can read and spend
what we call time on task reading.

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:36.060
On cell phones, this is a
particularly nice picture just

02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:40.610
because it shows one of our
cell phone users reading.

02:04:40.610 --> 02:04:44.080
When the whole -- and you'll see
that the books that are popping

02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:47.680
up for that particular
reader have to do with Ebola.

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.810
One of the things that
we didn't realize was

02:04:49.810 --> 02:04:52.980
by making a giant library of
books available in the palm

02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:57.870
of people's hands, health would
actually be one of the most sort

02:04:57.870 --> 02:05:01.870 position:56%
of sought after categories of books.

02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:04.640
We see this among teenage
girls in Kenya

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:07.740
who all flock toward
reproductive health books.

02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:11.910
And we saw this in particular
during the Ebola crisis in Liberia

02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:17.050
where in a three month period, we
saw our users triple in Liberia.

02:05:17.050 --> 02:05:19.480
We started to put up -- we
just digitized sort of CDC,

02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:23.080
WHO materials, anything
that we could get out there,

02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:26.260
about how Ebola really spreads.

02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:28.530
You know, in what cases you
might actually be at risk

02:05:28.530 --> 02:05:29.990
and in what cases you're
not at risk.

02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:31.650
Just factual material.

02:05:31.650 --> 02:05:36.610
And in that first month 60,000
people had read those materials.

02:05:36.610 --> 02:05:40.140
So, we are still discovering
the potential

02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:43.320
of this new medium ourselves.

02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:48.420
But so far we're learning
quite a lot.

02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:50.860
Here's a really cool story
that I just wanted to tell you.

02:05:50.860 --> 02:05:55.330
We're working right now with Kenya
National Library Serves to scale

02:05:55.330 --> 02:05:58.710
up our digital reading
program to every single one

02:05:58.710 --> 02:06:04.300
of their 61 libraries, 61
public libraries nationwide.

02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:09.290
Before our program, they had
mobile libraries that were brought

02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:12.390 position:56%
around by donkeys, which I've always
thought is a really cool idea.

02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:15.450
But it turns out that it's
very complicated for librarians

02:06:15.450 --> 02:06:18.610
to also manage to keep
a stable of donkeys.

02:06:18.610 --> 02:06:20.660
The donkeys kept getting sick.

02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:23.200
It was really expensive to
keep having to buy their feed

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:27.410
and in addition to librarian
duties, to haul donkey feed

02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:29.560 position:56%
over to the donkeys and feed them --

02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:32.240
which is not something that I
actually thought about before.

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.850
But it turns out donkeys
are complicated.

02:06:33.850 --> 02:06:35.760
So, then they went
to a different model

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:39.690
where they had the donkey carts
but they would rent the donkeys.

02:06:39.690 --> 02:06:41.840
Well, it turns out that's
difficult too because donkeys tend

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:45.070
to be busy animals and the
people who own them have,

02:06:45.070 --> 02:06:46.600
you know, lots of work for them.

02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:50.390
So, you can't always get the
donkeys when you need the donkeys.

02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:54.360 position:56%
So, in providing the librarians with
digital books, this is one of them.

02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:56.380
His name is Kelvin Guma
[assumed spelling].

02:06:56.380 --> 02:07:00.220
His entire community now
refers to him as eReader,

02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:01.910
which we think is kind of funny.

02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:09.340
But he has a tote bag in which he
puts, you know, 20 or 30 eReaders

02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:11.200
and then he sits on the
back of a motorcycle

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:13.530
or actually now he's
got his own scooter,

02:07:13.530 --> 02:07:16.030
and goes out into rural communities

02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:20.940
and does mobile library outreach
programs in little huts like these

02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:24.160
as well as in tents
sometimes as well.

02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:25.800
So, no more donkeys.

02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:27.100
Sorry, donkeys.

02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:32.630
This is a quote from UNESCO.

02:07:32.630 --> 02:07:37.870
They released a report last year
called Reading in the Mobile Era,

02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:41.910
which was really sort of a
groundbreaking study that they did

02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:46.980
about mobile reading
through programs like ours.

02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:50.630
And what they said was, "If every
person on the planet understood

02:07:50.630 --> 02:07:55.220
that his or her mobile phone could
be transformed, easily and cheaply,

02:07:55.220 --> 02:08:00.360
into a library brimming with books,
access to text would cease to be

02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:02.930
such a daunting hurdle to literacy.

02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:06.570
An estimated 6.8 billion people
would have access to books."

02:08:06.570 --> 02:08:09.250
So, that's the quote that
I want to leave you with.

02:08:09.250 --> 02:08:13.860
And I can't really tell you about
our work nearly as well as one

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:17.700
of our library users can and since
we're in the Library of Congress,

02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:19.690
I thought it would only be fitting

02:08:19.690 --> 02:08:22.000
to show you this really quick
video of one of our users.

02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:38.780
&gt;&gt; Better kind of life
I was [inaudible].

02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:47.030
But because [inaudible] it's
changed my mind and today I'm here.

02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:49.340
I came from a poor family.

02:08:49.340 --> 02:09:00.500
We couldn't afford the basics
[inaudible] even a lot of things.

02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:06.660
I didn't have my own school.

02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:09.000
All of us [inaudible] shoes.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:17.420
We would share only one or
two books once in a while.

02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:23.830
I lost my dad.

02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:41.420
I lost my mom.

02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:49.970
They had died of AIDs
[inaudible] yes.

02:09:49.970 --> 02:10:12.350
I came to learn that I had only one
option in life [inaudible] digital.

02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:18.380
That was one option.

02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:19.680
Reading [inaudible].

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:20.990
I would read for hours
[inaudible] sense

02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:22.290
of understanding about
life [inaudible].

02:10:22.290 --> 02:10:23.590 position:56%
I was able to go to the [inaudible].

02:10:23.590 --> 02:10:24.890
And my teacher [inaudible].

02:10:24.890 --> 02:10:26.190
Even much more than I was
[inaudible] more information.

02:10:26.190 --> 02:10:27.490
The first time I had [inaudible]
that was my first encounter

02:10:27.490 --> 02:10:28.790
with the eReader and [inaudible].

02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:30.090
[Inaudible] a lot of material
that I couldn't find on the shelf.

02:10:30.090 --> 02:10:31.390
Even in the [inaudible].

02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:32.690
To [inaudible] in the
house, I read it.

02:10:32.690 --> 02:10:33.990
As [inaudible] I passed the safety
information [inaudible] the school.

02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:35.290
I'm very, very, very much excited
for students to use eReaders.

02:10:35.290 --> 02:10:36.590
eReaders [inaudible]
access and a lot more books

02:10:36.590 --> 02:10:37.890
than they have ever
seen [inaudible].

02:10:37.890 --> 02:10:39.190
I have a passion for teaching.

02:10:39.190 --> 02:10:40.490
I have a passion for
[inaudible] life.

02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:41.790
And [inaudible].

02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:43.090
[ Applause ]

02:10:56.090 --> 02:11:00.320
&gt;&gt; Our final speaker will
be Sister Mary M. Buckley

02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:04.920 position:56%
and she represents a -- is she here?

02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:13.600
A literacy education group in
the Dominican Republic and her --

02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:17.070
I'm going to ask her to pronounce
the name of her organization

02:11:17.070 --> 02:11:21.110
as it should be pronounced rather
than the way I would pronounce it.

02:11:21.110 --> 02:11:22.410
Please, Sister.

02:11:22.410 --> 02:11:24.210
Let's give her a hand.

02:11:24.210 --> 02:11:27.500
[ Applause ]

02:11:29.050 --> 02:11:35.510
&gt;&gt; I'm speaking for the Escuela
Santo Nino Jesus de Fe y Alegria

02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:39.190
in Santo Domingo of
the Dominican Republic.

02:11:39.190 --> 02:11:42.270
And I'm very very happy to be
here and I thank the Library

02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:44.770
of Congress for this opportunity.

02:11:44.770 --> 02:11:49.120
Actually, I'm standing in for
someone else who was standing

02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:52.020
in for someone in the
Dominican Republic.

02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:54.990
So, I'm a very last minute add-on.

02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:58.490
But it was really important
to me that one of us be here

02:11:58.490 --> 02:12:02.210
because I feel as if it's
an opportunity to speak

02:12:02.210 --> 02:12:06.940
for some children who are
both invisible and voiceless.

02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:11.390
And these are Haitian children
living in the Dominican Republic.

02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:17.530
Ours in particular are in Santo
Domingo in what's called a Batey.

02:12:17.530 --> 02:12:20.220
A Batey is like a Haitian ghetto.

02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:24.720
Originally Haitians came to work
in the sugarcane plantations.

02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:27.300
And when they were taken
over by the government,

02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:30.520
the Haitian lost their job
and they couldn't return

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:35.290
to Haiti nor were they
accepted into Dominican society.

02:12:35.290 --> 02:12:41.380 position:56%
So, they really were just left to be
forgotten in these Batey situations.

02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:44.350
Ours is called the Batey
Laturia [assumed spelling].

02:12:44.350 --> 02:12:46.340
I am a Catholic sister, a member

02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:51.780 position:56%
of an international community called
the Society of the Holy Child Jesus.

02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:57.430
And about 25 years ago, a few of
our sisters went to Santo Domingo

02:12:57.430 --> 02:13:00.220
and they looked around to
see what needed to be done

02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:04.090
and they were drawn to the
Haitians in this Batey.

02:13:04.090 --> 02:13:06.720 position:56%
And it all started with a container.

02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:12.500
You know, one of those big
container -- structures.

02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:14.720
And that became a library.

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:18.780
And little by little they began
to engage the children in learning

02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:22.580
to read and trying to do
something also with the parents.

02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:25.190
Now, these are the poorest
of the poor and they have

02:13:25.190 --> 02:13:27.980 position:56%
so many things working against them.

02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:31.190
So, it was a pretty
up-hill situation.

02:13:31.190 --> 02:13:35.190
But the container then
gradually became a school,

02:13:35.190 --> 02:13:37.300
Holy Child Montessori School.

02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:40.250
That's Escuela Santo
Nino Jesus in Spanish.

02:13:40.250 --> 02:13:45.510
And the Montessori school now has
about two, maybe three buildings

02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:49.850
at this point and about
450 children.

02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:52.910
The children come at the
age of three and they move

02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:57.780
on into the public school system
probably at the end of 4th grade.

02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:01.080
And the idea of the
Montessori school is

02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:05.930
to give the children the training,
the literacy, the discipline,

02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:08.180
all that they need
in order to be able

02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:11.290
to succeed in the public schools.

02:14:11.290 --> 02:14:12.950
So, it really -- it's working.

02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:14.520
As I said, it's up hill.

02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:16.450
It's very hard work.

02:14:16.450 --> 02:14:18.900
It also entails working
with the families.

02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:24.250
In fact, just last year, two of
our sisters from Nigeria went

02:14:24.250 --> 02:14:28.140
to the Dominican Republic, learned
enough Spanish to function --

02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:29.980
they're still working at that --

02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:34.180
but they now are working
with the women in the Batey.

02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:38.410
And part of that work will
be literacy education.

02:14:38.410 --> 02:14:41.890
So, it's a wonderful work.

02:14:41.890 --> 02:14:44.090
The needs are enormous.

02:14:44.090 --> 02:14:47.550
It's growing.

02:14:47.550 --> 02:14:51.510
It also entails training teachers,

02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:55.690
which is a rather aspect
of the whole endeavor.

02:14:55.690 --> 02:15:01.050
Our community is about 165 years
old and we have a long tradition

02:15:01.050 --> 02:15:05.680
of education, education
of children and of adults.

02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:08.170
So, teacher training
is in our blood.

02:15:08.170 --> 02:15:10.670
And our sisters there
have really been working

02:15:10.670 --> 02:15:13.880
at training the Dominican people

02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.780
to be effective teachers
in this Batey situation.

02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:24.120 position:56%
So, from a container to a Montessori
school, to teacher education,

02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:28.580
to further work then with
the adults in the Batey.

02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:32.260
That's been the trajectory
over these 25 years.

02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:33.560
And that's us.

02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:35.010
Thank you.
