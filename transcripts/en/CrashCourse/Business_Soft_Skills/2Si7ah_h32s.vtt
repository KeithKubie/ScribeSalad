00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.850
You know that moment when you’ve gone too
far down an internet rabbit hole?

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.840
You’re in the depths of Wikipedia, reading
a ridiculously long article about deep sea

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.080
fish… those things are so weird.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.490
Then, you look at the clock and SOMEHOW it’s
3 a.m.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.660
You’ve got a reading you didn’t do, a
test to finish cramming for, and class in

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.660
the morning.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.660
Or even a job!

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.450
And you wish you had managed your time just
a little bit better.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.990
Well, we’ve all been there.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.260
So, today, we’re going to give you strategies
to work more efficiently, delegate tasks,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.220
and manage your time better so you’re not
late, very late, for your very important dates.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.300
I’m Evelyn from the Internets.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.320
And this is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.680
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.000
There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to
time management.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.280
Remember: we’re not going to ask you to
change yourself to become a business robot.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.199
The first step to feeling in control of your
time is thinking about your working style,

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.470
your work, and even your personality.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.040
Maybe you like detailed schedules or have
a pretty structured job, like a secretary

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.190
or government employee.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.930
Or maybe you think regimented schedules are
suffocating and want the flexibility to work

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.930
on your own timeline.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.480
I mean, that’s why I quit my office job
and became a freelancer.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.820
So don’t listen to those management gurus
who say there’s only one way to make a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.010
daily schedule.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.510
Managing your day down to the minute with
a sticky note system and a productivity tracker

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.570
is just as valid as prioritizing big projects
and diving in.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.320
And you probably have a time of day that you
work best, too.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.141
Some people are morning larks who get up early
for yoga and a protein smoothie, and then

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:45.080
do their best work first thing.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.020
Some of us are night owls who would love to
sit in our pajamas until 11am, eating cereal

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.400
and watching Netflix, and do our best work
later in the day.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.990
Even though us night owls may not appreciate
chipper morning larks, and you morning larks

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.320
may assume we’re lazy, there’s nothing
wrong with either style.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.049
Work with who you are and what you got!

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.170
Do the super important stuff, like big presentation
prep, when you’re most productive.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.219
And do the low intensity stuff, like sending
daily emails, when you’re in slump time.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.599
No matter when or how you work, there are
ways to make the most out of your time and

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.700
stay focused.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.069
For one, always avoid multitasking.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.480
It’s a myth.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.299
You’re just switching inefficiently between
a lot of things.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.860
You’ll be distractible and probably end
up making messes when things could have been

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.860
simple.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.329
So to keep you from running around as mad
as a hatter or anxiously dwelling on what

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.159
you /might/ be forgetting to do, make a checklist.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.469
Put the important stuff first, and complete
things one at a time.

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.569
Once you find your flow, do what you can to
avoid interruptions.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.819
Even little ones snowball into big chunks
of time, and it takes longer to refocus than

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:51.819
you’d think.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.129
Say you’re hard at work and your roommate
offers you something to eat.

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.430
It might only take a minute to grab that snack,
but our brains are weird and don’t actually

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.489
get back to that peak concentration level
very easily.

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.319
This chunk of additional time is called the
disruption cost, and you may need something

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.170
like 15 minutes to get back into the zone.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.749
Now, you don’t need to disconnect from people
completely and hide in a cottage in the woods

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.269
like the March Hare or Ron Swanson.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.870
It may take a bit of coordination with your
coworkers, but if you can, go somewhere away

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.359
from that open-office floor plan for an hour
or two and unplug.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.159
I know it’s hard to disconnect from electronics,
because we give them so much attention every

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.159
single day.

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.120
You’ve got texts, DMs, and Facebook messages
coming in, plus reminders, and your work may

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.309
want you online for emails or Slack.

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:45.019
But you can limit those distractions by printing
out your reports or taking handwritten notes,

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.709
setting a certain amount of media minutes
each day, leaving your phone in airplane mode

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.809
for a bit, or using a screen blocker app.

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:56.040
Now, sometimes work is pretty straightforward
and specific to you, like writing a report.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.120
But you won’t always be able to work solo.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.620
No matter your job, you’ll eventually be
a team member or a leader.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.370
And if your to-do list has a bit of everything
and you’re spread too thin, prioritize your

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.019
tasks, and then strategically delegate things
that aren’t your specialty.

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.439
Think about it this way.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.310
With a little delegation, the Queen of Hearts
managed to get an entire garden repainted

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.900
in, like, 20 minutes.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.630
Despite her faults, she was an efficient
villain.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.060
But… you probably shouldn’t model your
people skills after her.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.980
So don’t delegate things that could seriously
burden other people, put them in an ethical

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.570
pickle, or encourage poor behavior.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.760
Remember setting SMART goals?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.910
Handing work off with ambiguous instructions,
like, “Do whatever it takes to meet our

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.430
sales target!”, could leave room for corners
to be cut.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.310
And don’t delegate something important just
because you don’t want to deal with it or,

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.770
“it’s not your job.”

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.570
Sometimes, yes, you could get a request that’s
out of line.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.500
But for the most part, if everyone said, “it’s
not my job,” a lot of important stuff just

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.500
wouldn’t get done.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.520
This avoidance is why HR departments end up
handling most sexual harassment claims alone,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.060
even though messages of support from leaders
and managers about what’s not okay in the

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.250
office go a long way.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.930
You should be thinking critically about why
you’re delegating tasks.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.780
So, if you’re the best person for the job
and you have time, give the work a shot.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.710
But if you’re bad at something or your teammate
would be a better fit, maybe pass it along.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.430
For instance, the designer in your office
could work on place settings for the next

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.150
company fundraising lunch, while you work
on the corporate guest list.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.050
You’ll accomplish more together if everyone’s
playing to their strengths.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.670
And if you can teach someone a skill, you’ll
demonstrate leadership, save yourself time

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.720
later, and make your team stronger.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.870
But if delegation isn’t cutting it and you
still feel like you have too much on your

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.330
plate, remember that you can say no to another
project.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.900
Okay, you can sometimes say no.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.090
There are times you’ve gotta do what you
gotta do, especially if you’re getting an

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.690
order that’s framed as a request or it’s
basically in your job description.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.060
If you’re a card soldier, you can’t say
no to standing guard.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.720
But when you do have the option, remember:
there’s only so much time in a day, and

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.150
you want to put your effort towards things
that matter.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.170
So an extra responsibility could give you
a chance to show your skills.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.520
But think about the time commitment, how important
it is, how good of a job you think you could

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.270
do, and if it helps meet any of your own goals.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.960
If you’re not hyped about it, then offer
a polite, “no thank you.”

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.140
Just don’t take too long to decide, because
whoever’s asking probably has a deadline

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.590
and needs to find someone else.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.980
If you say no, do it respectfully and directly.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.700
Thank them for thinking of you, and maybe
throw in another way you can help them out,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.210
or name-drop someone who can.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.440
To see how you can thoughtfully manage your
responsibilities, let’s go to the Thought

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440
Bubble.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.820
Let’s say you’re in charge of planning
a Fall Fair for your small town.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.620
It’s a big event, so you’ve got a super
long checklist of things to do.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.310
Luckily, you’ve got a talented team, so
you can delegate some of those tasks.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.300
You don’t want to dump random things on
people’s plates, and you know that sometimes

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.680
people have skills that may surprise you.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.690
So during the next team meeting, you ask everyone
to tell you where they’d be the best fit.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.950
Together, you divvy up responsibilities.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.930
You’re in charge of vendors and sponsors.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.370
Your financially savvy friend is keeping track
of the budget.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.480
And it turns out that one of your friends
does graphic design on the side, so she’s

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.760
making the flyers and posters.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.520
With more of the work spread across the team,
you’re still really busy, but you’re

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.750
definitely less stressed.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.020
So when another friend asks you to help plan
the annual fundraising breakfast for the local

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.350
police force, you want to say yes.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.730
The event is super important to her, and she
makes a mean waffle.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.040
You’re happy she trusts your planning skills,
but you’re afraid that one more task will

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.140
turn your perfectly planned calendar upside
down.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.400
After you sleep on it, you tell her that you’re
flattered she asked, and you’re passionate

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.350
about the cause, but you don’t have time
to take on another event.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.870
Then, you suggest that she give your super
meticulous sister a call, since she’s an

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.990
expert planner during a crisis.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.690
Your sister’s got the time and even convinces
her boyfriend to help out!

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.340
Now, you’re not overcommitted and distracted
by extra responsibilities, and your friend

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.580
has the help she needs.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.580
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.050
It’s easy to overestimate how much time
something is going to take and accidentally

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.270
take on too much.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.250
It happens whether you're working a 9-to-5
office job, freelance gigs, or some sort of

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.460
combo.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.240
So if you’re struggling to figure out what
you really have time for or what projects

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.110
you should say no to, try using a calendar.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.470
After you’ve mapped out your current schedule,
pencil in projects you want to take on and

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.470
their deadlines.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.530
That way you can visualize how busy you actually
are.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.669
Then, you can use your SMART goals to figure
out your priorities, and cut what isn’t

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.669
important.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:44.610
Don’t put off projects you really care about
until “the right time.”

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.610
Guess what?

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.100
You’re always busy.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.480
Now is the right time!

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.959
But also remember to pencil in time for you.

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:54.610
The key to good quality work is feeling good.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.990
If you spread yourself too thin, you won’t
be doing anyone a favor.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.649
I know I sound like your Internet Mom right
now but…

00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:02.380
You need to get close to 8 hours of sleep.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:08.200
Just because you’ve heard that successful
people get up at 4am doesn’t mean you should.

00:09:08.209 --> 00:09:12.160
Really tired insomniacs who can’t focus
get up at 4am too.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.029
So get the rest your body needs.

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:17.920
And the last thing you probably want to do
when you’re overwhelmed is hit the gym,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.760
but exercise can help you destress and keep
your brain working smoothly.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.620
If you sacrifice your sleep, healthy eating,
social time, or anything else that’s important

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.960
to you... you’ll feel worse, do worse work,
and spend more time worrying... and probably crying.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.800
Take care of yourself!

00:09:34.809 --> 00:09:39.439
Perfect is the enemy of good, and if you find
yourself stressing, don’t overthink it.

00:09:39.439 --> 00:09:42.309
It’s probably great, and it’s time to
put down the pencil.

00:09:42.309 --> 00:09:46.740
Aaand... with that, we’ve
officially used up all our time on time.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.839
So don’t forget:

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:51.639
Figure out what works for you, because we’re
all different!

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.160
But multitasking isn’t real.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.640
Delegate what you can, and do it thoughtfully.

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:05.040
Prioritize your tasks by using a checklist
and use a calendar to see what’s important.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.509
It’s better to do high quality work over
high quantity, so it’s okay to respectfully

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:11.509
say no.

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:16.300
We know you’re making important decisions
on college, jobs, and just life in general.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.860
So next time, we’ll be talking about how
to avoid thought traps and make effective

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.860
decisions.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.499
Crash Course Business is sponsored by Google and it’s made with the help of all

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:28.220
these nice people and Thought Cafe is our
amazing animation team.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.619
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:10:30.619 --> 00:10:34.829
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:40.139
channels like SciShow Psych, where hosts Hank
Green and Brit Garner explore the complex

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:41.750
science of the human brain.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.600
Also, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.160
the series at Patreon; a crowdfunding platform
that allows you to support the content you

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160
love.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.520
