00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.980
used as a regular phone so make sure
that your apps are respecting both of

that your apps are respecting both of
these configurations finally

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370
these configurations finally

these configurations finally
multitasking this is one of those fields

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229
multitasking this is one of those fields
 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.760
multitasking this is one of those fields
which is gaining more importance with

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770
which is gaining more importance with
 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.879
which is gaining more importance with
these devices a lot of times you will

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889
these devices a lot of times you will
 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.800
these devices a lot of times you will
see that these devices are coming out

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810
see that these devices are coming out
 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.040
see that these devices are coming out
with nearly square form factor or very

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050
with nearly square form factor or very
 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.820

close to it
 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.330
close to it
what that means is that you can run to

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340
what that means is that you can run to
 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.290
what that means is that you can run to
18 by 9 windows next to each other side

18 by 9 windows next to each other side
by side so when you are multitasking

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460
by side so when you are multitasking
 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.249
by side so when you are multitasking
you're multitasking between almost 2

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259
you're multitasking between almost 2

these new opportunities now speaking

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:23.779
these new opportunities now speaking
 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.140
these new opportunities now speaking
about new aspect ratios this is

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150
about new aspect ratios this is
 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.850
about new aspect ratios this is
something that we definitely encourage

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860
something that we definitely encourage
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.489
something that we definitely encourage
you to pay attention to you are probably

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:30.499
you to pay attention to you are probably
 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:32.980
you to pay attention to you are probably
already very familiar with aspect ratios

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990
already very familiar with aspect ratios
 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.010
already very familiar with aspect ratios
like 16 by 9 or 18 by 9 now with these

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020
like 16 by 9 or 18 by 9 now with these
 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.999
like 16 by 9 or 18 by 9 now with these
devices

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009
devices
 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.820
devices
start thinking about new aspect ratios

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830
start thinking about new aspect ratios
 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.629
start thinking about new aspect ratios
which can go as high as 21 is 2 9 or

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639
which can go as high as 21 is 2 9 or
 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.839
which can go as high as 21 is 2 9 or
even beyond and on the other hand then

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849
even beyond and on the other hand then
 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.779
even beyond and on the other hand then
they can go as small as 1 is to 1 like

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789
they can go as small as 1 is to 1 like
 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.749
they can go as small as 1 is to 1 like
almost square displays so we really

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759
almost square displays so we really
 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.969
almost square displays so we really
encourage you to think about how your

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979
encourage you to think about how your
 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.059
encourage you to think about how your
apps are going to look like across all

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069
apps are going to look like across all
 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.959
apps are going to look like across all
of these different aspect ratios now we

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969
of these different aspect ratios now we
 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.749
of these different aspect ratios now we
understand that for some reason you may

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759
understand that for some reason you may
 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.550
understand that for some reason you may
feel that these extreme aspect ratios do

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560
feel that these extreme aspect ratios do
 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.860
feel that these extreme aspect ratios do
not provide the right kind of experience

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870
not provide the right kind of experience
 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.040
not provide the right kind of experience
for your users so we already have the

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050
for your users so we already have the
 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.920
for your users so we already have the
max aspect ratio attribute that you can

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930
max aspect ratio attribute that you can
 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.379
max aspect ratio attribute that you can
use to limit like you know how big it

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389
use to limit like you know how big it
 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.079
use to limit like you know how big it
can go we are also introducing in

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:26.089
can go we are also introducing in
 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:29.230
can go we are also introducing in
Android q a min aspect ratio attribute

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240
Android q a min aspect ratio attribute
 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.839
Android q a min aspect ratio attribute
so this allows you to have a true

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849
so this allows you to have a true
 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.209
so this allows you to have a true
control over exactly how your apps are

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219
control over exactly how your apps are
 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.070
control over exactly how your apps are
going to look like across all the

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080
going to look like across all the
 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.809
going to look like across all the
different range of devices that you're

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819
different range of devices that you're
 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.460
different range of devices that you're
gonna see now

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470

talking about screens we are introducing
a change which is more like a

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200
a change which is more like a
 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.610

clarification in Android q to make sure

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620
clarification in Android q to make sure
 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.370
clarification in Android q to make sure
that every display that comes out with

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380
that every display that comes out with
 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.350

now this is important because if we want

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790
now this is important because if we want
 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.180
now this is important because if we want
to make sure that you have enough space

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190

how you can make sure that your apps

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610
how you can make sure that your apps
 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.690
how you can make sure that your apps
work well on these new form factors one

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:35.700
work well on these new form factors one
 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.250
work well on these new form factors one
of the important things you can do is

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.260
of the important things you can do is
 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.230
of the important things you can do is
ensure that your app supports app

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240
ensure that your app supports app
 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.740
ensure that your app supports app
continuity so what is that really it's

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:42.750
continuity so what is that really it's
 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.390
continuity so what is that really it's
what we call the concept of being able

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400
what we call the concept of being able
 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.940
what we call the concept of being able
to seamlessly like have your app

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:46.950
to seamlessly like have your app
 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.680
to seamlessly like have your app
seamlessly change between the fold at

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:48.690
seamlessly change between the fold at
 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.990
seamlessly change between the fold at
the unfold States without losing any

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000
the unfold States without losing any
 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.400
the unfold States without losing any
state of the user so in this example

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:55.410
state of the user so in this example
 

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.980
state of the user so in this example
here you might have a video player if

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:57.990
here you might have a video player if
 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.080
here you might have a video player if
the user is watching a video and they

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.090
the user is watching a video and they
 

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.970
the user is watching a video and they
fold or unfold they don't want to lose

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:01.980
fold or unfold they don't want to lose
 

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.440
fold or unfold they don't want to lose
that state like they won't still want a

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.450
that state like they won't still want a
 

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.510
that state like they won't still want a
look at the same video and playback

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520
look at the same video and playback
 

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.350
look at the same video and playback
shouldn't interrupt so on a technical

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360
shouldn't interrupt so on a technical
 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.210
shouldn't interrupt so on a technical
level what this really comes down to is

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220
level what this really comes down to is
 

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.180
level what this really comes down to is
handling configuration changes folding

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:14.190
handling configuration changes folding
 

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.920
handling configuration changes folding
and unfolding is really nothing other

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:15.930
and unfolding is really nothing other
 

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.930
and unfolding is really nothing other
than the screen size in the

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:17.940
than the screen size in the
 

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.320
than the screen size in the
configuration changing and this is

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:21.330
configuration changing and this is
 

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.450
configuration changing and this is
existed on Android for a while now we

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.460
existed on Android for a while now we
 

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.740
existed on Android for a while now we
have a great developer guide on our

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:24.750
have a great developer guide on our
 

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.530
have a great developer guide on our
website on developer of Android to come

website on developer of Android to come
 

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.590
website on developer of Android to come
and it goes into a lot of detail on what

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:30.600
and it goes into a lot of detail on what
 

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.180
and it goes into a lot of detail on what
to do and how to handle those

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.190
to do and how to handle those
 

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.219
to do and how to handle those
configuration changes but sort of the

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:36.229
configuration changes but sort of the
 

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:38.510
configuration changes but sort of the
most important things to look out for

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520
most important things to look out for
 

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.670
most important things to look out for
are that you always choose the right

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680
are that you always choose the right
 

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.140
are that you always choose the right
layout when a configuration change

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.150
layout when a configuration change
 

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.050
layout when a configuration change
happens to really take advantage of the

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060
happens to really take advantage of the
 

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.570
happens to really take advantage of the
added screen real estate or properly fit

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:47.580
added screen real estate or properly fit
 

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.510
added screen real estate or properly fit
it if the screen size reduces when you

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:50.520
it if the screen size reduces when you
 

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.330

fold the device back closed

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:53.340
fold the device back closed
 

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.250

and another thing you really need to pay

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260
and another thing you really need to pay
 

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.590
and another thing you really need to pay
attention to is restoring state that the

positions in scroll layouts or something

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240
positions in scroll layouts or something
 

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.480
positions in scroll layouts or something
like the current page in a viewpager or

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:05.490
like the current page in a viewpager or
 

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.700
like the current page in a viewpager or
where the user currently is in a tab

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:07.710
where the user currently is in a tab

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:11.400
navigation and also really make sure to
 

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.340
navigation and also really make sure to
not drop any input the user has already

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.350
not drop any input the user has already
 

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.180
not drop any input the user has already

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.240
 
let's also talk a bit more about Android

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.250
let's also talk a bit more about Android
 

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.850
let's also talk a bit more about Android
resizable activity so this is a manifest

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860
resizable activity so this is a manifest
 

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.800
resizable activity so this is a manifest
flag that we introduced together with

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:30.810
flag that we introduced together with
 

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.020
flag that we introduced together with
multi window support quite a while ago

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.030
multi window support quite a while ago
 

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.860
multi window support quite a while ago
and it indicates whether an activity can

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:36.870
and it indicates whether an activity can
 

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.170
and it indicates whether an activity can
run in a different configuration than

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.180
run in a different configuration than
 

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.950
run in a different configuration than
what the local screen configuration is

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:41.960
what the local screen configuration is
 

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.210
what the local screen configuration is
and when you think about it it's really

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220
and when you think about it it's really
 

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.190
and when you think about it it's really
required for multi window right because

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200
required for multi window right because
 

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.290
required for multi window right because
your app might not occupy the whole

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.300
your app might not occupy the whole
 

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.070
your app might not occupy the whole
screen and so it needs to experience a

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080
screen and so it needs to experience a
 

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.570
screen and so it needs to experience a
smaller configuration than the whole

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580
smaller configuration than the whole
 

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.200
smaller configuration than the whole
screen the name is a bit unfortunate

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:57.210
screen the name is a bit unfortunate
 

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.360
screen the name is a bit unfortunate
however because even if you set this to

00:09:59.360 --> 00:09:59.370
however because even if you set this to
 

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.820
however because even if you set this to
false it doesn't mean that you never

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:01.830
false it doesn't mean that you never
 

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.830
false it doesn't mean that you never
experience the resize in your activity

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:03.840
experience the resize in your activity
 

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.440
experience the resize in your activity
because the orientation of the display

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:06.450
because the orientation of the display
 

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.470
because the orientation of the display
might change or now refold balls also

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480
might change or now refold balls also
 

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.780
might change or now refold balls also
the effective screen size might change

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:11.790
the effective screen size might change
 

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.720
the effective screen size might change
and you still need to handle that so

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:14.730
and you still need to handle that so
 

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.550
and you still need to handle that so
even if you set two resizable activity

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560
even if you set two resizable activity
 

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.500
even if you set two resizable activity
to false make sure that your test

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.510
to false make sure that your test
 

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.750
to false make sure that your test
configuration changes even with such

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760
configuration changes even with such
 

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.790
configuration changes even with such
activities now there's one case were

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800
activities now there's one case were
 

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.010
activities now there's one case were
previous to foldable phones we didn't

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.020
previous to foldable phones we didn't

really expose your activities to Orion

or to configuration changes ever and
that was for orientation locked

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.150
that was for orientation locked
 

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.660
that was for orientation locked
activities that are also not resizable

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:38.670
activities that are also not resizable
 

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.470
activities that are also not resizable
so don't support multi window and for

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480
so don't support multi window and for
 

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.240
so don't support multi window and for
those activities we are introducing a

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.250
those activities we are introducing a
 

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.540
those activities we are introducing a
new compatibility mode in Android Q

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:46.550
new compatibility mode in Android Q
 

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.060
new compatibility mode in Android Q

recommend that you avoid falling into

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:08.790
recommend that you avoid falling into
 

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.660
recommend that you avoid falling into
this case and support multi-window by

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:11.670
this case and support multi-window by
 

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.270
this case and support multi-window by
setting resizable activity to fall to

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:14.280
setting resizable activity to fall to
 

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:20.240

true alright so speaking of multi-window

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.250
true alright so speaking of multi-window
 

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.180
true alright so speaking of multi-window
on these form factors with the increased

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:23.190
on these form factors with the increased
 

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.320
on these form factors with the increased
screen size

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:24.330
screen size
 

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.200
screen size
it's like multi-window is really getting

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.210
it's like multi-window is really getting
 

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.300
it's like multi-window is really getting
more important to take advantage of all

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:29.310
more important to take advantage of all
 

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.330
more important to take advantage of all
that screen space and so i'd also like

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:32.340
that screen space and so i'd also like
 

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.490
that screen space and so i'd also like
to take a bit talk a bit more about what

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500
to take a bit talk a bit more about what
 

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.470
to take a bit talk a bit more about what
changes we made and how to take best

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480
changes we made and how to take best
 

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.500
changes we made and how to take best
advantage of that in android q like one

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:42.510
advantage of that in android q like one
 

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.180
advantage of that in android q like one
of the biggest multi window changes is

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:44.190
of the biggest multi window changes is
 

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.080
of the biggest multi window changes is
the introduction of multi resume and so

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.090
the introduction of multi resume and so
 

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.880
the introduction of multi resume and so
to change from previous version of

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:49.890
to change from previous version of
 

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.700
to change from previous version of
androids is that previously only at most

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:52.710
androids is that previously only at most
 

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.950
androids is that previously only at most
one activity could be resumed at the

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:54.960
one activity could be resumed at the
 

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.830
one activity could be resumed at the
same time I was not really indicated to

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:57.840
same time I was not really indicated to
 

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.780
same time I was not really indicated to
user which one that is and so it got a

00:11:59.780 --> 00:11:59.790
user which one that is and so it got a
 

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.660
user which one that is and so it got a
bit confusing if you know one activity

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:02.670
bit confusing if you know one activity
 

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.000
bit confusing if you know one activity
might react a bit differently than

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.010
might react a bit differently than
 

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.560
might react a bit differently than
another even though it looks totally the

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:06.570
another even though it looks totally the
 

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.530
another even though it looks totally the
same and it was also one more state you

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540
same and it was also one more state you
 

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.000
same and it was also one more state you
have to worry about as a developer

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.010
have to worry about as a developer
 

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.460
have to worry about as a developer
without really gaining anything so to

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:13.470
without really gaining anything so to
 

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.980
without really gaining anything so to
simplify things starting with Android Q

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:15.990
simplify things starting with Android Q
 

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.500

focusable activities resumed so in this

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:21.420
focusable activities resumed so in this
 

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.100

three activities are in the original
 

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.150
three activities are in the original
state in this situation on Android q

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160

once the camera becomes available again
also to notice that even if you disable

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720
also to notice that even if you disable
 

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.100
also to notice that even if you disable

with multi display devices you might
 

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.700
with multi display devices you might
actually even have resumed activity on a

a new call back to activity which tells
 

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.120
a new call back to activity which tells
you about the top Drizzy on state and

you about the top Drizzy on state and
 

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.440
you about the top Drizzy on state and
that really just corresponds to what

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:08.450
that really just corresponds to what

the process of doing so what we've done
 

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.510
the process of doing so what we've done
is we've created this sequence of steps

is we've created this sequence of steps
 

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.340
is we've created this sequence of steps
where we've iteratively improved the

successive platform and with each new
 

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.250
successive platform and with each new
platform that we add we then are able to

platform that we add we then are able to
 

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.710
platform that we add we then are able to
leverage and build upon the improvements

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720
leverage and build upon the improvements
 

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.850
leverage and build upon the improvements
from the previous ones when Android apps

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860
from the previous ones when Android apps
 

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.760
from the previous ones when Android apps
first launched on Chrome OS we knew that

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:22.770
first launched on Chrome OS we knew that
 

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.650
first launched on Chrome OS we knew that
we wanted to be there because it was

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660
we wanted to be there because it was
 

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.760
we wanted to be there because it was
where people were using apps it was you

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:28.770
where people were using apps it was you
 

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.580
where people were using apps it was you
know Chrome OS has had breakaway success

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:31.590
know Chrome OS has had breakaway success
 

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.410
know Chrome OS has had breakaway success
in the education market it is now a

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420
in the education market it is now a
 

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.530
in the education market it is now a
market leader for laptops and so we

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540
market leader for laptops and so we
 

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.880
market leader for laptops and so we
wanted to be there to where our users

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:37.890
wanted to be there to where our users
 

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.700
wanted to be there to where our users
are and we wanted to provide a seamless

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:40.710
are and we wanted to provide a seamless
 

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.460
are and we wanted to provide a seamless
experience that provided a responsive

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:43.470
experience that provided a responsive
 

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.050
experience that provided a responsive
layout and allowed us to take advantage

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060
layout and allowed us to take advantage
 

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.430
layout and allowed us to take advantage
of the optimizations and the design

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440
of the optimizations and the design
 

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.590
of the optimizations and the design
layout that we've done continue to use

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600
layout that we've done continue to use
 

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.700
layout that we've done continue to use
the larger real estate available on

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:55.710
the larger real estate available on
 

00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.980
the larger real estate available on
tablet devices so what that necessitated

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:00.990
tablet devices so what that necessitated
 

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.640
tablet devices so what that necessitated
for us

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:01.650
for us
 

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.130
for us
was to make use of resizable activity

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140
was to make use of resizable activity
 

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.470
was to make use of resizable activity
and to allow our activity to be

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480
and to allow our activity to be
 

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:12.030
and to allow our activity to be
recreated

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:12.040
 
 

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.520
 
so one of the challenges that we

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:14.530
so one of the challenges that we
 

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.170
so one of the challenges that we
encountered was that in the process of

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:16.180
encountered was that in the process of
 

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.270
encountered was that in the process of
allowing our activity to be recreated we

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280
allowing our activity to be recreated we
 

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.949
allowing our activity to be recreated we
discovered that well the very first

00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959
discovered that well the very first
 

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:22.560
discovered that well the very first
thing that happened was it crashed and

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:22.570
thing that happened was it crashed and
 

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.210
thing that happened was it crashed and
this happened as a result of us

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:24.220
this happened as a result of us
 

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.000
this happened as a result of us
depending on config changes Flags in the

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.010
depending on config changes Flags in the
 

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.990
depending on config changes Flags in the
manifest so what would happen is we try

framework handle it for us what we did
 

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.260

to resolve that issue was to remove

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960
manifests refactor our code so that we
 

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.600

instead we allowed the framework to do

instead we allowed the framework to do

it didn't you know expose another issue
 

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.320
it didn't you know expose another issue
for us and that issue was that

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.330
for us and that issue was that

effect of some assumptions that we'd

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.230
effect of some assumptions that we'd
 

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.040
effect of some assumptions that we'd
made about the activity lifecycle that

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.050
made about the activity lifecycle that
 

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.890
made about the activity lifecycle that
actually didn't hold true in practice so

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:46.900
actually didn't hold true in practice so
 

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.270
actually didn't hold true in practice so
we had to go back and we had to

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280
we had to go back and we had to
 

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.060
we had to go back and we had to
re-examine these assumptions and rectify

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:51.070
re-examine these assumptions and rectify
 

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.340
re-examine these assumptions and rectify
them in our code and once we did we were

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:53.350
them in our code and once we did we were
 

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.760
them in our code and once we did we were
able to deliver a an experience that was

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:56.770
able to deliver a an experience that was
 

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.350
able to deliver a an experience that was
a reflowable adaptive experience that

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360
a reflowable adaptive experience that
 

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.720
a reflowable adaptive experience that
took advantage of the real estate

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:03.730
took advantage of the real estate
 

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.730
took advantage of the real estate
available on the device based on the

the big lessons and the big takeaways

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:13.150
the big lessons and the big takeaways
 

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.230
the big lessons and the big takeaways
was really we just need to get out of

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240
was really we just need to get out of
 

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.690
was really we just need to get out of
our own way and let the framework do

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:18.700
our own way and let the framework do
 

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.180
our own way and let the framework do
what it does best in the case of

activity resizing we need to stop trying
 

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.330
activity resizing we need to stop trying
to handle

that you're making around things like
activity life cycles and be aware of the

really slow but if you were to ask me

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:09.850
really slow but if you were to ask me

absolutely anything so the way we

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.130
absolutely anything so the way we
 

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.000
absolutely anything so the way we
approach this is

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.010
approach this is
 

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.950
approach this is
we try to develop for something we call

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960
we try to develop for something we call
 

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.049
we try to develop for something we call
a device unknown device unknown means we

00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059
a device unknown device unknown means we
 

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:31.549
a device unknown device unknown means we
can make no assumption about the device

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559
can make no assumption about the device
 

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:35.650
can make no assumption about the device
we're targeting device unknown has any

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:35.660
we're targeting device unknown has any
 

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.820
we're targeting device unknown has any
resolution and all resolutions at the

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:37.830
resolution and all resolutions at the
 

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.760
resolution and all resolutions at the
same time even the resolution can even

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:40.770
same time even the resolution can even
 

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:44.360
same time even the resolution can even
change at runtime dynamically and the

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:44.370
change at runtime dynamically and the
 

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.390
change at runtime dynamically and the
way we'll do that is our editor would

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400
way we'll do that is our editor would
 

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.240
way we'll do that is our editor would
allow game designers to anchor different

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:50.250
allow game designers to anchor different
 

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.220
allow game designers to anchor different
UI elements the different to each other

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:52.230
UI elements the different to each other
 

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:57.049
UI elements the different to each other
to the screen edges and whatnot and even

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059
to the screen edges and whatnot and even
 

00:21:57.059 --> 00:21:59.299
to the screen edges and whatnot and even
allow them to resize it in real time so

00:21:59.299 --> 00:21:59.309
allow them to resize it in real time so
 

00:21:59.309 --> 00:22:01.039
allow them to resize it in real time so
they can preview what the game looks

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:01.049
they can preview what the game looks
 

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:02.960
they can preview what the game looks
like at different resolutions as they're

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:02.970
like at different resolutions as they're
 

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.669
like at different resolutions as they're
editing it and this allows them to be

00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679
editing it and this allows them to be
 

00:22:04.679 --> 00:22:07.070
editing it and this allows them to be
creative while the engine takes care of

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080
creative while the engine takes care of
 

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.150
creative while the engine takes care of
all of the grunt work behind the scenes

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:10.160
all of the grunt work behind the scenes
 

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.900
all of the grunt work behind the scenes
this unknown device also has different

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:14.910
this unknown device also has different
 

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.090
this unknown device also has different
input types as keyboard it has mouse

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100
input types as keyboard it has mouse
 

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.270
input types as keyboard it has mouse
which is single touch like it's a single

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280
which is single touch like it's a single
 

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.840
which is single touch like it's a single
input as opposed to multi-touch

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:22.850

we tried to support everything and the

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:30.330
we tried to support everything and the
 

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.730
we tried to support everything and the
way we do this is we try to guess the

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740
way we do this is we try to guess the
 

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.210
way we do this is we try to guess the
users intent - based on what he's where

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.220
users intent - based on what he's where
 

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.490
users intent - based on what he's where
he is in the game at the time along with

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500
he is in the game at the time along with
 

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.289
he is in the game at the time along with
the different components that are

00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299
the different components that are
 

00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:40.970
the different components that are
connected to the device so for example

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980
connected to the device so for example
 

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.710
connected to the device so for example
if he has a controller connected and

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720
if he has a controller connected and
 

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.810
if he has a controller connected and
he's in a race chances are he's gonna

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820
he's in a race chances are he's gonna
 

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.980
he's in a race chances are he's gonna
want to use it to play the game we also

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:48.990
want to use it to play the game we also
 

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.630
want to use it to play the game we also
assume that everything is dynamic we

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640
assume that everything is dynamic we
 

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.120
assume that everything is dynamic we
have no idea what hardware specs are

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.130
have no idea what hardware specs are
 

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.940
have no idea what hardware specs are
actually around the device we have for

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:55.950
actually around the device we have for
 

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.370
actually around the device we have for
example different GPUs different CPU

frequencies different amounts of memory
 

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.460
frequencies different amounts of memory
and the way we do that is will detect

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:04.470
and the way we do that is will detect
 

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.159
and the way we do that is will detect
all the specs put it all together do

00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:07.169
all the specs put it all together do
 

00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:09.680

what effects should be turned on and off
or the texture level that we should be

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:17.270
or the texture level that we should be
 

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.480

allows us to have the high-end devices

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380
allows us to have the high-end devices
 

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.340
allows us to have the high-end devices
at top quality while the lower end

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:25.350
at top quality while the lower end
 

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.110

devices will still have super good

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120
devices will still have super good
 

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:33.650
devices will still have super good
response and a good FPS when is the same

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:33.660
response and a good FPS when is the same
 

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.480
response and a good FPS when is the same
apk basically that's running on all the

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:35.490
apk basically that's running on all the
 

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:39.230
apk basically that's running on all the
devices and the final step is that

everything is dynamic so we have no idea

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:42.530
everything is dynamic so we have no idea
 

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.870
everything is dynamic so we have no idea
what the screen size is we can't assume

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880
what the screen size is we can't assume
 

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.400
what the screen size is we can't assume
that the screen size at the beginning

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:46.410
that the screen size at the beginning
 

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.140
that the screen size at the beginning
will be the same as at the end we have

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:48.150
will be the same as at the end we have
 

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.909
will be the same as at the end we have
no idea when its user will plug

00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919
no idea when its user will plug

something into the device at hand and of
 

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.990
something into the device at hand and of
course we're wrong and we know that

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000
course we're wrong and we know that
 

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.280
course we're wrong and we know that
because there's no way to do all this so

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:58.290
because there's no way to do all this so
 

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.930
because there's no way to do all this so
will will always allow the user to go

00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940
will will always allow the user to go
 

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.030
will will always allow the user to go
into the game settings and go and change

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:02.040
into the game settings and go and change
 

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.700
into the game settings and go and change
his input method or whatever so

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:04.710
his input method or whatever so
 

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.310
his input method or whatever so
basically our takeaway here was you can

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320
basically our takeaway here was you can
 

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.500
basically our takeaway here was you can
November you can no longer did develop

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:09.510
November you can no longer did develop

for one single device we have to develop
 

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.270
for one single device we have to develop
for all devices and assume that you

for all devices and assume that you
 

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.590
for all devices and assume that you
don't know anything because we have no

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600
don't know anything because we have no
 

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.240
don't know anything because we have no

it's probably better to use the activity
 

00:26:45.809 --> 00:26:48.799
it's probably better to use the activity
context and in general it's usually

to have different sizes densities and
 

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.210
to have different sizes densities and
resolutions and this means that the

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220
resolutions and this means that the
 

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.740
