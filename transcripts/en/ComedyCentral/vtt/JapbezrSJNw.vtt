00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.468
Sometimes I'll get, I'll get,
like, Irish eyebrow.

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:03.569
- Right. Right.
- You know what I mean?

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:04.603
- You gotta pull out...
- What's the Irish eyebrow?

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.639
That's when it gets like,
those Irish writers,

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:08.007
- they get those eyebrows.
- Yeah.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.244
And then you look like
some old Irish writer from the
old days.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.312
What do you think
Brooklyn thinks of you

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.281
- saying that you even tweeze
your eyebrows? 
- Yeah, that's bad.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.216
But the new Brooklyn probably
agrees with it.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.453
The old guys, "I used to like
Colin, now he tweezes
his eyebrows?

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.288
I can't watch
his stuff anymore."

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.324
I was a little metrosexual
back in the day. Now I'm not so
much anymore.

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:26.458
You're not?

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:30.396
- We'll be the judge of that.
- What's up everybody?

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.698
I'm Chris Distefano,
aka Chrissy Nipples

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:35.568
and I'm here with Colin
Quinn from Brooklyn, New York!

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.370
The hell's your problem?

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.108
What's the stupidest thing
your mom ever made you wear?

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.478
She didn't make me wear
it, but she actually bought me,
I had an Australian hat.

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.713
- Right. 
- So it was almost like a half a
pimp hat...

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.683
- Yeah. Right. Nice.
- ... from the early 70s. Like
half Superfly...

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:53.719
- ... and half of the
Australian, like, outback hat? 
- Right.

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:56.589
And the mistake she made
was to let me wear it to school

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:58.458
- 'cause then you're a target.
- Yeah, and then you get beat
up.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.493
So my mother bought me
a neon green swim cap

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.295
with flowers on the side
by the ears.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.896
I wore that thing.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.698
Johnny Zingrone from Middle
Village hit me in the face with
a wiffle ball bat

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.802
and was like, "Nice swim cap,
Flower Face!"

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:12.171
That's what happens
when you grow up in Brooklyn,

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.207
- Queens area. 
- You get dropped.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.110
Here's a stupid question.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:22.115
- What's the last dream you had?
- Huh. What's the last dream I
had?

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.583
Huh? By the way, huh means, huh,

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.885
I'm not going to tell
the last two I really had.

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.253
I'll think of a clean one.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:30.356
No, I'm trying to think, what's
the last time I had a good
dream?

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:31.757
- What did I have a good
dream...
- It's gotta be

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.293
either sex or murder or else
we don't want to hear it.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:38.764
I always have a dream
that some secret agency

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:41.868
is, like, you know, like,
they're knocking on my mother's
window.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.770
Like we need to see your son
and they have, like, a door
open, but the door

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:46.572
- open, it's got like this green
light coming out. 
- Right.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:47.840
And they want, they always want

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:49.041
to ask me
questions about aliens.

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:51.844
- It's like an abduction.
- It's either that or a secret.

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.746
They wanted you to reveal
something about yourself

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.147
that you're not
comfortable revealing yet.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.683
- Well, should I just do it now?
- But in today's society is
fine.

00:01:57.716 --> 00:01:59.318
I'm gay!

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:04.423
- You're the one that should
know all this stuff...
- Here's a stupid question.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:07.426
When you were a kid, were
you more scared of cooties or
ghosts?

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.462
I was scared of ghosts
for a minute, yeah.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.430
- I was scared of ghosts.
- I'm still scared of
ghosts. People,

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:13.166
everybody wants me to get a
house. My mother's like,

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.467
"Oh, you got to buy a house,
you get a family."

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.369
It's like, I need to live
in a studio apartment.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.237
I need to open the door
and visually scan the room

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.805
because guess where, guess
where the ghosts

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:21.774
and the murderers
are on any floor?

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.710
No, you're right. I've slept
since I was a child, I've slept

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:28.481
with either a giant butcher
knife or an ax for many years.

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:32.418
Mini hand axe under my
pillow, right next to my, next
to, I'm sleeping.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:33.619
It's in that little cut
on the bed right there.

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:36.489
- Right. 
- Like that. I sleep
like that and my hand's

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:37.790
- usually on it. 
- With an axe?

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:39.525
- Yep.
- Still to this day?

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:42.195
No, now I have an Afghani knife,
it's like a killing knife.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.896
- I have a grenade launcher.
- Guy who gave it to me told
me there's a couple of bodies

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.365
- on it, too.
- Really? So that's what you
have right now?

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:47.533
The Afghan knife in your bed?

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.769
- Yeah. 
- Wow. I dare somebody
to try to rob your - 

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:53.806
Oh my God, they're in for the
surprise of their life.

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.775
All right, Colin. Did you have a
good time on the show?

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.910
- I did. 
- Thanks for being here. I give
you a stupid gift now.

00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:58.978
All right.

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:01.447
You're a big history guy,
I'm a big history guy.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.316
I thought why not
Colonial hats

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.386
- Oh!
- that are really not colonial
they kind of look like a...

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.921
Like a colonial stripper would
wear them. Do you think we'd

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.389
be good soldiers
in the Revolutionary War?

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:13.292
- I would run. 
- You have no choice. Where
would you run to, there's

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:15.695
nowhere to run to? This right
here, your neighborhood,

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.230
all the battles are happening
right there.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:18.464
The whole British army

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:20.266
guess where they entered
the United States?

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.968
Or the 13 colonies as
that were called back then?

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.270
Denyse Ferry
in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.506
- Take my hat off to you,
the British. 
- You got a bad rap.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.275
We should have kept you
in charge of this country.

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:31.010
Yeah but thank you for Adele.

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:33.746
It's not a popular opinion.
These gifts really stunk.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.481
- Yeah I know.
- I'm being serious.

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:36.983
I should have, I'll think
more carefully.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.818
I mean, I got this at
the 99 cent store.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.620
You're not grateful!

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.923
That's what I'd like
to do to your face right there.
Just...
