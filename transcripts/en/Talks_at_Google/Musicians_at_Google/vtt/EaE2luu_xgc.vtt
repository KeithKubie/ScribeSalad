00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.500
My name is Rohit Kapoor,

00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:16.260
I'm sorry.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.968
This is a fanboy moment

so I'm going to be
a little nervous.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.500
It gives me immense
pleasure today

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.150
to host this talk with the king
of bhangra, Malkit Singhji.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.590

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.910

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.510
He was also recognized

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.770
MALKIT SINGH:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.990
I was only four, five-year-old
kid [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.354
I used to copy [NON-ENGLISH].

00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:01.520

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.940

00:04:16.684 --> 00:04:19.100
But I never thought I could
make with professional artists

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.974

00:04:31.734 --> 00:04:33.650

MALKIT SINGH: Sometime I
think, man, so lucky, man.

I'm so lucky, because when
I was in college time,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.390
all of Punjab knows
[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:28.700

we have to wear folk dress.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.580
And we used to--

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.580
you can use only

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.930

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160

You just mentioned you
felt bad that you were away

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.530
from home, which is why you
kind of wrote these songs.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.280
MALKIT SINGH: Yes.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.340

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.096
to be included in
an English movie.

00:21:14.096 --> 00:21:15.610
MALKIT SINGH:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:21:22.671 --> 00:21:24.170
ROHIT KAPOOR:

so much that you were
awarded with an MBE award

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.310

ROHIT KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.610
The Queen never talks to
anyone while giving the award.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.400
When you received that award,
when you received that letter

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.120

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.079
