00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So back in the spring, we put a note on the web that said

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
if you would like to build something that might be the DPLA, just start,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
tell us by June 15 that you want to do it with a letter of intent, and by September 1,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
send it to the Steering Committee, your results.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It can be big or small and code or not code,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but the basic idea is to give us a glimpse of what this might be

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and we will have a review panel of people

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
without any conflict of interest among the sprinters, and then we'll invite

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the most promising to present at the National Archives.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So we're going to have six presentations that are sort of "full" presentations

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Each group will speak for no more than seven minutes

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and then about seven minutes of discussion with each one,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and then our review panel also chose three for "lightning round" presentations.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
They'll go five minutes each in a series, and then we'll have commentary for them after that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I want to thank the blue-ribbon review panel, they were wonderful

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
they came to Cambridge after doing a ton of homework

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
after reviewing 48 submissions that were unbelievably great

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and rich and spent time locked in a conference room

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and came out with recommendations that are fantastic.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They were John Weiss, Patsy Baudoin, Michael Santangelo, Maeve Clark, Eli Neiburger, Laura DeBonis, David Rumsey, and Jessamyn West,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and I'd like to have a round of applause for the volunteer group.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
All right, so the first of the groups is one those referenced earlier,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
digital collaboration for America's national collections,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
representing three organizations that have worked collaboratively together -

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The Smithsonian, the National Archives, and the Library of Congress

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Martin Kalfatovic, Chin Sing Yun, and Pam Wright are here to present, so over to you guys.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The main purpose of our Beta Sprint entry was to show

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that these three large institutions that could collaborate together

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and I think that is the proof of concept that we did so

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
everything else is the special sauce.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We've heard already some of the statistics of our different collections

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and what we primarily did in this case was using some records from each of the three institutions

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and we put them into the Smithsonian's Collections Search Project that Chin Sing will talk about in a minute.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Primarily to show how the different data from libraries,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
archives, and museums could interact in one large

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
data system and provide different types of access to the data.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So with that I will turn it over to Chin Sing who will talk about how we did this

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and then you can ask questions about the details.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I think Mark has aluded to the fact that we're using the existing

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Smithsonian Collections Search Center and extending it to this Beta Sprint project,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
to see how things turned out and the three major organizations participating

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and we have all sorts of interesting materials and we wanted to make sure that

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
this is something that we could use not only for one institution, but for many.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We started this project by making sure that we have a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
dynamic extendable metadata model

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and this is something the Smithsonian has spent time

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
reviewing national standards

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and looking for commonalities

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and looking for specialties,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
anything from standard printed materials to scientific specimens,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the mosquitos and little bugs and making sure taxonomy information is properly addressed,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
so therefore, looking over the national standards,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and various cataloging standards assuring the metadata covers all the commonalities.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And this is one of the examples, a tiny snippet of what the metadata model looks like

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and in this particular section addresses the geographical location of the tags.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
For example, a photograph can be taken at a location and we can have latitude and longitude information

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which can be used for searching purposes -

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
A bug can be collected at a particular location, and this can help

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
scientists track the migration patterns of the bug or birds or a whale or anything like that.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So this is just a snippet of what the metadata looks like.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Obviously, we have cooperation from the three organization
- and this shows the 11 records from the National Archives

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and this is under a time constraint so we did data menus converstion

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
from the National Archives and the Library of Congress.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The nothing else has changed as a result of it to make everything a separate

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and not independent thoughts floating around, we went in to work together so that high-level

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
architecture, basically includes,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
as you can see on the bottom various independent sources

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
for specialized databases and focus

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and each of the organizations all have similar kinds of

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
challenges but the goal and help end up doing,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
does allow the metadata model to be the guide

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and standardize the data format

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and it is suggested into a central index search index

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
or temporary metadata and this is not permanent,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
just for indexing sake

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and then coupling with the concept,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we allow several web services to , for example,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to use the data.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
For example, metadata delivery services focusing on searching

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and retrieval of potential information.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
On the right side of the screen you see an indexed image delivery service

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and that is for the purpose of doing manipulation of

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
indexes and images, assuming and resizing and finally,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
attacking services that allow -- for tagging services that allow public input

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and allow people to tag our materials Brigadier with these services,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
we allow people to start developing their own web

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
interface and by no means is this a single interface or architecture.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I don't have a whole lot of time this is a high-level
system architecture and processing goes through,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
starting from the bottom up,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
you will see all of the databases

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and it gets adjusted its volume index and then, between,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
you'd see a box go up and down, the Aeros, it's preprocessing stage

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and that is where we do extensive scrubbing of data, standardization,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
make sure the data coming from different sources actually conforms to different standards

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and then leverage that into our master index

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and it replicates a number of slaves to handle high-level traffic at this point,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the data has no particular phase until some web applications start to have it.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
You see the red dotted line that educates the firewall and outside of the firewall is the number of applications

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that can be developed and I will end they are for questions.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:55.000
-- I will end there for questions. [Applause]

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Hello. My name is TJ freight my question is how often,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and the final implementation,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
how often would the indexing happen?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Would it be one time per record or would it be,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
updated as they might change?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
The answer is,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
at different intervals for different organizations,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
for the Library of Congress, so far,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
we have done one time but I am sure we can negotiate a

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
refreshing schedule for four internal Smithsonian,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
they range from daily updates to weekly updates to

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
monthly updates to quarterly update Center depends on how

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
often the data is refreshed and updated

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and how often the organization contributes to the field that they can handle

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and the system is built in such a way that it is

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
culminating all levels of frequency. Question.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:16.000
-- Good question.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Jerry Simmons, national archives,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
the team lead for authority cataloging and I'm interested in how you got this data to interact rate

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
The data, the system part is not difficult to build ultimately,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
what really grew everything together

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and how they start interacting is really through the

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
metadata themselves. And I think that the catalogers, professional catalogers,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
that is what we need to thank them for.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000
The data is obviously,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
this urbanization has to be dealing with all views of the

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
internal standards if not the national standards we have

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:16.000
the benefit of that advantage of the architecture thesaurus, subject headings,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
all of these terms are important and what we talk

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and we mentioned there is a lot of scrubbing process,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
it really is to standardize terms, oftentimes,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
simply miss spellings that oftentimes we just match those

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
terms up we have the database and we have right now,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
probably 50,000 lines of exceptions that process through

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
to scrub the data to make it standardized rate was the data to standardize,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
the records actually start interacting with each other.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Jerry McGann University of Virginia.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Can you speak to the kind of traffic you could come to

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
expect him to the alliance of scaling in the kind of traffic you can expect?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The next that is a hard question to answer because I

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
don't have the number on hand however,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the surf Center which is a main website that retrieves content from the end-users,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
we have in the neighborhood of 25,000 unique visitors per

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
month however, the system is not built for one interface.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
We have web applications using data

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and we also have individual web applications using the data.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
We have to level applications each with a different focus

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and I don't have statistics but I know that a majority of

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
the traffic actually comes from the southern application

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
of the LeMay one really provided. In other words,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
if some DPL -- DPLA

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and they want to write the application history to tell

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
the story of their town or Poulter,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
they can draw on  a lot of materials from other

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
organizations and one example I would point out,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
since I'm -- the Sony

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and is a well-known American injury this -- Museum American Indian Museum

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and have a collection of surprise they found out the

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
national history Museum has anthropology department which

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
has a tremendous amount of questions that we find extremely supplemental and useful

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and also there is a national anthropological archives

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that the Smithsonian has that has even more cultural

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and language materials that they find useful.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So all of these pleasant surprises before we did not realize that now, --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Please join me in thanking Chin Sing.
