00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.768
Opposers, the fight is back.

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.202
And the stakes
are higher than ever,

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:05.772
because a hundred percent
of 50% of the population

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.041
is at risk
of total eradication...

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.542
of their identity.

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.277
I'm talking about men.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.147
An overwhelming six states
now have female governors,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.215
which means only 44 states

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:19.085
stand between us
and a complete "fempire."

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:22.388
It's time to suit up for battle,

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:24.357
because-- wardrobe, please...

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.530
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:33.666
...there's a war on men!

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.903 line:0%
Something ominous is happening
to men in America...

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.504 line:0%
...a war on men.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:41.307 line:0%
The liberals' war on men
is working.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.542 line:0%
(laughing)

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:43.676 line:0%
 ...war on men...

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:44.978 line:0%
(deep, distorted growling)

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.348 line:0%
(cheering, applause)

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:50.416
Men...

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.185 line:0%
this war is nothing new.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.921 line:0%
Women have been out to get us
from birth.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.757
In fact, all fetuses start
as female in the womb,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.828
until some of us brave souls
fight our way to a penis.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.697
And what's worse,
just because women's bodies

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.399
are tiny baby apartments,

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:10.002
they think they get to call
the shots on motherhood.

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:11.871
Battleground one: Babies.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:14.974
-(military percussion plays)
-Senator Tammy Duckworth

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.110
recently because
the first senator to give birth

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.478
while in office.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:21.781
And then something
even more frightening happened.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.617 line:0%
NEWSWOMAN: Tammy Duckworth
 arrived to cast a vote

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.087 line:0%
 with her ten-day-old daughter
 by her side.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.423 line:0%
 The Senate unanimously decided
 last night

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.792 line:0%
 to allow working moms
 on the Hill

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.560 line:0%
 to bring their newborns
 to work.

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:36.596 line:0%
 Like anything else
 in the Senate, though,

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.164 line:0%
 it wasn't without
 some bellyaching.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.933 line:0%
 Senator Orrin Hatch even asking
 and telling the A.P.,

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:44.570 line:0%
 "But what if there are ten
 babies on the Senate floor?"

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:46.072
Exactly.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:49.342
Hatch knows babies are loud,
disruptive and in diapers.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.244
And that's totally his thing.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.712
(laughter)

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:56.149
And sure, there's only one
female senator under 50,

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.783
but women are sneaky.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:01.220
They're always creeping up
behind you to say, "It's yours."

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:04.023
(laughter)

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:05.391
Don't be fooled.

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:08.060
This newborn fever
is just the latest way

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:10.897
women have stripped men
of their basic liberties.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.432
Did you know that
as recently as 2009

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:16.068
the Senate used to have
a "men's only" pool.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.504
Of course they did.
Where else was Mitch McConnell

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.540
supposed to birth his eggs?

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.408
-(laughter)
-And...

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:25.478
in 2013, a record number
of women invaded the Senate

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:28.281
and then suddenly, months later,
the Senate floor bathrooms

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.483
had to be expanded for women.

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:33.186
These women are capturing
 our porcelain thrones.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.389
Women just want everything
men have: our money, our power,

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.025
our convenient bowel movements.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.928
This is a pissing contest
that we will win,

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.230
because we do it standing.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:45.698
And that's not all.

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.867
Men are being attacked
on all fronts:

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.870
our homes, our works,
even our happy places.

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:53.906
Specifically,
the happiest place on earth.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.908
Battleground number two:
Disney World.

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.210
(military percussion plays)

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.812
The Pirates of the Caribbean
ride is ground zero

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:01.547
for the feminist assault,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.317
where crybabies are saying
outrageous things,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.786
like, auctioning off brides
at a family theme park

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.521
is problematic.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.456 line:0%
This attraction,
the Pirates of the Caribbean,

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.225 line:0%
-Oh, God.
-it's been there for 50 years.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.126 line:0%
 It was originally
 a bride auction.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.729 line:0%
 They've decided that this
 is too controversial,

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:18.531 line:0%
 and it's a Me Too moment.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:20.733 line:0%
Maybe the little hula girls
at the Small World,

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.868 line:0%
-they need to come out as well.
-Oh, no, no.

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.004 line:0%
I got stuck on that ride,
It's a Small World.

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:27.173 line:0%
I was stuck in there
for, like, 45 minutes.

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:30.276
Of course,
Laura Ingraham got stuck

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.278
on the "Small World" ride,

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:36.215
because every hero
has an origin story.

00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:38.351
And you know what?

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.152
Getting trapped
in a globalist hellscape

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:43.422
of multicultural animatronics
is Laura's.

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:45.925
Now, the removal
of the wench auction

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.593
from the 
 Pirates of the Caribbean ride

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:49.629
sets a dangerous precedent
to men

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:53.065
because it's different.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:56.602
Disney and its rides teach boys
to become men.

00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:58.738
If little boys can't look
at a bunch

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.740
of seafaring murder pimps
and think,

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.842
"That's what I want to be
when I grow up,"

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.977
what do they have left?

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.046
Representation matters.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.382
And, look,
I know I'm right here,

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:12.184
because the men who are upset
by this change

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:14.854
are the most well-adjusted
people in America:

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:18.824
adults who go to Disney World.

00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:21.294
But man magic isn't
the only ground we've lost

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:22.895
in the war on men.

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:25.865
They're also renovating the
fields of math and science,

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:29.702
which brings me to our
final battleground: STEM.

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:32.405
It stands for science,
technology,

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.440
engineering, and math.

00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:36.042
Though it might as well
stand for

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:39.745
"stealing to eliminate men."

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:43.582
Because women are taking
our math and science jobs.

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:45.685
For years,
I thought it was because

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.787
we summoned women
on our calculators.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.156
But...

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:56.562
it turns out
there's another reason.

00:04:56.595 --> 00:04:59.065 line:0%
TV REPORTER: The Scully effect:
 Women who regularly watch

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:02.735 line:0%
 or watched The X-Files are 50%
 more likely to work

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:05.538 line:0%
 in science, technology,
 engineering or math,

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.373 line:0%
 compared to women
 who haven't been fans.

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:09.041 line:0%
 Nearly two-thirds of women
 in those fields

00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:12.311 line:0%
 say Agent Scully served as
 a role model for them.

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:13.679
How dare they?

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:15.481
Math is our thing.

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:18.084
Two-thirds of these women
said Scully was a role model,

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.753
but what about the other half?

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.722
(laughter)

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:27.660
Because of the XX-Files,
 a whole generation of women

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:30.763
are storming our labs
and taking our jobs.

00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:32.498
And if this show inspired them,

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.533
who knows what other
strong female characters

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:36.302
have activated women.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:37.803
There might be a horde
of warrior princesses

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:39.438
out there ready to attack,

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:41.440
or an army of women

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:44.343
just waiting to explain it all.

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:45.878
It's unbelievable.

00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.114
Men are the ones
who explain things.

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:51.584
Explaining things to people
is the last thing men have left.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:54.120
Okay, okay.
Let me explain it to you.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.255
You see, Opposers,

00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:58.991
men, we are under attack.

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:01.293
We need to make Disney
less "family"

00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:03.229
and more "manly."

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:05.598
Because we've lost the battle
of Space Mountain,

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.601
but we need to counterstrike
until Disney's Epcot Center

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:12.004
has two balls, as God intended.

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:14.440
And we need to get back to the
position where the only time

00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:16.642
a man has to deal
with an infant at work

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:18.577
is when he's delivering it
with his right hand

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.546
and holding a lit cigarette
in his left.

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:22.748
Men, get in your battle stance,

00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:25.484
which takes up approximately
three seats on the subway.

00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:28.087
We're going to compensate
for the ground we've lost.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.125
In fact, we'll overcompensate
until we feel secure again.
