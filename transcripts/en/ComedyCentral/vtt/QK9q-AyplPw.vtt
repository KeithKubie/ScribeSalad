00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.520
(choral music)

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.977
- Now, do I want
a classic grave

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:12.312
or one of those
tiny marble houses?

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.714
Ooh, I could see myself

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.049
in a little Taj Mahal
but less ethnic.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.652
I can't predict if Indians
are still going to be trendy

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:19.853
in 100 years.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.788
[gasps]
Beatrice, look!

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.258
I can get pink satin
in my casket.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.860
Ooh, and a monogrammed pillow.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.529
Beatrice, help me pick
my death pose.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.632
Do you think this
is too old-fashioned?

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:34.334
Ooh, maybe arms by my side.
That's more modern.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.803
Ooh, or maybe something like...

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.538
- What does it matter?

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.707
Worms are gonna
eat you either way.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.209
- May I help you?

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.944
- Oh.

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:47.414
Uh...hi.
[giggles]

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:51.285
Yes, we'll take two
of your finest plots--

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.754
preferably in an area
that can accommodate a crowd.

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.522
- Wonderful.
Well, that should save me

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.024
the time of going through

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.426
this extremely extensive
waiting list.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.994
[thud]

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.362
- [stammers]
Well, please.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.098
I'm sure there's
something we can do.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.000
It's very important
that I'm buried here.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.836
- Oh, it's very important?
Well, why didn't you say so?

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:14.675
In that case, all you need to do
is travel backwards in time

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:17.244
and get your
great-great-great-grandparents

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.147
to have better families
and improve their bloodlines--

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:23.150
that is, if they can
even speak English.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.352
- We don't know how
to travel backwards in time.

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.854
- You should tell that
to your dresses.

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:30.590
- That might hurt our feelings
if anything you said mattered,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.593
but we're all just animals
on a cold, unfeeling rock,

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.697
hurtling our way toward
the inevitable godless abyss.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:38.365
So...

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:40.834
it doesn't.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.936
- Fine.
They're still old dresses.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.204
- Please, you don't understand.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.839
- Oh, no, child.
I do.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.308
I do.
I simply don't care.

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.177
Anyway, there's nothing
to be done.

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:52.179
The cemetery
is completely booked.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.381
We're only accepting
legacies now.

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.818
- Oh, uh, so legacies
are guaranteed admission?

00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.653
- Yes. How else do you think
we ended up

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:01.321
with a mulatto district?

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.023
- [scoffs]
- Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:04.624
my 4:00 is here.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.461
[laughing cordially]
Mr. Needham, welcome.

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:08.962
I see you've brought
your parents.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.098
Come, let's go pick out
some plots

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:13.066
for your grandchildren.
