00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.460
So at the end of every lesson, I will briefly recap what we talked about during

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.160
that lesson and try to tie it into some future topics.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.470
Today, we started off by talking about the central conundrums and

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.070
characteristics of AI. This may have connected with some of

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.270
your previous experience with other AI classes, like machine learning in AI for

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.220
robotics. We then talked about the four schools of AI, and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.080
we talked about knowledge-based AI more specifically, what is it and where does

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.490
it fit in with the other schools? Then we talked about cognitive systems and

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.490
how cognitive systems are always concerned with human like intelligence. Lastly,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.400
we talked about the overall structure of the course,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.820
which is broken up into eight large categories, like learning, planning and

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.570
analogical reasoning. Next time we'll talk a little bit more

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.530
specifically about this class in particular. The goals, the outcomes and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.877
the learning strategies, and what projects you'll complete.
