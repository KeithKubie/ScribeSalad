those clues yet in their memory about
 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.610
those clues yet in their memory about
sense so we had to play leap renewed

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620
sense so we had to play leap renewed
 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.620
sense so we had to play leap renewed
where we describe the scent with the

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630
where we describe the scent with the
 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.740
where we describe the scent with the
music and with some words so that they

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750
music and with some words so that they
 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.230
music and with some words so that they
started to make this association quite

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240
started to make this association quite
 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.730
started to make this association quite
quickly and thank God the brain is very

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740
quickly and thank God the brain is very
 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.850
quickly and thank God the brain is very
used at associating an event with a

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860
used at associating an event with a
 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.780
used at associating an event with a
scent that's the the brain is even

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790
scent that's the the brain is even
 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.540
scent that's the the brain is even
better at doing that then at associating

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550
better at doing that then at associating
 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.690
better at doing that then at associating
a visual clue with an event you don't

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700
a visual clue with an event you don't
 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.860
a visual clue with an event you don't
have to repeat as much and so within 15

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870
have to repeat as much and so within 15
 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.760
have to repeat as much and so within 15
minutes we gave already a few tips I

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770
minutes we gave already a few tips I
 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.490
minutes we gave already a few tips I
would say and then we people attended

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500
would say and then we people attended
 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.380
would say and then we people attended
the Opera in the dark and could really

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:34.390
the Opera in the dark and could really
 

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.020
the Opera in the dark and could really
make the association between the sand

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030
make the association between the sand
 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.740
make the association between the sand
coming and going and and the musical

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.750
coming and going and and the musical
 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.130
coming and going and and the musical
clues the music playing at the same time

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.140
clues the music playing at the same time
 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.360
clues the music playing at the same time
so it was quite an exercise but we could

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.370
so it was quite an exercise but we could
 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.430
so it was quite an exercise but we could
see because the audience would love at

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.440
see because the audience would love at
 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.300
see because the audience would love at
the right moment and one and they would

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.310
the right moment and one and they would
 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.890
the right moment and one and they would
tell us after so yeah I could really see

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:55.900
tell us after so yeah I could really see
 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.830
tell us after so yeah I could really see
what was happening the battle between

00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840
what was happening the battle between
 

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.850
what was happening the battle between
technology and nature and metal coming

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:02.860
technology and nature and metal coming
 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.219
technology and nature and metal coming
in and all I kind of stuff and then the

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:05.229
in and all I kind of stuff and then the
 

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:10.170
in and all I kind of stuff and then the
the weirdo passing by and making a chaos

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:10.180
the weirdo passing by and making a chaos
 

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.909
the weirdo passing by and making a chaos
and all that so people could really make

00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919
and all that so people could really make
 

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:17.570
and all that so people could really make
a parallel with what they would have

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580
a parallel with what they would have
 

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.650
a parallel with what they would have
enjoyed in another arena
