00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
Women have, what's lovingly referred to as a biological clock.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.200
Don't you think you should have kids soon?  Because like if you have kids around

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.360
here it could be bad for your body

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.400
*alarm clock ringing*

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.200
It's basically this pressure that's looming over our heads

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.520
that says "if you want to have a baby, there's a deadline.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.040
Or else there are serious health consequences."

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.620
But as I get older, I'm like not really sure if I even want kids.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.580
I mean, I have 4 cats and right now that's kind of enough.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.360
Four cats, no cuddles.  This is parenthood.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.860
I also run a business and I want to establish my career.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.740
Seriously, get me my lunch.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.520
Plus, I'm like not even married yet.  Not even close.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.360
Hey babe?

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.760
Babe.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.820
Babe!

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.980
Can you come here?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.640
Please?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.900
I want to talk to you.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.580
Part of me thinks like, not having kids is the more responsible thing to do anyway.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.780
I mean our Earth is so overpopulated.  And if I want

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.500
to be a parent later in life, maybe I should just adopt

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.580
one of the thousands of orphaned children who are looking for loving parents.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.740
Hi.  Yes, I'm ready to be a mom now so I'll go ahead and take 4 of your most unfortunate orphans.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.640
But then another part of me chimes in:

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.460
"well what about pregnancy?  That seems like a magical awesome process of life

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.200
that you want to experience and like bring a part of you into the world.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.000
*vomiting*

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.440
And then some smaller part of me is like

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.680
"Well, maybe I'll just be a multiple cat momma forever."

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.360
Please cuddle with me.  Please care about me!

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.060
Congress!  Congress!

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.260
But then again, you know, when I'm in my 30s, I may feel completely

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.240
differently about all of these things.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.720
And I don't mind taking that long to really consider it.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.140
Like, I have always wanted to get a tattoo

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.600
but I told myself "You can't get a tattoo until you want the same one for 10 years straight."

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.960
And right now I'm on year 5 of maybe still wanting that same tattoo.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.320
So if I'm taking this long to consider ink on my skin permanently

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.400
it's fine that I'm going to take this long to think about bringing another

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.880
human being into the world through my vagina

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.340
and just destroying my body and potentially staying up every night after then

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.720
having to raise another human being and not like fuck it up.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.840
What do you think?  Do you want kids?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.720
Are you going to adopt a couple of cats and call it a day?

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.180
Are you adopted and was it like the best thing ever?

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.220
Let me know.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.260
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.
