thinking relies on very basic cognitive

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789
thinking relies on very basic cognitive

tendencies that we all share

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710
tendencies that we all share
 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.650
tendencies that we all share
so for instance we tend to see patterns

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660
so for instance we tend to see patterns
 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.569
so for instance we tend to see patterns
in the world and read meaning into those

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579
in the world and read meaning into those
 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.880
in the world and read meaning into those
patterns this is basically how we learn

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890
patterns this is basically how we learn
 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.889
patterns this is basically how we learn
and sometimes we read meaning into

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899
and sometimes we read meaning into
 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.540
and sometimes we read meaning into
patterns where there is no inherent

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550
patterns where there is no inherent
 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.209
patterns where there is no inherent
meaning so we see faces in the clouds or

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219
meaning so we see faces in the clouds or
 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.490
meaning so we see faces in the clouds or
we hear messages and records played

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500
we hear messages and records played
 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.919
we hear messages and records played
backwards and one type of pattern that

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929
backwards and one type of pattern that
 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.169
backwards and one type of pattern that
we read meaning into is seeming

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179
we read meaning into is seeming
 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.720

correlations between our things inside

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730
correlations between our things inside
 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.189
correlations between our things inside
our heads and things outside in the

our heads and things outside in the
 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.500
our heads and things outside in the
world so if the thought matches up with

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510
world so if the thought matches up with
 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.810
world so if the thought matches up with
some event then you see a correlation

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820
some event then you see a correlation
 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.300
some event then you see a correlation
and perhaps causation so let's say you

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310
and perhaps causation so let's say you
 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.650
and perhaps causation so let's say you
think about something and then it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660
think about something and then it
 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.180
think about something and then it
happens you might think that your

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190
happens you might think that your
 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.460
happens you might think that your
thought caused that event or maybe your

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470
thought caused that event or maybe your
 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.320
thought caused that event or maybe your
thought was a premonition of the event

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330
thought was a premonition of the event
 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.510
thought was a premonition of the event
or maybe something happens in your life

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520
or maybe something happens in your life
 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.550
or maybe something happens in your life
that has some particular meaning for you

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560
that has some particular meaning for you
 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.070
that has some particular meaning for you
you might think that the event happened

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080
you might think that the event happened
 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.750
you might think that the event happened
because it had meaning for you because

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760
because it had meaning for you because
 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.730
because it had meaning for you because
it was meant to improve your life

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740
it was meant to improve your life
 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.010
it was meant to improve your life
somehow or perhaps it was meant as a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020
somehow or perhaps it was meant as a
 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.090
somehow or perhaps it was meant as a
sign directed for you but you know if we

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
sign directed for you but you know if we
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.230
sign directed for you but you know if we
you know rationally

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240
you know rationally
 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.790
you know rationally
analyze these patterns like if we're

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800
analyze these patterns like if we're
 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.940
analyze these patterns like if we're
very careful and we sort of you know

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
very careful and we sort of you know
 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.280
very careful and we sort of you know
think about our thinking and say okay I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290
think about our thinking and say okay I
 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.190
think about our thinking and say okay I
you know I thought that for a moment I

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200
you know I thought that for a moment I
 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.060
you know I thought that for a moment I
felt that there was a correlation

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070
felt that there was a correlation
 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.580
felt that there was a correlation
between those things but does that

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590
between those things but does that
 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.530
between those things but does that
really make sense I mean is it not

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540
really make sense I mean is it not

should use magical thinking I would say

should use magical thinking I would say
 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.220
should use magical thinking I would say
that in a very general rule of thumb

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230
that in a very general rule of thumb
 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.480
that in a very general rule of thumb
would be to look at whether not focus on

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490
would be to look at whether not focus on
 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.660

whether a particular illusion is or

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:17.670
whether a particular illusion is or
 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.390
whether a particular illusion is or

whether a particular intuition or belief
 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.360
whether a particular intuition or belief
is an accurate picture of reality but to

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370
is an accurate picture of reality but to
 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.640
is an accurate picture of reality but to
wonder whether it's a useful picture of

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200
intuitions we all have the same instinct
 

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.800
intuitions we all have the same instinct
for magical thinking and people who are

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:42.810
for magical thinking and people who are
 

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.560
for magical thinking and people who are
less superstitious are actually not

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:45.570
less superstitious are actually not
 

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.780
less superstitious are actually not
necessarily more intelligent or more

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:47.790
necessarily more intelligent or more
 

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.060
necessarily more intelligent or more
educated than other people it's really

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.070
educated than other people it's really
 

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.980
educated than other people it's really
that they have a tendency to question

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:51.990
that they have a tendency to question
 

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.770
that they have a tendency to question
their intuitions so it's partly

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:54.780
their intuitions so it's partly
 

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.060
their intuitions so it's partly
motivation partly habits if you're more

00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.070
motivation partly habits if you're more
 

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.880
motivation partly habits if you're more
motivated to try to get down to the the

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:01.890
motivated to try to get down to the the
 

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.340
motivated to try to get down to the the
basics and try to figure out ok what's

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:04.350
basics and try to figure out ok what's
 

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.340
basics and try to figure out ok what's
real and what isn't or if you've done

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:07.350
real and what isn't or if you've done
 

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.200
real and what isn't or if you've done
this a lot and it becomes second nature

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.210
this a lot and it becomes second nature
 

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.020
this a lot and it becomes second nature
just through a habit of questioning

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.030
just through a habit of questioning
 

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.520
just through a habit of questioning
their beliefs and questioning your

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:13.530
their beliefs and questioning your
 

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.900
their beliefs and questioning your
perceptions and questioning and

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:14.910
perceptions and questioning and
 

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.810
perceptions and questioning and
illusions then you're more likely to be

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:16.820
illusions then you're more likely to be
 

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.490
illusions then you're more likely to be
become a skeptic I mean yet while we

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:21.500
become a skeptic I mean yet while we
 

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.690
become a skeptic I mean yet while we
might not be able to say that it's a

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700
might not be able to say that it's a
 

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.520
might not be able to say that it's a
question of intelligence you know the

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:25.530
question of intelligence you know the
 

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:31.390
question of intelligence you know the
difference I guess would you say that

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:31.400
difference I guess would you say that
 

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.740
difference I guess would you say that
intentionality and awareness with

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:33.750
intentionality and awareness with
 

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.500
intentionality and awareness with
respect to our own superstitions and

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:36.510
respect to our own superstitions and
 

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.800
respect to our own superstitions and
magical thinking is important and useful

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:39.810
magical thinking is important and useful
 

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.560
magical thinking is important and useful
in terms of deciding and trying to sort

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:42.570
in terms of deciding and trying to sort
 

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.820
in terms of deciding and trying to sort
of figure out and guide our own

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:43.830
of figure out and guide our own
 

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.590
of figure out and guide our own
consciousness in the ways that are

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600
consciousness in the ways that are
 

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.980
consciousness in the ways that are
beneficial to us sure yeah

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:48.990
beneficial to us sure yeah
 

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.700
beneficial to us sure yeah
so I before that often it's more

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:52.710
so I before that often it's more
 

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.100
so I before that often it's more
important to have a useful perception of

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.110
important to have a useful perception of
 

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.870
important to have a useful perception of
reality than an accurate perception of

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880
reality than an accurate perception of
 

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.810
reality than an accurate perception of
reality but of course in in many cases

00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820
reality but of course in in many cases
 

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.820
reality but of course in in many cases
an accurate perception of reality is a

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:01.830
an accurate perception of reality is a
 

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.400
an accurate perception of reality is a
useful perception of reality and so it's

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:04.410
useful perception of reality and so it's
 

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.920
useful perception of reality and so it's
important to try to figure out what you

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:06.930
important to try to figure out what you
 

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.290
important to try to figure out what you
know what reaction what reality actually

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.300
know what reaction what reality actually
 

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.820
know what reaction what reality actually
looks like and to try to cut through

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:10.830
looks like and to try to cut through
 

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.350
looks like and to try to cut through
your the illusions and try to cut

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360
your the illusions and try to cut
 

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.960
your the illusions and try to cut
through your biases and and make sure

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:14.970
through your biases and and make sure
 

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.350
through your biases and and make sure
that you're not friend

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360
that you're not friend
 

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.360
that you're not friend
since confusing correlation for

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:18.370
since confusing correlation for
 

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.150
since confusing correlation for
causation so that's something that to

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160
causation so that's something that to
 

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.519
causation so that's something that to
look out for you know if if it looks

like a Cosby did a Willie Cosby or is
 

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.420
like a Cosby did a Willie Cosby or is
there something else that may have

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:27.430
there something else that may have

caused both you try to think of other

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680
caused both you try to think of other
 

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.819
caused both you try to think of other
hypotheses another mistake that we tend

00:13:32.819 --> 00:13:32.829
hypotheses another mistake that we tend
 

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:36.600
hypotheses another mistake that we tend
to make is to to selectively look at

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:36.610
to make is to to selectively look at
 

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.850
to make is to to selectively look at
evidence or to use motivated reasoning

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:38.860
evidence or to use motivated reasoning
 

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.610
evidence or to use motivated reasoning
so if you cherry-pick things in your

so if you cherry-pick things in your
 

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.220
so if you cherry-pick things in your
environment that that pop out at you and

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:44.230
environment that that pop out at you and
 

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.810
environment that that pop out at you and
to tend to support things that you

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:45.820
to tend to support things that you
 

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.639
to tend to support things that you
already believe or things that you want

then maybe you should try to find

then maybe you should try to find
 

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.300
