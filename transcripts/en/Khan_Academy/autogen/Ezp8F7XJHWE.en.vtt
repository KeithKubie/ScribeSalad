00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:02.906
 We'll talk a bit about the pesticide. 

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:05.309
 If the term is familiar to you 

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:08.884
 It is likely that the first thing that will occur in your mind is the fat molecules, 

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:10.382
 This is true to some extent. 

00:00:10.382 --> 00:00:12.959
 Fat molecules type 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.862
 Commonly from the pulp, 

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:19.089
 Here's an example 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.583
 On the fat molecules, 

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:24.383
 Or triglycerides. 

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.923
 This triglyceride is a type of polyunsaturated fat, 

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:30.827
 We will explain more about this type 

00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:32.567
 In the video on the molecular structure of fat 

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:33.960
 Or triglycerides 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.224
 And in the video about fat 

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:38.998
 Saturated and unsaturated. 

00:00:38.998 --> 00:00:40.182
 These particles are connected 

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:42.760
 Tell us what the glycerol molecule was 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.499
 It is the basis of this structure, 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.645
 Linked to three molecules were fatty acids. 

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:51.224
 We will also explain this issue, 

00:00:51.224 --> 00:00:54.543
 The liver has other types of fat. 

00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:56.924
 But, why are all these things considered 

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.595
 Which will I show you also for the hand? 

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:00.975
 What is the common denominator between them and fats? 

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:03.436
 Lapid is the general term 

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:06.118
 For a type of particle 

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:08.158
 Not easily soluble in water, 

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:10.224
 Which are synthesized and aggregated 

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:11.605
 When placed in water 

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:15.786
 And do not melt 

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:19.083
 In water easily. 

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:21.030
 I pick my words well, 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.049
 I did not say it was water-crazed. 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.543
 There are types of lupine to be hateful and water repellent, 

00:01:26.543 --> 00:01:27.762
 There are types 

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:30.526
 One side is water-resistant 

00:01:30.526 --> 00:01:31.838
 And the other 

00:01:31.838 --> 00:01:33.788
 Water lover. 

00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:35.321
 Each of these species has a different term. 

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:36.482
 It is not what it is 

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:39.139
 Water-craving in a holistic manner 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:40.661
 He avoids 

00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:43.122
 Water repellent, 

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:46.557
 It is a non-polar molecule, 

00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:49.518
 Its molecules are massed 

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:51.619
 with each other 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.943
 In the water. 

00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:55.056
 And other types 

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:56.519
 she has 

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:59.177
 parts 

00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:02.161
 Watery 

00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:03.778
 And water-loving parts 

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:05.078
 Amphibathic molecules, 

00:02:05.078 --> 00:02:07.040
 We will talk about this more 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.781
 In biology 

00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:13.018
 When we explain phospholipid, 

00:02:13.018 --> 00:02:14.620
 Which is the basis 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.153
 Composition of the cell membrane. 

00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:17.801
 What are all these different molecules? 

00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:19.414
 Let us think together what parts are water-threatening 

00:02:19.414 --> 00:02:23.338
 And what parts are water-loving. 

00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:26.333
 When looking at fat you will see a hydrocarbon chain, 

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.515
 But do not be clear 

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:32.476
 Whether there are electrical shipments or not. 

00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:36.295
 In fact, there is none. 

00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:38.918
 Oxygen is negative electrical charge, 

00:02:38.918 --> 00:02:40.925
 There may be a small partial negative charge 

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:42.413
 Or a partial positive charge, 

00:02:42.413 --> 00:02:44.791
 Negative partial charge at oxygen 

00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:47.113
 Or perhaps a partial positive charge at the carbon side, 

00:02:47.113 --> 00:02:48.171
 Carbon is considered to be negatively charged 

00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:49.575
 More than hydrogen, for example, 

00:02:49.575 --> 00:02:51.793
 We will not be able to create a polar link, 

00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:53.755
 Or hydrogen bonds, 

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:56.493
 If there are hydroxyl groups, 

00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:58.130
 If what we are talking about is alcoholic. 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.453
 Hydrocarbon chains 

00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:03.586
 Watery 

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.791
 That's what fat makes 

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.287
 They are lumped and not dissolve in water. 

00:03:09.287 --> 00:03:11.029
 These particles are here 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.536
 Classified as Esther, 

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:15.927
 Because of the existence of the Ester group 

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:18.226
 Which consists of carbon bonds with oxygen, 

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:20.850
 One is a double 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.568
 And the other one link. 

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:25.713
 Where one-link oxygen is also connected to a long chain of hydrocarbons, 

00:03:25.713 --> 00:03:26.747
 And carbon 

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:29.986
 Connected to another long chain of hydrocarbons. 

00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:32.993
 This installation 

00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:34.855
 Considered 

00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:35.923
 One of the basic elements 

00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:39.996
 For beeswax, 

00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:43.391
 Which is inherently water-loving. 

00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:45.190
 And beeswax 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.514
 Like any kind 

00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:49.533
 Types of wax, 

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:52.470
 Considered 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.093
 Of sinter, 

00:03:55.093 --> 00:03:58.390
 It is hateful 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.468
 Waterproof 

00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:02.371
 It is sometimes used 

00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:03.672
 To keep the water 

00:04:03.672 --> 00:04:07.086
 Of infusion 

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:09.860
 Between spaces. 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.393
 Let's talk about this example here 

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:14.992
 It is a steroid. 

00:04:14.992 --> 00:04:18.043
 It is common to steroid 

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:20.690
 It is illegal 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.583
 And not allowed 

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:26.193
 Which players can 

00:04:26.193 --> 00:04:29.026
 BodyBuilding 

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:31.429
 To be injected 

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:32.185
 Their bodies 

00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:34.529
 To enlarge muscles. 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.491
 Steroid is a compound 

00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:40.450
 Which consists 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.505
 Of four episodes 

00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:44.004
 As such, 

00:04:44.004 --> 00:04:45.362
 Three of which are hexagonal carbon 

00:04:45.362 --> 00:04:46.582
 And one carbon tetrahedron. 

00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:48.322
 This steroid-related steroid, 

00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:49.658
 Is an alcoholic steroid 

00:04:49.658 --> 00:04:51.899
 Which is called sterol, 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.662
 This composition 

00:04:53.662 --> 00:04:56.647
 particulary 

00:04:56.647 --> 00:04:58.818
 Is known 

00:04:58.818 --> 00:05:00.500
 Cholesterol. 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.567
 Usually people think 

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:03.785
 Cholesterol 

00:05:03.785 --> 00:05:05.679
 bad thing 

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:07.036
 They always seek 

00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:10.485
 To ease it, 

00:05:10.485 --> 00:05:12.562
 But really 

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.525
 Is an important element 

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:19.260
 Of living things. 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.861
 It is an effective element 

00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:24.937
 In the conduct of the work of the cell, 

00:05:24.937 --> 00:05:26.842
 It is important for steroid hormones 

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:29.465
 Which help 

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:33.134
 In the configuration 

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:35.096
 Human. 

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:37.418
 This is another example 

00:05:37.418 --> 00:05:39.158
 Of steroid hormone 

00:05:39.158 --> 00:05:41.062
 It is a hormone 

00:05:41.062 --> 00:05:45.196
 Testosterone 

00:05:45.196 --> 00:05:48.423
 Derived from 

00:05:48.423 --> 00:05:49.920
 Cholesterol, 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.858
 As you can see 

00:05:52.858 --> 00:05:55.933
 Carbon rings 

00:05:55.933 --> 00:05:57.419
 Composed of 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.313
 Six carbonates 

00:05:58.313 --> 00:06:00.415
 The ring is composed 

00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:02.935
 Of five carbonates. 

00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:05.315
 Double Carbon Connector 

00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:06.695
 Located elsewhere, 

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:08.995
 And hydroxide 

00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:11.119
 Connected elsewhere 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:14.172
 Different from cholesterol 

00:06:14.172 --> 00:06:16.633
 In its carbonyl place 

00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:20.000
 Where the carbon is here 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.695
 Connected to oxygen with two bonds. 

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:24.852
 Cortisol, 

00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:27.778
 Derived from cholesterol 

00:06:27.778 --> 00:06:29.194
 A type of steroid hormone, 

00:06:29.194 --> 00:06:31.110
 Also has carbon rings 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.351
 Consisting of six carbonates 

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.831
 The ring is composed 

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:39.712
 Of five carbonates 

00:06:39.712 --> 00:06:41.093
 Which represents 

00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:42.638
 Stereoscopic installation 

00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:44.890
 Steroid. 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.409
 As we have seen 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.587
 That all 

00:06:51.587 --> 00:06:54.094
 Different 

00:06:54.094 --> 00:06:56.811
 Somehow. 

00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:00.745
 Composition of molecules 

00:07:00.745 --> 00:07:02.917
 With three-dimensional figures 

00:07:02.917 --> 00:07:03.974
 And look at it 

00:07:03.974 --> 00:07:06.435
 maybe 

00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:08.372
 Give us an idea 

00:07:08.372 --> 00:07:09.580
 About the shape of particles 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.171
 But 

00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:12.899
 Does not necessarily give us 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.059
 Its real shape, 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:17.207
 Light reflection 

00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:19.540
 Change the shape of things, 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.664
 Especially if their sizes are microscopic. 

00:07:21.664 --> 00:07:25.867
 To facilitate consideration 

00:07:25.867 --> 00:07:27.306
 On the stereo 

00:07:27.306 --> 00:07:29.385
 Can imagine 

00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:31.382
 White balls are hydrogen 

00:07:31.382 --> 00:07:34.401
 The gray is the carbon and the red is the oxygen. 

00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:36.966
 and that is 

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:39.763
 Probability 

00:07:39.763 --> 00:07:43.140
 For cortisol molecules. 

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.786
 Phospholipide is considered 

00:07:46.786 --> 00:07:48.528
 A well-known example 

00:07:48.528 --> 00:07:50.792
 Of amphibathic molecules 

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:53.369
 This has many common characteristics 

00:07:53.369 --> 00:07:55.423
 With the UltraSlide, 

00:07:55.423 --> 00:07:58.790
 Such as three carbonates 

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.448
 At the basis of the molecule, 

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.247
 whereas 

00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:06.406
 Each of 

00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:10.350
 Three carbonates 

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.462
 Connected 

00:08:11.462 --> 00:08:13.522
 A seed of oxygen, 

00:08:13.522 --> 00:08:14.869
 This is where it might be 

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:17.353
 Derived from glycerol. 

00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:18.886
 But the difference 

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:23.554
 Which we can see here 

00:08:23.554 --> 00:08:26.153
 Is that two are carbonates 

00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:28.267
 Connected to fatty acids 

00:08:28.267 --> 00:08:30.165
 The third is connected 

00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:32.823
 Phosphate group. 

00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:34.750
 These are 

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.967
 "R" 

00:08:36.967 --> 00:08:39.602
 Probably 

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:43.885
 To be a membership chain. 

00:08:43.885 --> 00:08:46.881
 As mentioned earlier 

00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:48.043
 That molecules 

00:08:48.043 --> 00:08:50.712
 Type of
