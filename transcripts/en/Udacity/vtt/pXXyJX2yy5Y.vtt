ANKE: Marketing is all around us, and it's
constantly evolving.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.083
The world has gone digital and so has marketing.

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:13.500
Actually, annually about seventy billion dollars
in the U. S. alone

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
is spent on digital marketing.

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:18.750
DANIEL: At Udacity, we've partnered with the leaders
in advertising and social media,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.083
to prepare you for a career in digital marketing.

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:24.792
AVINASH: Digital marketing allows you
to unleash creativity

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:28.625
way, way, way more than the marketing
used to be able to do in the past.

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:31.041
When I went to MBA school fifteen, sixteen years ago.

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.709
They taught me in my marketing class the holy grail is right person, right time, right message.

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:39.875
The internet is the only platform that actually makes it possible.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:42.250
And that's why I am excited about digital marketing.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.583
NING: We're real excited to collaborate with Udacity,

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:47.125
to help students out there to learn,

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:51.208
not just about Facebook itself, but really to learn the fundamentals of marketing.

00:00:51.208 --> 00:00:55.583
ANKE: We built this Nanodegree program to teach you the full range of digital marketing skills.

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:59.250
From search to social media, display advertising,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250
email marketing and analytics.

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:05.291
DAN: What makes this program special are all the real world projects that we have built in.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:09.375
So students get to run live advertising campaigns on major marketing platforms.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:12.250
And then get expert feedback to improve their results.

00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:17.625
AVINASH: And the biggest, most amazing, awesome advantage of

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:20.667
taking the course that Udacity and Google have partnered on,

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:24.333
is that you get a ton of practical knowledge.

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:26.709
We're very excited about this program,

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.625
and we're really looking forward to seeing our students launching their careers in digital marketing.
