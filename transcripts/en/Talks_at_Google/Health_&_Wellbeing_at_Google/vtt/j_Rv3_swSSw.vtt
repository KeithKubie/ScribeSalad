[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:09.652
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.652 --> 00:00:11.610
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Thank
you for joining us today.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.200
I am also a UW alum, so
I'm excited to be back

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.862
in that territory.

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:19.070
DAVID LEVIN: So when I first
saw this book, "Creating

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.945
Compassionate Kids,
Essential Conversations,"

00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:23.270
my impression was that
it's a book for parents

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.470
with young children.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.039
Is that the audience?

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.830
What's your intended
audience for the book?

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.020
SHAUNA TOMINEY: So my intended
audience is, like you said,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.650
parents.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.720
But I define parents
very broadly.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.240
There are a lot of people who
are serving a parenting role

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.570
in the lives of young children.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.020
We have parents who
are biological parents,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.560
foster parents, step-parents,
grandparents, aunts and uncles.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.050
Sometimes its neighbors,
community members,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.000
early childhood teachers
or other caregivers,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.620
really anybody with young
children in their lives.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.120
DAVID LEVIN: And there's some
emphasis on young children

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.800
and kids, but what about
teenagers and older kids?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.970
Does it apply to them at all?

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.050
SHAUNA TOMINEY: I think that a
lot of the foundation of what

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.470
we do with our young
children forms the foundation

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.930
for those relationships
that we have with older kids

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.010
and with teens.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.909
And so often, the same
things that we struggle

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.450
with our younger
children-- how do we

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.940
have conversations
about tough topics?

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.529
How do we help them manage
their tough emotions?

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:22.070
This is something that doesn't
go away as children get older.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.470
So there are some things
in the book that are very

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.850
specific to young children--

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.060
I make storybook recommendations
for how to talk about some

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.380
of these topics--

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.442
that really are targeted
for those picture

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:33.650
books and those younger ages.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.010
But a lot of the messages
lay that foundation

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.080
that should be true
throughout childhood

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.456
and into the teen years.

00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:44.016
DAVID LEVIN: One other broad
question about the book.

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:45.890
Now there have been a
lot of parenting books.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.350
And some of them give
perhaps questionable

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.840
advice that sometimes doesn't
seem so good in retrospect.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.737
How do we know we can
trust your book here?

00:01:55.737 --> 00:01:56.571
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:56.571 --> 00:01:58.490
SHAUNA TOMINEY: That's
a great question,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.740
and an important question
to ask, especially

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.280
because we know how easy
it is to get information.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.560
And how many of you are parents?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.300
Can I ask?

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.030
OK, so the vast
majority in the room.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.610
And whether you're a parent
now or plan to be a parent,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.590
or have a young
child in your life

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.870
or an older child in
your life in another way,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.060
we are inundated
with information

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.450
on what it means to be a parent,
what parenting looks like, what

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.490
parenting should look like.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.170
And sometimes that information
is very, very conflicting.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.404
I teach a parenting class
at Oregon State University.

00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:34.820
And one of the
activities we do is

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.790
we pick topics like
immunizations or some

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.680
of these other
challenging topics

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.340
that might have conflicting
viewpoints represented

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.900
on the internet or
in other sources,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.649
and look at where do you
find that information.

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.690
And what you find is that
you'll find information

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.529
on all sides of an argument.

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.070
And so that's a great question
to ask about a parenting book.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.111
Because the same is true.

00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:58.160
There are a lot of
parenting books out.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.030
And many of them offer
potentially conflicting advice

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.120
or sometimes advice that's not
really grounded in research.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.260
So one of the
beliefs that I have

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.600
is that you should be very
transparent about where

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.220
your information comes from.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.070
And so I try to be really
open in the book itself

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.500
about both my personal
experiences, which are

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.300
blended into what I talk about.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.500
I've been an early
childhood educator.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.130
I've been a parenting educator,
and trained in those best

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.500
practices for how
we teach children

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.320
about emotions, how
we teach them to talk

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.710
about these tough topics.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.700
And quite frankly,
there's a lot that we

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.310
know in child development
about how children grow,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.950
develop, and thrive.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.420
But as parents, it's not so easy
to take that information that's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.510
in the textbooks
that are available

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.490
and actually turn that
into parenting practices

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.990
and deal with the
challenges that we

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.730
might have every day
with our young children.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.280
And so in coming to this,
having been in the field,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.560
having heard thousands
of conversations

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.890
with children and parents
around the country,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.900
and seen what parents
really struggle with,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.490
what I've tried to do is take
the research we know about--

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.030
OK, what is it that
helps children thrive--

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.980
and put it into
practice, but also

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.640
blend that with those
personal stories.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.098
So I try to be as
clear as possible

00:04:16.098 --> 00:04:18.950
of where that's happening so
that the reader has a chance

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.920
to take that
information in yourself.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.110
Now in this book, we
go through and talk

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.510
about different examples of
challenging conversations

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.040
to have with young children.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.990
And I'll never say
there's one right way

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.620
to talk about this topic.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.130
Here are some examples.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.950
Here's what we know in research.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.440
And let's add this to
your parenting toolbox

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.885
so you can make a choice.

00:04:39.885 --> 00:04:41.890
DAVID LEVIN: And I really like
how after the conversations,

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.030
you go through and
you go, these are

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.400
the key things that we're trying
to do in this conversation.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.715
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Yeah.

00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:47.798
DAVID LEVIN: So you can
take away that and kind of

00:04:47.798 --> 00:04:49.735
adapt the conversation
to your style somewhat.

00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:50.860
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Absolutely.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.170
DAVID LEVIN: And I think you did
a great job of explaining it.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.680
And I know in the about
section about you,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.860
it says that you blend practical
experience with research

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.510
to develop and
test programs aimed

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.870
at promoting social emotional
skills for children and adults.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.594
And I felt like that
kind of captured

00:05:06.594 --> 00:05:09.010
a little bit of what you were
doing in the book, where you

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.720
kind of talk about some
of the practical side,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.220
and you mentioned the references
to various bits of research

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.340
throughout.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.680
One of the first things you
cover in the book was you

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.312
said there's the most
important conversation

00:05:20.312 --> 00:05:21.520
you can have with your child.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.690
What is that?

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.690
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Well, one of
the most important conversations

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.110
you can really have is about
loving and accepting your child

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.560
for who they are.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.120
That's absolutely foundational
to building trust,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.410
to let your child know that
you're not always going

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.120
to love everything they do.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.850
You're not always going
to be behind every choice

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.210
that they make.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.560
But you'll always be there
for them as a person.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.560
And that's moving
toward that acceptance

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.620
of who they are without shaming
them for being that person.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.580
So really looking at how do we
love and accept our children

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.310
for who they are, and help
them understand not only

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.950
who they are now, but
who they will grow into

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.395
and who they will
become as we also

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:04.790
then help guide them through
some of these challenges.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.570
Because we don't always
like what our children do.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.657
We don't always like or support
the decisions they make.

00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:12.490
But that doesn't mean
that we won't be there

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.030
for them to come back to us, and
feel like they have that trust

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.140
to know that we'll be
there, no matter what.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.940
DAVID LEVIN: Yeah.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.344
And I hear you mentioning
trust a lot right now.

00:06:21.344 --> 00:06:23.260
And I feel like that's
a theme that you hit on

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.180
throughout the book.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.620
Why is that so important,
the trust with your child

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.465
and so on?

00:06:28.465 --> 00:06:30.370
SHAUNA TOMINEY:
Well, as I mentioned,

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.450
having that trust is so
foundational to relationships

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.520
in early childhood and beyond.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.126
When children feel
like they can trust

00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:40.000
the parents and the
caregivers in their lives

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.300
to be there for them, they're
more likely to turn to them

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.070
when challenges come up.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.790
They want to be like them.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.970
They want to learn from them.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.610
It's easier to teach and
guide them along the way.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.480
We also know that when
children experience stress--

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.620
which we all do.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.000
We all experience stress.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.010
And so often as
a parent, we want

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.230
to shield our child from stress.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.270
We want to keep them
kids as long as possible.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.450
And we want to help them
avoid stressful situations.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.819
But the reality is they're
going to experience stress.

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:12.610
And they're going to
experience challenges.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.140
And knowing that we will be
there to help them through that

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.367
can have serious implications.

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:20.950
We're seeing in
research that children

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.100
who have trusting relationships
with adults in their lives

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.470
who can help them through
stress can actually

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.672
minimize the impact of
that stress long term.

00:07:30.672 --> 00:07:32.740
DAVID LEVIN: And how
do the conversations

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.350
that we have with our kids
help to build that trust?

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.890
What types of things
do we do, or even

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.314
not do or maybe undermine it?

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:41.230
You can touch on both.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.882
SHAUNA TOMINEY:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:42.882 --> 00:07:44.590
I think one of the
biggest things we hear

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.820
is that children--

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.560
as I mentioned, as
parents, we often

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.465
want to protect our
children from stress.

00:07:53.465 --> 00:07:55.090
And we want to protect
them from things

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.100
that we're worried
they're not ready for yet.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.070
There's so much out
there in the world

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.570
that our children
are going to face.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.986
There are so many
things that they

00:08:02.986 --> 00:08:05.140
might see, that
they might overhear,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.960
that they might become
exposed to on the internet,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.940
at school, on the
news, whether or not

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.220
we want them to
be exposed to it,

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.320
that oftentimes, when our
very young children come

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.820
to us with these
questions of things

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.210
that they're seeing or
hearing, we turn to them

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.590
and say, well, let's talk
about that when you're older.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:28.150
Or let's wait and talk
about that another time.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.240
And what we mean is,
I want to protect you.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.890
I want you to be a child
as long as possible.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.880
I don't want you to have
to worry about that now.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.150
What our children
might hear is, I can't

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.350
come to you to talk about this.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.590
And that's something that
we really want to avoid,

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.530
is not giving our
child that message

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.357
without meaning
to that we're not

00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:51.190
going to be the ones
who are there to answer

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.382
those questions for them.

00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:54.340
DAVID LEVIN: Yeah, and
I think related to that,

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.020
you have a whole
chapter in here devoted

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.920
to heavy topics like death
and divorce and so on.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.700
And yet those related for
kids and young children.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.077
Is this something that we can
wait to talk to them about?

00:09:06.077 --> 00:09:07.910
I think you were talking
about some already.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.207
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Yeah.

00:09:09.207 --> 00:09:09.790
You know what?

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.030
It really depends on our
child, the age of our child,

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.610
who our child is, and
what we experience.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.400
So often we talk to our
child about what we know.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.760
We talk to them about what it
is we are experiencing, what it

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.470
is we know that they're seeing.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.310
And if you don't mind me
stepping back a moment,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.790
just in setting this up--

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.080
when I have had the
opportunity to really

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.480
live in different
places in the country

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.090
and to hear the different
kinds of conversations

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.430
that children and adults
have in different settings.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.220
And one of the
things that I've seen

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.330
is that most parents talk
to children about how much

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.600
they love them, their hopes
and their dreams for them,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.600
what they want for them.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.550
But there are also
a lot of differences

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.370
in the kinds of conversations
that parents and children have,

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.560
and that varies by context.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.580
And there are some
children who never

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.710
grow up talking
about death, or never

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.497
grow up talking about stress.

00:10:09.497 --> 00:10:11.580
But on the flip side, there
are other families who

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.485
talk about that all the time.

00:10:13.485 --> 00:10:15.360
So when I was working
with military families,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.820
for example, those
families were talking

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.010
about the stress
of being deployed

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.560
or separated from a loved one
from for a long period of time,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.400
and the possible death
or the reality of having

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.210
a death in the
family as a result.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:34.770
When I was working in
inner city urban areas,

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.850
there were families there who
talked every day about how

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.100
the impact of the color
of their child's skin

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.740
would affect how they
were being looked at,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.260
the opportunities that
they had, or the reason

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.240
that people would
cross the street

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.610
to avoid standing next to them.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.830
And yet these were the
kinds of conversations

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.470
that other families
weren't having.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.560
And often, when I think
about this, and whether

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.200
or not we should tackle some of
these tough conversations, what

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.260
I'm reminded of is that
some of these topics

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.580
define a young child's
life every single day.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.890
There are parents who
don't have a choice, who

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.930
have to tackle
these tough topics

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.000
because they define
their child's life,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.400
how their child is looked
at, the opportunities

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.930
that their child has.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.790
And it was having
that experience

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.190
to see all of these
different experiences

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.680
that children and families had
that really got me thinking

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.290
about this book, and to
think about, how do I

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.820
as a parent use this opportunity
that I've had to see and peer

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.760
into the lives of all of
these children and families,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.550
and to think about for my own
child and then the children

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.300
that I work with, how do we
help them be more compassionate?

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.430
How do we help them
get those skills

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.702
to prepare for what they
might face in their lives,

00:11:47.702 --> 00:11:49.410
but also to be more
understanding of what

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.810
other children might be
experiencing around our country

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.410
and around the world?

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.439
And so in a
not-so-small nutshell,

00:11:57.439 --> 00:11:58.980
that's one of my
arguments for why we

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.900
should talk about these topics.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.970
When our children
want to learn from us,

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.430
this is a chance to help
them learn about the world,

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.770
about others' experiences, to
be more compassionate to that,

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.820
but then also to talk about
skills that they might need

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.070
when they face those
challenges, or if they face

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.052
those challenges in the future.

00:12:16.052 --> 00:12:17.787
DAVID LEVIN: So given--

00:12:17.787 --> 00:12:20.370
let's say we buy this, that we
should have that conversation--

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.369
what are some strategies
that we can use to have

00:12:22.369 --> 00:12:23.580
these types of conversations?

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.410
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Sure.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.940
So in the book, I
break down the sections

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.260
into different types
of conversations.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.900
And one set of conversations
is really about emotions,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.510
and how we help children
manage those tough emotions.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.320
And I think that each of these--

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.670
as I'll just briefly touch
on-- these different sections

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.460
and types of conversations we
have have different strategies

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.180
that go along with them.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.590
And so one of the starting
sections that I talk about

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.010
in the book is how we
set up that relationship

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.250
with our children,
really listening to them

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.270
and giving them a chance to
share, giving them a chance

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.130
to listen, and
that back and forth

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.130
that goes on between
parents or other adults

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.740
and the children in their lives.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.905
In that first section,
where we talk about some

00:13:12.905 --> 00:13:14.280
of these strategies
for how do we

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.664
do this when our children have
those really tough emotions?

00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:19.080
That's one of the
questions that I

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.930
think I'm asked most
often about parents,

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.340
is how do we talk to children
about those really hard

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.440
challenging emotions?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.010
And it's such a big challenge
for a lot of different reasons.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.520
So if you think about--

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.740
I'm going to turn things
on you for just a moment.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.740
Those of you who have children--
most folks in the room--

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.160
what are the skills
that a new baby

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.119
has to communicate or
to have a conversation?

00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:49.160
How do they let us know
when they need something?

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.040
AUDIENCE: Crying.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.920
AUDIENCE: Crying.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.650
SHAUNA TOMINEY: OK, just
heard the universal word, cry.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.250
What else?

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.240
What else do they do?

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.281
AUDIENCE: They'll fidget.

00:13:59.281 --> 00:13:59.860
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Fidget?

00:13:59.860 --> 00:13:59.990
OK.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.885
AUDIENCE: Just move around.

00:14:00.885 --> 00:14:02.426
SHAUNA TOMINEY:
Yeah, move your body?

00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:04.050
Yeah, move around.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.220
Tense, get tense, kick, scream.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.780
We hope sometimes smile.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.820
Laugh at some point.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.970
We hope for those moments too.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.060
But when our children
are born, they

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.990
are essentially programmed
to be a ball of impulses

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.440
and instincts, to use their
bodies and their cries

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.170
to let us know that
they need something.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.620
Now when we're talking about
how do we have conversations

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.000
with young children who
are kicking and screaming

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.457
and they can't
talk back with us,

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.790
when they get a little bit
older and all they want to do

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.490
is run around with a
diaper on their head,

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.870
we have to get really creative.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.410
First, we can let
them know that we're

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.720
recognizing those
emotions as the way

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.970
that they're
expressing themselves.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.190
And as parents,
oftentimes it's our goal

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.280
to help children move from
being that child who's

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.150
kicking and screaming and
tensing and sometimes smiling,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.350
to being able to say, I'm
angry, or I'm frustrated,

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.010
or I'm kind of grumpy,
can you help me calm down?

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.586
How many of you know
adults who can do that?

00:15:10.586 --> 00:15:12.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.610
Maybe not as many as we'd like.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.470
And so in recognizing that
our children's emotions

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.150
are actually--

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.010
the way that they
express them are

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.720
a way of communicating a need,
and then talking about that,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.886
labeling it, being able
to use words ourselves,

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:30.260
and to be a role
model in the way

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.470
that we talk about our
own emotions to help them

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.180
learn to do that.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.010
And in showing our
children they can

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.920
trust us to talk
about their emotions

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.460
really in a teaching
kind of way,

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.430
rather than a punishing
way, we can also

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.920
help set the stage for
these other conversations.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.950
So for thinking about
how we go about tackling

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.986
these more complex topics
as our children are ready.

00:15:51.986 --> 00:15:54.420
DAVID LEVIN: So you mentioned
emotions and handling them,

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.800
and some adults have
trouble with that.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.060
So what are we do when
we're even having trouble

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.260
with managing our emotions?

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.240
How can we teach the
skills to our kids?

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.980
SHAUNA TOMINEY: That's
a great question.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.740
Because as adults,
this isn't something

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.840
that we're always
taught ourselves either,

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.410
in terms of OK, when we
get really frustrated, that

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.100
impulse of that kicking
and that screaming toddler

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.290
still lives within us sometimes.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.120
And to really be able
to step back and say,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.690
I'm frustrated, I'm
angry, what's going on--

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.730
this is a great chance to
practice thinking about, OK,

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.004
what is it I want
my child to do when

00:16:29.004 --> 00:16:30.170
they're having this feeling?

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:35.120
And what's our family emotion
rule for frustration or anger

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.440
or stress?

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.060
Our children have
these feelings.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.280
How can we teach them to
show it in a way that's

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.632
effective and appropriate?

00:16:42.632 --> 00:16:44.090
And then coming
back to ourselves--

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.170
to think about well,
let's talk about this.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.380
What does this look like?

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.446
And now I should be practicing
this too as a parent.

00:16:50.446 --> 00:16:52.070
So if this is our
family emotion rule--

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.210
if our rule is that we're going
to try our hardest to not kick

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.880
and throw and scream, but
to stop and say, I'm angry,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.490
I've got to try that too.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.190
And when I don't,
then think about--

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.400
all right, when my child
can't do this either,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.810
what do I want them to do?

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.390
To step back and say, I
should have done something

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.530
differently.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.140
And our child will never
do that, or a teenager--

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.042
imagine them coming in
and saying, you know,

00:17:17.042 --> 00:17:19.250
last night when you wouldn't
let me take the car out,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.160
and I got so mad and I
just started yelling--

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.780
Dad, I shouldn't have done that.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.700
Next time, I'm going
to take a deep breath

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.380
and I'm going to come to you
and tell you how I'm feeling.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.020
Can you imagine a
teenager doing that?

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.600
They won't unless we do that
and model it for them first.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.156
It's going to take a lot
of work, but it's worth it.

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:40.280
DAVID LEVIN: So I'm going
to keep asking questions.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:40.470
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Sure.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.136
DAVID LEVIN: But I
also want to invite--

00:17:42.136 --> 00:17:44.180
if any of you have questions
about conversations

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.013
with your kids, feel
free to come to the mic

00:17:46.013 --> 00:17:49.180
and we'll start to mix those in.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.930
And if not, we'll just
keep going up here.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.380
You can listen to the
two of us talking.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.485
So when I read this--

00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:57.110
I read it pretty much
straight through,

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.340
given the timing and all.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.246
And I almost felt overwhelmed
by the amount of information

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.870
here, and trying to
think about it all.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.180
How would you recommend
that people can kind of

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.884
absorb it and apply it best?

00:18:06.884 --> 00:18:08.550
SHAUNA TOMINEY: That's
a great question.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.150
There's a lot of
information in this book.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.890
And it's divided
up, as I mentioned,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.230
into different sections
that tackle different kinds

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.140
of conversations.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.089
So one section is on those
foundational conversations

00:18:19.089 --> 00:18:21.380
about letting our children
know that they can trust us,

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.180
that we love them,
that we're going

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.110
to manage their emotions in a
way that's teaching and guiding

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.835
rather than punitive.

00:18:28.835 --> 00:18:32.960
Another section on
self-awareness and acceptance,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.960
and really helping children
learn about the qualities

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.470
that will make them who
they are, to those qualities

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.950
that make others who they are.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.160
And those conversations
include topics

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.080
like sex, gender, gender
identity, race, culture,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.270
different types of families.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.030
And then moving into another
section on conversations

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.700
that focus on tough
topics, like you mentioned,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:01.739
Dave, divorce, death,
suicide, guns, stress, sex,

00:19:01.739 --> 00:19:03.280
some of these
challenging topics that

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.650
come up over time, and
sometimes earlier than we

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.570
expect with our children.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.910
And then the final section
is on these conversations

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.940
that help us think about all
that we've been learning,

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.510
and applying that to
friendships, to relationships

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.160
inside and outside
of the family,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.350
to recognizing privilege,
to really thinking

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.200
about how do we find our
voice and make a difference?

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:28.240
And along with that come very
specific and concrete ideas,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.420
so storybook recommendations
with discussion questions,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.020
family activities,
parenting Q &amp; A's.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.350
With all of that being
packed into one book,

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:43.810
I really encourage folks to pick
it up and take a look at what's

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.230
helpful at different times.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.260
It's the kind of book that
you can read straight through.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.060
But it may be hard to go through
and really think about, now

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.760
how do I apply this at home
if you're not taking it little

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.280
by little.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.821
So it's the kind of
book that's meant

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.660
to be taken in snippets
if it's helpful.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.626
DAVID LEVIN: Yeah,
really, I guess I

00:20:00.626 --> 00:20:01.750
like two things about that.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.849
One, I like the index in back.

00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:05.890
So if you're having some
struggle with some topic

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.720
or whatever, you can look back
there and see if it's covered.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.430
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Absolutely.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.540
DAVID LEVIN: And two,
like you mentioned,

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.690
at the end of the
chapters, there's

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.740
the book recommendations.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.780
How do those tie in
and help with you

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.180
understanding or working
through the topics better?

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.420
SHAUNA TOMINEY: So
storybooks are a great way

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.330
to tackle topics that
we might not otherwise

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.250
feel prepared to talk
about with our children.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.080
It can be a great
way to also take

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.310
a look at challenges like
challenging emotions, anger

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.110
or frustration, outside of those
emotionally charged moments.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.480
If our children are in the
middle of a tantrum, that's

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.562
not always the best
time to say, oh,

00:20:36.562 --> 00:20:38.020
I can see you're
really frustrated.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.822
Let's talk about what
you should do instead.

00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:42.280
They're going to
keep on tantruming

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.630
and kicking and screaming.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.640
They are emotionally charged.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.950
They are in that fight,
flight, or freeze mode--

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.650
not so much freeze,
more of that fight mode.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.150
And they're not listening.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.270
They're not learning.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:57.700
But we can use books to pull out
of that situation and say, OK--

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.580
oh, look what made this
character field really angry

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.590
or frustrated or disappointed.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.210
Have you ever felt that way?

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.460
What do we do when
we feel that way?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.210
So that's one way.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:13.600
Another way that I think books
and storybooks are so important

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.490
is it's a way to build
empathy, to learn

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.940
about others' experiences, to
be able to bring in role models

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.500
to your child's life of
people who look like they do,

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.590
who think like they
do, dress like they do,

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.680
have a family that
looks like theirs.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.930
And that's harder
to do for children

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.570
who come from a
non-dominant culture,

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.834
or who have a
non-dominant family type.

00:21:36.834 --> 00:21:38.500
We have to really
work hard to make sure

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.440
our children have role
models who look like they do,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.280
so that they feel
valued, so that they

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.912
feel like part of a community.

00:21:46.912 --> 00:21:48.370
And I think the
last thing I'll say

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.280
about that is I think it's
important for children who come

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.590
from dominant groups
and dominant cultures

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.760
also to have those role models
from minority and non-dominant

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.700
groups so that those children
see one another as part

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.650
of that same community too.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.480
So I've tried really
hard in this book

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.500
to come up with a wide range
of storybook recommendations

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.570
that really depict
children and families

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.580
in different
situations, experiencing

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.710
different challenges
and strengths,

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.120
so that we can have those
role models for our children.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.820
DAVID LEVIN: Sounds great.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.930
I think we have a question.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:19.385
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Sure.

00:22:19.385 --> 00:22:21.070
AUDIENCE: So my
question is around kind

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.169
of like the age range.

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:23.710
I'm sure the skill
system and methods

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.410
that you talk about in
your book apply to children

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.770
throughout their lives.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.400
But would you say that
there is a cutoff,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.280
or an age range where these
conversations become really

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.130
crucial or have a lasting
impact on kind of, I guess,

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.630
how compassionate
children become?

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.100
SHAUNA TOMINEY: That's
a great question.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.540
I think that just to tackle age
range, the book, I would say,

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.755
is ideal in the 0 to
8 or 9 age range is

00:22:49.755 --> 00:22:51.880
where I'd put it in terms
of where the conversation

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.950
examples are coming
from, as well as

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.570
where the storybooks
are the best fit.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.780
But I think it's
also never too late.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.750
It's never too late
to have a conversation

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.060
or to build a relationship
with your child

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.120
where you can help them
practice these skills.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.550
We've got to look at
compassion like a scale

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.980
or a set of skills,
just like anything else,

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.440
just like emotion regulation,
just like anything

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.150
that we're learning
and practicing.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.470
And it may be harder
later on if children

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.330
haven't had a lot of practice.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.800
But again, it's never too late.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.670
I once had a parent sitting in
a workshop with me who said,

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.990
so I've got teenage
boys at home,

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.510
and the stuff you're
talking about emotions

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.770
and how we talk about it,
I want to do that now.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:34.910
So what do I do?

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.390
Do I just go home and say,
this is how we roll now,

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.600
and we're just going to talk
about emotions from now on?

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.760
And it was a real question
that he was asking.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.920
Because he hadn't been
doing this at home.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.890
And he said, well, what do I do
if I now see the value in this

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.960
and I just want
to change things?

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.470
And a big part of that
is putting yourself

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:54.680
up as a role model.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.930
And so coming home and opening
yourself up and saying,

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.100
OK, I had a tough
day at work today,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.019
and I kind of want
to talk about this.

00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:03.060
Did anyone else have these
kinds of feelings too?

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.350
What do you think I
should do about this?

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.210
So I hope that
answers your question.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.150
DAVID LEVIN: And we'll
go to their question.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.840
But I think one thing
that I got out of it

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.464
is that it's really
good that you start

00:24:15.464 --> 00:24:17.630
from a very young age, even
before your children are

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.500
non-verbal and so on, to start
to have these conversations.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.400
And I think you're
emphasizing that,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.440
that that's where the
trust comes from and so

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.226
on, just continuing throughout.

00:24:27.226 --> 00:24:28.350
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Absolutely.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.880
What are your thoughts about
a conversation with children

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.180
about their relationship
with technology,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.420
so that they are in
control and use tech

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:47.130
as their tools to
achieve their goals?

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.160
Because otherwise,
a parent that stands

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.990
in the way between
a child and a screen

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:56.640
can cause strong
emotions in a child.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.260
I think that's a sight
that can be often found.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.800
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Yeah.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.920
That's a great question.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.150
I think technology is such
a big part of our lives,

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.010
and such a big part of
our children's lives,

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.430
and even more so for them now
than it was for us growing up.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.150
And society is continuing
to move in that direction.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.770
And I touch a little
bit on technology.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.920
I don't have it as a
specific topic in the book.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.760
I mention it a little
bit here and there.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.430
But I think that like
with anything else,

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.100
we have to be a role
model, in looking

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:31.860
at how do we be a good
citizen in using technology?

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.040
What are all of the
strengths that technology

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.580
brings to our lives?

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.550
What are the capacities
that it brings?

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.490
What are all of those
tools that can really

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.390
enhance what we're doing, our
effectiveness, our efficiency?

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.820
But then also looking at what
are some of the challenges?

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.861
So some of the ways that
technology is coming out

00:25:49.861 --> 00:25:52.800
as problematic is
in cyberbullying,

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.300
or in some of the
ways that children

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.150
are relating to
each other outside

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.410
of those personal moments.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.020
Sometimes we interact with one
another in a different way when

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.789
it comes out over technology.

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:04.830
And I really try to think
about it in my own life

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.310
too as a parent, modeling what
we want to see in our children.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.440
So thinking about, if
we want our children

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.050
to set limits around
the time or the way

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:16.380
that they're using technology,
we have to model that too.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.960
We have to talk about it, share
those family values around it.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.760
What are our rules with that?

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.270
And then also
thinking about how do

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.030
we engage our children in
that technology in a really

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:27.910
healthy way?

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.800
So one of the things that, for
me, as a parent, for example--

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.570
and I know many of you
as parents probably

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.197
think about this too--

00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:37.530
when it's the first day of
school, what do I want to do?

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.170
Take a picture and put
it up on social media.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.500
My daughter has not wanted
me to take a picture

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.810
and put it on social media
for the last three years.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.300
So since she was
in kindergarten,

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.030
I have not posted a first
day of school picture,

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.220
as much as I've wanted to.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.450
And that's hard as a parent.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.330
Because I think, well,
this is my life too.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.300
But it's also hers, to
decide how she's shown,

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.500
and how she's depicted.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.670
And that I've seen as just
one little lesson in terms

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.430
of saying, OK, you've
got to remember,

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.730
I will always do this for you.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.970
If you don't want to be
shown on social media,

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.160
I won't put your
picture there, just

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.740
like how you should treat other
people in the way that you

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.220
talk to people, or talk about
people, or whether or not you

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.050
post a picture, or
take something down

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.340
when you're asked.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.410
We have to learn how to
treat people respectfully

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.840
across these platforms,
while also valuing

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.655
all of the amazing capacity
that technology brings.

00:27:32.655 --> 00:27:36.370
Yeah, thank you.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.620
DAVID LEVIN: I think you've
touched on it a little bit

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.036
there, but in a
part of your book,

00:27:40.036 --> 00:27:41.500
you talk about I
think respecting

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.960
the boundaries of
kids too, when they're

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.972
talking about things like,
oh, go give that uncle a hug

00:27:46.972 --> 00:27:48.930
or whatever, and they're
like, I don't want to,

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.160
and how do you deal with
this type of situation?

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.630
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Sure.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.760
Well, and I think it does
relate to technology,

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.180
and it relates to a lot of areas
what you're talking about too

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.340
is in relation to
your body and who

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.810
has control over what you do.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.940
And as we are raising our
children-- one of the reasons

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.010
that I think having these
kinds of conversations

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.520
is so important, and tackling
tough conversation topics

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.650
is so important, is
it gives us a chance

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.170
to help our children build
skills to think about

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.970
what do you want and
what do you not want,

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.511
and how do you speak up when
you need something or don't want

00:28:22.511 --> 00:28:23.480
something?

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.200
But then also showing them
that we will follow through

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.010
with that.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.980
For a child to say, I don't
want to hug that person--

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.670
it's pretty common to say, no,
go and hug your grandparents,

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.920
or go hug your uncle,
or go hug your aunt.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.920
But then we're telling
our child that they don't

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.230
have control over their body.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.520
And if we really want them
to believe that they do,

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.660
we've got to listen to that too.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.680
And I think part of having
those tough conversations

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:54.050
into other topics as well is
learning that over time, we

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.192
have to give more and
more trust to our child

00:28:56.192 --> 00:28:57.650
in terms of them
being able to make

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.830
those decisions for themselves,
and them having the skills

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:03.080
that they need to
manage conversations

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.940
or tough situations
that will come up.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.520
Because we won't
always be there.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.310
DAVID LEVIN: But it is there
a possibility of giving them

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.040
too much choice
and too much mand--

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.765
I don't know-- kind of like
let them rule the whole thing?

00:29:16.765 --> 00:29:18.170
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Absolutely.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:18.750
Absolutely.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.470
I think boundaries are
also very important.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:22.970
We can't say to a
child, I'll listen

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.620
to what you need in
terms of technology,

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.578
and they say, OK, well,
I'd like to watch shows

00:29:26.578 --> 00:29:30.930
for five hours on this
device or that device.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.340
We also set boundaries.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.060
And I think as parents, we also
need to communicate our family

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.060
values, whether
it is technology,

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:44.261
or whose choices it is related
to your own body or anything

00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:44.760
else.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.520
One of the things-- just to
give an example in the book--

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.978
in talking about sex, which is
a challenging topic for many

00:29:48.978 --> 00:29:51.951
families--

00:29:51.951 --> 00:29:54.200
there's been some research
showing that teens actually

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.380
wish that their parents
talked more to them

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.870
about family values
around sex, where they're

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.930
getting a lot of talks
around safe sex practices,

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:07.190
but not necessarily about
those family values.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.140
That's not always the case.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.297
But that has to be
a piece of this too.

00:30:12.297 --> 00:30:13.880
DAVID LEVIN: We have
another question.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.140
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Yeah.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.840
My wife and I come from
a different country,

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.730
and we have different
experiences growing up.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.847
Our kids grow up here.

00:30:22.847 --> 00:30:24.680
They have a much more
comfortable lifestyle,

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.690
I feel like, in general,
at least I think so.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.870
So one of the difficult
conversation topics

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.884
usually arise when there
is a sense of entitlement.

00:30:32.884 --> 00:30:35.300
At least my wife and I feel
like, when we were growing up,

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.510
we didn't have this or that.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:42.185
And you kind of talked about
it earlier about storybooks.

00:30:42.185 --> 00:30:44.810
Do you have any other techniques
to kind of show them, hey, you

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.310
know what?

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:50.630
Maybe try to get a better
perspective on their situation,

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.800
as far as you growing up here
versus where we grew up from.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.360
Do you have any other tools
aside from like storybooks,

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.295
any other techniques?

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:00.170
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Yeah.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.000
Well, one, that you
were talking about too

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.420
is sharing your
personal stories,

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.920
sharing what it was
like growing up.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.050
My mom is an immigrant.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:06.370
She's from Taiwan.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.828
AUDIENCE: It that
tends to be like,

00:31:07.828 --> 00:31:11.136
oh, she keeps saying that again,
that again, that story again?

00:31:11.136 --> 00:31:13.760
SHAUNA TOMINEY: But also to say
this is really important for me

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.510
to share with you.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.880
Because this is what it was
like when I was growing up.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.140
This is what it's like here.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:22.580
And I think that even in passing
through the day-- at holiday

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.670
time, sometimes when it seems
like there's so much and so

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.190
much more than maybe
others are experiencing,

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.170
to be able to talk about
that, that we are very

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.690
fortunate here, and pointing
out those things that we're

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.330
really grateful for, talking
about gratitude, what it is

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:36.590
we're thankful for.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.370
Because others don't
always have these things.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.090
And these are
things in our lives

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.330
that we really appreciate.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.320
But it's hard
sometimes when you're

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.800
fighting against the
excitement of new things,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.630
or having more
with young children

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.870
to have those conversations.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.580
But I it's important
to continually,

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.810
in a way that both allows them
to be kids and celebrate what

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:03.110
they want to celebrate,
have that continual reminder

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.660
of this is something we
should be thankful for.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.440
Writing thank you notes,
talking about gratitude,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.810
why we're grateful for things.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:15.560
And also-- I'll go back to
that example of storybooks--

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.960
but I think it is
important to show

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.955
what other children
experience, and how that's

00:32:19.955 --> 00:32:21.830
similar to and different
from your own lives,

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.710
to build that empathy and
that understanding as well.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.185
Yeah, thank you.

00:32:28.185 --> 00:32:29.810
DAVID LEVIN: So you
talked a little bit

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.605
in these various things about
being an example and all.

00:32:32.605 --> 00:32:33.480
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Yeah.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:37.910
DAVID LEVIN: And so if we want
to teach our kids compassion,

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:42.150
is just being nice to other
people just good enough?

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.460
SHAUNA TOMINEY: It's a start.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.230
It's a good start.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.490
And it's amazing to see how much
or how little children pick up

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.077
on.

00:32:52.077 --> 00:32:53.910
One of the examples I
used in the book, just

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.980
a simple example,
was holding the door

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.305
open for somebody else.

00:32:57.305 --> 00:33:00.620
If you hold the door open for
somebody else and your child's

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.390
standing there right next
to you, so you think,

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.510
they are seeing me stand here
and being a good role model.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.870
Your child may be thinking,
why are you taking so long?

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:13.170
I want to get home, or
I want to go to school,

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.160
if you don't talk about it.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:19.110
And so speaking those words and
what's going on in your head

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.840
out loud in terms of holding
the door open, and saying,

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.590
you know, I'm going
to hold the door open,

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.173
because I see this
person coming who's

00:33:25.173 --> 00:33:27.120
holding a lot of
bags in their arms,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.182
and it looks really heavy.

00:33:29.182 --> 00:33:30.640
So I'm going to
hold the door open,

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.130
because I'd like to
be helpful for them.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.760
And I think that what they're
doing looks really hard.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:41.070
You start speaking that
inside voice out loud.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:44.250
It's something that makes
other adults crazy in terms

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.650
of, oh, let me move
the chair for you,

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.290
because I see that you
are coming back this way,

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.799
and you weren't quite far
enough, and so I wanted to--

00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:52.965
it makes other adults crazy.

00:33:52.965 --> 00:33:53.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.480
But it's really good for
kids to hear that language.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.670
And the same thing goes
for the previous question

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:03.730
that we just had in
terms of saying out loud.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.430
I think I'm only
going to do this,

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:06.930
or I'm only going
to take this much,

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.449
or I'm not going to buy
anything new because I

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:10.980
feel like we have enough.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.790
Expressing those words
out loud not only

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.010
helps children see those
examples of compassion

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:20.429
a little bit more, but it
teaches them how to think.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.949
It teaches them how to stop
and think about somebody else's

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.432
feelings first, yeah.

00:34:25.432 --> 00:34:27.792
DAVID LEVIN: I think we
have another question.

00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:29.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:37.650
So I have teenage girls at
home, and still two years apart.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:40.889
And outside, they're nice,
they're the best girls.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:43.210
And out with my family,
it's always perfect.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:44.190
But at home--

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.650
--between each other, it's
a very different story.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.600
And I'm not going to
repeat some of the things

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.172
that they call each other.

00:34:53.172 --> 00:34:56.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.430
And I make sure that
they understand,

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.890
OK, this is what
happened at home,

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.750
and I'm going to say don't
say that to your sister,

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.220
it's not appropriate.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.840
And they also
acknowledge that no, they

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.420
are not using these words
or these behaviors outside.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.670
They understand that.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:15.420
My hope is that it's
going to continue.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:19.920
It's going to be true at home
and true outside as well.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.390
Any recommendation on how
to deal with this situation?

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:24.900
SHAUNA TOMINEY:
Well, one, I think

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.970
celebrating what's
happening outside the home,

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.490
in terms of
everyone's doing well,

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:33.760
and by all appearances
outside, folks are like,

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.890
oh, they've got it all together.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.770
And I think that happens
so often in families

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.269
too, especially
with young children.

00:35:39.269 --> 00:35:42.180
Has anyone had that
experience where home just

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.780
feels like it's falling apart
and a mess, and then folks say,

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.980
your child is so sweet, and
doing so well, and so kind,

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.020
and you think, really?

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.785
Thank goodness!

00:35:52.785 --> 00:35:53.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.200
And some of that
is that it's hard.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.700
It's a lot of work to
really manage your emotions,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.990
to manage your behaviors.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.040
To keep a check on what
you're saying all the time

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.290
is hard to do.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:06.490
It takes a lot of energy.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.690
It takes a lot of intensity.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:11.130
It takes a lot of
brainpower for our children.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.080
And so knowing that
by the time they

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.940
come home that
they're exhausted.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.050
They may be just done.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.530
The fact is they can do it.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.570
And you're seeing it
happen outside of the home,

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:22.528
so you know it's there.

00:36:22.528 --> 00:36:23.920
So one, celebrate that.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.260
So that's great.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.650
And two recognize that, yeah,
I think that that's probably

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.170
true across many families,
that we don't always

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.930
treat each other within our
families as compassionately

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.150
as we treat people
outside of our families.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.160
And that hopefully,
that'll grow and change

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.310
as you continue to have those
conversations about what we do,

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.190
what we don't do, what
we value as a family.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:48.780
And opening up some of
those conversations about,

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.907
how was your day?

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.240
What are you thinking about now?

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.030
Helping them connect when
they can in different ways.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.587
That wasn't a really
specific answer,

00:36:59.587 --> 00:37:01.420
but I'd be happy to
talk more afterward too.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.215
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:02.215 --> 00:37:03.298
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Thank you.

00:37:03.298 --> 00:37:05.960
DAVID LEVIN: I
know in my family,

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.930
I have two kids that I'm--

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.308
anyway, I can relate.

00:37:09.308 --> 00:37:11.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.470
But I [INAUDIBLE] reading
something your book,

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.354
and you were talking
about how you

00:37:15.354 --> 00:37:16.770
had a situation
with two kids that

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.430
were kind of arguing and so on.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.620
And I know my tendency at
times has been to kind of jump

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.830
in and solve things.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:26.550
So I jump right in
and kind of like--

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.340
but I think in your book,
you had a different type

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.320
of scenario going.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.654
Can you tell us more about that?

00:37:31.654 --> 00:37:32.528
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Sure.

00:37:32.528 --> 00:37:34.710
I think there has to be
a blend and a balance.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.217
And just like with
anything else,

00:37:36.217 --> 00:37:37.800
we want to make sure
our children have

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.650
the skills they need to
navigate different situations.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:43.780
And so in navigating
sibling rivalry,

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.430
do we jump in right
away and say, OK, I

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.550
told you not to do that.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.620
You go to your room,
you go to your room,

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.330
let's just break it up.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.720
Versus helping them figure
out how to problem solve,

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.720
and how to come together
and say, wait a minute,

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.720
what happened?

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.720
Let's talk through this.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.210
And when children are younger,
being there to guide them

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.580
through what happened.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.080
Why don't you tell
me what happened?

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.090
Why don't you tell
me what happened?

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:07.420
How are you feeling about this?

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.210
How are they feeling about this?

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.180
To really get children to focus
on one another's feelings,

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.140
and to think about one
another's situations,

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.550
which can be really hard in
those sibling conflict moments.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.141
And so looking at how do
we build a relationship so

00:38:20.141 --> 00:38:22.140
that they're really
thinking about one another's

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.800
feelings inside and outside
these conflict moments?

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.710
And it's one of these things
that we scaffold over time,

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.490
where we play more of a
role early on, again, trying

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.940
to avoid some of the well,
let's just stop the scenario

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.440
and get out of this, because I
can't deal with this anymore.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.731
And that will happen sometimes.

00:38:39.731 --> 00:38:41.890
Because we'll be too
tired to do anything else.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:43.080
And that's OK.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:48.219
But if we can also add in these,
OK, let's talk through this,

00:38:48.219 --> 00:38:50.760
scaffolding that so our children
start learning those skills,

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.481
so that they can learn
to do that on their own.

00:38:53.481 --> 00:38:56.230
DAVID LEVIN: So you
mentioned this a little bit

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.200
when we were talking
about bullying, kind

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.580
of touching on it somewhat.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.740
But how can we
teach our children

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.140
to stand up for
themselves and others

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.630
when they're hitting
those types of scenarios?

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.220
SHAUNA TOMINEY: It's
a great question.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.030
And I think it's
something that's

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.070
starting to get a lot
more attention now

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.392
with conversations about how do
we help children be upstanders

00:39:14.392 --> 00:39:16.350
rather than bystanders,
or different terms that

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.740
are being used.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.880
And one of the ways comes
back to that foundation.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:27.420
When we show our children
that we are listening to them,

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.930
we are taking their feelings
and their words seriously,

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.344
they learn that adults
will do that for them.

00:39:33.344 --> 00:39:35.260
And not all children
have that in their lives.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.960
And so if repeatedly,
they've been

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.480
shown that regardless of
the feelings they've had

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.750
or the words they've
shared, no one's listened,

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.240
they're probably less likely
to be able to stand up

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.377
in those situations.

00:39:46.377 --> 00:39:48.210
And so if we've really
built this foundation

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.640
to show children that
we take them seriously

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.020
and we're here to
listen to them,

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.410
they're more likely in those
moments to be able to do that.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.557
But then we also have to
help them prepare for it.

00:39:58.557 --> 00:40:00.390
So if you think about
a situation that might

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:02.940
be challenging for a child--

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.730
if you're seeing an instance
of bullying for the first time,

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.680
or somebody getting
hurt, or somebody

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.710
being treated unfairly.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.380
If you've never thought
about that before, but all

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.963
of a sudden you see
it, and you think,

00:40:11.963 --> 00:40:15.090
oh, that doesn't feel
good, I don't like that.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.130
If we've had those
conversations--

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.220
let's say we've read storybooks,
or we've played with dolls,

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.750
or role-played
different scenarios

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.166
that might be
challenging, or even

00:40:23.166 --> 00:40:25.620
talked about different movies
that we've watched together

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.140
or TV shows, and talked
about what would you

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.920
do in that moment?

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.505
We can help our children
learn scripts so they can say.

00:40:32.505 --> 00:40:35.910
We can help them learn
and practice saying, hey,

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.050
cut that out.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:41.220
Or help them learn and think
about, well, I don't feel good.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.510
I wouldn't feel good
standing up and saying that.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:45.930
But I would feel OK going
and telling a teacher,

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:48.420
or going in and asking
an adult for help.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.730
So if we help our children
outside of those moments

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.290
think about what they
would do in those moments,

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.384
they're more likely
to see it through.

00:40:56.384 --> 00:40:59.015
DAVID LEVIN: So we're getting
close to the end of our time,

00:40:59.015 --> 00:41:01.870
so I'll ask you some
general questions.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.795
Do you have any other
advice for parents?

00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:05.400
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Sure.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:05.980
Let's see.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.420
A big question.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:08.880
DAVID LEVIN: Book two!

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.380
SHAUNA TOMINEY: A big question.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.770
But I think parenting is hard.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.250
Parenting is hard work.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:19.050
I think there's a
lot of belief that's

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.910
really prevalent
that you should just

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.520
know what to do as a parent.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.600
And so when you seek out
support or parenting education,

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.970
there's a lot of
stigma that's still

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:33.780
pervasive in our society about
doing that, that that's only

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.000
for bad parents, or those
parents who don't know what

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.666
they're doing, rather
than acknowledging

00:41:37.666 --> 00:41:38.880
that this is learned.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.550
We are trying our
hardest along the way.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:44.500
And parenting is a challenge,
regardless of your background,

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.960
regardless of your
education level.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.940
Parenting some
children is harder than

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.800
others, depending on
your own personality,

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.250
their personalities,
and their needs as well,

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.170
and the context
that you live in.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:58.240
And so one of the
pieces of advice

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.780
I have is to be more
compassionate to one another.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.040
So often, we're
fearful of being judged

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.040
when we're standing in
line at the grocery store

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.070
and our child is melting down,
or we're in the parking lot,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.290
just trying to get
in the car, and we're

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:14.290
looking around hoping
that nobody else sees us.

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.990
And so to think about, what
can we do in those moments

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:21.040
to be a support for one another,
to see each other as learners,

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.070
just as we're trying to help
our children see themselves,

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:27.615
and to be there for one another.

00:42:27.615 --> 00:42:30.360
DAVID LEVIN: I guess my
last question, and maybe

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.690
the last question if nobody else
comes up, but is there anything

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:36.040
else you'd like readers
to know about your book,

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.164
"Creating Compassionate
Kids," or in general,

00:42:38.164 --> 00:42:39.330
creating compassionate kids?

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:40.500
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Sure.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:44.850
Oh gosh, let me think for a
moment in terms of anything

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:48.310
that we haven't shared yet.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:54.700
I think that as we said,
it's never too late.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.250
Parenting is hard.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.220
And acknowledging that
the more you know,

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.510
the more tools you have
in your parenting toolbox.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.800
And so I really just
appreciate you being here,

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.430
appreciate you being
here to learn, to share.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.160
I'd be more than happy
to answer or chat

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.517
about specific questions.

00:43:11.517 --> 00:43:13.600
DAVID LEVIN: And I don't
get in the last question.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.956
SHAUNA TOMINEY:
Sure, absolutely.

00:43:15.956 --> 00:43:20.800
AUDIENCE: So I'm probably
going to have white kids.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.550
You talked about
in some situations,

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:27.790
it's more important to--

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.580
some families, you end up having
more conversations about what

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.290
life is like growing
up, how people

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.210
are going to perceive you based
on the color of your skin,

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.160
knowing maybe you're going to
have more death in your family

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.850
because you're a-- your thing.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.900
What are your recommendations
for having those conversations

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.350
from a more privileged
standpoint without instilling

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.140
a sense of intrinsic guilt
for having that privilege?

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.280
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Yeah.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.510
That is a great question.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.040
And I have a whole section of
the book on, as I mentioned,

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:55.840
self-awareness.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.820
And I think that one
of the things that we

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.850
can do for our children is not
just talk about the qualities

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:03.050
that make them who they are.

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.590
My daughter is also
very fair-skinned.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:08.860
She has blue eyes, despite the
other dark eyes in our family.

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.720
And she will, in our
country, probably

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.580
never be discriminated
against because

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.680
of the color of her skin.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.700
And so thinking about how do
we, with children of all races,

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.650
talk about race?

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:25.480
And with honesty, in
terms of how challenging

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.890
and how race is
seen in our society.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.310
So often, we want
to teach children

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:33.290
that differences don't matter.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:34.960
But the truth is they do.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:41.150
There are some children growing
up recognizing and living

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.610
the fact that their differences
do matter in the way

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.700
that people look at them,
treat them, the opportunities

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:47.860
that they have.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.090
And I think that if
we have conversations

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:52.470
with all of our
children about race,

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:57.110
about sexual orientation,
about gender identity,

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.900
about different cultures,
different religions,

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:03.170
we can help our children
think about the impact of that

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.360
in their own life,
and help them feel

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.540
comfortable emerging into
who they're growing up to be.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.480
But also help them to
see both the challenges

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.310
and the strengths that
other people have.

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.580
Because we really want them
to see that as a strength,

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.450
and that diversity
as a strength,

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:22.470
rather than a difference
to be afraid of.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.654
DAVID LEVIN: And last question.

00:45:24.654 --> 00:45:25.570
AUDIENCE: No pressure.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:26.860
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Sure.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:31.670
AUDIENCE: So we're not
originally from the US.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:34.400
I'm from Israel, so
we're Jewish, turns out.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.590
And we walk around
with our kids,

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.540
and there's these--
you pose with Santa

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:39.620
and all these things.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.410
And you know, my daughter says,
hey, let's stand this line.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:42.870
And I explain to
her, no, it's OK,

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:43.820
we don't stand in
this line, because we

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.110
don't celebrate Christmas.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:45.609
Why?

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:47.630
Because do Hanukkah, whatever.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:50.210
The problem happens when
she goes back to school.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.910
And we don't send her
to a Jewish school,

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:57.030
because we feel she
should be with everyone.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:59.030
Basically, so one of her
friends says something,

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.802
like hey, I got picture with
Santa, and my daughter goes,

00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:04.010
we don't celebrate Christmas.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:04.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:07.091
And my instinct is to
try to explain to her,

00:46:07.091 --> 00:46:08.090
that's not what you say.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:09.980
I mean, it's OK for
other people to have--

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.440
how do I get around
that while on one hand,

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.636
trying to maintain our--

00:46:14.636 --> 00:46:16.260
I don't know if its
values or beliefs--

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.920
but on the other hand, still
making sure that she respects

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.540
everyone else's?

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.730
Because she's not
getting a bad example,

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:24.360
but she's perceiving
it that way.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:24.860
Sorry.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:25.735
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Yeah.

00:46:25.735 --> 00:46:27.530
No, no, it's a great question.

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:31.525
One, all of the other parents
in the classroom, in my opinion,

00:46:31.525 --> 00:46:32.900
should be thinking
about how they

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.320
talk to their children
about other cultures,

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.380
about people celebrating
in other ways,

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.260
having other holidays,
other religions.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.220
Because then, when
another child says,

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.600
oh, you don't
celebrate Christmas?

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.279
What do you celebrate instead?

00:46:49.279 --> 00:46:51.320
And seeing that as something
to be interested in,

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.810
and wanting to learn about,
and seeing that as part of--

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.240
in our community, we
all have different ways

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.170
of thinking about things, of
sharing, of coming together

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:02.310
in our family, with our culture.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.810
And so one piece of that
question, which you don't have

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:07.070
control over.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:08.750
And then the other
in terms of the way

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:11.450
that you approach
your daughter--

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:12.410
it's OK.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:15.620
And it's OK for her to say,
we don't celebrate Christmas,

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.570
here's what we
celebrate instead.

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:19.460
Or here's what's
important in my family.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:21.890
And I think too
often, it's folks

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:25.370
who, in your case, in
the community that you're

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:28.490
living in, come from
the minority group--

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.050
too often, it falls
on your shoulders

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:33.290
to be the one to explain,
to educate, or even

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:37.250
defend your family
to others because

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.900
of that lack of
awareness, or the lack

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.180
of those conversations.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.930
And that's one of the
things that I really

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.210
am striving to help change.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:47.310
But I think what you're
doing with your daughter--

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:49.070
it's a challenge,
in terms of thinking

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:53.690
about how do we help her then be
that role model of recognizing

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:56.180
where our family fits
in to this other more

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.147
dominant society around them.

00:47:58.147 --> 00:47:58.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.580
SHAUNA TOMINEY: Thank
you for bringing that up.

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.900
DAVID LEVIN: Thank you very
much for coming and talking

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.274
about your book,
and ways that we

00:48:04.274 --> 00:48:05.964
can create compassionate kids.

00:48:05.964 --> 00:48:07.380
SHAUNA TOMINEY:
Thank you so much.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.090
I really appreciate
you taking the time.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:13.040
