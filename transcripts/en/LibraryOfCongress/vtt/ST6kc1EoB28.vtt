00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.430
&gt;&gt; Hello there, my name Michael
Alflore [assumed spelling],

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.850 position:59%
I work in the Education Outreach
Department at the Library of Congress.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.840 position:69%
We are thrilled to welcome you to the second
annual Online Conference for Educators.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.990 position:59%
Our session today, how did slaves gain
their freedom during the Civil War?

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.700
Without further ado, I would
like to introduce our presenter.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:28.640 position:70%
Tuyen Tran received her PhD in history from
the University of California Berkley in 2007.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.100
Tran's field of interests are
20th Century United States History

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.930 position:63%
and Asian American history, particularly
Southeast Asian American history.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.610
As a graduate student, researcher,
and teacher goes,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.530 position:64%
Tran worked with the UC Berkley history
social science project from 2002 to 2006,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.320 position:75%
she joined the project statewide office in 2008.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.940 position:69%
As an assistant director for the project
her major responsibility is the coordination

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.410 position:58%
and development of academic programs.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.680
Welcome and take it away.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.300
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you everyone
for being here with me.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.460 position:66%
I'd like to thank the Library of
Congress and its educational outreach team

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.990 position:64%
for organizing this wonderful
conference to connect us with one another

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.360 position:59%
and the library's excellent resources.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.400 position:73%
I hope everyone has enjoyed the conference thus
far and you will continue tune in tomorrow.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.730 position:59%
So a little something, something about
me and my organizations I represent.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.460
I am part of TPS UC Davis, I'm the
assistant director of the teaching

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.560 position:67%
with primary sources here at the University
of California Davis, that's in California.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.020 position:59%
We specialize in disciplinary
literacy and building curriculum units

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.900
that feature materials from
the library's archives.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.570
And I am also representing
as she assistant director

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.080
of the California History
Social Science Project.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.410
Before you is a summary of
our activities and programs.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.170 position:69%
Please know that we are a statewide network,
we have regional sites and satellite sites

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.520 position:61%
across California based out of colleges
and universities across the state.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.210 position:69%
We have classical resources available at our
website, following the links on this slide.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.880 position:70%
And all the primary sources that I'll feature
as part of my presentation are also linked.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.660 position:75%
So at your leisure later you can click onto
them and it will take you directly to the lesson

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.050
that I'm going to feature or to
its bibliographic information.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.150 position:72%
So that's a little bit about our organization.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.560 position:73%
Okay. So that I have sense of who's online with
me, who we are collectively and the expertise

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.720
in the room, I'd like to know
who teaches emancipation.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.320 position:73%
And for those of you that do what is your main
focus when you are teaching the end of slavery?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.490
All righty then.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.500
So 62% of folks teach emancipation.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.010
I guess other folks are interested
in the subject.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.610 position:64%
And then our second one was, what is your
main focus when you do teach the subject?

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.230
So I have an information literacy
instructor, I also have someone

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.040 position:73%
who teaches primary sources from the Civil War.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.320
Great. Other folks teach
resource skills for sheer writing.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.180 position:56%
Okay. On the subject of emancipation
it seems to me -- whoa.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.030 position:67%
What we'll be looking at is the majority
of folks emancipation during the Civil War.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.530 position:63%
Great. And I don't know if your
students are like the students I've had.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.690 position:56%
Most of the students I've taught in
the past have been college students,

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.100
and most of them privileged Lincoln

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.550
for emancipating the slaves,
that Lincoln freed the slaves.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.590 position:59%
Has this been your experience as well?

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.930
And so I ask this question
because I was surprised myself.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.980 position:66%
I have a Kindergartener, and in preschool,
he learned about President Lincoln,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.280
which I was thrilled about because,
you know, I am a history geek.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.560
But they talked about Lincoln
and that he did free the slaves.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.910 position:69%
And I thought that was very interesting that
that narrative started even in preschool.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.790 position:64%
And that, you know, people have this hero
worship of Lincoln, and rightfully so,

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.610 position:70%
he did lots of wonderful things as president.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.720 position:61%
But, you know, privileging Lincoln as
the one to free the slaves is only part

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.720 position:75%
of this national myth -- only part of the story,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.700 position:56%
a full story of how the emancipation
of slaves came about.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.880 position:56%
I think most students and most
Americans believe that slavery ended

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.270
with the Emancipation Proclamation
or the 13th Amendment,

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.710
and definitely that Lincoln played
a decisive and starring role.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.630 position:70%
And it seems like that's what I see reflected
in the comments here in the chat box.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.240
Thank you everyone.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.370
Now, historians argue something
quite differently.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.850 position:59%
In this lesson that I'm going to teach
you provides students with secondary

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.890
and primary sources to make
these arguments as well.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.870
So all right.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.090 position:75%
So we have this national myth that Lincoln freed
the slaves and a lot of students believe it.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.030
And this is sort of the narrative
that's still being taught over

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.270 position:69%
and over again, including my kindergartener.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.530 position:58%
So if you can see in the passage here
in writing, it sort of reflects that.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.420
Any words to say of what folks
can see in these passages here?

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:54.240 position:67%
How that understanding or this mythology of
Lincoln freeing the slaves repeats itself?

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.610 position:67%
So in this passage what you see the student
writing about is that Lincoln was the one

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.510 position:63%
who wanted to start to focus on the
slaves by the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.160
It was Lincoln that wanted all
the slaves from the Confederacy

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.890 position:63%
to be freed and so they joined the army.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:20.340 position:63%
So that Lincoln was the one who had this
idea and originated this idea of freedom

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.880
of those enslaved and that they
were useful for the war effort.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.900
So it's important here to note

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.970 position:66%
that the Emancipation Proclamation did
not actually free any slaves in the Union,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.430 position:63%
it only freed slaves in the Confederacy.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.980
But what the Emancipation
Proclamation actually do?

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.040
It did permit black enlistment.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:51.380 position:64%
So by the war's end 180,000 and freed and
enslaved persons fought for the military.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.740 position:70%
Enlistment was one key opportunity for
freedom, especially those in Union territory.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.790 position:67%
And then, it empowered and emboldened those
who were still on farms and plantations

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:10.540 position:66%
to free themselves of that bondage as soon
as Union troops were anywhere in the area.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:17.530 position:64%
So that slaves -- those still enslaved
freed themselves by crossing Union lines.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:23.880
So this lesson that we built is
around the history Blueprint.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:31.640 position:64%
And the history Blueprint, we have three
now, the Civil War, the Cold War for U.S.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:38.400 position:66%
and world history, and [inaudible] for the
Medieval world, were created as a model

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.500 position:63%
of curriculum units for teachers looking

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.590
for example common core state
standard's rich instruction.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:51.130 position:70%
All our units are inquiry based, they include
activities and guidance for teaching reading,

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.080 position:64%
writing, listening, and speaking in the
content area, that is discipline specific

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.130
and covers the state's content
standards as well.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:07.740 position:75%
Each curriculum unit includes multiple lessons
that are each organized around a focus question.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:18.050 position:70%
And the focus question for the lesson that
I'm going to feature here -- that's so funny.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.470
Never mind my yellow bar there.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.980
My yellow bar is actually
supposed to cover emancipation.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.290 position:58%
Clearly that's the topic of the talk.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.770
But the -- the focus question
for emancipation was,

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.470
how did slaves gain their
freedom during the Civil War?

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:39.840 position:70%
Now, in the first unit of the Civil War these
are -- that emancipation lesson one of eight.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.740
Thank you.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.130
Whether that was Michael or
Kathy, thank you very much.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.220
So the emancipation is one of
eight lessons in this entire unit.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.370
And the first one is about how
the slaves gained their freedom.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.040
So the older historiography said
that the Lincoln freed the slaves.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.420 position:75%
That's a problem because as I was saying earlier
the Emancipation Proclamation really didn't free

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:08.410 position:67%
anyone, only those folks in the Confederacy
and they weren't part of the Union anyhow.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:15.000
And that, like, Lincoln walked this
really tight line between trying

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.090 position:70%
to keep those border states within the Union.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.690 position:61%
And then, -- but also wanting to deal a
blow to the Confederacy and its ability

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.740 position:66%
to use slaves for manpower and for battle.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.380 position:66%
And so, what we wanted to was create a
lesson that was selected current research,

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.970 position:69%
and the role of slaves in their own freedom.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.220
So the focus question is how
did slaves gain their freedom?

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.880 position:75%
Now, a good focus question for a lesson
reflects current scholarship, it inspires wonder

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.990 position:59%
and curiosity, it provides a focus for
student learning, that standard space,

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.080
it requires students to utilize
a critical thinking

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.970
and writing skills, it elicits
more than one answer.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.730
And as you can see in this
question that we posed, it helps --

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.050 position:61%
we want students to determine for
themselves how emancipation came about.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:10.660 position:72%
They're supposed to generate a thesis
statement that would be supported by evidence,

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.370
that evidence we provide as
part of this lesson learning.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.060 position:58%
So the lesson is common core aligned.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:23.030 position:56%
There are two main activities, a
cause and effect reasoning, reading,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.900 position:75%
and plenty of work with primary source analysis.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.750
Students, taken all together,
students have the opportunity

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.330
to cite specifically textual
evidence, determine central ideas,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:40.670 position:61%
describe how text presents information,
reveals [inaudible] points of views,

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.680 position:64%
integrate visual information, [inaudible]
evidence, and analyze relationships

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.700 position:59%
between primary and secondary sources.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.090
All of this stuff is common
core and part of this lesson.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:57.210
And I'm not sure if common core is
real [inaudible] I like to use it.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.950 position:66%
So the lesson itself has four steps and
I'm going to focus the majority of my time

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.700 position:64%
on the emancipation fact-finding mission.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.450 position:67%
You'll also hear me call it a gallery walk.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.830 position:66%
I think most teachers with a gallery walk.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:16.300 position:70%
You post things up on the wall, students
walk around, make some observations about it.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:22.740 position:66%
We want to use that same concept with some
primary sources around this idea of deeds

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.450 position:59%
and acts of slaves to free themselves.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.780 position:64%
So we call it a emancipation fact-finding
mission because we're trying to figure

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:34.690 position:70%
out some facts about, like, how to unpack and
deconstruct this myth, right, about Lincoln

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:39.730
and emancipation doing the heavy
lifting of freeing the slaves.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.310
So first of the four steps is
introducing the focus question.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.420 position:75%
So initially when you introduce a focus question
there are some key things that you're trying

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.320
to get out of your students to --
sort of as a formative assessment.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.340 position:70%
You're trying to access background knowledge,
you want to connect to some prior learning

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.590 position:59%
and you want to determine if there's
any preconceptions on the topic, like,

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.310 position:64%
I started with earlier whether, you know,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.330
students still privileged
Lincoln and the emancipation.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.230
Where are they coming to -- where
are they coming from in terms

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:14.650 position:63%
of what is their starting point, when
you're teaching them about emancipation?

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:19.000
Now, some folks might -- for
us this, as I said previously,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.540
this emancipation lesson number
six in a total of eight lessons.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.060 position:64%
So previously, students have some
experience with Emancipation Proclamation

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.820 position:72%
because there's a focus on Lincoln's speeches.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.260 position:73%
So I'm trying to fill in a little bit of the
gaps here so that you can get caught up in some

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.770 position:69%
of the context of how we built this lesson,
but in general you do want to start a lesson

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.540
with trying to access these
three key points here.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.400 position:63%
So the way we did it for this lesson was
we have this image here in front of you,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:58.950 position:69%
it's titled "President Lincoln, writing the
Proclamation of Freedom, January 1st, 1863."

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.690 position:66%
Are folks familiar with this image at all?

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.390
It is a painting that was
painted by David Blythe.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.110 position:59%
I hope I said that right, B-L-Y-T-H-E.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.580 position:58%
If you click it on later it will link
you to the bibliographic information.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.770
Oh, okay. Blair [assumed
spelling] uses it the unit.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.960 position:64%
I would be interested if you could share,
Blair, how you use it in your unit.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:26.210 position:72%
So what we do, what we suggest in this lesson,
is for teachers just to have this as a,

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.160
you know, as a cold opening to see
what students know about Lincoln

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.720
and the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.340 position:58%
Some students will figure out that it
actually was issued on January 1st.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:44.470 position:70%
So this image actually is an imagination of
what he looked like when he was composing it,

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:49.860 position:66%
not what he actually was doing the day of.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.820 position:59%
And so there's a handful of these sort
of descriptors I have on the side,

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.590 position:75%
some key details that students might pick up on.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:02.330 position:58%
And generally in California the Civil
War is taught at the end of the year.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:08.240 position:63%
By now you may not need a primary
source analysis tool to deconstruct this

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.240
or analyze this primary source
for your students.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:17.130
But just in case you may need one,
if you click onto this scroll here

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.800
at the bottom right corner,
it's a link to the Library

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.270 position:73%
of Congress's own primary source analysis tool.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.980 position:64%
In general, when you're analyzing a
primary source for your students you want

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:34.780 position:73%
to have them observe it, make some reflections,
you want to ask some questions of it,

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.800 position:72%
and think about other things that they might
be interested in it for further investigation.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.020 position:72%
That's how the Library of Congress's primary
source tool is organized in those four chunks.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:51.520 position:73%
And it's also similar to another primary source
analysis tool that I will feature when we look

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.850 position:73%
at the primary sources during the gallery walk.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.480 position:64%
So I'm reading Blair's comment about
students looking at a picture and picking

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.200
out items you see as -- and
what some of these items mean.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:10.310 position:69%
Yes. So, you know, just trying to get a tone
of what this first image says about Lincoln,

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:16.670 position:58%
his role with emancipation, you know,
his centrality in the creation of it.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.240 position:59%
Some things that he's concerned about.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.560
You know, whether it's his
sword, the scales of justice,

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.660 position:73%
being able to represent either James Buckhannon
or Andrew Jackson with their busts also

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.600 position:56%
in the picture, or even rail
splitter's mold in the front of him,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.410
harkening back to his rural roots.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.460 position:72%
So some of your students will pick up on that.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.590 position:72%
But at the -- but the main part of this, like,

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.650
you're trying determine what
their background knowledge is,

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:49.570 position:69%
you're trying to connect the prior learning,
and any preconceptions may have on topic.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.190 position:75%
Now, remind your students of two earlier points.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.530 position:56%
That in 1860 there are nearly four
million slaves in the United States,

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.140
mainly in the South, and
that Lincoln's rationale

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.670 position:67%
for fighting the war had changed over time.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:09.270 position:67%
So what is it about the Emancipation
Proclamation that brought about this change

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.180 position:56%
of the purpose for fighting the war?

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:18.380 position:73%
I think it's universally known by the time of
the Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln's purpose

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.920 position:58%
for the war, of preserving the Union,
changes to really to end slavery.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.730 position:56%
And so, what we want to [inaudible].

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.610 position:61%
Okay. Well we're going to look at this
topic and we're going to look at, like,

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.560
why has Lincoln changed his mind?

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.430 position:58%
You know, and let's look at some
these resources to think about, like,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.660
what could have impacted
Lincoln's choice in that matter.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:47.120 position:75%
So, it's an early start of getting them to
visualize and understand some of the key players

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:53.920 position:64%
and some of the key concepts that
students will engage in before they start

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.400 position:64%
to actually look at some primary sources.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.290
So the second part is to do a
little bit of background reading.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:04.510 position:56%
And this is where they look at and
read very closely a secondary source

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.800
for cause and effect reasoning.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.930 position:59%
Now, it's useful to relate to students
that history tells a story of events.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.810
And these events can serve
as causes for other events

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.190 position:66%
and effects from previous events, or both.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:22.400 position:70%
As readers of history, it is important to not
only know that the events take place but also

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.840 position:63%
to understand the causal
relationships that link events together.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.330
So this is what our reading does.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:34.930
So here we have multiple
sections for our secondary reading

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.070 position:72%
where students will read one section and then,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:42.470
be able to identify cause
and effects in these boxes.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:48.060 position:61%
The first one has been done for them;
I'll let you have a quick read of that.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:53.940 position:59%
And we simplified it in the beginning,
the cause statements are bolded.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.610 position:70%
So that's very easy just to, like, go through
the bold statements, put them in one column,

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.920
and then, read through the
passage to figure out the effects.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:08.540 position:63%
Further along in the reading it's -- the
text is written not in italics anymore

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.870 position:63%
and they aren't bolded, so students have
to work a little bit harder for that.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.040
Here's a sample of one that's
not done for the students,

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.330
where they have to fill out
the cause and the effect.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.680 position:56%
And then, following this they answer
some text dependent questions.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.910 position:59%
So since we need to identify the cause
and effect from separate sentences --

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.660 position:64%
and this forces the students to slow down

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.730
and make the connections
between causal relationships.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:41.200 position:64%
So ultimately this is a summation of what
they get from their secondary reading.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.660 position:72%
A trial like this will be useful to teachers
to give as whole or teachers might maybe blank

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.980 position:72%
out some boxes and have students fill them in.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.300
Any ideas?

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.220
I would like to hear some
ideas that some of you may have

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.460
about this could be a good summary
for their secondary reading.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.230 position:63%
I think ultimately the graphic organizer
helps to summarize their new learning

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.420 position:61%
and that the main ideas gain from this.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.090
It's a great way to summarize.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.230 position:61%
And so, the main ideas gained from this
reading will help to provide context

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.840
for the primary sources that they
really dig into in the next step.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.750 position:63%
What we hope is that students will learn
the politics of emancipation and what is

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.480
at stake politically for Lincoln,
the Union, and the Confederacy.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:32.990 position:67%
That they learned that slaves had forced
the political situation upon these factors,

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:39.180 position:75%
when they left their farms and plantations,
before the Emancipation Proclamation was passed.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.340
So using something like this might
show them more causes than effect.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:42.770
Is that right?

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.230 position:59%
Or there are more effects than causes.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:51.200 position:64%
And what's really nice that I've seen
before is if you extend this even further

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.370
and have a causes/effects,
and then create a third column

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.350 position:67%
to the right of effects, long-term effects.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.040
So that you think about, okay.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.770 position:56%
What is lingering that -- like,
what are the long-term repercussions

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.230 position:64%
of the Emancipation Proclamation as well?

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.120
Okay. So the third part, we set
them up, we primed up the students,

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.770 position:72%
they thought about cause and effect reasoning.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:18.170 position:59%
They talked about -- they figured out
the political ramifications and what's

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.620 position:64%
at stake politically for the Emancipation
Proclamation, all the key holders.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:28.900 position:73%
And now we're looking at the slaves themselves.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.540 position:56%
Those enslaved and freed blacks,
and what they did to force the issue

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.680
of Emancipation Proclamation
upon Lincoln and Congress.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.520 position:72%
So procedures for a gallery walk style set up.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.380 position:72%
As you can see in this picture we've done this
workshop multiple times with teachers in fact

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.400
as a way to just do a simulation
of how it would work.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.090 position:61%
But generally you just want to have a
nice large size of the primary sources.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:57.970
We have ten for this gallery
walk, this fact-finding mission.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.510
We spread it out across the room.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.430 position:56%
You can set up the students in pairs

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:08.890 position:58%
or small groups depending how your
class is behaving what works for you.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.930 position:73%
And while students work together in groups each

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:16.210
of them have their own fact-finding
mission guide notes.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:21.400
So each of them have a note-taking
guide for every single item.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.650
Now, ten is a lot.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.310
You know, it's completely up to
teacher how many they want to do.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:33.050 position:61%
We could have a conversation about
what would be the best for your timing.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:37.970
I picked my favorite as -- a little
bit down the road we're going

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.210 position:66%
to actually process one of these together.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:45.230 position:72%
I feel like that one would be, like, a key one
that you could spend tons and tons of time on.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.910 position:59%
And -- but there's a variety of 10 in
all, that you could sort from and look

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.190 position:61%
through to work with your own students.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:57.970
Okay. So how long for this
step -- to allow for this step?

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.270
I would say a whole class period
just to do the gallery walk,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.330
if you want to do all primary
sources in one class.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.720
If not then I would say anywhere
between five minutes.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:17.580 position:64%
I would say five -- this is my assumption
that this is for us in eighth grade.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.790 position:67%
So Civil War is taught in the eighth grade.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:25.680 position:72%
So by then students have had lots of
experience analyzing primary resources I hope,

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.810 position:72%
and so they're going to be pretty quick at it.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:35.900 position:72%
So I'm thinking anywhere between -- like, no
more than five, six, seven minutes per source.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:42.630 position:69%
And then -- you know, so, you know, you
could get away with three or four in a class

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.440 position:61%
and you could assign some for homework.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.430
It's completely up to you.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:51.570
And you see that something like
this doesn't have that much text,

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.370 position:59%
although I did provide the
bibliographic information for this one

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.870
because the bibliographic
information was so good,

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.590
because it gave so much context
to the image itself.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.570
And you too can decide whether
you would provide that or not.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.780
I did it just because there were
10 and I didn't want them, like,

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.180
searching for research information
that difficult,

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.640 position:61%
that takes a little bit time in itself.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.270 position:66%
So take a moment here, look at the source.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.680 position:73%
We're going to see this again and again because
what I'm going to show you is the source

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:25.230 position:73%
and then, I'm going to show you the field notes
that we'd have a student to analyze the source.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.690 position:67%
So take a -- I'm going to give you 60
seconds to just, like, really take this in.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:33.650
And then, I'm going to show you
the bibliographic information.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.510 position:67%
Okay. So here now I've added a description.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:40.690 position:61%
Sometimes when you go to the Library of
Congress you don't really get any notes

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.620 position:67%
about the source that you are working with.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.250 position:56%
But luckily this one does, and it's
so rich here and it explains so much

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.410
about what contrabands is
what's happening in the image.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.640 position:75%
It takes away some of the processing for
students but I think that's okay when there's --

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.770 position:63%
you know, when you're doing gallery work
and there's 10 to look at it's okay.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.330 position:64%
But, you know, this shortcuts some of
their having to, like, really dig deeper,

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:06.990 position:67%
I think they can still process and there's
a lot to sort of summarize, even with this,

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:10.120
like, heads up text that they get.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.210
So take a moment here to read
these bibliographic notes.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:20.030 position:70%
Yes. The majority of the sources that are in
this lesson are from the Library of Congress.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.060 position:59%
Is there a one super archive for them?

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:31.020 position:73%
No. But if you visit our website we have some
links that we recommend that would help to sort

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.060
of shortcut that process for you.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.990 position:59%
And yes, Kimberly is absolutely right,

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:41.830 position:67%
the Library of Congress's teacher section
is really great and there's tons of lessons

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:48.540
that already have collections of
primary sources attached to them.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.710
Okay. So my assumption is
that we're all fast readers.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.620
So -- and you'll see the
bibliographic notes are possible --

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.930
are available on each slide
-- subsequent slide as well.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:02.180 position:58%
Okay. So I just wanted to give you a
quiet moment to read it for yourself.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.440
So here we go.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.360
So I showed the primary source.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.820
And here is their fact-finding
mission field notes.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:15.390 position:75%
Again, we call it a fact-finding mission because
we set it up so that we said, hey everyone says,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:16.780
you know, Lincoln freed the slaves

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.600
and the Emancipation Proclamation
did all these wonderful things.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.340 position:64%
But what did actually happen underground?

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.580
What was going on?

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.540 position:66%
And so, they're on a fact-finding mission.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:29.630 position:69%
You know, trying to figure out, you know,
what was the sequence of events that brought

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.870 position:56%
about the Emancipation Proclamation?

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.960
And that forced Lincoln's hand.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:43.200 position:75%
What you'll see here is that the -- one of the
key things about our fact-finding field notes is

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:50.060
that we always include the
lesson focus question at the top.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.430 position:59%
So the students are always [inaudible]
and remember that there's a purpose

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:54.870 position:69%
for why they're looking at a primary source.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:26:00.880 position:73%
Like this is connected to this larger question,
this inquiry that they're engaged upon.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.200 position:66%
And the rest of the document is basic
sourcing materials, so they have to figure

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:12.530 position:63%
out what the citation is and looking at
a description of the source, its purpose

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:17.540 position:59%
and its audience message and argument,
making connections for evidence,

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.330
because they will use this
source to build a part

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.160 position:73%
of their argument to answer the focus question.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.760 position:59%
And then,, you know, very important, a
final column for them to, you know, --

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.870
a parking lot for all the
questions they may still have

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.120
or stuff they're still just curious
about as a result of the source.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.670 position:64%
Okay. So what we're going to do now is I
want to break down each of these sections

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.240 position:58%
and we'll do it together in applying,

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:49.520 position:64%
analyzing the primary source I showed you
previously with each of these sections.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.540
So here we go.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.300
For the first part.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.380
Here is the source again.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:27:00.290 position:73%
I took out the bibliographic notes because it's
not that important for the first part of it,

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.210
the basic citation information,
you know, the type of document.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.740
This is sort of a freebie for you
all because I'm going to assume

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.330 position:56%
that you all are the [inaudible]
students, super, super A plus folks.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:17.100 position:75%
You already know what type of document it is;
it says that in the parenthesis, who created it.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:24.300
Oh actually that was in -- it's
the -- creator is actually unknown.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:32.460 position:61%
When and where is document from, if we
are to believe this source information,

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.300
Fort Monroe, which is in Virginia.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.060
Okay. So I did this first part of
you because I knew some of this.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:43.010 position:66%
But the next part I'm going to put you all
on a hook and you process this together.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.100
So let's analyze this next part.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.620
June, that's a very good question.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:55.330 position:66%
Seemingly not that important, correct, but
it is because in the bibliographic notes

00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:01.340 position:58%
for the source it actually gives the
measurements of this -- of the stamp.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:09.220 position:75%
And it's almost like the size -- I want to say
it's almost like the size of a Manilla envelope,

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.470 position:56%
it's, like, longer than 8 1/2 by 11.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:15.520 position:72%
So it's a really sizeable one, so that's good.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.930
Is it official stationary?

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.520
You all are very smart people.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.310 position:67%
You all didn't have questions I would have.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.460 position:56%
Yes. I do think about what kind of
stationary or what kind of envelope.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.980
And was it an official document?

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.830
Very good points.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:31.940 position:66%
And here I am just -- I breezed through
that first part of it, thank you everyone.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.180 position:59%
So it seems like everyone's consistent
with the description of the source.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.130
[Inaudible] in the audience.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.690
And then, I love your comment,
Theresa, about -- okay.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.220
What does this mean about
the Fugitive Slave Act?

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:50.950
Does the Union who controls Fort
Monroe have to return slaves,

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:55.050
or are they in violation
of the Fugitive Slave Act?

00:28:55.050 --> 00:29:02.060 position:63%
And does this Fugitive Slave Act still
apply in Confederate, you know, country?

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.430
So looking at the audience I
think June's comment is very --

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:11.340
is a good one that clearly is
not going to be for the officers.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.980 position:61%
Because it would be really inflammatory
for the local folks, correct.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:22.800 position:73%
So the purpose is to demonstrate this moment in
time in which slaves are entering Fort Monroe.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.160 position:70%
I love this understanding of who the audience
is by thinking about who it is not for.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.210
Right? Who it is not created for.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:34.780 position:64%
It shows that the masters have no
control over their slaves, that slaves --

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.630 position:58%
no one has said anything about
contrabanning [assumed spelling] yet,

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:38.850
the language of contrabanning.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.850
Like, the slaves understand what
the concept of contrabanning is.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.290
Right? Like, there's this
term that they're using.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.760
Come back.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.510
You can't come back now, massa
this child's contrabanning.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:53.760 position:66%
Like, this understanding of this concept
of contrabanning is that's, like pervasive

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.490
or common enough that folks
are leaving for Fort Monroe.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:02.130 position:66%
Okay. So now that we've looked that the
purpose and the description of the source,

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.050 position:72%
let's move on to its message and its argument.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.970
What's the main idea?

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:15.030
Taking this all together, what's
happening here in this source?

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:19.090 position:75%
And Janelle [assumed spelling], your point about
the Emancipation Proclamation is a valid one.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:26.300 position:67%
I think a lot of your students would ask
that question and they'll make a connection

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:31.940
that the Emancipation Proclamation
is issued on January 1st, 1863.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:37.960
But this stamp on the envelope
was created in 1861.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.300
So they might have some questions
about the timing of that.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.240 position:69%
So the main idea -- one of the main ideas is

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.930 position:61%
that southern planters are losing their
labor force and that slaves have method

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.450 position:58%
to free themselves from their owners.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.380 position:64%
And they see Fort Monroe as a safe space.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.600 position:73%
And Patricia says that the historical prophecy.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:03.110 position:66%
Oh at the very least that what's
happening underground in1861 would lead to

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:09.610 position:75%
and have long term effects for the purpose of
the war, for Lincoln's understanding of the war,

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:13.690 position:67%
and for the North and South's understanding
of the war and its purpose for sure.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:18.250 position:73%
So every time we have our students look at a
primary source we also ask them to think about,

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:23.160 position:75%
okay, will how does this source relate to the
question about how do slaves gain their freedom?

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.740
What can we tell?

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:29.590
What information can we gain
from this about that?

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:35.380 position:72%
How would this source help to inform our
understanding how we could answer the question

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.650
of how slaves gained their freedom?

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:41.620
So yes, that many slaves took it
upon themselves to achieve freedom.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.340
And then, Kimberly asked, how
much freedom did they gain?

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.540
Right? By taking the act, and
we will talk about that later.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.580
And Theresa's point that the
contraband practice was proof

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.380
that freeing blacks could
make a difference in the war.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.260
That's right.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:01.700 position:58%
That would deal a blow to the -- on
federacy's manpower and their morale.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:06.870 position:56%
By the end of the -- at the start of
the war there four million enslaved.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:13.610 position:58%
By the end of the war, half a million
had left their farms and plantations.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:22.490 position:64%
And almost 200,000 slaved and black free
men fought in the military for the Union.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:24.510
So the slaves made a choice.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.960
Right. And that choice was
happening underground in 1861.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.540
And so, that's what we want
students to gather from this.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.940 position:66%
And in the collection -- and here's a key.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.010
Every single -- in the lesson
that you'll receive --

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.080 position:69%
there's a link to the lesson at our website.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:50.460 position:61%
So there in that lesson complete packet
there's a mission field notes key

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.260
for every single primary source.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:58.630 position:56%
So here's one four the contrabanning
primary source.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:05.470 position:70%
So slaves made the choice to free themselves.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:13.020 position:64%
So here is a collection of the primary
sources available as part of this lesson.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:19.210
And we do have a convention speech
from 1843, we have a petition

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:23.130
for black service volunteers
before Emancipation Proclamation.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.510 position:70%
We have eyewitness accounts, autobiographies,

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:32.120
and journals about slaves leaving
their farms and plantations.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:40.560 position:67%
We have arts -- we have art and letters,
and a music hymn, and a music sheet to sort

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:50.820 position:70%
of build a body of evidence to show case that
the enslaved and freed black wanted freedom,

00:33:50.820 --> 00:34:00.270 position:66%
acted on their own, and forced this issue
of emancipation upon Lincoln and Congress.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:06.270
So the fourth step here is it's
our assessment for the lesson.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:12.860 position:66%
And the assessment replicates exactly
what we were trying to teach the students.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:18.550 position:73%
So the students have to write and cause and
effect statements and they also have to be able

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:24.750 position:64%
to put into a timeline the course of
events from 1860 to the end of Civil War.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:29.010 position:69%
Now, there are only two key -- in particular
you'll note there are only two key things

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:32.580
that were only made possible after
the emancipation Proclamation.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.920 position:75%
This forces them to understand cause and effect.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.770 position:63%
Right? That out of these six categories,
six choices, only two are made possible

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:43.560 position:69%
after a certain date and that was made
possible with the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:49.480 position:75%
And everything that happened before it
indicates that its supporting role in the course

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.460 position:72%
of the Emancipation Proclamation being issued.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:57.220 position:72%
And finally, students will have to write three
actions that slaves to gain their freedom just

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:02.340 position:73%
in case they didn't get it from everything else
that -- from their primary source analysis.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:06.770 position:59%
So this is the entirety of the lesson.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:10.820 position:70%
And those were the two things that can only
happen here in these two arrows that happened

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:16.470 position:56%
with the passage of the Emancipation
Proclamation.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:23.560 position:73%
And I have here resources for you if you want
to dig deeper to learn more about the Civil War

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.910
or this Blueprint lesson or
another Blueprint lesson.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.470
&gt;&gt; I want to thank Tuyen very
much for a wonderful presentation

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.920
and for all the educators who
joined us for this session.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.360
Goodnight.
