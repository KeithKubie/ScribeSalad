00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.390
PROFESSOR: Review
model analysis.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.469
I figured most-- I figured lots
of students have had questions

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:28.260
and we could use a
little practice on this.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.778
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:31.122
AUDIENCE: Solving the q thing?

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:31.570
PROFESSOR: Huh?

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.945
AUDIENCE: Solving
the q function?

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
solving the whole thing.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.560
So but let's start.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.810
I'd still start with
the usual concepts.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.650
I haven't even erased
what we had last time.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.520
But this is what the
students in the last group

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.430
said about key
concepts for the week.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.405
If you want to add
something to it, speak up.

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:53.840
But modal analysis, multi-degree
of freedom, transfer functions,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.510
and then model analysis--
more specifically,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.300
response to initial conditions,
response to steady state

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.940
harmonic inputs.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.160
Anything else that was
significant, conceptual,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.600
and new in the last week?

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.730
Add to that.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.970
And then the second
thing, what are

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.950
issues that are muddy for you?

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.370
Not quite clear, things you
want to learn more about,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.550
have questions about.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.220
Last class.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.970
was more on transfer functions
for multi-degree of freedom

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.610
systems and solving
initial condition problems

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.360
is what one student
was interested in about

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.345
from using modal analysis.

00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:39.880
But do any of you have
questions about things

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.080
that you want to practiced on?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.880
AUDIENCE: So I understand
how to get the new mass

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.650
and spring whatever
matricies for the q system,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.680
so I can set it up as the
mq bq kq, but from there,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.362
I don't know how to go
back and solve for x,

00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:01.820
or I don't know
how to solve for x.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.340
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.520
So we'll go through that.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.095
We're going to run through
a complete modal analysis

00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:09.125
today, all the steps that you
need to do to make it happen.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.760
So anything else that you've
got a question about that I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.810
might be able to get to?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.350
OK, let's get rolling.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.760
This will take a little while.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.940
So problem for the day is,
if you recall last time,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.470
we had this demo of
this double pendulum.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.470
But now we're going to
take that double pendulum

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.610
and make the masses unequal.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.170
So well, the masses
are equal here,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.962
but they could be
unequal-- M1, M2,

00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:40.170
they're each half a kilogram.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.360
But we're changing the lengths
a little bit, 1.1 for L1

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.550
and 1.0 meters for L2.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.600
So slightly different
lengths, and that'll

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.510
make this system not symmetric
so it won't have 1, 1

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.470
and 1 minus 1 mode shapes.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.770
A little weak spring in
the middle, possibility

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.740
of having some dashpot here
connected to a non-moving wall,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.640
another dashpot here.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.530
And the possibility
of having harmonic

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.320
excitations-- F1 on this
one, F2 on that one.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.510
The whole system's
been linearized.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.270
The equations in
motion look something

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.410
like this, mass damping
matrix, stiffness matrix.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.620
Of course, it has
gravity terms in it

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.120
as well as the spring terms.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.250
And it's been linearized.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.500
This equation in motion, is it
a force equation or a moment

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.670
equation?

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.960
Are they force or
moment or both?

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.790
We can have mixed
ones like the cart.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.010
Problem with the pendulum
has one force equation

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.740
and one equation
with units of torque,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.363
this one has units of what?

00:03:53.363 --> 00:03:54.204
AUDIENCE: Torque.

00:03:54.204 --> 00:03:54.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.339
This is moments about point
A and moments about point B

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:59.630
and give you the two equations.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.590
So this is a torque equation.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.290
So you need to look and see if
things inside here make sense.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.250
So the MGL, the non-linear
equation, the restoring torque,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.680
is MGL sine theta.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.340
Linearized, it's just theta.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.970
So MGL 1 theta is the
torque on the first mass.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.720
M2 GL 2 theta is the torque on
the second mass, and so forth.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.920
And K1 L1 squared,
why the L1 squared?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.930
This term here gets multiplied
by theta 1, so what is that?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.360
What's K1 L1 squared theta 1?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.139
What kind of a
torque-- what is that?

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:43.930
Does it make sense?

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.300
Are its units correct?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.335
So first of all, what's
K1 L1 times theta?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.710
AUDIENCE: Force.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's a force.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.012
What's L1 times theta?

00:04:58.012 --> 00:05:00.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.860
PROFESSOR: Physically,
that is what?

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.840
AUDIENCE: Distance.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.130
PROFESSOR: That's the distance
that that thing moves, right?

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.840
And a displacement
times a spring constant

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.070
gives you a force, and then
that force times a moment arm

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.700
gives you a torque.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.630
So it makes sense.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.560
OK, so L1 squared theta 1
is the torque about point A

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.890
caused by a
displacement theta 1,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.490
assuming this one
is 0 when you do it.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.490
That's the torque caused by a
displacement of theta 1 only.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.180
OK, all right.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.120
So that's our equations
of motion linearized.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.780
This is the mass matrix.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.040
This is the stiffness
matrix that you

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.510
would get if you go into there
and substitute in these values.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.205
Yeah?

00:06:03.205 --> 00:06:04.579
AUDIENCE: The
matrix on the right

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:07.830
would be to one of these
[INAUDIBLE] on the bottom?

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.330
PROFESSOR: This one here?

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.710
This is a two by two matrix.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.750
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.470
PROFESSOR: And it has to be.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.845
It's a two degree
freedom system.

00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:20.020
This is K11, the K11 term.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.370
This is the K12 term, the
K21 term, and the K2 term.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.290
AUDIENCE: So there's
a space between--

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.248
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it got
a little squeezed here.

00:06:30.248 --> 00:06:34.360
This space, there's an
M2GL2-- and that shouldn't

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.613
be squared-- plus KL2 squared.

00:06:38.613 --> 00:06:39.738
AUDIENCE: Plus [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:42.714 --> 00:06:44.937
PROFESSOR: All
right, pretty sure

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:46.270
that's what it out to read like.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.280
MGL2 KL2 squared.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:54.290
And then each of these are
minus KL1L2 minus KL1L2.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.080
All of this, this is all in a
handout which will be put up

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.110
on the Stellar website.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.890
And just so in terms of
reviewing for final and things

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.584
to go look at, for almost every
recitation we've done this

00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:11.000
during Professor Gossard, the
other recitation instructor,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.240
has written up the
complete problem

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.557
that was discussed
with its solution

00:07:15.557 --> 00:07:16.640
and put it on the website.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.931
So you don't even need to
have to copy this stuff down.

00:07:18.931 --> 00:07:21.969
It's all posted.

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:23.510
In each recitation,
we've essentially

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.110
done the problem that is
sort of the objective lesson

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.440
for the week.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.390
So they're a good
place to go review.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.270
So this whole problem
will be up on there.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.210
And we found a
mistake, actually.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.410
And I think it will get
fixed before it gets put up,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.910
but I think this
had a zero in here,

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.860
and that's actually
wrong, or if something

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.630
got transposed in writing.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.600
That's the correct mass.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.894
OK, so you have these numbers.

00:07:52.894 --> 00:07:54.560
I don't want you to
work this stuff out,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.090
because I want to focus
on the model analysis.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.480
So let's see here.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.660
I'm going to ask you
a question first.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.920
So we're going to begin this.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.559
Yeah?

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:06.100
AUDIENCE: Is there a torsional
damper at the top of the page?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.095
PROFESSOR: Oh, somebody asked
a question in the last class

00:08:09.095 --> 00:08:11.000
and I drew that up there.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.400
But if you put a
torsional damper up there,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.640
some CT value, how
would it appear

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.940
in the equation of motion?

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.630
Would it have L1,
L2 squareds in it?

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.100
No, it would just
simply disappear

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.380
as a plus CT theta
1 or a theta 2,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.941
wherever it's applied
directly, theta 1 dot.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.309
OK, so question.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.344
Write down your piece
of paper-- so I'm not

00:08:44.344 --> 00:08:46.010
going to make you go
to the board today,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.910
but I want you to take a
minute and write things down.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.750
And then we'll check and
see if everybody agrees.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.870
The reason we can
do modal analysis

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.830
is because of something we
called the modal expansion

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.480
theorem.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.620
It's basically the
fundamental statement

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.830
that says we can do this.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.930
So what is the modal
expansion theorem?

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.740
You can write it
down mathematically

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.770
if you want this, just as
a little linear algebraic

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.240
expression, or you could
write it out in words.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.780
So take 30 seconds
and write down

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.290
what makes modal analysis
work, what basic proposition.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.550
All right, somebody help me out.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.890
What is the modal
expansion theorem?

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.608
What's it say?

00:09:57.608 --> 00:09:59.604
AUDIENCE: Any
motion of the system

00:09:59.604 --> 00:10:03.300
can be described as a weighted
sum of the natural modes?

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.110
PROFESSOR: Weighted sum
of the motions of each

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.320
of the natural modes, OK.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:14.580
So that's the statement,
the most succinct way

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:20.150
to say it is in the original
generalized coordinates,

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.990
you can express them as uq.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:31.150
u is the matrix of what?

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.370
PROFESSOR: No, this is--

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.280
AUDIENCE: Oh no,
of the mode shapes.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.380
PROFESSOR: Mode shapes.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:43.320
And the q's are the individual
modal coordinates, right?

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.970
And so this, expanded, says
that this two degree freedom

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.510
system has two
generalized coordinates--

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.130
theta 1 and theta 2.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.040
And the response of either
of the actual motion

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.870
of the system expressed in
the generalized coordinates

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:05.220
can be made up as the sum of
each of the modal coordinates,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:11.450
the q sub i's,
scaled to this shape

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.660
the mode shape for that mode.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.770
So this multiplies
the mode shape,

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.640
and that-- so everything
contributed by mode

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.240
one will move in the
shape of mode one,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.100
and that will be
reflected in the motion

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.810
of the generalized coordinates.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.110
And in this case,
it's a two by two.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.190
It's a two-degree
freedom system.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.670
Here's the mode shape
of mode 1 times q1,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:41.070
which we're going to solve for,
plus the mode shape of mode two

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.755
times its model motion.

00:11:44.755 --> 00:11:46.790
OK, that's the model
expansion theorem.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:57.330
This allows you to--
in order to do this,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.120
you have to solve
for these qi's.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.280
So what is the
equation of motion

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:11.820
that governs the behavior of
each of the modal coordinates?

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.700
Write it down.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.720
What's the whole
reason we do this?

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.345
There's one particular
equation that every one of them

00:12:19.345 --> 00:12:19.845
satisfies.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.130
So equation of motion,
not asking for solution.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.270
I just want equation
of motion that

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.975
governs these modal motions.

00:12:57.767 --> 00:12:59.980
I think I'll give you a
minute to think about it.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.000
OK, somebody help me out.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.590
What's the equation
of motion that I

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.120
can write that will describe
the motion of any one

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.730
of these modal coordinates, qi?

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.000
Christina?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.370
AUDIENCE: With the
fancy M's and C's and K?

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.120
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.290
AUDIENCE: With the
fancy M's and C's and K?

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.980
PROFESSOR: Well yeah,
but it's basically

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.880
a very simple equation
of motion, which you

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.180
should be familiar with by now.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.300
What's it look like?

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.400
For any one of these
modal coordinates,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.780
what is the equation of
motion that governs it?

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.200
Why do we go to
all this trouble?

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.580
There's a reason for doing this.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.220
It's because--

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.160
AUDIENCE: Single
degree of freedom.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.640
PROFESSOR: Ahh, the single
degree of freedom oscillator

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.590
equation, right?

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.200
This is the reason we do this.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.590
Single degree of freedom systems
are mathematically simple.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.150
You've seen them
since high school.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.220
You've seen them in 1803.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.430
It's the second order
linear differential

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.119
equation that looks like this.

00:14:17.119 --> 00:14:18.660
And you already know
everything there

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.010
is to be known
about that equation.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.130
And that's why one of the
reasons why we do this.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.820
You don't have to
solve a complex set

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.720
of simultaneous
differential equations,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.780
you just have to know one.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.755
And so the ith one, you need
to know the ith modal mass,

00:14:31.755 --> 00:14:34.970
the ith modal damping,
the ith modal stiffness,

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.140
and the modal force.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.030
And we've-- in this course,
we've taught you how to solve

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:45.740
two kinds of single degree
of freedom system problems.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.020
One is response to
initial conditions

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.090
when the forces on the
right hand side is zero,

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.000
and the other is
this steady state

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.420
response to a harmonic input, so
a cosine omega t kind of input.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.870
So that's what we focused
on in this course,

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.150
because it's vibration
we're interested in.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.355
So we've solve this equation
for two kinds of problems.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.660
Now to do modal
analysis, you need

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.730
to be able to find
these quantities.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.970
These we called
the modal masses,

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.360
the modal damping coefficients,
the modal stiffnesses.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.940
How do you get those?

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.980
How, for example?

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.440
Write down on your
paper, what equation,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.390
what linear algebra
thing do you have

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.384
to work out to get the modal
masses for this system?

00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:36.300
Let's say all of them.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.642
I want a two-degree system.

00:15:38.642 --> 00:15:39.350
What's the state?

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.820
What's the mass,
the linear algebra

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.694
you have to work out to
get the modal masses?

00:16:02.222 --> 00:16:02.930
Somebody help me.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:03.545
What is it?

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:05.030
Yeah?

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:10.475
AUDIENCE: Transpose
of the mode vector--

00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:13.445
sorry, the mode matrix
multiplied by the mass vector?

00:16:13.445 --> 00:16:15.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.535
AUDIENCE: And then multiplied
by the mode matrix.

00:16:18.535 --> 00:16:19.410
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:16:26.172 --> 00:16:28.110
All right.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:33.680
The modal forces
are u transpose f.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.140
The modal masses--
and I've drawn

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.056
these little diagonal
marks in here to remind,

00:16:37.056 --> 00:16:39.619
you these matrices
become all diagonal

00:16:39.619 --> 00:16:40.910
when you do the model analysis.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.930
Coordinate transformation,
I'll call it.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.290
So the modal masses
are u transpose mu.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:54.270
And this m is a matrix,
and it's the original mass

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.200
matrix of the system.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.270
Modal stiffness,
matrix u transpose ku.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.400
And the modal damping
matrix, u transpose cu.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.359
But this one can be problematic.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.990
You have to force
this one to behave.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.890
These are guaranteed
to behave, all right?

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.569
So for this problem,
and I know some of you

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:22.300
are a little rusty
calculating these things.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.000
So there's the
model mass matrix.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.910
And here is the modal matrix
of eigenvectors or mode

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.500
shapes of the system.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.790
u is made up of
columns, and each column

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.990
is one of the mode shapes.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:48.270
The convention is to order them
from the first mode to the nth

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.740
mode where the
order is established

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.865
by the natural frequencies.

00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:53.750
The lowest natural frequency
is first-- second, second,

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.520
up to the highest
natural frequency.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.110
Anyway, here's mode one, here's
mode two for this system.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.880
You have to choose
a way in which

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.850
to normalize the mode shapes.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.300
I choose to normalize
them usually.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.950
I say, I'm going to make
the top element of them one.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.780
And I do that whatever--
if do MATLAB like you do,

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.190
there's a function called
Eig, which means eigenvalue.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:28.050
You do Eig of A, it'll give you
the eigenvalues of matrix A.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.915
And it'll give them back to
you unnormalized and unordered.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.424
Well, so you can
write a little program

00:18:36.424 --> 00:18:37.590
to put it all in nice order.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:44.110
But if MATLAB gave you back
the mode shapes for a system

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.600
and it said, well, the
mode shapes of the system

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.260
are-- and it's a
two by two system.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:58.260
2 and 0.4 and 0.6 0.5, you know
that the vectors are the mode

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.230
shapes, the columns.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.440
How would you normalize those?

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.364
How would you make the top
element 1 in this first one?

00:19:07.364 --> 00:19:08.280
AUDIENCE: Divide by 2.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.446
PROFESSOR: Divide what by 2?

00:19:09.446 --> 00:19:10.750
AUDIENCE: The Entire column.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.166
PROFESSOR: The
entire column by 2.

00:19:12.166 --> 00:19:13.250
Just factor 2 out.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.950
So this would become
2/2 and 0.4/2.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:25.260
And then that's 1 and 0.2.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.620
So you just normalize this
vector so the top element is 1.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.270
So do you have to normalize it?

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.740
Could you use them this way?

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.350
Sure.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:42.030
But once chosen, once the
normalization is chosen,

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.680
the key to doing modal analysis
is you have to stick with it.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.522
You can't move.

00:19:46.522 --> 00:19:48.230
You can't mess with
that halfway through,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.625
or you totally screw
up the solution.

00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:52.560
So you pick your normalization.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.140
When you calculate the natural
frequencies and mode shapes,

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.060
you pick a
normalization, and you

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.190
must ride with that
all the way through,

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.130
including putting it
back together here

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.590
at the end, this summation.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.660
OK, so let's do-- I want
you to do this computation.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.450
Calculate the modal
masses for this problem.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.740
That means you have to
remember what a transpose is.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.390
There's the model,
that's the model matrix.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.950
And the modal mass
matrix is right there.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.450
So actually, just
do the arithmetic.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:26.620
Take a few minutes.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.480
Yeah?

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.980
AUDIENCE: On the
exam, we won't have

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.122
calculators, so like is it all
going to be variables, or--?

00:20:32.122 --> 00:20:33.568
PROFESSOR: Say that again?

00:20:33.568 --> 00:20:36.109
AUDIENCE: On the exam, we won't
have calculators or anything.

00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:38.590
PROFESSOR: On the exam, we'd
either make it so simple

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.430
that you can, in fact, do
it in your head or on paper,

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.280
or we won't ask a question that
you have to do it that way.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.845
Or we'll accept an answer
where you put it down but don't

00:20:54.845 --> 00:20:55.845
have to multiply it out.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.050
So just do this one,
just to see if you

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:06.300
remember the mechanics of doing
the linear algebra to get that.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.480
OK, somebody have
an answer for me

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.600
here for the modal mass matrix?

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.920
What's the first element?

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.628
Somebody help me.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.205
Give me a number and then
everybody else can check you.

00:21:25.916 --> 00:21:27.585
AUDIENCE: 0.254.

00:21:27.585 --> 00:21:28.460
PROFESSOR: Say again?

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.040
AUDIENCE: 0.254.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.850
PROFESSOR: 0.254.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.340
OK, what about the second
one, this element over here?

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.280
Speak up.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:41.790
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.123
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it better be 0.

00:21:43.123 --> 00:21:44.670
What about this one down here?

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.990
All right, how about this one?

00:22:05.217 --> 00:22:07.057
AUDIENCE: Wait, that
first one's not right.

00:22:07.057 --> 00:22:07.682
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:22:07.682 --> 00:22:09.200
AUDIENCE: That first
one's not right.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.783
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:12.806 --> 00:22:14.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.550
PROFESSOR: So did you
give me the first one?

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.010
So you're authorized
to change this.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.680
OK, you got point what?

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.842
AUDIENCE: 859.

00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:30.370
PROFESSOR: 8598, And this 0,
0-- how about this second one

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.518
down here now?

00:22:31.518 --> 00:22:37.520
AUDIENCE: 3.48.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.940
PROFESSOR: 3.48.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.525
Anybody else get
anything different?

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:59.130
So let's-- we have
605 00 and 0.5,

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.785
and we're multiplying that.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:50.851
So if you're looking for just
one of them, by the way--

00:23:50.851 --> 00:23:55.790
where'd my eraser go?-- all
you need is one of the modal

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:56.290
masses.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:06.350
The only ones that give
you non-zero results

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:22.720
is when you compute u transpose
for mode r m u for mode r.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.400
So if you're only looking
for this second one,

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.140
you only have to do the
calculation for that mode.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.060
So this then becomes a set
of matrix, matrix, matrix,

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.850
you only have to do
a couple of vectors.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:41.070
So this looks like for
mode 2, it's minus what?

00:24:43.820 --> 00:25:04.640
Mode 2 is 1, and minus 1.6949
times 0.60500 0.5 times 1

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.520
and minus 1.6949.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.990
So to get just one
modal mass, this is M2.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.680
To get just one modal
mass, now you only

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.846
have to do that calculation.

00:25:15.846 --> 00:25:21.040
You only have to do
the computation using

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.190
one of the mode shapes.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.390
So it's this times that,
and this times that

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.400
gives you some numbers back.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.790
0.605 and half of
this about point

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.370
0.8, and then you take
that and multiply again.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.150
Anyway, can somebody give
me this second number?

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.010
I have a 3.48.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.400
Anybody get anything different?

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:40.900
Pardon?

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.950
AUDIENCE: I messed it up.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.000
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.375
There are about 18 of you and
nobody can do this calculation?

00:25:52.155 --> 00:25:52.830
AUDIENCE: 2.13.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.705
PROFESSOR: Say again?

00:25:53.705 --> 00:25:55.360
AUDIENCE: 2.130.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:12.030
PROFESSOR: All right, I
have a 2.132 and a 2.0.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:18.290
OK, there you are.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.610
OK, so if you were having
trouble sorting that out,

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.290
probably a good thing to go
back and review a little bit

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.550
of your linear algebra.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.680
OK, if you do u transpose
ku, you get this.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.688
Yeah?

00:26:34.688 --> 00:26:36.560
AUDIENCE: What is it
for the [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.110
you have a multiplied
by F1 L1, not just F1?

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.800
PROFESSOR: OK, I'm going to
guess where I'm going next.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:49.000
So to get the stiffness matrix,
u transpose ku, you get this.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.970
We're going to leave the
damping matrix for a minute.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:52.830
We need that.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.290
We need the modal excitations.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.870
So I'm just going to do
a particular problem.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.900
I'm going to say,
let's let F2 be 0.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.290
We'll only have one force.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.080
And the first force will
be F1 cosine omega t.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.610
And so now I need
to do u transpose

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.150
F. So here is u transpose.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.902
Here's the F's, and
I guess I've got

00:27:12.902 --> 00:27:17.890
to keep my cosine omega t here.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.890
So you multiply that out.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.620
What do you get?

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.120
Yeah?

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.070
AUDIENCE: Why is
F1 L1 [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.290
PROFESSOR: Well,
because F1 is just

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.310
the applied force, but the
equation in motion that we're

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.860
working with, if you
go back and look at it,

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.770
what is the forces on
the right hand side?

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.150
The forces have to
be moments, right?

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.200
If we're putting a force down
there, it's a moment equation.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.050
We need the moments
about the pivot.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:51.074
So it's the force times
L1 or the force times L2.

00:27:51.074 --> 00:27:54.726
AUDIENCE: Oh, so we don't have
to use actual magnitude of 4.

00:27:54.726 --> 00:27:56.452
We have to use [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:56.452 --> 00:27:57.410
PROFESSOR: You have to.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.830
You well eventually-- well,
these kind of problems

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.380
are easiest to do once you
reduce them to numbers.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.350
I'm leaving the force in it
as a variable at the moment

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.760
just so you can see how it
carries through the problem.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.490
But I'm just saying,
in the real problem

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.860
there, let's say there is no F2.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:24.490
There is an F1, and the F1
of t looks like a magnitude

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.200
f1 times cosine omega t.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.520
That's the only force
I have in the system.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.256
But we're working with
equations of motions.

00:28:32.256 --> 00:28:35.440
An equation of motion is the
right hand side-- F1, L1,

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.760
and F2 L2.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.570
And you have to retain
the L1's and L2's in order

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.555
to have the correct
equation of motion.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:50.530
So when we say this is kind
of just a generic form,

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:55.610
this is the modal force
vector is the mode shape

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.950
matrix times the
modal excitations

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.610
in the original coordinates.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.930
So I just wrote F here,
but what this really means

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.060
is this is F1, L1.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.540
F2, L2.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:21.000
These are the real generalized
forces in the system.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.190
OK, they're the real,
generalized forces.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.960
Now, I've let F2 be 0.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:31.710
So the only generalized force
is F1, L1 cosine omega T.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.790
I multiply that by u transpose
to get-- and what do I get?

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.300
This is a pretty
simple calculation.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:47.810
So this becomes F1,
L1 cos and F1, L1 cos.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.220
So the two modal
forces are identical.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:51.720
Yeah?

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.148
AUDIENCE: Why do
we know this one

00:29:53.148 --> 00:29:54.617
so we don't have
to include a phi?

00:29:54.617 --> 00:29:56.450
PROFESSOR: Ah, well the
phi doesn't come out

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:57.158
until the answer.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.550
What does the fee mean?

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.650
What's that phase angle mean?

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:10.140
If you-- remember, we're
doing steady state problems

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:19.720
in which F1, L1 for
example, if it's cosine,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.640
we're just assuming
it looks like that.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.235
And we're looking for
a solution of theta 1.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:34.720
And actually, we can't
quite go there yet.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.600
We're doing single degree
of freedom problems, right?

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.020
We are looking for
a solution for Q1.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.680
We turn this into
a modal force, q,

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.680
but it happens to be the
capital Q1, the modal force,

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.820
is F1 L1, right?

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.250
Cosine omega t.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.120
So that's the input.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.200
The output is q, little q,
of t, the modal coordinate.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.310
And what does it look like?

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.630
We're only doing steady
state, no transience.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:12.650
It looks like a response
that looks like this,

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.830
but it's shifted.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.910
I'll draw this so its
peak is right here,

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:23.010
cosine is its-- it's shifted
in time by this amount,

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:26.470
between this peak is here
versus the peak being there.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.450
And that we can represent
as a phase angle.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:34.680
Remember, one period from
here to here is 2 pi radians.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.300
So some portion of that
period is an angle.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.745
You can interpret it as an
angle or you can interpret it

00:31:41.745 --> 00:31:44.290
as a time delay.

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:52.320
And this then has the form of
some q1 magnitude cosine omega

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.050
t minus that phase shift.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:00.320
So it's only-- that's the only
thing the phase shift means.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.570
Cosine in doesn't mean
exactly the response

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.797
out's going to be exactly in the
same perfectly in time with it.

00:32:07.797 --> 00:32:08.630
It could be shifted.

00:32:11.475 --> 00:32:13.225
Now you know that it--
for a single degree

00:32:13.225 --> 00:32:15.555
of freedom system at resonance,
what's the phase angle?

00:32:15.555 --> 00:32:16.710
Do you remember that?

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.170
It's always one number.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.435
It's pi over 2.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.110
A shift of pi over 2, if you
remember your trigonometry,

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.845
takes you from cosine to
sine or sine to cosine.

00:32:30.845 --> 00:32:34.610
It's trying to tell you
that the response is

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:40.240
shifted by exactly a quarter
of a cycle, pi over 2.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.400
And the reason for that
is that at resonance,

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.990
all of the excitation is going
into overpowering the damper.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:54.020
And the damper's motion is
proportional to velocity.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.490
And if velocity, if
displacement looks like cosine,

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.580
velocity looks like
one derivative of it,

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.280
which is sine.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.890
So that pi over 2
says that the response

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:12.010
velocity is in phase with the
force, and that makes sense.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.510
Something I hadn't
said in lecture

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.550
but I really meant
to is I want you

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.820
to think about something here.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.977
Single degree of
freedom system, we'll

00:33:18.977 --> 00:33:20.560
even write the one
we're working with.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:29.420
M1 Q1 double dot plus
C1 Q1 dot plus K1 Q

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.960
equals some F1 L1
cosine omega t,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.510
and I'm going to let
omega E be at omega 1.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.240
But this is the equation
of motion, right?

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.560
Let's plug in.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.430
We're saying we're going
to do this right at the--

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:52.360
and we know the response of this
is Q1 is some magnitude cosine

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.600
omega t minus the phasing.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.920
We know we can plug that in.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:21.719
We get minus M1 omega squared
Q1 plus K1 Q1 minus C1 omega Q1.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:26.739
And this one goes like
sine omega T minus phi.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:28.870
This one here needs
to get multiplied.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:33.254
This term gets multiplied
by cosine omega t minus phi.

00:34:33.254 --> 00:34:35.920
You plug that into this.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.570
This term and this term
both behave like cosine.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.650
This term, one derivative
behaves like minus sine.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.690
One derivative of cosine
gives you minus sine, right?

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:50.260
And when omega
equals omega 1, so

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.830
when you're right at
resonance here, what happens?

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:58.520
This is squared.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.530
And put the squared
down here, there we go.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.310
So this is omega.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.200
But now I'm going to let
it be right at omega 1.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:12.150
What is omega 1 in
terms of K's and M's?

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.790
K1/M1, otherwise,
one of the checks

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.270
you can make when you finish
doing your modal-- if you take

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.200
that modal mass and
the modal stiffness

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.400
and you divide 7.96 by 0.8598,
that had better be omega 1

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.497
squared.

00:35:27.497 --> 00:35:29.080
That's a good way
to check that you've

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.950
done all your arithmetic right.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.970
All right, I'm going
to plug in omega 1

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.650
squared here equals K1/M1.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:46.070
So I put in, this becomes
minus M1 K1 over M1, which

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.830
is minus K1, right?

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.670
Hmm, plus K1.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:57.040
That resonance,
this term accounts

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.170
for the inertial force in the
system, the force required

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.340
to accelerate the mass.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.460
This is a force equation.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:08.130
This accounts for the force
required to push the spring.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.970
The amazing thing that
happens is at resonance,

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:18.540
the inertial forces exactly
cancel the spring forces.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:23.620
And the equation of
motion reduces to minus C1

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:33.550
omega 1 Q1 sine omega 1 t
minus a phase angle equals,

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:39.730
in this case, F1 L1
cosine omega 1 t.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.090
So how to satisfy that equation?

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:46.290
What phase angle will
satisfy that equation?

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.590
Has to be pi over 2.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.650
And if you put pi
over 2 in here,

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.300
this minus sign turns
into plus cosine.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:37:01.130
And you're left with C1
omega 1 Q1 equals F1 L1.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:07.170
So all of the exciting force
goes into pushing the dashpot.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:11.100
So that's why you get the big
peak in the transfer function.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.305
It takes in no force
to move the spring.

00:37:13.305 --> 00:37:15.820
It takes no force to
accelerate the mass.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.585
They exactly cancel.

00:37:17.585 --> 00:37:21.749
And all the force is available
to drive just the dashpot,

00:37:21.749 --> 00:37:23.140
all right?

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.900
So let's move on now.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.540
We need to get to
our answer here.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:41.080
So the last piece of this is
we now know the modal forces,

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:52.916
and your assignment is to
let's let omega-- let's see,

00:37:52.916 --> 00:37:57.820
where's my-- did I
do this somewhere?

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.535
I guess not.

00:37:58.535 --> 00:38:01.400
I guess I erased it, so we
can pick anything we want.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.907
Let's let omega equal omega 2.

00:38:05.907 --> 00:38:08.240
We're going to drive this
thing at the natural frequency

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.031
of the second mode.

00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:10.489
That's the excitation.

00:38:10.489 --> 00:38:11.280
What do you expect?

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.344
Which mode do you expect
to dominate the response?

00:38:14.344 --> 00:38:15.308
AUDIENCE: The second.

00:38:15.308 --> 00:38:16.432
PROFESSOR: The second mode.

00:38:16.432 --> 00:38:17.102
Why?

00:38:17.102 --> 00:38:19.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.052
PROFESSOR: Because
you are driving it.

00:38:21.052 --> 00:38:23.510
You know it's got a transfer
function that looks like this,

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.580
and you're driving
it right here.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.260
And where are you driving it?

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.310
If you're doing
that, where are you

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.970
on the transfer function
for the first mode?

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:41.100
Omega 2, it's a little higher
than omega 1, but not a lot.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.280
So if this were the first
mode's transfer function,

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:49.710
where would you be driving
it on this transfer function?

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:58.709
If this is omega over omega 2,
you're over here a little bit.

00:38:58.709 --> 00:39:00.250
You're driving it
a little bit higher

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.270
than the natural
frequency of mode 1.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:06.240
This would be omega 2
over omega 1 on that.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.600
So one's sitting here,
one's sitting there.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.360
Which one's going to dominate?

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.360
The big one, OK?

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.990
Because they have
equal modal forces.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:16.290
They both happen to be F1 L1.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:19.320
OK, so how do you do that?

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.490
So the last step
in this thing is

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:35.417
I want you to, for this
case, find the first-- no,

00:39:35.417 --> 00:39:36.000
let's do this.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:46.960
Find the second
mode contribution

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:52.690
to the response in the original
generalized coordinates.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.522
A quiz would often
be written this way.

00:39:54.522 --> 00:39:56.105
It's trying to make
it easier for you.

00:39:56.105 --> 00:39:58.870
I'm asking for only one
mode's contribution.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:02.690
What does that actually mean
in the original statement

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.030
of the modal expansion theorem?

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.720
We know the total response
looks like this, right?

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.290
I'm asking you to give me only
the second mode's contribution.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.410
What am I asking for?

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:17.824
Just this term.

00:40:17.824 --> 00:40:19.240
So I'm telling
you, you don't have

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.880
to bother with the other
term to satisfy me.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.610
Just tell me what
this one is, because I

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.460
know this is one is going
to be the dominant one.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.720
OK, so how do I do that?

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.700
So for this problem, what
is the steady state response

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:34.650
of this due to mode 2 only?

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:38.710
So mathematically, just
in-- what's that look

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:39.580
like over here?

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.510
Just that second term, right?

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:51.650
It's the modal, mode shape
vector for mode 2 times Q2

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:52.580
of t.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.050
So you need to tell me
how to find Q1 of t.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.200
It's a single degree of freedom
problem excited by steady state

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:03.700
excitation.

00:41:18.094 --> 00:41:19.760
AUDIENCE: It's like
a transfer function.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.910
PROFESSOR: Ah, magic
word-- transfer function.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:26.290
So we need the magnitude of
the-- this is a linear problem,

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.384
so the response is linearly
proportional to the--?

00:41:29.384 --> 00:41:30.050
AUDIENCE: Force.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.758
PROFESSOR: Force.

00:41:30.758 --> 00:41:34.430
So the magnitude of
Q1 times a transfer

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.600
function that looks like the
hx over f transfer function.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:45.850
In this case, we call it the
magnitude of HQ2 per unit Q2.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:49.810
And that multiplied
by-- it looks

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:55.390
like cosine in this case--
omega 2 t minus some phi 2.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.060
That's what we're looking for.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.172
What's this?

00:41:58.172 --> 00:41:59.380
Tell me what that looks like.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:41:59.879
Yeah?

00:41:59.879 --> 00:42:02.510
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't it be Q2?

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.750
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.270
So in effect, what's
the transfer function?

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:13.020
I want it in all its detail now.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.490
That's the magnitude
of the force.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.245
What's in the numerator of this?

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.552
Numerator.

00:42:29.552 --> 00:42:32.360
AUDIENCE: Well, it has
parentheses around it.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's in
the denominator though.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.760
I want just the numerator part.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.167
This transfer
function expression

00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:40.750
for a single degree
of freedom system,

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.749
what's in the numerator?

00:42:41.749 --> 00:42:42.780
AUDIENCE: 1/K.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.550
PROFESSOR: 1 over which K?

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.850
K2.

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:53.422
Modal K2, We're now
in the modal system.

00:42:53.422 --> 00:42:55.880
And in the denominator of that
transfer function, what's it

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.845
look like?

00:42:56.845 --> 00:43:00.810
AUDIENCE: 1 plus omega.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:04.770
PROFESSOR: 1 minus omega
squared over-- in this case,

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:10.090
omega 2 squared, squared, plus--

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:14.184
AUDIENCE: 2 [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:14.184 --> 00:43:14.850
PROFESSOR: Zeta.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:16.740
AUDIENCE: Zeta, yeah.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.034
PROFESSOR: 2.

00:43:18.034 --> 00:43:25.362
AUDIENCE: 2 omega over
omega 2 quantity squared.

00:43:25.362 --> 00:43:26.320
PROFESSOR: There we go.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.778
Now in this problem,
what is omega?

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:35.280
So that makes this
a 2, this a 2.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.770
This term, what happens to it?

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.480
1 minus 1.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.950
This term, this goes to 1.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:47.160
This is 2 zeta quantity
squared square root.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.480
Just 2 zeta.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.540
So this whole at resonance,
any one of these single degree

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.390
of freedom systems
that are at resonance,

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:58.220
the response is the magnitude
of the force-- in this case,

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:06.980
it's positive F1 L1--
over K2 times 1/2 zeta 2.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:16.080
So F1 L1 is the modal magnitude
of the moral force divided

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.320
by K2 gives you what we
call the static displacement

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.490
of the system.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:24.690
And this is the
dynamic application.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:26.790
So oftentimes on
quizzes, you're asked

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.130
to do the response at
resonance, because it makes

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:30.600
all this algebra so simple.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.360
It boils down to 1/2 zeta.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.020
So the only thing left to do
is we need the damping ratio

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:37.690
for this system.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.320
So rather than do that,
so now that, we're

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.400
missing something yet.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.610
We're missing-- that whole thing
gets multiplied by cosine omega

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:52.500
2 t minus the face angel.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.490
What's the face angel?

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:56.570
Pi over 2.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:10.640
So Q2 of t is F1 L1 over K1
1/2-- whoops, F1 L1 over K2,

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:18.650
1/2 zeta 2 cosine
omega 2t minus.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:21.880
And at the very--
how do we get back

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:27.170
to generalized coordinates,
theta 1 and theta 2?

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:28.150
AUDIENCE: Stay here.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.590
PROFESSOR: Right here.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.930
And we've computed that.

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:39.160
This part, you multiply
it by the mode shape.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.300
The mode shape partitions
out the response

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.480
in the right amount
to coordinate

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.810
one and the correct
amount to coordinate two.

00:45:54.762 --> 00:45:58.234
AUDIENCE: For the damping ratio,
would you take the modal, like,

00:45:58.234 --> 00:46:01.870
mass and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.660
PROFESSOR: In
reality, what you do

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:14.720
with damping ratios is you're
working with real things

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.650
out there in the real world.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.135
If you can, you go up
and give the thing a kick

00:46:20.135 --> 00:46:23.620
and get your stopwatch out and
say, how many cycles does it

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.800
take to the k?

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.560
And is it light damping or not?

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.790
If it vibrates a lot, it's
usually light damping.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:33.340
And if it's light damping, you
can force this damping matrix.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.720
You can just make--
force it to behave,

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.980
even if it isn't perfect.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.620
And it is a perfectly
adequate, useful answer.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.220
Even if it isn't
perfectly diagonal,

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.695
it just doesn't matter
when it's light damping.

00:46:44.695 --> 00:46:46.570
And so in this problem,
what you do if you go

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.070
estimate the damping
for the system.

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:51.720
You say eh, it looks to me
to be about 2% for mode one

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.950
and 1.5% for mode 2.

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:58.130
And you just say, how can I fit?

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.880
How can I represent the
damping in the system?

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.050
And one of the
easiest ones is to say

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:06.480
that the original damping
matrix is some alpha times

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.110
the mass matrix plus beta
times the stiffness matrix.

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:14.700
And in this problem-- or you
can use any part of that.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.420
And if you're only trying
to match one mode, see,

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.430
this problem it's-- this system
is being driven at the natural

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.200
frequency of one mode.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.650
That mode is dominating
the response, right?

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:31.900
So we really actually
only need a good model

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.760
of the damping for that mode.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.790
Even if you have the
completely wrong damping

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:40.860
for the other mode, it will
have little effect on its answer

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:43.410
because you're not at resonance.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:48.730
When in the transfer functions,
which look like this,

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.350
at resonance, this happens.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:55.710
Then you find out that the
only force resisting the input

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:58.220
is the dashpot.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.030
At low frequencies, you
find out that over here,

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.420
the dominant force is what
it takes to move the spring.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.170
And the damping
isn't very important.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:08.380
And so even if
you're wrong by 50%,

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:12.350
it just doesn't-- 50% of a
little bit compared to what it

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:15.350
takes to move the spring
is not a big deal.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.100
And over here, it
behaves like the mass.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.010
Out here it's called the
mass controlled region.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.350
Over here is the stiffness
controlled region.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.230
And in the vicinity of the
peak is the damping controlled

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.730
region.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:30.370
So at low frequency,
this term dominates.

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.565
At high frequency,
that term dominates.

00:48:32.565 --> 00:48:36.360
And at resonance, this
is the dominant term.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:41.150
So in this case, let's let
the damping be some alpha

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.410
times the mass matrix.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:49.890
Then when you do UTCU, you
get alpha times the modal mass

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:50.390
matrix.

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:57.230
And therefore, C2, which
is the one we care about,

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:01.410
is equal to alpha times M2.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:13.420
And we have M2, our
modal mass, 2.04, right?

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:20.960
So that says this is equal-- C2
is equal to alpha times 2.04.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.060
And if I want-- that's C2.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.400
And how do I get zeta 2?

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.300
Zeta 2 is C2 over 2 omega 2 M2.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.070
That's just the definition
of the damping ratio.

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:36.070
I know this.

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.050
I know this.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:48.630
So this is going to be alpha
times 2.04 over 2 omega 2 M2.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.420
And I've measured it.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.770
I've taken it, and
I know this is 0.02.

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:54.690
About 2% damping.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:56.350
Solve for alpha.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:50:01.130
You now have the whole
thing that you need.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:04.240
You can now find it.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.760
That's all you need.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.260
Yeah?

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.578
AUDIENCE: Where do you get the
alphas and omegas from again?

00:50:10.578 --> 00:50:13.430
Alphas and omegas.

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:17.310
PROFESSOR: This is simply--
this is called Rayleigh damping.

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:20.786
Lord Rayleigh 150 years
ago came up with this.

00:50:20.786 --> 00:50:22.160
And he just said
hey, by the way,

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.576
if you model damping
this way, you

00:50:23.576 --> 00:50:26.970
can automatically make
the equations of motion,

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.730
u transpose CU, go diagonal.

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:33.010
And you have a two
parameter model

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:37.210
with which you can juggle
them to make any two

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.660
damping ratios of the
system be exactly what you

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.550
want them to be.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:46.610
So it's just-- if I left
this as alpha N beta,

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.290
then I would have worked
this problem as-- this would

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:54.630
have been an alpha M plus a beta
K. C2 would have been an alpha

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.110
M2.

00:50:56.110 --> 00:51:03.680
But now it would be equal
to alpha M2 plus beta K2.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.640
And then this still
applies, except that it'd

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.850
have this alpha and a beta.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.840
And you could do it
for the other equation.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.410
You could do it for zeta 1.

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:14.720
And you'd have two
equations and two unknowns.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.349
You solve for alpha and beta.

00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:18.890
But think about what
I just did here.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.750
If I made a measurement
of the system,

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:23.490
I said the damping
for mode 2 is 2%.

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:25.750
Do I have to go
through all this junk?

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:29.640
No, because I know the
answer looks like that.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.610
All I have to know is
what the damping is.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.620
And that's my approximate
solution for the problem.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.830
This is just how to
satisfy all the mathematics

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:39.460
if you want that perfect
mathematical model

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:43.740
for which you can write out
u transpose CU and get them.

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.700
Well, this is one
way that you force

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:53.277
the damper matrix to have the
properties that you want it to.

00:51:53.277 --> 00:51:55.110
But in reality, you
just measure the damping

00:51:55.110 --> 00:52:00.050
and put it in the answer.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:04.890
Very good, this is our last
go around at recitations.

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:08.270
See you in class on Tuesday.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:14.280
We'll do something fun that's
not covered on the final exam.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.800
I'll give a little
review of what's

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.590
going to be on the final,
a list of what's on it.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:20.740
And we'll talk about
strings and beams and things

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:24.720
that apply to pianos and
violins and so forth.
