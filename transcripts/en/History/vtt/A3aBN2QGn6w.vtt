00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.631
NARRATOR: Sanliurfa,
Turkey, October 1994.

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:10.343
While plowing his field,
shepherd Safak Yildiz

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:16.015
spots a strangely shaped stone
protruding from the ground.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:19.978
After brushing away the dirt,
he realizes that it may be

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:23.606
part of a much larger object.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:27.026
Shortly after contacting the
local museum with his find,

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:30.321
he is visited by Klaus
Schmidt from the German

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.657
Archaeological Institute.

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:35.160
HUGH NEWMAN: It wasn't
until German archaeologist

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.081
Klaus Schmidt visited the site
and began digging they realized

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.542
what was really at the site.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.961
WILLIAM HENRY: What he
discovered was mind blowing.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.672
After discovering the
first t-shaped pillar

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:50.175
buried at the site,
he soon found more

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:53.553
of these massive structures.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:57.432
NARRATOR: During the intensive
dig, Schmidt and his team

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:00.268
begin to unearth dozens
of additional giant,

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:03.563
stone monoliths covered
in intricate carvings.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.608
Some weighing as
much as 20 tons.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.276
PAUL BAHN: The site
of Gobekli Tepe

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.696
is a series of
circular enclosures,

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.990
but then in the center
of each enclosure

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.409
you have two particularly
big, t-shaped

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.497
pillars of limestone sort
of facing each other.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:24.000
Now many of these pillars have
remarkable carvings on them,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.753
wonderful carvings and
bas-reliefs of animals,

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.339
birds, insects, all
kinds of things.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.674
So to fashion those
and carve them

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.259
and set them up in
these structures

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.346
was just absolutely amazing.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:38.681
NARRATOR: Archaeologists
estimate that it would have

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:42.602
taken a team of 50 men
an entire week to move

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.813
just one of the
monolithic pillars

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.690
from the limestone quarry
to the top of the hill

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.653
where they stand today,
and over 300 hours

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:54.280
to carve the bas-reliefs.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.408
At this rate, each of
the five stone circles

00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:59.911
unearthed so far
would have required

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.872
a full year to be completed.

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:06.918
But why such a monumental site
was built in the first place

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:10.338
remains a mystery.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.048
PAUL BAHN: It's very
difficult to know

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:15.176
what the purpose of something
like Gobekli Tepe could be.

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:16.845
And certainly Klaus
Schmidt had not

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:19.013
reached any conclusions
except that it's

00:02:19.013 --> 00:02:20.348
clearly not a settlement.

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.683
It's not a village.

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.853
There is absolutely
no domestic refuge.

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:28.565
Schmidt always hoped
that it was funerary

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.317
and that there would be
burials underneath the walls

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.111
or underneath some of
the pillars or so on.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:35.572
But so far, they
have not yet found

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.575
any human remains at the site.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.785
There were no domestic
plants in the site.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:43.496
There are only
wild animal bones.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.582
Inevitably in archeology
if we don't know what

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.543
something is for we think
of ritual, but really

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.212
it's pure speculation.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:54.007
NARRATOR: Intrigued by evidence
that the structure might go

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.135
back to a Neolithic
period, Klaus

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:02.849
Schmidt has the sediment layers
of the site radiocarbon dated.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.185
The results indicated that
the stone structures could

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:10.899
be as much as 12,000
years old, more than 5,000

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.319
years older than mankind's
first known civilization

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.696
in Mesopotamia.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.741
More than that, it would place
the construction of Gobekli

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:23.077
Tepe to a time when
mainstream scholars

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:29.751
suggest humans were roaming
the earth as hunter gatherers.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.502
PAUL BAHN: Well, the
site of Gobekli Tepe

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:34.130
really did send shockwaves
through the whole world

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.550
of early prehistory because
we'd never before known

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.719
or imagined even
that simple hunter

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.930
gatherers could produce
such spectacular

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.682
monumental structures.

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:47.727
Now in archeology,
really since it began,

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.271
we've always assumed that
hunter gatherers were

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:53.191
capable of producing wonderful
works of art-- rock art,

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.692
cave art, and things like that.

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:57.320
But we never imagined that
they could come together

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.033
in sufficient numbers to
make monumental constructions

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.702
like Gobekli Tepe.

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:08.206
NARRATOR: But if the currently
accepted timeline for mankind's

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:12.752
advancement is correct, is it
possible that primitive hunter

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.964
gatherers could have
built such sophisticated,

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.925
megalithic structures?

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.637
Ancient astronaut
theorists say, no.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:26.599
And instead, suggest that
Gobekli Tepe was built

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.602
by the survivors
of a lost society,

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.813
one that was almost
entirely wiped

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:35.775
out by a worldwide cataclysm.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:39.779
And to support their claim,
they point to recent evidence

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.533
of a catastrophic event, which
many mainstream scientists

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:47.286
believe occurred at the
very end of the last ice

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:53.251
age, which is believed to have
lasted from roughly 108,000 BC.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.379
until nearly 10,000 BC.
