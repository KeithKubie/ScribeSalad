00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.860
HERB KLEIN: Today is one of the
most favorite things for

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.650
me to do and that is mobilizing
the caring power of

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.900
our community through
volunteering.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.650 position:97%
 


00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.140
JACK BERGER: It's cool to be
out here at the YMCA, which

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.860
has been here since 1856.


00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.980
It's been serving the community
for over 150 years

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.310
and so it's just cool to be part
of something that's been

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.950
around for so long and be able
to help perpetuate what

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.030
they've been doing for
people for so long.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.280
SAMUEL FRISBY: When I started
here six months ago, there

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.320
were only 35 members in
this Y. And now we

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.610
have over 700 members.


00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.510
We've been doing good
work, but part

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.860
of it is the facility.


00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.890
JOE TULL: Personally, I did a
lot of service in high school

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.350
and it's much harder to do that
balancing an academic and

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.860
athletic schedule like there
is at Princeton.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.750
And a lot of guys feel the same
way and Weapons of Mass

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.810
Construction is a great way to
be able to come out here and

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.090
give back to the community.


00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.660
We laid some mulch down on the
playground to make it better.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.420
We're also going to firm up a
fence that seems to be falling

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.230
over a little bit.


00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.750
The kids can't play there
unless we raise

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.780
that up and fix it.


00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.210
So we definitely want them to
have a place to go out there

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.420
and have fun.


00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.730
SHIRLEY WANG: A preschool is run
through this YMCA and so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.210
there about 60 kids that come
here every day and the new

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.490
paint really brightens it up.


00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.630
And the new playground with new
mulch and the weeds that

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.640
are taken out looks
so much nicer.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.890
It's great.


00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.570
GABRIELLA GUZMAN: There were
holes in the windows in the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.300
classrooms and our job here is
basically to just fix it all

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.590
up for the community.


00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.670
So we create a place for them
to come and be together.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.630
We all joke about how it's like
a Princeton bubble, and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.080
we're not really exposed to
what's going on around us, so

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.130
I think this is a great
opportunity to be aware and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.800
help at the same time.


00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.640
JACK BERGER: I think it's a nice
kind of bond that we have

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.680
with the other teams.


00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.080
As athletes, we're all
in a similar

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.840
experience in this together.


00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.880
So it's great to see them
because people are in season,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.420
people are out of season, this
is a nice time that we can be out

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.860
with them and get to know some
different people that we might

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.980
not know as well.


00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.520
AMANDA BIRD: It's nice to get
out here with other teams and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520
know that Princeton Varsity Club
does more than just play

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.450
our sports.


00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.820
Just listening to the speeches
that they gave just before

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.370
really showed that they are
really appreciative of us

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.080
being here.


00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.450
So it makes it a lot better for
us to know that it's going

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.540
toward something that's
appreciated.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.270
JOE TULL: One of the biggest
facets of the University

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.540
athletic system is education
through athletics.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.450
It's the first thing on all our
coaches' minds as we go

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.430
through practice and workouts
and everything.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.170
But there's always different
kinds of education.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.380
We're going to Princeton to
get a great education in

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.270
liberal arts and every
kind of field.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.880
But there's also social
education that we rarely get a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.350
chance to learn from.


00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.810
And I think that's why
we're here today.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.970
Is to kind of get the education
about the community,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.980
about the social welfare of
people through athletics.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.640
HERB KLEIN: I'd like to actually
give a special thanks

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.310
to the Princeton Varsity Club.


00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.180
Through their commitment and
their involvement and their

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.770
willingness to help, we're able
to do activities like

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.590
this today.


00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.570
Organizations like the Princeton
Varsity Club are why

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.360
we're able to complete many of
the volunteer projects that we

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.310
complete in Mercer County.


00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:14.900
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.950
SAMUEL FRISBY: I didn't realize
how daunting it was

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.290
going to at least look.


00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.490
It just looked like a sea
of orange and black.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.280
It's like the cavalry is coming
and you know that

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.590
things are going to get done.


00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.950
We were very excited and proud
to see these young people

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.380
coming to give back to a
community that many of them

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.140
don't live in, and some
of them probably

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.190
have never been in.


00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.290
But we appreciate the fact that
they're here to give back

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.360
to this community.


00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.550
And we're looking forward to
what they've done having an

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.010
impact on the people
in this city.
