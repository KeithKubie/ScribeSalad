MICHEL DEGRAFF: So at
the end of the course,

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.820
what I've been wanting--

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.790
and I think that was achieved
for the greater part-- is

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.180
to have students become very
analytical when it comes

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.840
to the use of language,
race, religion,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.650
gender, as technologies,
technologies

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.140
to create hierarchies of power.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.000
But if you think of something
that Steven Biko once said,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.160
Biko once said that the most
efficient tool of the opressor

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.750
is the mind of the oppressed.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.650
So after the students to
understand how when you grow up

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.930
in a society where there
are various hierarchies that

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.920
are imposed on that
society based on tools,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.260
like how we perceive race, how
we perceive language varieties,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.000
how we perceive gender,
how we perceive religion,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.010
and we ourselves--

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.250
both myself as a faculty of
MIT, but also the students,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.640
are students coming from
different social groupings--

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.850
we bring those
hierarchies with us.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.506
And often, it's implicit--
not aware of that.

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.130
So at the end of the course, one
thing which became clear to me

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.920
is that the students
became more aware of how

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.710
these cultural phenomena
and the use of them

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.950
and the position of them are
used as tools to maintain

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.030
those hierarchies.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.130
So what became
clear to me is that

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.110
towards the end of the
course, the students

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.810
were indeed very self-conscious
of the uses of culture,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.500
of race, of religion, of
issues about migration

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.240
in creating those walls.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.630
And I think now they
have tools that they

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.690
can use to break those walls
within themselves, but also

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.550
within the social groups.
