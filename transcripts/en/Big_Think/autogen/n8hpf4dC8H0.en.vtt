in my lab I can think of three things
 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:07.780
in my lab I can think of three things
that we've done that have kind of been I

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790
that we've done that have kind of been I
 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.230
that we've done that have kind of been I
think you know and I don't say it to

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240
think you know and I don't say it to
 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.240
think you know and I don't say it to
credit myself because the a lot of

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250
credit myself because the a lot of
 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.070
credit myself because the a lot of
credit goes to the students and postdocs

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080
credit goes to the students and postdocs
 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.350
credit goes to the students and postdocs
who did this research in many cases they

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360
who did this research in many cases they
 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.249
who did this research in many cases they
came up with these ideas but one was the

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259
came up with these ideas but one was the
 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.850
came up with these ideas but one was the
rediscovery of something called

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860
rediscovery of something called
 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.220
rediscovery of something called
reconsolidation which is when you

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230
reconsolidation which is when you
 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.080
reconsolidation which is when you
retrieve a memory it becomes unstable

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090
retrieve a memory it becomes unstable
 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.659
retrieve a memory it becomes unstable
and new information can be incorporated

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669
and new information can be incorporated
 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.839
and new information can be incorporated
into the memory at that point it also

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849
into the memory at that point it also
 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.580
into the memory at that point it also
means that when the memory is unstable

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590
means that when the memory is unstable
 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.550
means that when the memory is unstable
its restabilization process can be

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560
its restabilization process can be
 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.200
its restabilization process can be
blocked and if you block that the memory

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210
blocked and if you block that the memory
 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.390
blocked and if you block that the memory
is weakened or dampened so that's how

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400
is weakened or dampened so that's how
 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.680
is weakened or dampened so that's how
we've been using reconsolidation to help

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690
we've been using reconsolidation to help
 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.910
we've been using reconsolidation to help
people with traumatic memories and try

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920
people with traumatic memories and try
 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.319
people with traumatic memories and try
and dampen their memories of those

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329
and dampen their memories of those
 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.780
and dampen their memories of those
traumatic situations not necessarily the

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790
traumatic situations not necessarily the
 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.340
traumatic situations not necessarily the
conscious cognitive memories but the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350
conscious cognitive memories but the
 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.740
conscious cognitive memories but the
emotional component of the memory so

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750
emotional component of the memory so
 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.140
emotional component of the memory so
that's one area that that I think we've

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150
that's one area that that I think we've
 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.229
that's one area that that I think we've
had a big impact in and Kareem Nader

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239
had a big impact in and Kareem Nader
 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.920
had a big impact in and Kareem Nader

it's also called extinction where you
give your condition a rat to be afraid

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540
give your condition a rat to be afraid
 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.210
give your condition a rat to be afraid
of something then you give the tone over

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220
of something then you give the tone over
 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.820
of something then you give the tone over
and over again and it stops being afraid

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830
and over again and it stops being afraid
 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.310
and over again and it stops being afraid
and this is also used in the treatment

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320
and this is also used in the treatment
 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.490
and this is also used in the treatment
of phobias and other kinds of anxiety

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500
of phobias and other kinds of anxiety

problems by weakening the the fear
 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.950
problems by weakening the the fear
associations that the trigger the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960
associations that the trigger the
 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.680
associations that the trigger the
emotion but the problem is that the fear

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690
emotion but the problem is that the fear
 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.140
emotion but the problem is that the fear
always bounces back at some point say by

always bounces back at some point say by
 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.570
always bounces back at some point say by
stress so the patient has a fear of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580
stress so the patient has a fear of
 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.670
stress so the patient has a fear of
heights and then his or her mother dies

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680
heights and then his or her mother dies
 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.289
heights and then his or her mother dies
and the fear of heights comes back even

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299
and the fear of heights comes back even
 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.270
and the fear of heights comes back even
though it was successfully treated but

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280
though it was successfully treated but
 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.090

we found a way in rats to prevent that
bounce back of the fear we can more or

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040
bounce back of the fear we can more or
 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.700
bounce back of the fear we can more or
less permanently dampen in it and that

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710
less permanently dampen in it and that

which the extinction process is timed in
 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.839
which the extinction process is timed in
a certain way and it's too complicated

a certain way and it's too complicated
 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.300
a certain way and it's too complicated
to explain in detail but by simply by

altering brain activity by what you do

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520
altering brain activity by what you do
 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.650
altering brain activity by what you do
is you connect up a molecule that you're

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660
is you connect up a molecule that you're
 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.380
is you connect up a molecule that you're
interested in with a virus so that it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390
interested in with a virus so that it
 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.450
interested in with a virus so that it
can be injected into the brain and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460
can be injected into the brain and
 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.080
can be injected into the brain and
altered genes in that brain area and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090
altered genes in that brain area and
 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.300
altered genes in that brain area and

what we've been injecting our molecules
 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.530
what we've been injecting our molecules
that that are light-sensitive so that

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540
that that are light-sensitive so that
 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.660
that that are light-sensitive so that
you inject this this virus into the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
you inject this this virus into the
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.320
you inject this this virus into the
brain it puts a molecule in that part of

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330
brain it puts a molecule in that part of
 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.740
brain it puts a molecule in that part of
the brain that then when you later

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750
the brain that then when you later

implant a small fiber-optic lamp in
there it's very tiny it's just you know

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650
there it's very tiny it's just you know
 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.680
there it's very tiny it's just you know
it's it's microscopic but it goes right

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690
it's it's microscopic but it goes right
 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.780
it's it's microscopic but it goes right
into the amygdala and when you shine a

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790
into the amygdala and when you shine a
 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.720
into the amygdala and when you shine a
flashlight on the amygdala it it causes

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730
flashlight on the amygdala it it causes
 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.060
flashlight on the amygdala it it causes
the neurons in the amygdala to be

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070
the neurons in the amygdala to be
 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.550
the neurons in the amygdala to be
responsive to light and to depolarize so

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560
responsive to light and to depolarize so
 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.710
responsive to light and to depolarize so
they have action potentials when the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720
they have action potentials when the
 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.160
they have action potentials when the
light shines on them and what this

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170
light shines on them and what this
 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.900
light shines on them and what this
allowed us to do was to test the basic

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910
allowed us to do was to test the basic
 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.840
allowed us to do was to test the basic
idea that learning in the brain or

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850
idea that learning in the brain or
 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.640
idea that learning in the brain or
learning in this case in the amygdala

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650
learning in this case in the amygdala
 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.880
learning in this case in the amygdala
but in the brain in general involves the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890
but in the brain in general involves the
 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.460
but in the brain in general involves the
depolarization depolarization of neurons

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470
depolarization depolarization of neurons
 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.530
depolarization depolarization of neurons
but in other words the firing of action

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540
but in other words the firing of action
 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.729
but in other words the firing of action
potentials while the neuron is getting a

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739
potentials while the neuron is getting a
 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.650
potentials while the neuron is getting a
meaningless stimulus so what we did is

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660
meaningless stimulus so what we did is
 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.350
meaningless stimulus so what we did is
we presented the rat with the tone while

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360
we presented the rat with the tone while
 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.380
we presented the rat with the tone while
we directly depolarized the lateral

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390
we directly depolarized the lateral
 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.380
we directly depolarized the lateral
amygdala cells with the light and this

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390
amygdala cells with the light and this
 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.960
amygdala cells with the light and this
created learning in that the form of in

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970
created learning in that the form of in
 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.880
created learning in that the form of in
the form of behavior when the rats later

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890
the form of behavior when the rats later
 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.830
the form of behavior when the rats later
heard the tone so this is a very

heard the tone so this is a very
 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.050
heard the tone so this is a very
important technical advance showing that

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060
important technical advance showing that
 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.170
important technical advance showing that
a very basic principle of synaptic

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180
a very basic principle of synaptic
 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.449
a very basic principle of synaptic
plasticity called heavy and learning

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459
plasticity called heavy and learning
 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.540
plasticity called heavy and learning
after Donald Hebb who said that learning

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550
after Donald Hebb who said that learning

involves the arrival of a weak synaptic

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330
involves the arrival of a weak synaptic
 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.599
involves the arrival of a weak synaptic
input at a time when a strong synaptic

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609
input at a time when a strong synaptic
 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.120
input at a time when a strong synaptic
input is activating the same cell so in

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130
input is activating the same cell so in
 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.010
input is activating the same cell so in
our case the weak synaptic input is the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020
our case the weak synaptic input is the
 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.860
our case the weak synaptic input is the
tone and the strong synaptic input is

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870
tone and the strong synaptic input is
 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.600
tone and the strong synaptic input is
the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610
the
 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.670
the
depolarization of the cells this

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680
depolarization of the cells this
 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.980
depolarization of the cells this
depolarization obviously substitutes for

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990
depolarization obviously substitutes for
 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.719
depolarization obviously substitutes for
the electric shock that we would

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729
the electric shock that we would
 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.550
the electric shock that we would
normally give in a conditioning

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560
normally give in a conditioning
 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.830

most important things in neuroscience

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210
most important things in neuroscience
 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.689
