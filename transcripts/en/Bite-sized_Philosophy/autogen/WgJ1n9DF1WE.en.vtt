malevolence and that's I think that's
 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.610
malevolence and that's I think that's
technically correct because one of the

and that does Nietzsche said if you look

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
and that does Nietzsche said if you look

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020
having the abyss gaze back into you
right the idea is that if you look at

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
right the idea is that if you look at
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.760
right the idea is that if you look at
something monstrous you have a tendency

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
something monstrous you have a tendency
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.920
something monstrous you have a tendency
to turn into a monster and people are

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
to turn into a monster and people are
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.080
to turn into a monster and people are
often very afraid of looking at

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
often very afraid of looking at
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.789
often very afraid of looking at
monstrous things exactly for that reason

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
monstrous things exactly for that reason
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.889
monstrous things exactly for that reason
and then the question is well should you

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
and then the question is well should you
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.630
and then the question is well should you
turn into a monster and the answer to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
turn into a monster and the answer to
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.420
turn into a monster and the answer to
that is yes you should but you should do

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
that is yes you should but you should do
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.270
that is yes you should but you should do
it voluntarily and not accidentally and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
it voluntarily and not accidentally and
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.580
it voluntarily and not accidentally and
you should do it with the good in mind

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
you should do it with the good in mind
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859
you should do it with the good in mind
rather than falling prey to it by

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
rather than falling prey to it by
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.569
rather than falling prey to it by
possession essentially because that's

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
possession essentially because that's
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.580
possession essentially because that's
the alternative how does it possess you

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
the alternative how does it possess you
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.540
the alternative how does it possess you
that's easy

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
that's easy
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.940
that's easy
you're suffering makes you better you're

you're suffering makes you better you're
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.949
you're suffering makes you better you're
better this makes you resentful you

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959
better this makes you resentful you

it fantasizing in your basement about
 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.770
it fantasizing in your basement about
shooting up the local high school and

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780
shooting up the local high school and
 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.059
shooting up the local high school and
then killing yourself right because

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069
then killing yourself right because
 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.800
then killing yourself right because
that's sort of the ultimate end of that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810
that's sort of the ultimate end of that
 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.990

intrinsic evil and I'm exactly the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110
intrinsic evil and I'm exactly the
 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.020
intrinsic evil and I'm exactly the
person to do it and I'll cap it off with

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
person to do it and I'll cap it off with
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.120
person to do it and I'll cap it off with
an indication of my own lack of worth

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
an indication of my own lack of worth
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.640
an indication of my own lack of worth
just to hammer the point home right and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
just to hammer the point home right and
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.949
just to hammer the point home right and
if I can garner a little post post

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959
if I can garner a little post post
