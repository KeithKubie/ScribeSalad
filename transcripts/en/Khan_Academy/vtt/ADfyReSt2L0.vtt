00:00:00.722 --> 00:00:01.696
- [Voiceover] Alright, grammarians.

00:00:01.696 --> 00:00:03.309
So we know that there's one way

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:06.105
to use this thing we
call reflexive pronouns

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.877
and that's to say you're
doing something to yourself,

00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:09.814
as in the sentence

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:14.294
I made myself breakfast.

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:19.242
Right, I'm making myself breakfast.

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:21.174
Or in the sentence

00:00:21.174 --> 00:00:26.074
Ronaldo cut himself shaving.

00:00:31.034 --> 00:00:35.294
Sorry about the capital S
there, that is a mistake.

00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:40.280
So Ronaldo and himself and I and myself.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.270
We use, these are called
reflexive pronouns

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.467
and we use them when the subject

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:48.999
and the object of a sentence
is the same thing, right,

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:52.443
but there's another way to
use these reflexive pronouns

00:00:52.443 --> 00:00:55.227
and it's called emphatic usage.

00:00:55.227 --> 00:00:58.654
So I want you to imagine
me storming off in a huff

00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:01.210
or getting really excited
as I say the following:

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.524
Well, if you won't help
me, I'll do it myself!

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:13.936
Or, he's lying, I heard it myself.

00:01:18.176 --> 00:01:23.176
Or, the princess herself is
running the charity marathon.

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:32.697
And what this is is what we
call emphatic or intensive

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:37.055
because we use it to intensify a statement

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.456
or to grant it emphasis, right?

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:41.245
This is how it works.

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:42.494
So instead of just saying...

00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:45.713
and the difference, the key
difference, between reflexive

00:01:45.713 --> 00:01:49.322
and intensive or emphatic
usage of this kind of pronoun

00:01:49.322 --> 00:01:53.546
is you could take these
right out of a sentence

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:54.777
and it would still make sense.

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:59.618
I'll do it, I heard it, the
princess will run the marathon.

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:02.890
Right, we're using them as intensifiers

00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:05.661
which really means

00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:07.744
they can come right out.

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:10.084
They're not essential to the
understanding of the sentence,

00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:13.698
you're just using these words

00:02:13.698 --> 00:02:16.712
in order to hammer home a point.

00:02:16.712 --> 00:02:19.158
You know, if someone
else isn't helping you

00:02:19.158 --> 00:02:21.097
you say I'll do it, but you wanna really

00:02:21.097 --> 00:02:22.197
hammer home the fact

00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:23.993
that you're going to be
doing it alone so you say

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:27.236
I'll do it myself.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.822
And if you wanna emphasize
that you were there

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:32.357
and you heard something
happen you would say

00:02:32.357 --> 00:02:35.296
I heard it myself.

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:37.318
And if it's really crazy that

00:02:37.318 --> 00:02:40.806
the princess is running this
marathon then you would say

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:45.806
whoa, the princess herself
will be there, and that's nuts.

00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:49.386
And that's the intensive
or emphatic pronoun.

00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:51.578
That's how you use it.

00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:53.150
You can learn anything.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.104
David out.
