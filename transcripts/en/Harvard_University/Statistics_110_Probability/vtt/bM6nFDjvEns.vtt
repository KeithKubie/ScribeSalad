00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
So next thing we need is
the exponential distribution.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.097
We've been talking about
continuous distributions.

00:00:10.097 --> 00:00:11.958
We talked about the uniform and
the normal.

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.209
So we have two famous
continuous distributions.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.546
We've already done all the discrete
distributions we need for

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:19.390
the entire semester.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.083
But we only have two
continuous distributions, so

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:25.098
we kinda have to catch up on
the continuous stuff, okay?

00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:29.980
So the next most important one is
called the exponential distribution.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.605
And that's one of the biggest topics for
the next homework, and

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:35.045
it's one of the most important
distributions in general.

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:42.286
Now we've already seen the exponential
distribution, A couple of times, it's

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:48.020
just like as part on the previous homework
with waiting for the book to be released.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.743
And I used it to illustrate
Universality of the Uniform, but

00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:54.304
we haven't formally introduced it yet.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:59.267
So this will be our formal introduction
of exponential distribution.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:03.048
So Stat110,
this the exponential distribution,

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:06.427
exponential distribution this is Stat110.

00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:11.732
Now you're friends with the exponential
distribution, it has one parameter

00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:16.646
lambda usually called lambda, but
you could call it whatever you want.

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:21.843
That's the traditional and
I'm gonna call this a rate parameter.

00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:27.000
Because you don't have to call it lambda,
it's just lambda's the usual terminology.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.848
I'm gonna call it a rate parameter,
because intuitively we can

00:01:31.848 --> 00:01:36.719
think of it as the rate at which
some type of event occurs, okay?

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.730
So let's just write down the PDF and
the CDF and so on.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.820
And then we can start to see why
is this important compared with of

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.930
course there's infinitely many PDFs,
so we could write down.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.798
But what special about this one?

00:01:52.798 --> 00:02:00.759
Okay, so we say X is exponential lambda,
That's our notation.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.231
And it has a PDF, that's given

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:10.651
by lambda e-lambda x for

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:15.924
x positive and 0 otherwise.

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:18.753
So it's always positive, so

00:02:18.753 --> 00:02:24.307
continuous positive random variable,
that's the PDF.

00:02:24.307 --> 00:02:27.554
You can see why it's called
the exponential distribution,

00:02:27.554 --> 00:02:31.753
cuz there's an exponential function
with a couple constants stuck in there,

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:32.911
exponential decay.

00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:38.120
This is a valid PDF,
because if we integrate lambda

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.673
e-lambda xdx from 0 to infinity
that's a very easy integral.

00:02:44.673 --> 00:02:49.830
And I get one just integrating
exponential, so that means it's valid.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.394
Okay, let's get the CDF and then let's
figure out the mean and the variants,

00:02:53.394 --> 00:02:54.204
stuff like that.

00:02:54.204 --> 00:03:00.152
Then we can talk more about what are the
special properties of this distribution.

00:03:00.152 --> 00:03:03.651
So let's get the CDF,
since we have the PDF,

00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:07.268
it's easy to get the CDF
just by integrating.

00:03:07.268 --> 00:03:09.424
So f(x) = the integral, so

00:03:09.424 --> 00:03:14.878
I will start the integral at 0 because
this is a positive random variable.

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:19.218
0 up to x of lambda e-lambda t dt,

00:03:19.218 --> 00:03:23.875
again that's a very easy integral.

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:28.973
And I will just get 1-e-lambda x,

00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:32.105
for x greater than 0.

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:36.408
It's easy to check that this is correct,
cuz if you take the derivative of this,

00:03:36.408 --> 00:03:38.324
lambda comes down and you get this.

00:03:38.324 --> 00:03:40.709
And also notice that this is a CDF,

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.240
because just check that this is
an increasing function, right?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.281
And as you let x go to infinity,
then this part's gone and goes to 1.

00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:53.344
If you let x go to, but
you can't let x go to minus infinity, but

00:03:53.344 --> 00:03:57.279
if you let x go to 0, then you get 0 and
then it just stays 0.

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.889
If you go that way, right?

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.000
And approaches 1, if you go that way.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.850
Okay, so that's a valid CDF,
it's continuous as well.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.361
Okay, well that's easy enough,
let's get the mean and the variance.

00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:14.563
Actually an easier way to get the mean,

00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:17.649
of course we can just write
down the integral and do it.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:21.880
But before we do that it's
useful to try to standardize it.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.178
So remember what the normal, we can
reduce any normal to a standard normal.

00:04:27.178 --> 00:04:31.510
In this case, the normal has two
parameters, mu and sigma squared.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.114
Here, there's only one parameter,
lambda, okay?

00:04:34.114 --> 00:04:39.168
And we're gonna show right
now that if we let Y =,

00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:51.459
Lambda times X, Then we're gonna
show that Y is exponential of 1.

00:04:54.031 --> 00:04:58.403
So that's kind of analagous to
standardization of the standard normal.

00:04:58.403 --> 00:05:02.297
And that we're multiplying,
I mean it's not exactly the same cuz for

00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:05.950
the normal we subtracted
the mean by a standard deviation.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.081
Here, we're just saying multiply by
something to make it exponential of 1.

00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:13.840
Because if I can get exponential of 1,
it's gonna be a lot easier, right?

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.635
Then if the lambda's are not there,
so how do we do that?

00:05:20.227 --> 00:05:20.812
So since,

00:05:20.812 --> 00:05:24.615
let's just do a quick calculation
to show that that's true, okay?

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:27.250
Cuz once we have this relationship,
than a lot of the times we can just work

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.550
with exponential of 1, and
then stick in the lambda when we need it.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.537
So let's just compute the CDF of Y.

00:05:35.537 --> 00:05:39.480
Y less than or equal to little y, right?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.136
It's just this is an very easy
calculation if you understand CDFs,

00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:46.432
that the CDF of Y, a Y is lambda X.

00:05:46.432 --> 00:05:49.953
So that's X less than or
equal to Y over lambda.

00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:54.810
But that's just the same as the CDF
of X evaluated at Y over lambda.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.585
So if we take the CDF and
plug in Y over lambda,

00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:04.003
then we just get 1-e-lambda, right?

00:06:04.003 --> 00:06:05.701
X, that's Y there.

00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:10.936
That's the CDF of an exponential of 1,
right?

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:15.246
I just plugged in Y over lambda here,
and lambdas cancel, okay?

00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:21.040
So it's just that one short equation
proves that his statement is true.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.153
Okay, so let's first concentrate on
the case where it has parameters 1.

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:31.830
And find the mean and variance, and
then we can get the general case, okay?

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.497
So let's do that case now, so
we're letting Y be exponential of 1,

00:06:44.581 --> 00:06:48.541
And we wanna find the mean and

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:54.735
variance, Okay?

00:06:54.735 --> 00:06:56.786
So let's get the mean first.

00:06:56.786 --> 00:07:02.477
Just by definition, Expect the value Y,

00:07:02.477 --> 00:07:09.829
so it's just the integral of Y
times the PDFF e-y dy, right?

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:14.048
Okay, now this is a very
standard integration by parts.

00:07:14.048 --> 00:07:17.551
This is the kind of interval you'd
see in AP calculus when you're

00:07:17.551 --> 00:07:19.787
learning integration by parts, right?

00:07:19.787 --> 00:07:27.390
So all we have to do is let u = y and
let dv = this part.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.513
Remember your integration by parts,
uv minus the integral vdu, so that's u.

00:07:32.513 --> 00:07:38.225
du = dy and
v = just integrate this thing, right?

00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:39.612
So -e-y, okay?

00:07:39.612 --> 00:07:44.496
So now I'm just gonna do
a uv- integral of vdu.

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:52.910
So it's -y e-y evaluated from 0
ero to infinity minus a negative.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.987
So it's gonna be plus
the integral of e-y dy.

00:07:56.987 --> 00:08:03.091
So now we've made it
into an easy integral.

00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:09.320
This first part is 0, because if
we plug in y = 0, we just get 0.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.011
If we let y go to infinity, y is going
to infinity, but e-y is going to 0,

00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:18.135
exponentially fast, and
this part's only growing linearly.

00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:20.056
So the exponential part's dominant.

00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:23.774
So this part is just 0, and this part,

00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:28.500
it's just 1, cuz that's an easy integral.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.811
Or an even cuter way to do it is to say,
we're integrating the exponential 1 PDF it

00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:35.446
has to be 1,
otherwise that wasn't a valid PDF.

00:08:35.446 --> 00:08:39.452
So in this course, there are actually
a lot of integrals, we can do not using

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:43.720
calculus directly, but by recognizing
that's a PDF or that kind of thing.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.969
Of course that's an easy integral anyway.

00:08:45.969 --> 00:08:47.718
Okay, therefore the mean is 1.

00:08:47.718 --> 00:08:53.467
Now for the variance,

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:04.222
For the variance,
we can just do E of y squared -e of

00:09:04.222 --> 00:09:07.486
y squared the other way as usual.

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:16.314
So here is the LOTUS,
E of y squared while by LOTUS,

00:09:16.314 --> 00:09:21.011
it's immediate of that
integral of y squared e to

00:09:21.011 --> 00:09:26.186
the -y dy- this thing we
just computed as 1, okay?

00:09:26.186 --> 00:09:30.709
Now this integer, well then we have
to use integration by parts again.

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:34.612
And I'm not gonna write out
the integration by parts again,

00:09:34.612 --> 00:09:38.911
probably because we're gonna learn
better ways to do this later.

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:43.016
Or we're gonna actually avoid doing this,
and get them movements a different way.

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:45.989
So this is called the second moment by the
way, E of Y is called the first movement,

00:09:45.989 --> 00:09:47.339
that is called the second movement.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.271
Okay, but

00:09:49.271 --> 00:09:55.079
this is an easy integration by parts
in the sense that if let u = y squared.

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:57.787
Basically it's gonna reduce reduce
it back down in to an integral

00:09:57.787 --> 00:09:59.077
that looks like this, right?

00:09:59.077 --> 00:10:01.079
It's gonna lower the power from 2 to 1, so

00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:04.540
this is like when you're doing
integration by parts twice.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.735
You don't actually have to do it twice,
cuz you do it once and

00:10:06.735 --> 00:10:08.210
then you reduce it to the one we just did.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.002
So you're actually doing
integration by parts once.

00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:16.250
And wwe do that we also get 1 and
that's pretty easy to remember, okay?

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.140
So now coming back to
this general exponential,

00:10:22.731 --> 00:10:28.659
So just continuing the notation here,
y = lambda X,

00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:33.550
so x = y over lambda and
that's gonna have,

00:10:38.831 --> 00:10:40.752
The mean,
just take expected value of this.

00:10:40.752 --> 00:10:43.214
Lambda is a constant that comes out.

00:10:43.214 --> 00:10:47.599
So it has mean 1 over lambda,
and it has variance.

00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:52.520
Well for the variance,
take the variance of this.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.460
Remember the variance
constant comes out squared.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.394
So it's 1 over lambda squared times the
variance of y, but the variance of y is 1.

00:10:59.394 --> 00:11:00.826
So the variance is 1 over lambda squared.

00:11:03.138 --> 00:11:05.670
Okay, so now we know the mean and
the variance.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:11.278
We do not yet know why
the exponential is important, okay?

00:11:11.278 --> 00:11:14.330
And there's different
reasons why it's important.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.590
But what I consider the most important
reason is what's called the memory

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.260
list property.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.574
And you've already seen the memory
list property in the discrete case,

00:11:22.574 --> 00:11:24.708
if you did that practice
mid-term question.

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:28.078
But we haven't talked about
it in the continuous case.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:40.400
So memoryless property, So
exponential distribution is memoryless.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.361
I have to tell you what that means,
and then check that is true, okay?

00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:49.983
So memoryless property means that,

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:58.241
See if we can remember that
midterm practice problem.

00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:03.108
What is said something about
memorylessness, it said no matter how long

00:12:03.108 --> 00:12:08.080
you've waited then it's like you're
starting over from fresh, okay?

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.378
I think that's what it said, right?

00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:12.404
So it says that if you have
a random variable that,

00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:16.886
intuitively it's a random variable
that we interpret as a waiting time.

00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:19.410
So you're waiting for
something to happen, right?

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.570
No, just have a concrete example in mind.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:28.084
Suppose you're just waiting for
a phone call, right?

00:12:28.084 --> 00:12:31.410
So now is time zero, okay?

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.819
And you're waiting to get a call, okay?

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:36.880
Which could come at any time
in continuous time, right?

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.084
The geometric is discrete like flipping
coins waiting for success, right?

00:12:41.084 --> 00:12:42.334
Bernoulli trials wait for

00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:45.127
success in discrete times cuz
they have discrete trials.

00:12:45.127 --> 00:12:48.594
This is in continuous time,
you're waiting for the phone call.

00:12:48.594 --> 00:12:53.483
And suppose that this waiting
time has the property that no

00:12:53.483 --> 00:12:58.286
matter how long you waited,
just like that time is gone.

00:12:58.286 --> 00:13:02.968
It's not giving you progress
towards getting your phone call.

00:13:02.968 --> 00:13:05.910
It's like starting from fresh every time,
okay?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.136
That's what the memoryless property means.

00:13:08.136 --> 00:13:14.494
So as an equation, what it says is
the probability that X is greater than or

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:19.225
equal to s + t given that X is
greater than or equal to s.

00:13:19.225 --> 00:13:24.820
Imagine that s is measured in minutes or
whatever unit you want.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.130
This says you've already
waited at least s minutes.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.540
You've already waited s minutes, and
you haven't gotten your phone call.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.455
So you know X is greater than or
equal to s, okay?

00:13:35.455 --> 00:13:39.821
And then what's the probability you would
have to wait at least an additional t

00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:40.424
minutes?

00:13:40.424 --> 00:13:44.803
Is just the same as the probability
X is greater than or equal to t.

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:49.037
Because you've started over with the fresh
exponential distribution with the same

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.240
parameter.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.827
That's the definition of the memoryless
property, but I hope that this equation

00:13:54.827 --> 00:13:59.229
kind of intuitively make sense to capture
that intuition of memorylessness.

00:13:59.229 --> 00:13:59.798
Okay, so

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:04.716
now let's prove that in fact that this
equation is satisfied by the exponential.

00:14:04.716 --> 00:14:09.720
So for the exponential lambda,
this is the general definition.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.891
But now we're assuming X
is exponential lambda and

00:14:12.891 --> 00:14:15.333
let's check that the equation holds.

00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:19.816
So let's find the probability
that X is greater than or

00:14:19.816 --> 00:14:22.946
equal to s, that's 1 minus the CDF.

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:26.788
We don't have to worry about whether
it's strict inequality here,

00:14:26.788 --> 00:14:29.115
cuz it's a continuous random variable.

00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:33.368
So this is just 1 minus the CDF,
and this is the one,

00:14:33.368 --> 00:14:37.345
this is called the survival
survival function.

00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:40.720
Because what'ss the probability that,
if you think of X rather than

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.636
thinking of a waiting time thinking of it
as like how long someone is gonna live?

00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:49.538
And then that's the probability that they
will live more than at least s seconds, so

00:14:49.538 --> 00:14:51.138
that's a survival thing.

00:14:51.138 --> 00:14:55.955
So this is actually extremely important
in what's called survival analysis in bio

00:14:55.955 --> 00:14:58.377
statistics, as well as in engineering.

00:14:58.377 --> 00:15:02.518
You wanna figure out how long is a certain
piece of electronic's gonna last,

00:15:02.518 --> 00:15:06.750
things like that, then you need
to look at survival functions.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.633
Well anyway that's just 1-CDF,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.118
But the CDF was 1-e-lambda x, so

00:15:19.118 --> 00:15:22.832
that's just e-lambda s.

00:15:22.832 --> 00:15:25.743
So it's a very easy
looking survival function.

00:15:25.743 --> 00:15:30.013
So now the probability
that X is greater than or

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:35.276
equal to s + t, given that X
is greater than or equal to s.

00:15:35.276 --> 00:15:38.676
Let's just use the definition
of conditional probability.

00:15:38.676 --> 00:15:43.939
So this is the probability that X
is greater than or equal to s + t.

00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:45.849
And X is greater than or

00:15:45.849 --> 00:15:51.794
equal s divided by the probability
that X is greater than or equal to s.

00:15:51.794 --> 00:15:55.024
Just definition of
conditional probability, but

00:15:55.024 --> 00:15:58.450
notice that the numerator
is slightly redundant.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:02.113
Cuz if we say it's greater than or
equal to s + t, I'm assuming s and

00:16:02.113 --> 00:16:03.931
t are non negative real numbers.

00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:07.800
But if it's at least s + t,
obviously, it's at least s.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.653
So this part is redundant,
so in other words,

00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:15.716
it's just a ratio of the survival function
here over the survival function here.

00:16:15.716 --> 00:16:19.500
And this is true for
all s greater than or equal to 0.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:26.182
So that's just e-lambda s
+ t divided by e-lambda s.

00:16:26.182 --> 00:16:29.423
And that just simplifies to e-lambda t,

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:34.877
which is the probability that X
is greater than or equal to t.

00:16:34.877 --> 00:16:36.805
So that shows that its memoryless.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.604
Now you might imagine that there
is millions of other memoryless

00:16:41.604 --> 00:16:42.517
distributions.

00:16:42.517 --> 00:16:46.020
But it turns out that
the exponential is the only one.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.238
This completely characterize is it?

00:16:48.238 --> 00:16:51.094
And just one more quick,
we'll prove that next time.

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:54.649
But one more quick restatement
of the memoryless or

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:57.383
consequence of memoryless property.

00:16:57.383 --> 00:17:02.050
Here's a core area of this memoryless
property that's often useful.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.900
Again, we're letting X be exponential
lambda, and suppose we wanted to

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.330
know the expected value of X given
that X is greater than some number a.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.980
This is our first time actually using
this notation, conditional expectation.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.140
But you should already know
what this means, right?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.530
Because this just says
take the expectation, but

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.180
instead of using probability,
use conditional probability.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.440
So it's defined in the same way
except use conditional probability,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.150
that gives us conditional expectation.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.831
So intuitively is just like given
the information that you've waited at

00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:35.989
least a minutes.

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:38.840
What's the expected value of
X given that information?

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.633
Well, we could think of
that as a + E (x- a,

00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:47.308
just linearity, pull out an a).

00:17:47.308 --> 00:17:51.908
The cool thing about the memoryless
property is, given that X is greater than

00:17:51.908 --> 00:17:55.677
a, this thing X-a just becomes
a fresh exponential, right?

00:17:55.677 --> 00:17:59.954
Because this is the additional
waiting time, that you waited a,

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.536
but it's started over again, right?

00:18:02.536 --> 00:18:08.770
So it's immediate that this is just a + 1
over lambda by the memoryless property.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.245
Otherwise, you have to do some calculus,
do integration and stuff.

00:18:11.245 --> 00:18:14.851
But we can avoid that just by
understanding, in this case and

00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:18.750
in some other interesting problems
just by using this property.
