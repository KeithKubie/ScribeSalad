00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.950
My wife and I have recently
purchased an assortment pack

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.870
of soap, and we both want
to experience all 3 bars.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.960
And we are not willing to
share soap with each other.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.760
So we have a little
bit of a conundrum.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.090
How do we share
these 3 bars of soap

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.810
so that we each get to
experience all of the smells?

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.650
So this might be
a nice rose smell.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.932
This might be some
type of ivory smell.

00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:24.890
I don't even know if
that's a legitimate smell.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.473
This might be some
type of sandalwood,

00:00:26.473 --> 00:00:28.160
which is always very nice.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.730
And my wife has an idea.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.460
She says, look I'm going
to take these 3 bars,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.100
so we're starting
with 3 bars of soap.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.692
And I'm going to divide
it into 2 equal groups.

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:40.400
And I said, how are
you going to do that?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.316
And she says, well, I'm
just going to take out

00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:44.299
some type of carving
saw or carving knife,

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:45.840
or who knows what
it is, and I'm just

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.330
going to cut it right down the
middle, so right down this.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.800
This is my wife cutting the soap
right over here with her saw.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.720
So she's cutting the
soap right over here.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.650
So she has divided the
soap into 2 equal groups.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.850
So she's taken 3 bars, and she's
divided into 2 equal groups.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.160
So the interesting question
here is, how many bars of soap

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.800
do we each have now?

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.634
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:14.050
and think about
that for a second.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.110
How many bars of soap
do we each have now?

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.760
Well, let's just
visualize my share.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.540
Let's say I take this
bottom half right over here.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.910
So this is Sal's
share of the soap.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.430
Let me write this out.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.410
So this is Sal's share.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.290
My wife took this top half.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.470
Well, what do I have?

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.730
Well, I have 1/2, I have another
1/2, and I have another 1/2

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.780
of a bar.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.770
So I have 3/2 bars of soap.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.540
Or you could say that I have
3 times 1/2 bars of soap.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.790
Notice, something very
interesting happened here.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.699
3 divided by 2 is
equal to 3 times 1/2.

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:01.490
And we could make it
even more interesting,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.810
because we know 2 is the
exact same thing as 2/1.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.850
So 3 divided by 2/1 is
equal to 3 times 1/2.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.520
Notice we went from a
division to a multiplication,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.790
and we took the reciprocal.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.040
And that makes complete sense.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.390
We have 3/2 bars now.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.600
But what's 3 times 1/2?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.175
Well, 3 times 1/2
is equal to 3/2.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.830
So just doing this little
simple, smelly soap example,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.770
we've got a very
interesting result.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.300
3 divided by 2 is the
same thing as 3 times 1/2,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.245
which is the same thing as 3/2.
