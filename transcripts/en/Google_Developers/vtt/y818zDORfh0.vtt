00:00:00.227 --> 00:00:01.560
- Welcome to the developer show.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.440
My name is Filip Hiracek,
and I'm here with Tim Sneath.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi, Tim.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Hi, Filip.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.272
- So, who are you?

00:00:08.272 --> 00:00:09.730
And what are you
doing in the team?

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.390
- I'm Tim Sneath, and
I'm the group product

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.010
manager for Flutter and
for Dart here at Google.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.300
- Tim, you joined the
team quite recently.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.160
What are your first
impressions of Flutter?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.810
- Yeah, so I joined the team
about, what, nine weeks ago

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.680
now.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.960
I came from Microsoft,
where I'd been there

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.390
for 17 years,
something like that,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.360
and I came to Google because I
was really inspired by Flutter.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.910
It's just such a
beautiful platform.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.230
It feels productive.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.340
It's efficient.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.620
It's a great way to build
mobile applications,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.605
whether you're targeting
iOS or Android.

00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:50.790
- I also know you recently
spent some time with "Hamilton"

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.510
in New York.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.290
What can you tell us about that?

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.480
- Yeah, yeah.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.210
So not Hamilton himself, right?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.270
Obviously he's long dead.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.416
But we went to New York to
film a case study video of one

00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:05.790
of the first applications
that's been built with Flutter,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.916
and that is the "Hamilton"
musical official app.

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:10.290
And they wanted
to build this app

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.460
to be able to connect more
closely with their fans,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.950
and so they were looking
around for a platform,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.690
a framework they
could move quickly,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.060
they could iterate fast, and
they could chip something

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.150
simultaneously both for
iOS and for Android,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.897
and they picked Flutter.

00:01:25.897 --> 00:01:28.230
They had a really good time
and they talked a little bit

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.780
about it in this video, and
some of their experiences

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.080
using Flutter, and they
are fully converted

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.830
to Flutter as a technology now.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.790
- So Tim, what are you excited
about for Flutter in 2018?

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.120
- Yeah, so we really think
this is the year of Flutter.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.980
We hope it's the
year of Flutter.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.775
It's the year
where a lot of work

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.450
the the team has been working
on for several years now

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.070
comes to fruition.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.020
We're at the point
now where Flutter

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.896
is about to go into
beta, and this year we're

00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:00.020
going to continue to build
on the foundations we've

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.290
laid with Flutter.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.220
We're going to add things
like ads and map views

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.279
and inline video.

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:08.820
We want to just
continue to build out

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.840
the richness of the experience.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.470
We've also announced
it's Dart conf this week,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.640
Dart 2, which is a reboot
of the language for client

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.650
development, and we're starting
to turn that on within Flutter

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.560
as well, so that's going to
be another thing you're going

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.560
to see over the next
couple of months in the run

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.600
up to Google I/O, which is of
course the next big developer

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.230
conference.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.920
- Thank you, Tim, and
thank you audience.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.930
This has been the developer
show from Dart conf in L.A.
