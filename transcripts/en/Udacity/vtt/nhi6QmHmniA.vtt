00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.051
So, we know we can use the Pythagorean theorem for any right triangle. Any

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:08.205
triangle that has a 90 degree angle, we can square the legs and then add them

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:13.670
together to find the square of the hypotenuse. So, let's use the Pythagorean

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.356
theorem to problem solve. What do you think would be the link of this

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:20.420
hypotenuse? Write your answer here.
