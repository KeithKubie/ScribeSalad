Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.070
We are back with Phil Torres, entomologist, and about two years ago I created a

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.130
video about butterflies that I thought were eating a fish.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.160
They appear to have taken down their prey.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.200
Well that's not what was happening at all, was it.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.220
(Phil) No.
(Destin) What are they doing?
- It's called puddling. Basically they're drinking

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.230
the minerals in the sand to get salt.
- Alright so here's the deal. This is

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.260
the Tambopata River, which feeds into the Amazon River. It's a little bit different

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.310
than Alabama but right over there, if you look really really close you can

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.340
see there are some yellow butterflies. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.380
high speed camera, see if we can sneak up on em, and get high speed of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.410
all those butterflies puddling. See what it looks like.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.460
OK it's gonna take me a second to get over there, so let's talk.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.470
When you come up on a big group of butterflies like this they're almost all male.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.500
This is why. When I fertilize my wife, I provide her selflessly with

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.540
some liquid that has little swimmy things in it and my genetic code.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.590
But male butterflies are much more heavily invested than this. They create what's called a

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.630
spermataphore. Now that's basically just a structure that has all their

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.680
swimmy things in it but it also has nutrients that they've collected and saved for her.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.720
Like sodium and things like that. You see when a female lays eggs on a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.760
leaf, it requires a lot of sodium. And so he's helping out with the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.800
resource budget by giving her the spermataphore that she can draw from with her body.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.840
It's pretty cool. So when I go over here and we kick up all these butterflies

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.870
I just almost hear a bunch of little angry voices saying "Hey!"

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.940
"Can't you see we're trying to gather nutrients for our spermataphores here?"

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.970
Anyway, I'm almost there. Let's check it out in high speed.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.980
- Oop. I'm falling. Alright my leg's in a hole

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.020
I'm not really gonna be able to move here. You want to walk up on them from that side and scare them a little bit?

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.060
- You got it.
- 3..2..1..Go.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.090
- Awesome!
- Nice.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.130

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:29.230
   

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.260
Alright that's it. If you want to see the entire video

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.280
with the time code so you can figure out how many butterflies are flying at what time, I'll leave a link right

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.320
here. So go click on that and you can go look at that video. Otherwise, that's it.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.340
You know what it is right?
(Wife) Salt water.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.370
- Do you know how much work it was to make this for you?!

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.400
[laughs]
You don't want to play

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.410
along do you.
- No.
