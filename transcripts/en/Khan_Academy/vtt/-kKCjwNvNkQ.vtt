00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.028
World War II was the largest conflict
in all of human history.

00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:06.919
The largest and bloodiest conflict

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.285
And so you can imagine it is quite complex

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:15.659
My goal in this video is to start giving
us a survey, an overview of the war.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.103
And I won't even be able to cover it all in this video.

00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:21.243
It is really just a think about how did things get started.

00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:23.186
Or what happened in the lead up?

00:00:23.207 --> 00:00:27.667
And to start I am actually going to focus
on Asia and the Pacific.

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:33.468
Which probably doesn't get enough attention
when we look at it from a western point of view

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:36.088
But if we go back even to the early 1900s.

00:00:36.088 --> 00:00:39.033
Japan is becoming more and more militaristic.

00:00:39.068 --> 00:00:40.588
More and more nationalistic.

00:00:40.703 --> 00:00:43.417
In the early 1900s it had already occupied...

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:47.927
It had already occupied Korea as of 1910.

00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:51.167
and in 1931 it invades Manchuria.

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.457
It invades Manchuria.

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:58.857
So this right over here, this is in 1931.

00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:03.801
And it installs a puppet state,
the puppet state of Manchukuo.

00:01:03.848 --> 00:01:06.359
And when we call something a puppet state,

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:07.860
it means that there is a government there.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.437
And they kind of pretend to be in charge.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:15.257
But they're really controlled like
a puppet by someone else.

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:18.548
And in this case it is the Empire of Japan.

00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:22.644
And we do remember what is happening in China in the 1930s.

00:01:22.644 --> 00:01:25.634
China is embroiled in a civil war.

00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:30.194
So there is a civil war going on in China.

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:32.922
And that civil war is between

00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:37.242
the Nationalists, the Kuomintang
and the Communists

00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:41.198
versus the Communists

00:01:41.198 --> 00:01:43.879
The Communists led by Mao Zedong.

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:47.401
The Kuomintang led by general Chiang Kai-shek.

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:49.361
And so they're in the midst of the civil war.

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:52.958
So you can imagine Imperial Japan
is taking advantage of this

00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:57.313
to take more and more control 
over parts of China

00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:59.903
And that continues through the 30s

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:02.026
until we get to 1937.

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:06.146
And in 1937 the Japanese use some pretext

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:09.194
with, you know, kind of a false flag, kind of...

00:02:09.194 --> 00:02:11.814
well, I won't go into the depths of what started it

00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:14.376
kind of this Marco-Polo Bridge Incident

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:16.386
But it uses that as justifications

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.978
to kind of have an all-out war with China

00:02:19.978 --> 00:02:25.690
so 1937...you have all-out war

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.309
and this is often referred to as 
the Second Sino-Japanese War

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:34.900
...Sino-Japanese War

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.070
Many historians actually would even consider 
this the beginning of World War II.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.549
While, some of them say, ok this is the beginning of the Asian Theater of World War II

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.398
of the all-out war between Japan and China,

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:49.939
but it isn't until Germany invades Poland 
in 1939 that you truly have

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.379
the formal beginning, so to speak,
of World War II.

00:02:53.387 --> 00:02:56.504
Regardless of whether you consider this
the formal beginning or not,

00:02:56.504 --> 00:02:58.941
the Second Sino-Japanese War,
and it's called the second because

00:02:58.941 --> 00:03:01.522
there was another Sino-Japanese War
in the late 1800s

00:03:01.522 --> 00:03:03.968
that was called
the First Sino-Japanese War,

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:08.790
this is incredibly, incredibly brutal
and incredibly bloody

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.996
a lot of civilians affected

00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:14.562
we could do a whole series of videos
just on that

00:03:14.562 --> 00:03:16.491
But at this point it does become all-out war

00:03:16.491 --> 00:03:19.941
and this causes the civil war 
to take a back seat

00:03:19.941 --> 00:03:24.617
to fighting off the aggressor 
of Japan in 1937.

00:03:24.617 --> 00:03:29.519
So that lays a foundation for what's happening 
in The Pacific, in the run-up to World War II.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.502
And now let's also remind ourselves 
what's happening...

00:03:32.502 --> 00:03:34.353
what's happening in Europe.

00:03:34.353 --> 00:03:37.276
As we go through the 1930s

00:03:37.276 --> 00:03:40.816
Hitler's Germany, the Nazi Party,
is getting more and more militaristic.

00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:43.285
So this is Nazi Germany...

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.080
Nazi Germany right over here.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.641
They're allied with Benito Mussolini's Italy.

00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:56.935
They're both extremely nationalistic;
they both do not like the Communists, at all

00:03:56.935 --> 00:04:00.853
You might remember, that in 1938...

00:04:00.853 --> 00:04:05.927
1938, you have the Anschluss,
which I'm sure I'm mispronouncing,

00:04:05.927 --> 00:04:10.537
and you also have the takeover 
of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia.

00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:14.352
So the Anschluss was the unification with Austria

00:04:14.352 --> 00:04:18.563
and then you have the Germans taking over the of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia

00:04:18.563 --> 00:04:20.508
and this is kind of the famous,
you know,

00:04:20.508 --> 00:04:23.977
the rest of the, what will be called the Allied Powers

00:04:23.977 --> 00:04:27.221
kind of say, "Okay, yeah, okay maybe Hitler's 
just going to just do that...

00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:29.119
well we don't want to start another war.

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:31.914
We still all remember World War I; it was really horrible.

00:04:31.914 --> 00:04:37.282
And so they kind of appease Hitler
and he's able to, kind of, satisfy his aggression.

00:04:37.282 --> 00:04:43.472
so in 1938 you have Austria,
Austria and the Sudetenland

00:04:43.472 --> 00:04:47.052
...and the Sudetenland...

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:50.241
are taken over, 
are taken over by Germany

00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:55.797
and then as you go into 1939,
as you go into 1939

00:04:55.797 --> 00:04:59.539
in March they're able to take over
all of Czechoslovakia

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.036
they're able to take over
all of Czechoslovakia

00:05:02.036 --> 00:05:05.459
and once again the Allies are kind of,
they're feeling very uncomfortable,

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:08.530
they kind of, have seen something like this before

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.488
they would like to push back, but they still are,

00:05:11.488 --> 00:05:15.167
kind of, are not feeling good 
about starting another World War

00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:18.347
so they're hoping that maybe Germany stops there.

00:05:18.347 --> 00:05:20.083
So let me write this down...

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:23.081
So all of Czechoslovakia...

00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:27.952
...Czechoslovakia...
is taken over by the Germans.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:32.616
This is in March of 1939.

00:05:32.616 --> 00:05:38.079
And then in August you have the Germans,
and this is really in preparation for,

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:41.284
what you could guess is about to happen,
for the all-out war that's about to happen

00:05:41.284 --> 00:05:43.865
the Germans don't want to fight 
the Soviets right out the gate,

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:49.364
as we will see, and as you might know,
they do eventually take on the Soviet Union,

00:05:49.364 --> 00:05:53.748
but in 1939 they get into a pact with 
the Soviet Union.

00:05:53.748 --> 00:05:56.387
And so this is, they sign

00:05:56.387 --> 00:06:05.631
the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:09.406
with the Soviet Union,
this is in August,

00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:11.933
which is essentially 
mutual non-aggression

00:06:11.933 --> 00:06:14.404
"Hey, you know, you do what you need to do,
we know what we need to do."

00:06:14.404 --> 00:06:17.723
and they secretly started saying
"Okay were gonna, all the countries out here,

00:06:17.723 --> 00:06:19.601
we're going to create these 
spheres of influence

00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:22.456
where Germany can take, uh,
control of part of it

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:26.392
and the Soviet Union, and Stalin is in charge 
of the Soviet Union at this point,

00:06:26.392 --> 00:06:28.409
can take over other parts of it.

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:31.324
And then that leads us to the formal start

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:34.346
where in September,
let me write this in a different color...

00:06:34.346 --> 00:06:40.436
so September of 1939,
on September 1st, Germany invades Poland

00:06:40.436 --> 00:06:44.402
Germany invades Poland on September 1st,

00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:48.973
which is generally considered 
the beginning of World War II.

00:06:48.973 --> 00:06:55.874
and then you have the Great Britain and France declares war on Germany

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:58.084
so let me write this

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:04.831
World War II... starts

00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:08.502
everyone is declaring war on each other,
Germany invades Poland,

00:07:08.502 --> 00:07:12.072
Great Britain and France 
declare war on Germany,

00:07:12.072 --> 00:07:13.363
and you have to remember at this point

00:07:13.363 --> 00:07:18.966
Stalin isn't so concerned about Hitler
he's just signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:24.138
and so in mid-September, Stalin himself invades Poland as well

00:07:24.138 --> 00:07:27.544
so they both can kind of carve out...

00:07:27.544 --> 00:07:32.743
...their spheres of influence...

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:38.383
so you can definitely sense that things are 
not looking good for the world at this point

00:07:38.383 --> 00:07:42.131
you already have Asia in the 
Second Sino-Japanese War,

00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:43.766
incredibly bloody war,

00:07:43.766 --> 00:07:45.541
and now you have kind of,

00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:48.510
a lot of very similar actors 
that you had in World War I

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.330
and then they're starting to get into 
a fairly extensive engagement.
