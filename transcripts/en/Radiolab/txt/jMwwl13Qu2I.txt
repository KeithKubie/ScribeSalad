Speaker 2:          00:25          Hey, it's Molly Webster from radio lab. Before we get into the show today, I wanted to tell you something and that's it. Radio lab has a newsletter. We do. It's awesome. You should sign up for it. You'd be the first to know about new episodes. You'd get updates on old ones and lots more to sign up. Go to radiolab.org/newsletter see ya.

Speaker 3:          00:46          This is Radiolab. I'm Jana [inaudible] and I'm Robert Krulwich and this hour we're talking about space, sending stuff into space, little messages in bottles or capsules as it were so that the extraterrestrials of the future might one day find if there are really

Speaker 2:          01:02          well, yes, yes, yes,

Speaker 3:          01:03          but surely there are, I mean someday android space capsule is bound to run into someone and they'll know about us. Wow. Um, just the second year, I know that the Anne story was beautiful and that you're in some kind of romantic haze. How did you adjust, get a little more cold-hearted here about solid facts. You might feel differently about this whole thing. What do you mean? Well, what do you think is the likelihood of Ann's message of love ever being read by an intelligent alien somewhere? See where you're going with this? What do you have to ask that question? I mean it's just a gesture. It's like a romantic phone. No, this is an attempt. I think to be fair to her had a real conversation. She wants someone to hear about this, but the chances are so remote. When you consider the vastness of space, suppose for example, you wanted to visit just a make it easy.

Speaker 3:          01:55          The very next star to us. Okay. Actually it's too lucky to meet a civilization. I think it'd be so hard to come out and flame one in the very first stop. Let's go four stars out to a called Zita to calm a B. I see you hang up. I look, I admit I looked it up. If we increase the speed of the voyager capsule and drains message from 35,000 miles an hour, that's how fast she was going, right? Yeah, that's right. Increase that speed to say a million miles an hour. How long do you think would it take for you to get to Zeta to county? 300 years. Hmm. 30,000 years.

Speaker 2:          02:31          Seriously.

Speaker 3:          02:33          Wow. This Jetta, boom. Rod is a 1200 generation trip. Do you know where the air boom rounds where 1200 generations ago where they were living in a cave, beating on a drum? That's what they were doing. So imagine a space trip in which you have to go forward. 1200 generations. That's a long trip. You're such a downer. You think that's tough. Listen to this. There's a whole nother problem we're going to have to deal with, not the of distance. In this case, there's a problem of time. We have one of those two. Every civilization has an arc. You can think of it in threes. Step one, step two

Speaker 4:          03:12          Jackson and his Chesterfield. Bam Ray body.

Speaker 5:          03:21          Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:21          What the hell is that? Well, a million years ago we were practically apes. We'd hardly begun to have conversations. Now we have technology, we have radio and TV and the universe can hear us

Speaker 6:          03:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:37          but how long will it be, do you think before either from global warming or for some kind of war? We're [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          03:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:45          the way the news has been recently days, weeks in case I'm going to guess like a hundred million years or 10 million years, but that's still a flash of time in a universe. Now suppose instead of one civilization, let's have two civilizations and other one out there. If they arrive on earth ready to talk and we're old, then there's no way to have the conversation. Or on the other hand, if they arrive on earth after

Speaker 5:          04:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          04:13          nobody to talk to, and in a 14 billion year universe with each civilization lasting, you know, only 10 million years, what are the chances of two civilizations lining up in perfect synchrony so they can have a conversation? It's almost mathematically impossible. Yeah, fine, fine. But you have to keep something in mind though. All right, well, as a rule, people who make the argument you're making right now, pessimists, as it were, as a rule, those people are usually proven wrong at say that's always how it goes in mid [inaudible]. Well, I'm in the history of human navigation. Lots of things have seemed to lonely and too far away until someone did. This is the guy who produced the voyager record. His name is Tim Ferris, I mean settling Polynesia in canoes, navigating by the stars and the currents alone hitting a tiny island after crossing hundreds or even thousands of miles of open ocean.

Speaker 3:          05:08          That's a pretty lonely, scary thing to do and yet thousands of Polynesians did it. So I don't know what our future in interstellar space flight will be, but it's, it is important to keep in mind that the record of people who said that this or that journey of exploration is impossible or ill-advised historically, those sorts of predictions have not fared very well. Yes, you just hold your horses, right. I mean, look, Tim is talking about the Pacific Ocean, which is big, but I'm talking about them. University of mind is a much, much bigger space in there for a much, much, much bigger problem. And when I want to ask questions about space, a yes, I usually go to this guy. Now I realize why was talking to here. I hear you through that speaker, but not through my headphones. Who is this? This is Brian Green professor of mathematics and Physics at Columbia University. We are on, okay, so jet, I said to Brian, if we've got a spacecraft crawling through this vast, vast empty university, how long a trip is it for? Just to start from wherever it is now to the, to the end of the university. By the way, what is, where is the end of the universe?

Speaker 7:          06:16          That's a very natural question. You know, in most environments you can walk for a while, but then you hit the end. You hit the end of the city, the end of the state, the end of the country. But when it comes to the universe, we believe that there's probably no edge. There is no end

Speaker 8:          06:38          [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          06:39          Now, how do you picture that? The one possibility is it may be that the universe just goes on forever. Space may just carry on. You just keep on going and you'll just never run out of space. The other possibility is it could be that you walk off into space for a while and you keep on walking and after a while you realize that you've actually circled back to your starting point. Sort of like on the surface of the earth. You don't find an edge. You can't fall off the earth surface because when you walk ultimately you'll come back to you starting point. That idea may apply to the fabric of space to the entire cosmos.

Speaker 3:          07:15          Although the earth analogy is a little insufficient cause when I'm walking in central park, I am on the edge of the earth because when I look down I see earth, but when I look up I see none earth. I see guests around the earth, so I'm at the edge. Well as if I were on a balloon, I'm on the surface of the balloon looking out at non balloon nests.

Speaker 7:          07:36          Yeah. That's where the analogy fails. If you're on the surface of the earth, you can jump off, you can jump up. Yeah. So feels like you're on an edge. But in the universe there is no notion of jumping off because there is nothing beyond the space that we inhabit. It is all there is and there is nothing outside of it.

Speaker 3:          08:00          And now to make things even harder for our little capsule traveling through space, we now know that space, that the universe and the space that it is is expanding, constantly expanding. So imagine our little craft all alone in nothingness and every minute there's more nothingness and more nothingness and more nothing. And as this always been happening,

Speaker 7:          08:25          we think it's been happening since the very beginning. So if the big bang was the origin of the universe and this expansion has been going on for 13.7 billion years, so there's more space all the time. Yes. Does that mean that it

Speaker 3:          08:41          takes a longer time to go from one part of the universe to another? Is that absolutely.

Speaker 7:          08:47          Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          08:48          So when you say something like, so the universe is expanding, what that to mean to you

Speaker 7:          08:56          is that the empty spaces in the universe are getting bigger. Yes. So the, the intuitive but wrong picture would be that you picture the universe expanding into a preexisting space. It preexists existing realm that the universe is now filling like a balloon, like a balloon filling, say the room in which you're blowing it up. Yeah. But that imagery is wrong in the following way. It's not that the universe is expanding into a preexisting space. It's that as the universe expands, it creates more space. It creates the new space that then inhabits.

Speaker 9:          09:35          Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 7:          09:39          Does that mean that there's no middle of the universe? Yes. The old idea was that there is a central point in the universe, and the old idea was that we were at that central point in the universe, but in the current way and more modern way of thinking about the universe, there is no center. The Universe is actually expanding, but it's not expanding from a certain point in space. All of space is stretching uniformly.

Speaker 3:          10:07          Oh mm mm, okay.

Speaker 10:         10:10          Mm.

Speaker 3:          10:11          Brian Green is professor of physics and Mathematics at Columbia University. This leaves us in a sort of strange position. Yeah, lonely position in the sense that we have this little capsule riding somewhere in a space which just keeps changing. We don't know where it is or where we are relative to other things and whatever we know is changing all the time. It used to be so different. Hello, Neil degrasse Tyson, who runs the Hayden Planetarium in New York City because once upon a time we knew where we were always. We thought we knew where we were and we were the stars. Well, before [inaudible] Copernicus,

Speaker 11:         10:44          the idea of our place in the universe was largely accepted to be the center. It looked that way for sure. You stand here on earth and look up and the sun rises and sets on the moon rises and sets and the stars rise and set and the planets rise and set a Copernicus came around. He put the sun in the middle of the known universe, allowing the planets to then go around the sun, relegating earth to the status of a planet being one of these objects that goes around the sun. Now, that was a very dangerous idea at the time. Apparently, yes, because that idea conflicted with all prevailing interpretation of scripture. It had deep societal ramifications, and Copernicus knew this. He knew it so well that he said, I'm going to make sure I'm dead before this hits the best seller list. So he didn't want to publish during his own lifetime.

Speaker 11:         11:46          This book was basically published on his deathbed as competitive as 16 hundreds oh 1515 oh yeah. 15 three I think was the pub date. So now what happens? So, so now we're no longer humankind is no longer at the center of things. Now what? Well, we're no longer at the center of the then known universe, then known universe was the objects of the solar system, the planets. But you look up at the night sky beyond the planets. What do you see? Stars? They're stars in every direction. In fact, if you count how many stars are to your left, how many are to your right, how many are above and below? It's about the same in every direction. You look, hey, maybe even if earth is not the center of the solar system, the solar system is in the center of the rest of the universe.

Speaker 11:         12:34          Yeah, there. Yeah. That's the ticket. Okay. Now we can dig out of this hole the Kapernick put us in. Let's go ahead and do that. So that group is king. No. Yeah. Our little family of planets were in the center and so that prevail for awhile because it's a comforting concept, not only for the public, but for the scientist as well. It wasn't until the 1920s where Harlow Shapley then head of Harvard College Observatory noticed globular clusters. Those were more in one direction of the sky than the other and he deduced that these things ought to know where the center of the gravity is rather than these measly handful of stars that are sitting in front of us around on the sky. I mean these big fat concentration of fat hundred thousand star Beehive concentrations of stars, star clusters, they ought to know where the center of the galaxy is, even if these single stars don't.

Speaker 11:         13:35          And so he deduced that the center of the galaxy was off in the direction of Sagittarius on the sky. Okay, so now people are fighting that. People fighting that, but then all hell breaks loose because 1920s come in. Edwin Hubble grabs the business end of the biggest telescope of the day and determines that these fuzzy things among the stars are not the same distance as the stars themselves. They're vastly farther away. In fact, you know, they kind of look like what this collection of stars might look like from afar. In fact, maybe they are other milky ways. Maybe they are other galaxies. Maybe we're not the whole story. Oh boy, man. While this guy keeps getting bigger and bigger and deeper and deeper and bigger and deeper and bigger and deeper. Yeah. Oh, this was terrible for the ego. I can tell you I'm disappointed myself. Oh Man.

Speaker 11:         14:33          And so now, okay, maybe we're in the center of the universe because we look this way. We see about the same number of galaxies this way is that way, is that way, is that way it kind of looks like we're at the center and they're all receding from us. So Hey, wait the center then you know, but, but now we're smarter than this. Now we're saying we're not gonna fall for that. [inaudible] okay, we fallen for that one nine times already. We're not gonna fall for this again. Somebody is sitting there in the corner thinking every time we'll make ourselves the star of the show, we're wrong, we're wrong. So we're not going to make that mistake again. And so you then apply Einstein's general theory of relativity and it says if you live in an expanding universe in this fabric of space and time, no matter where you are, it will look like you're at the center.

Speaker 11:         15:20          Which means what? There is no center. Yes. Every center is an illusion. Yes. And so that's how we could look like we're at the center of the actual universe, even though we're not, because everybody sees the same signature of the expansion. Now there's an even stronger argument for then the numerics. Let's look at the ingredients of the human body. You learn from biology class where mostly water, right, but what is water? Mostly? Hydrogen and hydrogen. Actually, let's look in the cosmos. The number one ingredient in the cosmos was hydrogen. Next in the universe, oxygen next on earth and in life. Oxygen next in the universe. Carbon next in life. Carbon next in the universe of nitrogen. Next online nitrogen, one for one. You go down the list. We are not simply in this universe. The universe is in us, so we're not the center of the universe.

Speaker 11:         16:12          We're on this side. Then our gang is not the center of everything, but it's just out on a wing and then a galaxy that we're a part of is one of many and the fact that we are alive is maybe not unique. I got some, hello, can we go? We can go lower. You're ready? Do you want to go lower? Okay. We may not even be the principle stuff of the universe. That's how insignificant we are. Okay? We have learned the universe has this stuff that has gravity but doesn't otherwise interact with matter as we know it. It doesn't shine. It doesn't reflect. It doesn't block. It's dark. It's called dark matter, so how

Speaker 3:          16:49          travel the universe is the stuff that we can either see or that is blocked, but we can kind of detect

Speaker 11:         16:54          4% [inaudible] glow. I took you guys, how low can we go? 96% of the university's missing. 96% universe is not us. It's something else.

Speaker 3:          17:08          Is it your working bias that if I came to you with a new discovery in which we were less important or discovery, which proposed that we were more important that you would guess that my scientific discovery that said we are less important is more likely to be right.

Speaker 11:         17:23          No doubt about it. That's correct. Now you call that a bias, but I don't. I call that track record. Okay. Track record we have among our exhibits. Here are a timeline of the universe that begins with the big bang and you walk the equivalent length of 100 yards and time goes by with every step. You take million years depending on how long your legs are. [inaudible] 70 million years per step, yes, per step. And you do that for a hundred yards and you get near the bottom. Uh, it's a, it's a gently sloping ramp. You get to the bottom of the ramp and then you're reminded that 65 million years ago, the dinosaurs were roaming the earth ready to become extinct. And then you take one more step on this ramp and you reach modern day. Well, at the end of that ramp, we have mounted a single strand of human hair. The left side of that hair, cavemen would join cave paintings. The right side of that hair is this conversation right now. So we are a Spec on a Spec, on a Spec, on a Spec,

Speaker 3:          18:47          and the Spec that you just heard talking was over six feet tall. By the way, is Neil degrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City? Is He that? That right there though, is why I think a lot of people don't like science because any time that anyone normal wants to say that we are important. There's some scientists in the corner who's yelling, man, that's what you spec clients. His preference, but I don't know. I think artists, Shakespeare for example, who says what a piece of work is, man, how noble and reason and all. It seems like it's arched job to say that we are special, significant, glorious, and it's science's job to say, no, we're not. Right. Well, well maybe art is where we should go next. Stay with us. I'm Jack [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich. Radiolab will continue in a moment.
