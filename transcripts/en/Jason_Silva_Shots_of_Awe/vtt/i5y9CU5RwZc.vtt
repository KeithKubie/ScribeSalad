00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:15.360
JASON: For much
of human history,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.650
the idea of physical proximity
and attentional proximity

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.360
were seen as one and the same.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.660
Where I am is what
I pay attention to.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.070
Who I'm with is who
I pay attention to.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.020
But the notion of who I'm
with-- the notion of where

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.140
my mind is-- is being
transformed to the back

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.040
of wireless technologies.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.080
Who are you?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.550
Where are you when you're
talking on the telephone?

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.330
Are you at the other end of the
world at someone else's ear,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.970
or are you over here?

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.036
Essentially,
attentional proximity

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:44.410
on the back of
these technologies

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.270
has been disjointed
from physical proximity.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.160
Our mind no longer has
to be engaging with where

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.490
we physically are at.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.720
Our mind has been
unhinged-- liberated--

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.510
from the constraints of
time, space, and distance.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.660
We have transcended geography.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.800
Now granted, we are still
interfacing with other minds,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.670
transcending physical
proximity-- physical location--

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.300
with, you know, magical devices
made of plastic and metal.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.290
But eventually, flow
immersive virtual reality--

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.570
the ability to engage with
somebody on the other side

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.600
of the planet, in a space that
isn't space, that nonetheless

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.580
feels like a three-dimensional
matrix-- will lead us to a time

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.090
when the new thing is going to
be called shared co-presence.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.810
It's this notion that
mind-to-mind communication

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.310
and mediation will be
free of any constraints.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.510
This is a kind of
technologically-enabled

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.330
transcendence of mind over
matter-- mind trumps matter,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.900
minds trumps biology, mind
trumps any and all limits,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.680
you know.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.050
And it's a wild idea,
because most people are still

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.724
freaked out about these
disruptive and transformative

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:47.265
technologies.

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:50.939
But in the end we're
liberating ourselves.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.290
We're gettin rid of our
biological staight jackets.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.770
You know, we're
learning the songs

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.019
that orchestrate the universe.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:58.320
We're becoming beings
that are in superposition.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.210
We're experiencing non-locality
at the level of consciousness.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.380
I mean, this is us.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.880
Right?

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.375
We're literalizing the
prophecies of quantum physics.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.660
It's a wild idea--
something worth thinking.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.010
