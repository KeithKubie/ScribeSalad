1
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.870
Last time.
We talked a lot about the idea,
I didn't,
I didn't mention the name of,

2
00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:06.920
here's some jargon for you.

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.630
We talked about the idea of deleting dominated strategies,
looking at a game,

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.600
figuring out what strategies are dominated,
deleting them,

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.920
looking at the game again,
the heat we're strategists are now dominated,

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.230
deleting those and so on and so forth,

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.530
and this process is called the iterative deletion of dominated strategies.

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.570
This is not a great title of a Barry's book and you'd be better than that to get

9
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.670
the $250 right?
This is a boring title.
I don't mind.

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.760
Instructive deletion of domain strategies,
the idea of what it is,

11
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.900
it's embodies the idea of putting yourself in someone else's shoes and trying to

12
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:41.150
figure out what they're going to do and then think about themselves,

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.860
them putting themselves in your shoes,

14
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.750
bringing out what you're going to do and so on and so forth.

15
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.340
And last time we saw already that this is a very powerful idea.

16
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.380
All right,
and that game at last time,

17
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.160
but we also sorts of dangerous idea to take to literally that sometimes this can

18
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:59.180
get you to overthink the problem and actually as an that numbers game last time,

19
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.180
the optimum,
the best choice,
the winning choice,

20
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.090
it might not involve so many rounds.
All right?

21
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:08.540
We also saw in that numbers game last time that in some games,

22
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:10.640
but by no means all games and some games,

23
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.170
this process actually converges to a single choice in that numbers game,

24
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.560
it converged to one.
All right,

25
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.660
so just say once again what this idea is.

26
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.580
His idea is you yourself should not pay a dominant strategy.
Delete those,

27
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:27.260
delete those for all everyone else roads.

28
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:29.960
Everyone else is not going to pay a domination strategy.
Delete those.

29
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.010
Look at them at the game with all those,
all those dominated strategies deleted.

30
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.570
See if there are any strategies that are now dominated,
delete those look again,

31
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.210
et Cetera,
et cetera.
All right,
I could write that all up.

32
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.540
We saw it in practice last time that you were just easy to have the idea that,

33
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.810
all right,
one tip about this,

34
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.080
try to identify all the dominated strategies of all players before you delete

35
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.660
them,
delete.

36
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.080
Then look again to identify all the dominant strategies of all players again,

37
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.880
and then delete that process.
We'll,

38
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:05.030
we'll will prevent you from me from getting into trouble.
All right,

39
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.330
so today I want to be a little bit less abstract if you like.

40
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.650
And I want to look at an application.
I want to get a famous application from,

41
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.680
from politics.
All right,
so we're gonna look at a model,

42
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.100
<v 1>all of politics,</v>

43
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.870
all right,
and

44
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.680
<v 0>the idea is going to be this.</v>

45
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.590
We're going to imagine that there are two candidates,

46
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.490
<v 1>two candidates,
and</v>

47
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.370
<v 0>what these candidates are doing is that choosing that political positions for an</v>

48
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:43.110
election so that these are the players and the strategies are going to be,

49
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.680
they're going to choose positions

50
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.350
on our politics,
on a spectrum,

51
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.070
<v 1>on a political spectrum.</v>

52
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.430
<v 0>You can make your life easy.</v>

53
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.720
We're going to assume that this political spectrum has 10 positions.

54
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.420
So here are the positions,
we'll call them.
One,
two,
three,

55
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.830
four,
five,
six,
seven,

56
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.440
eight,
nine and 10.
Right?

57
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.690
Very difficult.
All right.
What's the idea here?

58
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:21.610
We haven't finished tribe in the game.
Watch the idea.

59
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.760
The idea is that these positions are left wing positions and these positions are

60
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.210
right wing positions.
Can people not see past the podium?

61
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.630
Let's get out of the way.
All right,

62
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.960
so you could think of these extreme left wing positions.

63
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.470
These are people who,
uh,
I guess they,

64
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.070
they don't eat anything except for fruits and they think the tree should have

65
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:49.690
the vote.
All right?
And uh,
uh,
these guys out here,

66
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:50.980
these are the extreme right wing position.

67
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:54.910
So they think they think the poor shouldn't have the vote and they eat

68
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:58.660
immigrants.
I'm an immigrant.
I recap

69
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.720
the candidates here.
I'm going to try and choose positions.

70
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.520
We're going to assume this is not realistic.

71
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:11.521
We're going to assume for now that there are 10% of the voters at each of these

72
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.390
positions.
All right?

73
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.720
So there's 10% of the voters at each position,

74
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.840
so uniformly distributed.
All right?

75
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.920
And we're going to assume that voters will,

76
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.630
will eventually vote for the closest candidate.
Alright?

77
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.540
To voters,

78
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.710
vote for the closest candidates,

79
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.220
the candidate whose position is closest to their own,

80
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.180
and we'll need a tie breaking assumption and we'll do the obvious tie break.

81
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.620
If there's a tie,

82
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.620
then the voters split the boot.
Is that position split evenly?

83
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.800
All right.
The Thai,
half the voters go at that position.

84
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.370
Go for one of the candidates and half of them go for the armor.
All right,

85
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:06.760
so here's a game.
I've got the players.
That's the candidates.

86
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.840
I've got the strategies,
that's the political positions.

87
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.123
What am I missing?

88
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.830
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

89
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.610
<v 0>I'm missing payoffs,
right?
I'm missing payoffs and it mangoes in this game a lot.</v>

90
00:05:17.611 --> 00:05:21.930
How we specify the payoffs,
but we're going to assume that the payoffs,

91
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.060
<v 1>okay.</v>

92
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.810
<v 0>Oh,
that the candidates</v>

93
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.573
<v 1>aim</v>

94
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.480
<v 0>to maximize</v>

95
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.320
their share
of the vote.

96
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.030
All right,
well,
that's not the only thing we could have assumed.

97
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:46.240
We could have assumed that all they really care about is winning and the winning

98
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:49.510
gave them a high payoff and that losing gave them nothing.
All right,

99
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:50.680
I'm going to spend a bit more,

100
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.700
I'm going to assume that they haven't spelt maximize,
right?
Max We'll do right.

101
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.040
They want to Max that share of the vote.
Right?

102
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.360
The reason this makes it this reason,
this isn't a terrible assumption,

103
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.320
is you could think of getting a higher share of the vote gives you a mandate or

104
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.210
if this is a primary election you want,
you know,

105
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.480
a larger share of the vote gives you a bigger push for the next primary
whatever.

106
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.501
All right,

107
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:12.140
so we're gonna assume that they are trying to maximize their share of the vote.

108
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.610
All right?
So we want to know what's going to happen in this game.

109
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.530
It seems like a pretty natural,
pretty important guy.
Okay,

110
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.400
so given what we've learned so far in the class in natural,

111
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:27.560
first question to ask is,

112
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.720
are any of the strategies here that are 10 strategies,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,

113
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:36.470
six minute,
nine,
10 right?
Any of the strategies dominated or any strategies?

114
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.050
Let's get some,
let me get,
my microphone is up and ready.

115
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.440
[inaudible] so any structures don't,
how about this gentleman in blue?

116
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.480
So stand up and stand up and shout.
Yep.
Great.
Um,
one in 10 are both dominated.

117
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.620
All right,
so,
uh,
this gentleman,
his name is Steven.
Steven says one,

118
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.830
and we'll come back to 10 but you're,
you're right.
We'll come back to 10.

119
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.100
So he says that straight.
That's position one.
Strategy one,

120
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:03.050
choosing the most extreme left wing position is a dominated strategy.

121
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.430
What dominates it by the way,
Stephen and a shout out to.
So for example,

122
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.360
I'll conjecture here is,
is that to

123
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.540
dominates
one,
two,

124
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:20.720
dominants one that's the claim,
right?

125
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.300
And let's just be careful here.

126
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.540
What does it mean to say that to dominates?

127
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:28.400
While it means,

128
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.670
it means that choosing position to always gives me a higher share of the vote,

129
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.010
then choosing position one,

130
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.990
no matter where the other candidate positions herself,
right?

131
00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:45.440
It does not mean to beats one.
All right,

132
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.310
so let's take Stephen's conjecture and see if it's true.

133
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.533
<v 1>All right.</v>

134
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.850
<v 0>All right.
It's one participant in particular.</v>

135
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.210
Let's start working out what share of the votes you'd get if you chose position

136
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:06.230
one or position to against different positions the other guy can choose.

137
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.580
All right.
Uh,
okay.
So for example,

138
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.200
so what we're gonna do is we're going to test does to

139
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.240
dominate one and what we're doing this,

140
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:23.720
we'll figure out how these payoffs work as well.
All right,

141
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.630
well how about versus one?

142
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.890
I suppose the other candidate has chosen position one.
All right,

143
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:32.930
so the other candidate is chosen position one.

144
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.730
Then we're going to compare my payoff from choosing one against the other

145
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.860
candidates.
Payoff from choosing one.

146
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:45.130
We're going to compare this with my payoff from Tuesday to against the other

147
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:49.790
candidate choosing one.
All right,
let's figure out what that is.
So what's the,

148
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:51.380
what's my,
somebody can shout this out.

149
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.530
What's my share of the vote if I choose one and the other chooses one 50% that

150
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:00.090
was pretty easy,
right?
Must Be.
It's a tie for everybody.

151
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.070
So I'll get 50% of the votes

152
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.820
and what's my share of the vote if I choose to and the other candidates chooses,

153
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.550
one might have a center,
right?
In fact,
he will get,

154
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.120
or she will get all the voters at one.
I'll get everyone else.

155
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.560
So I get 90% so in this case,
choosing two is better than choosing one,

156
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:20.790
but of course we're not done yet.

157
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.270
We have to consider other possible positions of my opponent,

158
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.060
just oppose my opponent chooses to.

159
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.090
So now we're comparing my choosing one,
uh,

160
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.290
wet my opponent chooses to and the payoff I would get if I choose to wear my

161
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:39.750
opponent chooses to.
Okay,

162
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.520
so what's my payoff if I choose one and my opponent chooses to,

163
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.010
I get all the voters right on top of me at position one and she gets everyone

164
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:52.440
else.
Is that right?
So I get 10%

165
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.953
<v 1>okay.</v>

166
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.620
<v 0>And what about if we both choose to 50% we're happy with that.
All right,</v>

167
00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:02.680
so 50% in this case and once again,

168
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.080
two did better than while everyone happy with that.

169
00:10:05.081 --> 00:10:09.600
So we showed this choice was better and this choice was better.

170
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.850
I'm going to keep them going
against three.

171
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.670
So now we're comparing me choosing one,

172
00:10:15.671 --> 00:10:20.671
my choosing one versus three and my choosing two versus three.

173
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.200
If I choose one against three,
what share of the vote do I get

174
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.230
all the people at position?

175
00:10:29.231 --> 00:10:34.231
One and half the people at position two for a total of 15

176
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.820
<v 1>okay.</v>

177
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.170
<v 0>And if I chose to as again,
if I choose two against three what do I get?</v>

178
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.830
I get 20 again,
all people at,
why did I get all the people at too,

179
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.200
so I get 20% so we're okay.
Again,
let's do one more.
This is your pattern here.

180
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:57.010
If I choose one against four and comparing my choosing two against four in the

181
00:10:58.901 --> 00:11:02.590
former case,
if I choose one against four,
how many votes do I get?

182
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.000
I get all the people that one at all.
The people at two right?
I get,

183
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.390
so I get 20% of the votes she gets.
Everyone else

184
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.150
had here.
I shoes two against four.
I get all the people at one,

185
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.830
all the people at two and what half the people at three.
All right.

186
00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:23.050
So that comes out as 25%

187
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.540
<v 1>okay.</v>

188
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.690
<v 0>And once again,
I'm sorry.
No,
I could go on right the way through here,</v>

189
00:11:28.691 --> 00:11:31.470
but I'm going to stop because it got to be a bit boring after awhile.
Right?

190
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.150
Cause I'm,
I'm,
I'm guessing you can see a pattern emerging here.

191
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.430
What's the pattern here?
What's the pattern there?
Somebody,

192
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.810
somebody,
somebody raised their hands.
I get in my account.
Then we get Mike in,
in,

193
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:49.570
in this guy in white.
Stand up.
Stand up.
Yep.
Sound up.

194
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:53.340
Spit up in one.
Start up and shouts.
Two is always better than two.

195
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.750
Has always been a little bit,
we can see more than that in the pattern.

196
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:59.950
What's the,
yeah,
that's right.
But what's the pattern here,
Mike?
Back.
Yeah.

197
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.050
Whatever is closer to five is better than what's ever farther away from five.

198
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.350
That's all quite the pattern I'm looking for.
Let's look at the numbers here.

199
00:12:07.351 --> 00:12:12.030
We had,
we had 15,
20,
then this went up to 20,
25 and so on.

200
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:17.200
All right,
so what's,
what's the pattern here?
Yes.

201
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.950
Steven,
again hit.
If your opponent doesn't choose one or two,
then um,

202
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.150
then you're always going to be 5% better off if you choose to do in the morning.

203
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.090
Exactly.
So ignoring these first two positions are a bit weird.

204
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.280
[inaudible] choosing to always gave me 5% more votes than choosing one,
right?

205
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:36.250
Regardless of what the other person's shoes,
right?
I mean you can,
if you want,

206
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:39.280
you can fill in the next whatever it is,
the next six positions and see.

207
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.280
But you'll see that very clearly that Steven's right,

208
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.690
that that choosing to always get me 5% more of the votes than choosing one from

209
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:49.240
here on down.
And in fact,
they'll go up in intervals of five.

210
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.020
So in fact it is true.
It is in fact true is we can conclude

211
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.290
include that too.
Dominates in facts.

212
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.920
We can do a bit better than that.
We can say strictly

213
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.230
dominates one,
right?

214
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.310
To strictly dominates you one.
All right.

215
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.480
Is anything else dominated here?
I'll just,

216
00:13:14.481 --> 00:13:16.350
you've already told us that 10 is dominated.

217
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.900
I'm not going to go through that argument.
Can everyone see that?
Symmetric.

218
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.033
Hang on a second.

219
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.700
Can everyone see that 10 is going to be dominated by nine and exactly the same

220
00:13:23.701 --> 00:13:25.470
way?
Yeah,
that was that obvious.

221
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.750
It's just really the same argument coming down that's coming the other
direction.

222
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.110
All right,
so similarly,
nine

223
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.710
strictly dominates

224
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:42.640
10 all right.
And again,
we're not saying choosing two beats,

225
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:47.290
choosing one.
Right?
Two wins against one or nine wins against 10.

226
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:53.130
Ryan was saying choosing to always does better than choosing one regardless of

227
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:57.370
what the other person chooses and choosing nine or is it better than choosing 10

228
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.660
regardless of what the other person's shoes.
All right.
There was a question we,

229
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:04.420
okay.
All right.
Let me get the mic and put the question.

230
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

231
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.490
<v 0>Yep.
Stand,
stand,
stand.
Shout out everyone.</v>

232
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.290
I think you may have defined it already,

233
00:14:10.291 --> 00:14:14.370
but I couldn't find a definition of strictly in the book we have.
Ah,
okay.

234
00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:15.990
Would you,
how would you have one on the handouts?
Let that,

235
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.820
I think the probably is one in there somewhere,

236
00:14:17.821 --> 00:14:20.400
but just in case there's one this,
we've had two in class.

237
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:24.360
There's one on the handout.
Okay,
good.
Alright.
So,

238
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.693
<v 1>okay.</v>

239
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.341
<v 0>All right.</v>

240
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:31.120
So we've concluded that that one is dominated by two and 10 is dominated by
nine.

241
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.950
It's anything else dominated here.

242
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.050
Well,
what about,

243
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.810
what about thinking about

244
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.330
weather too

245
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.480
is dominated by three after all I've gotten your name but that um,

246
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.450
your,
your,
what's your name there?
Yes.

247
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.230
So [inaudible] had suggested early on you want to be close to five.

248
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:11.231
So three is closer to five than to is to is to dominate saves by three.

249
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.790
<v 1>That's true.</v>

250
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.480
<v 0>I ask anyone and anyone else who had any other hands.
There's a hand here.</v>

251
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:22.040
Can I can't get this lady here?

252
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:24.251
<v 2>Well,</v>

253
00:15:24.251 --> 00:15:27.760
once you delete the dominated strategies then you kind of go through it again

254
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:28.820
and then two is dominated.

255
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.010
<v 0>All right,
good.
Just you're getting ahead of us.
Good.
So we'll get that,</v>

256
00:15:32.011 --> 00:15:33.690
hold that thought.
Hold that thought.

257
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.750
But what about right now before we delete anything,
let's,

258
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.590
let's,
let's check it out.
Let's check it out at two in particular.
Let's just try,

259
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.860
try this person.
The process.

260
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.120
So how about my payoff versus one for example?

261
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.810
So two against one gives me my 90% of the votes.

262
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

263
00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.240
<v 0>Three against one gives me what?</v>

264
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.690
85% of the votes,
which is actually lower,

265
00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:08.950
right?
Just low.

266
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.640
So it's clear that three dozens dominate to write three doesn't dominate to in

267
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.650
particularly if the other candidate would to choose position one,

268
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.570
I would get a higher share of the vote.

269
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.400
Choosing to only would have done if I'd chosen three.
All right,

270
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:28.410
so in fact it's not the case that two is dominated by three box.

271
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.770
The woman whose name I that didn't get off of God.

272
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.930
So Christina's pointed something else.
The question,

273
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.520
when do you wait for the mic and point that out again,

274
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.620
once we know we know that two is not dominated and pick their not only by three

275
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.790
but what's the but

276
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.620
<v 2>when you delete the dominated strategy of to dominating one or one being</v>

277
00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:50.500
dominated,
when you delete that and 10 than it is,

278
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.160
<v 0>all right.
So what Christina is arguing is it,</v>

279
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.870
even though it's the case that a two is not a dominant strategy.

280
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.340
If we do the process of releasing the instructions and we delete the dominators

281
00:17:02.341 --> 00:17:05.940
strategies,
then maybe we should look again and see if it's dominated now.

282
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.910
All right,
so let's be careful here.

283
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:13.530
We're not saying that we're going to delete the voters at one or delete the

284
00:17:13.531 --> 00:17:18.330
voters that 10 that we might wish to,
right?
We're just saying we want,

285
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.290
all we're saying is we know that the candidates aren't going to position

286
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:26.850
themselves at one and aren't going to position themselves at 10 so in some sense

287
00:17:26.851 --> 00:17:31.320
we're deleting those strategies.
The voters are still let,
all right.

288
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.840
All right,
so let's try that.
So if we

289
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.770
bought here,
I guess bought,

290
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.330
if we delete the strategies

291
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:51.000
one and 10 which were dominated,

292
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.100
then
does three

293
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.360
dominate too.
And once again,
we can try it out.
All right,

294
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:08.290
so let's try it out.
All right,

295
00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:13.291
so the payoff from choosing one [inaudible] start against to put power from

296
00:18:16.691 --> 00:18:21.691
choosing two against two is 50% the payoff from choosing three against two is

297
00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:32.320
what?
What's the from choosing three?
I'm gonna shout out with,

298
00:18:32.321 --> 00:18:33.750
apart from shooting three against two,

299
00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:35.950
<v 1>eight</v>

300
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.760
<v 0>80% right?
The person at two's going to get all the ones that one,</v>

301
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.540
all the ones at two or three we'll get everything else.

302
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.520
This is 80% all right versus three.

303
00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.910
The payoff of two against three is all the people at one or two so it's 20%

304
00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:00.380
the pay off from choosing three against three is of course 50% so so far so

305
00:19:02.051 --> 00:19:04.060
good.
So far.

306
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:09.390
Choosing three is better against for the payoff from choosing two against four

307
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.050
is what?
What's the payoff from choosing two against four?

308
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.330
I got all the people that won all the people at two and half the people at three

309
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.950
so that's 25%

310
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.510
<v 1>okay.</v>

311
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.510
<v 0>The payoff from choosing three against four it's going to be all hip at one or</v>

312
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.561
two at all.

313
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:36.561
He went three for a total of 30% what'd again is bigger now?

314
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.310
Let's do one more.
First is five.

315
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:45.560
The payoff from choosing to,
I can't afford to raise this a bit.

316
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

317
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.060
<v 0>Against five is all the people at one,</v>

318
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.750
all the people at to add all the people at three

319
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.980
30% where's the payoff from choosing three against five is all HIPAA one or

320
00:20:04.241 --> 00:20:06.760
table two or three and half the people at four

321
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.060
35% and again you can see exactly the same pattern is going to emerge here from

322
00:20:13.061 --> 00:20:15.040
here on down.
I bothered to do it.

323
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:20.100
We'd find that choosing three always gets me 5% more of the vote and I would

324
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:24.220
have had from choosing to against any of these higher numbers are the same

325
00:20:24.221 --> 00:20:27.460
pattern Stephen pointed out before.
So I've forgotten your name again.
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:32.890
So Christine is correct in saying that once we delete the strategies one in 10

327
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.310
once we realized that those positions are not going to be chosen by our

328
00:20:37.311 --> 00:20:42.100
sophisticated candidates,
then we realized that probably choosing to,

329
00:20:42.101 --> 00:20:46.810
and of course nine isn't a good idea either.
All right,
so two a nine

330
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.690
two and nine are not dominated.

331
00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:01.060
<v 3>Bought.
They are dominated.</v>

332
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.750
Once we realize

333
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.070
<v 0>one and 10</v>

334
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.370
<v 3>won't be played,
wouldn't be shy.</v>

335
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.610
All right.

336
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.730
<v 0>Okay.
So where are we going here?
Where are we going?
Where's this?</v>

337
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.620
Where's this discussion?

338
00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:32.310
And going to end up just going back to our original game.
Alright,

339
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.480
we've all used,
the one in 10 shouldn't be chosen because they're dominated.

340
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.261
We'd all get the,

341
00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:40.460
once we realize there's aren't going to be played that two and nine aren't going

342
00:21:40.461 --> 00:21:43.380
to be played.
What's in the,
what's going to end up being played?

343
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.090
Wow,
let's just go slow.
So we were able to donate one and 10 in the first rounds.

344
00:21:51.091 --> 00:21:53.520
We know this won't be played and we know this won't be paid.

345
00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:54.570
I remember the voters are still there.

346
00:21:54.571 --> 00:21:58.200
I would just deleting the strategies then we don't need that.
Then we rolled out,

347
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.330
I'll put double crosses in the second round,

348
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.890
two and nine and then we rolled out three and eight

349
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.890
and then we rolled out.

350
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.790
We would have done four and seven and that leaves just five and six.

351
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.870
All right.

352
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.870
So if we do the procedure of iteratively deleting dominated strategies,

353
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.760
going back again and he wants dominated doing it again,
do it again.

354
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.160
All that's left is five and six.

355
00:22:26.161 --> 00:22:30.660
So this procedure leads us to conclude that the candidates will choose positions

356
00:22:30.661 --> 00:22:34.170
five or six just five dominate at six or six dominate five or anything like
that?

357
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.260
No,
at that point it's just a tie.
Right?
So at the end,

358
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.920
the procedure,
so intrusive deletion,
it's quite,
it's Dell

359
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.730
leads to deleting.

360
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.780
Oh,
except

361
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.260
except five and six.

362
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.260
Five and six.
All right,

363
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.350
so this was just a simple exercise I can run.
I mean,
I hope that was [inaudible].

364
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.890
Let me just look out there and everyone following that.
Okay.

365
00:23:07.891 --> 00:23:10.740
That really wasn't meant to be hard.
All right.

366
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.070
But what's relevant about this exercise is not the fact it's hard.

367
00:23:14.071 --> 00:23:17.260
Even if it isn't hard.
What's relevant is that it's relevant,
right?

368
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.560
It's about the real world.
I in particular,

369
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.140
this is a famous model in political science.

370
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.160
They want to know the name of this model.
What's the,
what's the prediction here?

371
00:23:26.161 --> 00:23:30.840
The prediction here is that the candidates are going to be squeezed towards the

372
00:23:30.841 --> 00:23:31.151
middle.

373
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:34.860
They're going to choose positions very close to each other and very close to the

374
00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:39.310
center.
What's that called?
We all know.
Sorry,

375
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.690
hold the thought on that.
Hold on.
That.
So someone at the back shoulder,

376
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.470
this the median voter thera thank you.
Thank you.
That's a new board.

377
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.480
<v 1>That's fine.
We'll be fine.</v>

378
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.460
<v 0>So the prediction is</v>

379
00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:04.120
<v 1>candidates
crowd</v>

380
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.630
the sensor,
and this is called in political science,

381
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.040
the median
voter

382
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.223
cetera.

383
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.340
<v 0>It's called the median voter throne because the voters at the sensor,</v>

384
00:24:21.341 --> 00:24:25.030
in this case,
five and six actually get to decide not just election,

385
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.450
but decide therefore what policies are put in place.

386
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:29.783
<v 1>All right.</v>

387
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:35.150
<v 0>How's this do as a,
as a prediction of the real world.
All right.</v>

388
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.700
How does this do the picture of the real world?
Well,

389
00:24:36.701 --> 00:24:40.900
there are examples in American history in which the median voter theorem looks

390
00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:41.734
pretty good.

391
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.160
They're pretty old as examples are going to be before you guys were born.

392
00:24:45.161 --> 00:24:47.560
But let me mention that anyway.
So I think a lot of people,
if you,

393
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.620
if you go back today and you look at tapes of the Kennedy Nixon election in 1960

394
00:24:54.091 --> 00:24:57.120
so I'm American,
help me out here.
60 right,
right.
I think of 60.

395
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.470
So anything in the 1960 election between Kennedy and Nixon.

396
00:24:59.471 --> 00:25:01.060
Do you ever look at those tapes?
Tapes?

397
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.260
It's amazing how conservative Kennedy looks when you think about his reputation

398
00:25:05.261 --> 00:25:07.540
today,
right?
They really,
uh,

399
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.870
we're crowding the center and eight years later makes them seem to have learned

400
00:25:10.871 --> 00:25:13.660
his lesson.
So if you look at the 68 election,
which Nixon won,

401
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.380
Nixon sounds almost tapes,
but his policies being put forward a mental action.

402
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.610
He looks extremely liberal for Republican.
All right?
So again,

403
00:25:21.611 --> 00:25:23.680
they were crowding that center space.

404
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.520
Some people argue that that's exactly what Clinton did in 92.

405
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.630
He took the Democratic Party to the right eye towards the center in order to

406
00:25:31.631 --> 00:25:34.480
pick up those,
those central voters.
And when shows are,

407
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.380
there are examples in American history of elections that seem to,

408
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.040
in which the median voter theorem seems to do well.
All right.

409
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.580
Now we'll come back and discuss it more in a second.
But before I do,

410
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.710
let me mention that.
The same model,

411
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.340
exactly the same idea has an application in economics.

412
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.340
Somebody mentioned already over the hell.
All right.

413
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.400
The application in economics is to do with product placement is the thing that

414
00:25:57.401 --> 00:26:00.040
Jake's working on,
right,
and product placements.

415
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.520
You might think that is until placing a gas station,

416
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:08.410
you might think it would be nice if gas stations spread themselves evenly out

417
00:26:08.411 --> 00:26:11.620
over the town or out over the road so that whenever you happen to be,

418
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.110
when you run out of gas,
there was a gas station close by.

419
00:26:14.111 --> 00:26:18.070
That would be the convenience.
But unfortunately gas stations that we all know,

420
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.010
they tend to crowd into the same corners.

421
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.470
They tend to be on the same road junctions.
Right?
Why?
Because they're trying to,

422
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.800
they're competing for voters who happen to be close or running out of gas at

423
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.890
those moments and by crowding to cry crying together.
They've,

424
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.280
they avoid being out competed by each other in terms of position.

425
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.990
Can I said that a bit quickly,

426
00:26:34.991 --> 00:26:38.680
but we'll come back and look at that idea in more detail later on in the class.

427
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.310
All right.
All right,
so in,
in,
in politics,

428
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:47.130
this is about crowding too close together towards the center to try and get as

429
00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:49.680
many voters who are close to them and economics.

430
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.450
This is about firms crowding together to try and get a shoppers who are close to

431
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:55.980
them.
All right,

432
00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:01.550
and the people associated with this are a guy called Anthony Downs who did this

433
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:07.581
in political science in a book in 1957 and then I can only makes a guy called

434
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:14.571
hoteling who wrote a paper about this in 1929 and in political science they call

435
00:27:17.401 --> 00:27:22.170
this simultaneous discovery.
I think 909 is a bit earlier.
I have in mind,

436
00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:28.440
all right,
now what I want to do now,
I want to do this periodically in the class.

437
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:30.420
We have a model out there and we've got to analyze it.

438
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:32.070
We've used a bit of game theory to analyze it.

439
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.860
I want us to talk about whether we think it's right,
what,

440
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:38.430
what do we think of the strengths and weaknesses of this model?
All right,

441
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.030
so I want you to show thinking about is do we believe this model list?

442
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:46.470
It's a good model of politics.
What's it missing?
All right,

443
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:47.730
let me come off the stage a second there.

444
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:50.000
I encourage you to get involved in discussion.
What,

445
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.180
how many of you policy majors now raise your hands,

446
00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:56.880
your policy majors as well.
You've probably had,

447
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:59.340
how many of you are Polish ladies?
I've seen this model before.

448
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.340
Some of you have seen it before.
All right,

449
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.780
so a watch this model missing and you don't live in America or live in a

450
00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:09.240
democracy.
I mean you don't know what everybody got.
A lot of you live in it.

451
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.510
A lot of deliberative democracy.
Do you have some idea about this?
What's,

452
00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:17.060
what are we missing here?
So I'm gonna get the,
the woman here,
Ellie.
Yeah.

453
00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.730
Evenly distributed.
All right,
so,
so one thing that seems,

454
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:28.500
seems odd about the way they start this model is that the voters are not evenly

455
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:32.980
distributed.
Let me,
let me go and put that up and I'll be a bit if retiring,

456
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.170
but let me go to and fro.
I bet.
All right,
so one thing,
what's missing?

457
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.633
<v 1>Okay,</v>

458
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:43.950
<v 0>well wrong if you like on the one thing is the voters are not</v>

459
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:46.160
<v 1>evenly</v>

460
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.710
<v 0>distributed and the real world.
Okay,
good.
Anything else?
Good.
We'll,</v>

461
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.850
we'll talk about each of these in turn.
Right.
Let me,
can I get the guy over here?

462
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.380
Sorry,
I'm not making this easy for the,
for to let me stay down here.
I'll,

463
00:29:02.381 --> 00:29:04.050
I'll collect are fewer than,
go back to the board.

464
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.980
The model doesn't take into account differences between the groups in voter

465
00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:12.750
turnout based on the candidates.
Good.
So,
so there's an issue of turnout,

466
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:16.230
right?
We assumed here that everyone votes it's not right,

467
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:19.470
but in fact not everyone votes.
There's always the option of not voting.

468
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.770
All right.
Remind me to put that one up.
It's okay.
Not Voting.

469
00:29:22.771 --> 00:29:26.400
And it remind me of these hard.
The gentleman here in yellow,

470
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.980
there's a difference between the primary and general election.
Good.
Good.
So we,

471
00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:37.130
we assume we kind of jumped to just one election and at least on the American

472
00:29:37.131 --> 00:29:41.030
system,
for better or for worse,
I could voice it depended on that.

473
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.390
There are lots of little elections on the way.

474
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:45.820
There are primaries and all the states that you've never,
oh,

475
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.820
you probably have heard of the states you probably have heard of on the way.

476
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.350
All right.
Anything else?
Anything else that uh,
um,
can we,
can we get the,

477
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.730
where's the other mic?
Can we get the,
the,
the uh,
woman in green here.

478
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.670
American voters often vote based on character rather than position.
All right,
so,

479
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.060
so this more than just positions,
another way of saying that,

480
00:30:09.061 --> 00:30:10.920
so to stop me if this is wrong,

481
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:14.340
but more want me to say that we've been assuming that politics is one

482
00:30:14.341 --> 00:30:17.730
dimensional left,
right?
And there might be other things involved,

483
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.620
character or even among issues,
even on clinical issues.
It could be more,

484
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.620
more than one dimension.

485
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.610
It could be that there's a dimension about the environment and a dimension about

486
00:30:26.611 --> 00:30:31.020
foreign policy and maybe another dimension about registering politics.
All right,

487
00:30:31.021 --> 00:30:34.650
so there's a that's a,
that's an important idea.
Uh,

488
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.150
we got a couple of more years we got going.
Get,

489
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.480
<v 1>um,
the,</v>

490
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.570
<v 0>the model might not apply with more than two candidates.
Good.
Good tone.
Now,</v>

491
00:30:45.571 --> 00:30:50.040
the issue here is I just assumed that there were two kinds of this.
All right?

492
00:30:50.041 --> 00:30:53.340
We know in some of the actions there was a third candidate.
For example,

493
00:30:53.341 --> 00:30:56.070
there was Nida in the,
in the election in a,

494
00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.600
well I guess he was that another one as well,

495
00:30:57.601 --> 00:31:00.210
but he was particularly there in 2000 so by the way,

496
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:05.270
I don't mean this as a joke and some sense there's always a third candidate and

497
00:31:06.511 --> 00:31:09.270
that comes from the point we had earlier because not voting is always an option.

498
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.320
All right?

499
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.370
So in principle in that election in 2000 there was at these four candidates as

500
00:31:14.371 --> 00:31:15.780
it were for things you could do with your vote.

501
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.470
You can vote for as it was then that time Gore,
Bush,

502
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.240
Nida or not voting.

503
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.850
And I'll leave it to you to decide which of those is equivalent to not voting.

504
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.493
<v 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.200
<v 0>Anyone else?
No one else has.
One other thing I think was really,</v>

506
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.750
maybe it's not small things,
but we're not really glaring thing here.

507
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.280
The glaring thing I bought was fine.
I haven't had yet click out.

508
00:31:36.281 --> 00:31:38.840
I haven't helped me out here.
So let me get this guy here.

509
00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:43.400
I'm extrapolating from the fact that there are different things which people

510
00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.234
take into account.

511
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.960
Not everyone closes to six might actually vote for six and eight might be

512
00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:51.020
covering certain.
That's true,
although that's,
that may be a question.

513
00:31:51.021 --> 00:31:54.740
As I mentioned,
I had a different thing in mind.
I mean,
I,
let me say it.
All right.

514
00:31:54.741 --> 00:31:56.820
So I think this is important.
Uh,

515
00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:02.110
I've been a candidate could say during an election that I'm a moderate

516
00:32:02.481 --> 00:32:04.910
candidates.
I'm at position five.

517
00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.210
But you might not believe him or her,
right?

518
00:32:08.211 --> 00:32:10.580
You've got the candidates track record in last.

519
00:32:10.581 --> 00:32:14.630
That candidate can commit to policies at position five.

520
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:19.700
You might know full well that the candidate is in fact a position 10 or position

521
00:32:19.701 --> 00:32:22.190
one candidate.
Is that right?
Is that right?

522
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.790
So unless the candidate can actually commit to a position,
all right,

523
00:32:25.791 --> 00:32:29.270
there may be a problem in them simply announcing my position is moderate.

524
00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.230
So again,
let's think of an example here.
Couple of examples.
Uh,
in,

525
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.800
in the Bush Gore election,
uh,
we saw,
uh,

526
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:41.660
President Bush candidate bushes saying,
I'm not a right wing candidate.

527
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.380
I'm a compassionate conservative.
And you guys believed him.

528
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.130
And I don't know,
maybe he was,
I dunno,
he's tracking.
I got in Texas,

529
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:52.670
I probably did actually look a lot like that.
Or today,
if you look at both,

530
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:56.570
primary is going on now you're seeing various candidates on both the republican

531
00:32:56.571 --> 00:33:01.510
side and the democratic side seek to position themselves.
But as you all know,

532
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:03.860
those candidates almost all have track records.

533
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.110
And not everybody believes that Clinton,

534
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.530
that Hillary Clinton is quite so centrist as hip.
She now seems,

535
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.190
and not everyone believes that the former governor of Massachusetts is quite so

536
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:14.600
conservative as he now seems,
right.

537
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.920
So it's not clear that you can just choose your position Willy Nilly.

538
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:24.380
All right,
so let's put some of these up.
All right.
I'm,
I'm gonna Forget.

539
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.680
Let me see.
You have to help me out of beds.
So we have,
uh,

540
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.270
we have many candidates.

541
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.383
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

542
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.340
<v 0>We have many candidates more than just two,
or we have not voting,</v>

543
00:33:35.341 --> 00:33:37.020
which is related to that.
Actually,

544
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.863
<v 1>okay.</v>

545
00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:43.620
<v 0>And we have,
uh,
choosing your position,
the inability to commit to a position.</v>

546
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.530
All right,
so,
so your position,

547
00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:48.670
<v 1>okay.</v>

548
00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.820
<v 0>Maybe not believed,</v>

549
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.040
I don't want to claim that that's connected to the idea that you can't commit to

550
00:33:57.041 --> 00:33:58.760
yourself,
to your policies.

551
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.053
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

552
00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.890
<v 0>And we had some others,
we had primaries</v>

553
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.740
and we had a how other dimensions.
So we have higher dimensions.

554
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:15.873
<v 1>Okay.</v>

555
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:22.480
<v 0>Have I got all that?
Have I got the main ones now?
I think I go,
thank God,</v>

556
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.400
most of the main ones.
So there's lots of things.
When we look at this model,

557
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.330
there's lots of things I'm missing.
A lot of things are,
uh,

558
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.830
not seeming to be captured by it.
And here's why.

559
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:38.570
I want to get a little bit more religious.
You like,
it's tempting to say,
look,

560
00:34:38.571 --> 00:34:42.950
we run at this model,
it's missing all this stuff.
So it must be useless.

561
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.010
Let's just,
you know,
we shouldn't go modeling.
You might even go further.

562
00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:49.010
You might say modeling,
you're always gonna miss stuff out.

563
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:53.930
So let's just not bother.
And I think it's the wrong conclusion here.

564
00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.680
The right conclusion I think is the reason we write down these models is to try

565
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:03.710
and capture and test our intuitions.
In this case,

566
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:07.430
the intuition about crowding towards the center to get votes.

567
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.290
But of course these models abstract from very important parts of reality.

568
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.980
And the next step to do is what is to say,
okay,

569
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:21.070
now let's try to enrich the model to add more into the model and see if you get

570
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:26.150
a different result.
And if so,
why?
All right.
So you start with your basic model,

571
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.140
then you add in,
you enrich the model and you see if the results change.

572
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.410
And that'll help you explain why you're getting different results in different

573
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:36.200
settings.
All right,
so the,
the,
the,
the,

574
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.530
the sort of part of today's class is models are always abstractions.

575
00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:45.600
You want to use them to see what's missing and then add things back in to see if

576
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:49.080
they make a difference.
And if so,
how?
And let's go through these a little bit.

577
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.670
So it turns out that the very first one voters are not evenly distributed is

578
00:35:53.671 --> 00:35:56.040
certainly true.
It's on,
that'll be true.

579
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:59.940
But it turns out that if you make the voters distributed more realistically,

580
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:01.530
let's stay in the kind of bell curve shape.

581
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.490
It makes actually no difference to the results at all.
All right?

582
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.720
So this is true,
but it doesn't actually change the result.
So this one,

583
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:13.460
we're okay.
Oops.
The results survives the uh,
this change.

584
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:18.060
All right.
What about the one about many candidates?
Well,

585
00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:21.390
clearly that that matters a lot,
right?
We know that there are many candidates,
uh,

586
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:22.110
in,
in,
uh,

587
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.710
in [inaudible] 92 election in the 2000 election and we know that not voting is

588
00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:28.830
important.
So this one,
I'm going to let you see where that makes a difference.

589
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:33.480
This one's going to be on the problem set.
All right?

590
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.820
So I'm actually gonna get you to do this.
Let's go back to the model,

591
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.370
add an extra candidate and see what happens.
All right?

592
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:40.470
You can learn whether it makes a difference.
I'm not going to give it away.

593
00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.290
The one that can missing to policy.
This is important,

594
00:36:44.291 --> 00:36:48.480
is that it's really hard for candidates to convince you that they really are a

595
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:50.220
left or a writer or a centrist candidate.

596
00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.210
Let me give you a historical example outside of America,
but in the real world,

597
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:59.250
in England,
uh,
in the,
uh,
in the 97 out in the,

598
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:00.600
in the eighties and nineties,

599
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.770
the Labour party in England had lost election after election after election and

600
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:08.910
in each,
and it would come forward and say,
we are not really a left wing party.

601
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.900
We're a centrist party these days.
And people would say,
we don't believe you.

602
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.500
All right,
so what Tony Blair,
the,
the,

603
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:20.460
the guy who won the 97 election did with new labor policy was he managed to

604
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:24.180
commit to a centrist policy by literally committing to it.

605
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.280
He took the,
in England,

606
00:37:26.281 --> 00:37:29.460
you have to publish your economic and financial plans or the government five

607
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:30.240
years ahead.

608
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.660
So he took the financial plans of the conservative government that was then in

609
00:37:33.661 --> 00:37:37.290
power five years ahead.
And he said,
these are my financial plans.

610
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.020
I'm going to announce these today as my financial plans.

611
00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:43.710
Five years said they're exactly the same policies as the conservative government

612
00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:47.190
has.
[inaudible] choosing a position close to the conservatives.

613
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.460
He was choosing exactly their position and it came down to it.

614
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:54.120
Somebody else said,
here it came that left election on the other dimension,

615
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.820
which might've been character or whatever.
All right,
and that one,

616
00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.310
that one by a big way.
All right.
So nevertheless,

617
00:37:59.311 --> 00:38:01.140
even having give you that historical example,

618
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.530
we're going to come back and we'll look later on in the class at a model in

619
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:07.680
which,
uh,
politicians cannot choose their positions,

620
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.770
but rather you know their positions ahead of time.
So we'll do this one.

621
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.680
We'll do this one later,
right?

622
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.790
And these other two primaries and higher dimensions that both great points,

623
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.070
we're not going to have time to do them in this course,

624
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.760
but if you take a class in political science department,
uh,

625
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.680
on voting and on elections,
on a modeling elections,

626
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.760
you will see that both of these have been modeled and discussed in great detail.

627
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:34.350
There's even to empirical work on just how high dimensions are really involved

628
00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:35.980
in elections.
All right,
so this is,

629
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.970
this is great stuff for this area of political science.
All right.
Tell me,

630
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.940
I want to inspire you to take some,
some more advanced courses,

631
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:47.440
albeit in another department.
All right?
So,

632
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.520
uh,
have I convinced you that this is something you can do with it or deletion?

633
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.360
Uh,
w we sweat,
we played it,
we use it,
a deletion in it ready?

634
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.120
Relatively abstract setting or not.
Absolutely,

635
00:38:57.121 --> 00:39:00.790
but rather a place that thing last time in which we,
uh,

636
00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:03.070
what would you was choosing numbers and then we looked at,

637
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.570
talked about it in t in terms of Hannibal Invading Rome and now we've seen how

638
00:39:07.571 --> 00:39:11.830
it applies here in election game.
I think that's probably enough or deletion.

639
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:16.430
So what I want to do now is I want to switch course and introduced a new tool is

640
00:39:16.431 --> 00:39:18.280
what we'll do typically in the cars.
We'll have new tools,

641
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.670
we'll see how they apply with it,

642
00:39:19.671 --> 00:39:22.810
we can learn with them and we'll move on to a new tool.
All right.

643
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.170
So I'm going to switch to a new toy.
Any any,
any,
any questions at this point?

644
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.230
I ran out.
Everyone happy at this point or happiest?

645
00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:32.560
Two strong people satisfied at this point.
All right.
Okay.

646
00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.170
All right,

647
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:38.620
so we're gonna move away from this example and I'm going to introduce a new

648
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:41.260
subjects.
I'll need several boards,
I think.

649
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.810
<v 1>Sorry guys.
We'll collect them.</v>

650
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.630
<v 0>All right,
so that bill semi religious speech about modeling,
I think economists,</v>

651
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:07.390
those of you who are economics majors,
you're thinking,
yeah,

652
00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:10.380
what's the problem for those of you who are history majors or political science

653
00:40:10.381 --> 00:40:12.690
majors,
uh,
and that's more of an issue,
right?

654
00:40:12.691 --> 00:40:15.360
So you really want to think about why we're modeling,
what do we,

655
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.450
what do we get for this exercise?
All right,

656
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:21.210
I want to move to a different approach now and

657
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.553
<v 1>okay.</v>

658
00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.310
<v 0>The different approach to analyzing games.</v>

659
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.580
He's going to be about what we're going to call best response

660
00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.240
had to kick.
Kick this off.
Let's look at an example.

661
00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:43.763
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

662
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.770
<v 0>So here's a game.
Very simple game with two players.</v>

663
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.950
Play a one is choosing up middle or down and play.

664
00:40:59.951 --> 00:41:04.951
A two is choosing left or right and the payoffs are like as follows,

665
00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:06.660
then nothing really interesting.

666
00:41:06.661 --> 00:41:09.430
They just some numbers thrown out for the purpose

667
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:16.070
for two and two threes that 510-TWO-ONE-3414,

668
00:41:17.081 --> 00:41:17.920
two and two three.

669
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:20.883
<v 1>All right,</v>

670
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.030
<v 0>so first of all,</v>

671
00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:27.410
let's try and analyze this game using the tools we've learned so far.

672
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.420
So does either player have a dominated strategy?

673
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:40.690
Can you take this?
So I claimed that neither player has dominated strategy.

674
00:41:40.691 --> 00:41:41.830
Let's just check.

675
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.120
So for example is you might think down is dominated,

676
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.660
you really think down is dominated.
But if we look carefully,

677
00:41:49.661 --> 00:41:54.661
we see that down actually does better than up against right and down does better

678
00:41:56.861 --> 00:42:00.480
than middle against left,
right?

679
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.320
I have similarly we can see that right is not dominated because it does better

680
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:09.640
against up than those left but left isn't dominated cause it does better against

681
00:42:09.641 --> 00:42:12.520
middle than does,
right,
right.
And so on,
so forth.

682
00:42:12.521 --> 00:42:15.940
So you can work through this game and you can check pretty quickly that nothing

683
00:42:15.941 --> 00:42:17.020
is dominated.
So if,

684
00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:22.140
if the only tool I taught you in this class was dominating strategies and the

685
00:42:22.751 --> 00:42:26.680
iterative lesion or donate his strategies,
we'd be stuck,
right?

686
00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:30.280
We're going to get,
you wouldn't really get started on this game.
Nevertheless,

687
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.500
it's a pretty simple game,
but straight forward game,

688
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.970
imagine your player one in this game.
You'll play a one in this game.

689
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.970
What do you think you do?
What would you do if your player one?

690
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.890
And so it's a show of hands actually.
So,
uh,
let's just see how I look at it.

691
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.710
A base,
right?
No extensions.

692
00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.680
How many of you would choose up?

693
00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:51.930
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

694
00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.430
<v 0>raise your hand for opera.
Raise your hands right now.</v>

695
00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.290
Somebody put to keep your hand out.
You're at SRMC.
You keep your head up.
Oh,

696
00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.630
you're Martha is wrong.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
You took accounting last year.

697
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.450
No one's choosing up.
I don't want to.
You put,
okay.

698
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:08.100
How about middle one person chose middle.
How about down?

699
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.820
Oh my goodness.
Okay.
There's a massive majority for down.

700
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.320
All right,
so let's think about this a second.

701
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.280
What if you knew that player to was going to choose left?

702
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:29.190
What would you choose if you just happen to know that player to was going to

703
00:43:29.191 --> 00:43:30.024
choose left?

704
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:31.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

705
00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.100
<v 0>Oh everyone agree?
Because,</v>

706
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.790
because five is bigger than one and five is bigger than four.

707
00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.420
So op is to use a technical term.
We'll define formal next time.

708
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:45.100
Oh is the best response to left.
Everyone agree with that?

709
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.780
All right,
so up,

710
00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:51.400
let's say does best

711
00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.260
<v 1>against left</v>

712
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.120
<v 0>and what does best against right</v>

713
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.590
middle does best against right after all four is bigger than zero and four is

714
00:44:04.591 --> 00:44:05.700
bigger than two.

715
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:10.080
So middle does best against,
right?

716
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:16.140
Okay.
So here's an interesting thing.

717
00:44:16.141 --> 00:44:20.790
All of you chose down but opt does best against left and middle does best

718
00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:23.050
against,
right?
Let's,
let's push this a bit harder.

719
00:44:23.051 --> 00:44:25.200
I suppose that you work for somebody.

720
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.260
Some of you going to go out of Yale and be your own boss,

721
00:44:28.261 --> 00:44:30.240
but most of you are going to like me.

722
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:35.070
I got to end up for somebody and suppose you play this game came along in your

723
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:40.071
line of work and you'd chosen up and then your boss came to you and it looks

724
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:41.490
rather fiercely asks you.

725
00:44:41.491 --> 00:44:44.850
So this is Rick Levin or somebody looking rather fiercely at me and says,

726
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:49.740
why didn't you choose up?
Right?
And what can I do?
I can say,
Oh,

727
00:44:49.741 --> 00:44:53.580
I chose up cause I thought the other guy was going to choose left.

728
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:54.770
Right?

729
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:59.770
I have a way of rationalizing choosing up if I believe the other guy going to

730
00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:00.684
choose left,

731
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.580
I can rationalize choosing up that right is that might save me from getting

732
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:07.980
fired.
At least for now.
Similarly,

733
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:12.450
if I'd chosen middle and uh,
President Levin comes along to me and say,

734
00:45:12.451 --> 00:45:14.850
why did you choose middle?
I can say,
okay,

735
00:45:14.851 --> 00:45:19.851
I chose middle because I believed that the other guy who was going to choose

736
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:24.900
right and middle was the best thing for me to do against.
Right.

737
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.710
And once again,
if I'm lucky I will get fired.

738
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.130
It seems like I've managed to rationalize choosing middle,

739
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.470
but down all of you shows down pretty much all of you chose down.

740
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:43.410
Down is going to be a little tricky.
How am I going to rationalize choosing down?

741
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.030
Can I rationalize choosing down?
You will chose it.

742
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:53.100
I'm your boss now.
Why did you choose down?
Somebody hasn't said anything yet.

743
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.713
Can I get the mics up?

744
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.240
And perhaps the person right in front of you stand up and shout.

745
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:59.610
It's the safer answer.

746
00:45:59.611 --> 00:46:02.650
If you can't decide whether or not your opponent's gonna choose left or right,

747
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.250
you don't have to worry about having a payoff of zero.
All right?

748
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:09.930
So in some sense it's safer.
It avoids the zero.
Although,

749
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.880
uh,
I mean it's true to voyage to zero,

750
00:46:11.881 --> 00:46:13.580
but it doesn't always doesn't get the five and the four.
But,

751
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.880
but I think the key part of your answer was I might not know.

752
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.800
I might not be what?
Be sure whether their opponent,

753
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:23.850
whether my opponent is choosing lefts or rights,
for example,

754
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.230
I might believe that it's equally likely that they choose left and right.

755
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.350
Is that right?
All right,
so let's look at something.

756
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:36.030
Let's look at my pay offs from choosing the three options up,
middle and down.

757
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:41.240
If I think it's equally likely that my opponent will choose left and right.

758
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.373
Okay.

759
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:48.590
So we're gonna look at is the expected expected

760
00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.660
<v 3>hay off
of up</v>

761
00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.550
<v 0>versus let me hold it half,
half,</v>

762
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.700
half off being equally,

763
00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.100
equally likely that my opponent chooses left and right.

764
00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:08.090
So what's my expected payoff from choosing a op where,

765
00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:10.480
where I believe the other persons are gonna choose veteran,
right?

766
00:47:10.481 --> 00:47:14.620
Equally likely it's what?
It's a half times

767
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:19.520
<v 3>five
plus a half</v>

768
00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.940
<v 0>times zero for a total of two and a half.
Is that right?</v>

769
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:26.650
All right.

770
00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:31.650
What about my expected payoff from choosing middle against a half half.

771
00:47:32.901 --> 00:47:33.171
So in the,

772
00:47:33.171 --> 00:47:36.970
in this case where I think it's equally likely that my opponent's gonna choose

773
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:41.050
left or right.
All right.
So in this case,

774
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.810
my expected payoff is a half

775
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.720
of one

776
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:51.860
<v 3>plus a half or four</v>

777
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:57.490
<v 0>for a total of again,
two and a half ever happy with that?</v>

778
00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:02.140
My math correct so far.
All right.

779
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:07.560
And how about my expected payoff from choosing down versus a half half?

780
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.470
This is going to equal

781
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
<v 3>a half of four plus a half of</v>

782
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.440
<v 0>to which is a half of six.
So that's three.</v>

783
00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:28.560
Alright.
So turns out that as the gentlemen out there said,

784
00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:33.300
if I thought it was equally likely that my opponent was going to choose left or

785
00:48:33.301 --> 00:48:36.300
right,
then actually my best choice,

786
00:48:36.301 --> 00:48:40.040
my best response is to choose down.
Right.

787
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.680
Or is it a good compromise on is it safe?
It's actually the best I can do.

788
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:49.020
It maximizes my expected payoff.
Right.
All right.

789
00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:50.280
Now we're not quite there yet.

790
00:48:50.281 --> 00:48:54.780
We know that up does best against laughing or the middle of those best against

791
00:48:54.781 --> 00:48:57.030
rights and we know that down does best.

792
00:48:57.031 --> 00:48:59.670
If I think it was equally likely that the person's gonna choose left and right,

793
00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:04.080
but that's not the only beliefs I can have.
For example,

794
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:09.230
I couldn't believe that it's twice as likely that the person's going to choose

795
00:49:09.361 --> 00:49:11.940
left as right.
Right.
It could be,

796
00:49:11.941 --> 00:49:14.190
I think it's they're twice as likely to choose laughter's.
Right.

797
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.640
So equally likely it was problems of half the half.

798
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:21.660
What problems are associated with being within cancer twice as likely they're

799
00:49:21.661 --> 00:49:25.290
going to choose left than right.
Well,

800
00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:29.010
proteins are associated with that two thirds.
One third,
right.

801
00:49:29.011 --> 00:49:30.480
I think if I thought there was two thirds,

802
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:34.590
probably they choose left and one third property,
they choose rights,

803
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.050
then I think it's twice as likely they're going to produce who's left.

804
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.440
And I could redo this calculation.
And in principle,

805
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.730
I could redo this calculation for every single possible problems that you can

806
00:49:44.731 --> 00:49:48.300
think of.
Right?
But that would get very boring.

807
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.420
So rather than do that,
let's draw a picture.

808
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:55.953
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

809
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.360
<v 0>What I want to do is I want to draw a picture here.</v>

810
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:04.850
<v 1>All right?</v>

811
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.680
<v 0>In which on the horizontal access,</v>

812
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:13.210
I'm going to put the probability of the other guy choosing reits,

813
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:17.230
right?
It's my belief that the other guys going to choose,
right?

814
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:18.880
Think of this as a belief.

815
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:20.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

816
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:25.340
<v 0>I don't the vertical access,</v>

817
00:50:25.341 --> 00:50:27.440
I'll put two vertical axes in just for the sake things

818
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:30.870
on the vertical access.

819
00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:35.930
I'll put my expected payoffs,

820
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.600
my expected payoffs.

821
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:48.220
Right?
And let's start by considering my payoffs on his pictures,
but that,

822
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.100
just to help myself a bit,
let me put some points in here.
So I've got one,

823
00:50:53.101 --> 00:50:57.750
two,
three,
four,
five,
one,
two,
three,
four,

824
00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.720
five should really the same in your notes.

825
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.300
You probably have lined paper that makes this easier.

826
00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

827
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.880
<v 0>It starts by plotting my expected payoff from choosing the strategy up.</v>

828
00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.200
So this isn't so hard.

829
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:21.260
We know that if I choose up and there's pro bowler cs zero that the other guy is

830
00:51:22.741 --> 00:51:25.320
going to choose rights.
Right?

831
00:51:25.321 --> 00:51:28.680
That's the same as saying I choose up on the other guy who chooses,

832
00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.780
let's try again.
All right.
They,
if there's problems,
he's zero,

833
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.600
but the other guy chooses rights.

834
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:39.330
And that's the same as saying that the other guy is going to choose left.
Okay?

835
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:41.610
So that's,
so the problems is zero.

836
00:51:41.611 --> 00:51:45.690
The other guy choosing left is the same as that.
Probably zero.
That that again,

837
00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.100
probably zero of that.
Choosing rights is the same as saying they just,

838
00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.330
they choose laughs.
So that might pay off from,
from ARPA gains.

839
00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:58.230
That is given by the top box up there.
I get five.
All right,

840
00:51:58.231 --> 00:52:03.231
so this is my payoff from choosing up against left.

841
00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:08.940
Alright?
And conversely,

842
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.630
if there was probably one that the other guy is going to choose,
right,

843
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:16.680
and I choose up,
then I get zero.

844
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:22.460
So this point here corresponds to my pay off if I choose up and they choose

845
00:52:23.131 --> 00:52:26.100
right.
And we already knew,

846
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:31.170
if I look at probably a half,
which is here

847
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:38.390
that the pay off I get from choosing the expected payoff I get from choosing up

848
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:43.110
against the half half is two and a half.
All right.

849
00:52:43.111 --> 00:52:46.140
So here's a third point we can use.

850
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:48.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

851
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:52.370
<v 0>What is this graph going to look like other than these three points?</v>

852
00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:55.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

853
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.110
<v 0>What's it look like other than the three points?</v>

854
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:00.860
It's going to be a straight line.
Okay.
It's gonna be a straight line.
Okay.

855
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:05.300
So you can confirm that for yourself at home.
But in fact I draw a straight line.

856
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.330
This will actually be correct.
So what is this?

857
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:13.510
This is my expected payoff from shooting up against the privacy of the other

858
00:53:15.771 --> 00:53:19.130
person choosing rights.
And what does it actually equaled?

859
00:53:19.131 --> 00:53:20.690
Sewers to confirm the equation.

860
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:25.200
It's one minus the probability that they choose rights.
In that case,

861
00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:29.880
I'll get pay off of five plus that they choose,
right?

862
00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.570
In which case I get a payoff of zero.

863
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:36.480
So it doesn't really matter.
But that's actually the equation of that line.

864
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:42.990
All right,
what about choosing middle?
Well,
once again,
we can plot that point.

865
00:53:42.991 --> 00:53:46.110
So at w if the other person's choosing right with poverty zero,

866
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:48.060
that's the same as saying they're going to choose left.

867
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:51.660
And if I chose middle against left,
they get what?
I get.
One,

868
00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.350
I should use this pointer.
I get one.

869
00:53:56.890 --> 00:54:01.860
All right,
so that here,
and if I knew they were choosing right,
for sure,

870
00:54:01.861 --> 00:54:05.040
that's probably one that choosing rights.
And if I choose middle,

871
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.790
I get four that's here.

872
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.040
And we've already agreed that if the,

873
00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.380
if I think it's equally likely they're going to choose the right and left,

874
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:15.270
there's probably a half of them choosing reits.

875
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:18.300
I get two and a half from choosing metal.

876
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:23.010
So putting that all together,
I know that they must go through here again.

877
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.420
And once again I got a straight line.
I think I might've missed politely,

878
00:54:27.421 --> 00:54:29.940
but that's more or less great.
So what is this?

879
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:33.750
This is the payoff to play a one of choosing,

880
00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:35.370
middle against left.

881
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.830
This is the payoff to play a one of choosing.
Middle against,
right?

882
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:41.641
Right.

883
00:54:41.641 --> 00:54:46.641
And the line in between this line here is the expected payoff to play a one of

884
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:54.090
choosing middle as a function of the problems that other people choose.
Rights.

885
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.460
How are we going to get,
and we could write down the equation.

886
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.210
It's going to be one minus the PO.

887
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:01.830
They shoes right times one

888
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:09.270
plus the problem to the lead shoes,
right times for one.
Again,

889
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:10.560
don't worry too much about the equation.

890
00:55:10.561 --> 00:55:11.820
We're not really going to do any math here.

891
00:55:11.821 --> 00:55:15.690
I'm just putting it in for completeness.
All right,
everyone following me so far?

892
00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.800
Okay,
so let's put in now the third of these lines.

893
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.290
I really should use a different color already.
Let me switch colors.

894
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.340
Let's put in the line,
the correspondence to choosing down.

895
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.520
So that third line,
not to Belabor the point,

896
00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:34.700
is going to go through here through four and through to

897
00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:41.060
right.
So this is the payoff from choosing down against laughs.

898
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.440
And this is the payoff from choosing down against rights.

899
00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:50.760
And I got those from looking at these payoffs here and here

900
00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.250
and in between.
Once again,
it's a straight line.

901
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.120
So here's the ups,
here's the straight line,

902
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:05.820
and this line is,
let's take it out of here.

903
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:10.850
This line is the expected payoff to play a one from shooting down as it depends

904
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.050
on the problems that the other person chooses,
right?
Hannah?
Once again,

905
00:56:16.051 --> 00:56:17.430
we can write down the equation.

906
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:21.240
It's one minus PR times four

907
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:27.990
plus PR times to alright.

908
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.200
And I claim that this picture really tells me everything I could possibly want

909
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:38.210
to know when my boss comes along when pressed,

910
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.030
when present lemon or Barry.

911
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:43.120
Now Bob has now walked in the back of the room when my boss comes along and

912
00:56:43.121 --> 00:56:46.660
asked me,
why did you do that?
Right?
Why do you do that?

913
00:56:46.661 --> 00:56:49.660
I can now say so for example,

914
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.500
<v 1>okay,</v>

915
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.660
<v 0>just put it in these crossing points here for zone.</v>

916
00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:00.800
What I can say is if I think it's very likely,

917
00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:02.480
let's call this point x.

918
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:06.680
If I think that the provost see that the other person's going to choose rights

919
00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:08.720
is less than x,

920
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:14.470
then the highest payoff I can get corresponds to this line.

921
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:19.430
I have class.
The highest line on that line corresponds to me choosing up,

922
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.020
hey,
if I think that the problems are that they're going to choose rights is less

923
00:57:24.021 --> 00:57:28.430
than x,
then my best response is to choose up.

924
00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.080
Conversely,

925
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:34.550
if I think it's more likely than this crossing point,

926
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:38.540
why?
I think it's very likely they're going to choose,
right?

927
00:57:38.541 --> 00:57:41.540
It's more likely than why the property they're going to choose,
right?

928
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:45.740
Is More than y.
Then the highest line of the history is this one,

929
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.880
which corresponds to my choosing middle.
So over here,

930
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:55.190
my best response is to choose middle.
All right,
put that in.
So over here

931
00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.900
my best response is middle,

932
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:05.230
and over here my best response is up and in between.

933
00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:10.740
It's going to turn out that the highest lines of like if I,

934
00:58:10.741 --> 00:58:14.170
if my belief that the person's gonna choose right,
it's is,
is more than x,

935
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:18.330
less than Y,
then my highest expected payoff comes from that Blue Line.

936
00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:21.420
And in that case my best response is down.

937
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:26.580
I can rationalize all three of these decisions and hope that Barry won't fire
me.

938
00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:30.910
How are we gonna do more than that?
If we're being nerdy,

939
00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:32.800
but I'm not going to be this nerdy today.

940
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.270
What we could actually do is we could sold out,

941
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:40.180
we could solve out for the x and for the y.

942
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:41.770
How would we go about,

943
00:58:41.771 --> 00:58:43.660
I mean I don't want to do it because I'll probably get it wrong,

944
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.680
but if I wanted to solve out for this x and the y,
since this is a QR class,

945
00:58:47.681 --> 00:58:49.780
let's just talk about it a second.
How would I do it?

946
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:55.350
Somebody who's somebody who's not a math major.
Tell me how I solve out there.

947
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:57.370
Maybe the math,
I just can't do it.
Actually it's too simple.

948
00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:00.400
Somebody who's a math major,
tell me how to solve out for the x and the y.

949
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.510
We can be,
but it's going to make on this.

950
00:59:05.511 --> 00:59:10.090
This person here is that the intersection points equal the equations equal to

951
00:59:10.091 --> 00:59:11.470
each other and solve good.

952
00:59:11.471 --> 00:59:16.471
Good to define to solve that x x is when x is when this blue line,

953
00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:21.650
this blue line equals this red,
right?
Right.

954
00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.500
Is what we're going to do is take the equations for those two lines.

955
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:29.770
So here's one of those equations and here's the other one,

956
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.330
right?
Set the P and there's equations equal to X.

957
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:39.950
I got a um,
two equations in one of my own,
so I can,
I can,
sorry,

958
00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:43.490
I got one equation and one unknown.
I said these two things equal to each other.

959
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.460
I've got one equation and one unknown so I can solve that for X.

960
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:50.150
I think I did that at home.
If you do that at home,
I think we don't trust me.

961
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:55.070
You'll find out that x is equal to a third.
It repeats again.

962
00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:57.140
I know I've got some math phobics in the audience.

963
00:59:57.141 --> 01:00:00.260
Let me just slow down a second.
All I'm doing here is I'm saying,

964
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:05.090
look at this equation of the pink line.
Look at this equation of the Blue Line.

965
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:10.310
X is when they cross it,
they are equal to each other.
Take these two equations,

966
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:12.410
put an equal sign between them,

967
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:16.880
replaced this PR throughout with x,

968
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:23.360
I'm going to have one equation and one unknown and that even the math phobics in

969
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:27.890
the audience did in high school.
Is that right?
All right.
Now we're going to use,

970
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.720
this isn't,
I'm going a bit slow here,

971
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:34.670
but I'm going to use this method next time to introduce you to the most

972
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:39.530
important class,
the most important game we're going to see in the whole course.

973
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:44.150
In fact,
it's the most important game in the world.

974
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.690
What is the most important game in the world,

975
01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.030
but they don't go yet.
Don't go yet.
What's the most important game in the world?

976
01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.880
We're going to use this idea of best response.
We're going to think about it.

977
01:00:55.881 --> 01:00:59.450
We're going to learn from it in the most important game in the world.

978
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:03.290
What is the most important game in the world?
Football.
Soccer.

979
01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:06.890
Actually soccer is the most important.
All right,
so we're going to,

980
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:11.210
we're going to show how this technique is going to help us shoot penalty shots

981
01:01:11.211 --> 01:01:14.810
in soccer.
So before you go,
that's Barry nailed off at the back.

982
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:18.110
He has copies of the book.
It's a great book.
Go buy it from him.
