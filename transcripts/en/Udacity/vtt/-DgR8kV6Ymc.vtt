00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
At the heart of polarization, we have a charge attracting opposite charges.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We found something very similar happens when a lightning cloud comes overhead.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These clouds tend to have a lot of negative charge built up at the bottom of them.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We haven't talked about how yet, but this negative charge gets there.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well, what happens is this negative charge in the clouds causes some of the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
negative charges in the ground to be upheld--leaving a deficit of electrons and excess of protons.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This causes the ground to actually become slightly positively charge.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This concept of polarization is essential to the functioning of what we're going to find--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
this Benjamin Franklin's solution to saving buildings from lightning strikes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's actually think about what would happen if ??? a perfect sphere,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we change the shape of our conductor, because ??? with a sphere

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
where the negative charges have a large surface over which they can distribute themselves.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What if we made this a pointier shape, not a sphere but a cone--do I still expect polarization to happen.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But qualitatively, is there any way difference between what happen

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with the sphere and what happen with the cone.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
At the tip of this cone, is the concentration or density of negative charges higher

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
than it was with the sphere, lower or the same, and I admit this is quite a tricky question.

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Think about it and take your best guess but don't worry if you're wrong.
