1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's at the Joe Rogan experience.
That's kind of like the the what is it?
The uh,

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.700
the,
the staircase,

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.180
you know that documentary where like two of his wives died falling downstairs.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.500
Oh yeah.
That's,
people are like,
what?
You still don't fucking know.

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.950
You think two women coincidentally,
imagine if they did.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.170
They're your favorite people ever and they just kept falling.

7
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:22.550
Can pop it literally impossible.
What if you're a rock climber there?

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.820
It was in his kitchen.
Is it is fucking kitchen?

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.140
Did he tries to like an owl did it?
What's this

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.670
crazy dude he had fucker.
Now he had such influence.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.060
He said a bluebird flew in and scared her and flew out of the home because there

12
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:40.230
was no fucking bird by the way.

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.460
But he said a bird flu in scared her and she fell down the stairs backwards.

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.323
By the way,

15
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.240
you know how hard it is to fall back down the stairs backwards when you,

16
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:49.680
when you're already at the top of the stairs,

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.430
nobody falls backwards when they're walking upstairs.
Kicked Sparta.

18
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.730
Someone has to hit you down the that's exactly.
The lawyer was like,

19
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.630
somebody pushed you down the stairs.
That's the only way that happens.
Sparta.

20
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.700
Sparta,
fuck you.

21
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.780
If they did an autopsy and they see the footprint right in the middle of her

22
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:07.614
chest.

23
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.100
Well they said the blood splatter was like so obviously consistent with someone

24
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:15.830
that was like thrown downstairs.
Yeah.
He's,
Oh god,

25
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.980
her bro and these huddles are doing that.
That is a thing that happens.

26
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:22.500
I'll fly into your home.
They fuck shit up.
They're not good guests.

27
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:27.150
They're not nice people.
Assholes.
Yeah.
They really are truly not nice birds.

28
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.810
There's such a cool animal.
Yeah,
they are.
They're a weird animal that we like.

29
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.790
Think of them as these wise old creatures.
Like we,
we,

30
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:39.400
we have like an anthropomorphic version of an owl that's really smart.

31
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.560
Like an owl is like,
hmm.
Well yeah,

32
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:45.700
like the read off and find out what's going on in pop out.
You know,

33
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.510
how many licks does it take?
That was like,
he wore glasses too.
Yeah.

34
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.900
Well that must be what it is.
But the wise old owl is like an adage,
right?
Yeah.

35
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:56.690
Why is it though?
I don't know man.
Because they're fucking ruthless.

36
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.770
What they are is just cunts that swooped down and kill rabbits.

37
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.170
They fuck rabbits up man.
They're wingspans are fucking incredible.

38
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.810
When you see them take off,
take flight and come snag something.
It's,

39
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.090
it's wild to see driving home once and one was flying over my head and I guess

40
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.120
it didn't like how low it was as to where my car was on the road.

41
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:21.371
Like it picked a path probably not in its head understanding that cars go down

42
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:26.430
this road.
It was flying.
Right,
right.
And the car was just too close.

43
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.750
So we just dropped the rabbit and went to get it later.
And uh,

44
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.690
I pulled over cause they're like,
what the fuck was that?
Because it was big,

45
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.590
like whatever it dropped,
it was a fairly large creature and a,

46
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:40.220
I went over in this rabbit that was just gutted because the first thing they eat

47
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:43.610
is the guts.
So to just torn the guts out of this rabbit.

48
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.540
They pick it apart and then they take the rest home with them.
They swooped down.

49
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:51.620
Have you ever seen a,
an OWL's clause?
Yeah,
they're fucking nasty.
They're huge.

50
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.850
Giant has clause that the coolest video.
Look at that thing.

51
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.460
Look at the clause that they're bad ass dude.
Oh my God.

52
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:02.020
It's an amazing first one.
Predator.
The first picture looks like him saying,

53
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:04.450
don't take a picture.
And then the second one,
he's like,
you,

54
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.560
why did you take the fucking,
I told you not to make the pitch.
Yeah.

55
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.310
It's like mad at you and she's picking it up.
Look at the eyes in that thing,
man.

56
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.470
I mean,
it has a demonic face that's like beautiful Predator man.

57
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.160
It's an incredible animal.
Um,
but there's that one.

58
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.490
There's an amazing video online of one killing the hawk.

59
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.470
It kills a hawk in its,
in its nest.
It swoops down in the night.

60
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.200
They got a trail camera,
Frodo.
They had these,
this,

61
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.550
these hawks that were in this nest and these a wildlife biologists were filming

62
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.680
it and this,
this egg,

63
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.300
this owl will comes in and watch this and just snatches the Hawk right from the

64
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:45.640
nest watch test.
Here comes in the distance.

65
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.500
You'll see it's a little eyes any second now.

66
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.230
It's crazy shit to watch the little baby Haka.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
A little baby.

67
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.510
Look at that.
Watch this motherfucker come in and look at this like,

68
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.900
Oh shit bitch.
Whoa.

69
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.390
Fuck.
That's a wrap son to snatched it.
Okay.
The mom.
I was like,
what happened?

70
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:07.390
What happened?
I don't even know if that's a mom.
That might also be another baby.

71
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:09.550
It's pretty big though.
Yeah.
It's hard to tell.

72
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.860
It's hard to tell because we remember prospective,
but look at this.

73
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.260
Look how it snatches it
just to hang out.

74
00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:20.650
Look all the feathers of fly off.
Two hands grabbing a hold.

75
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.850
I don't know why that freaks me out so much now.
That freaks me the fuck out.

76
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.230
Bird on bird violence is weird.
Crazy to do.
It is bird lives matter man.

77
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.340
But it's bird on bird violence is strange cause it's almost like a cannibalism.

78
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.530
It's,
it happens so often is Jack Birds.
Cause they don't give a fuck.

79
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.120
It doesn't matter if they don't give a fuck.

80
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.980
But do you think that's a last resort?
Kind of.

81
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.080
They don't really want to eat other birds,
right,
bro?

82
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:46.540
Everybody eats birds or the next picture.
Even birds.

83
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.840
That's a bird swallowing chick.
Yeah.
They'll get it.

84
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:51.940
Look at it bucking and it's his throat.

85
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.400
Fuck what a Twat duck.
Yeah.
That's a fucking whole duck.

86
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.230
That's huge.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look at that thing.
That is huge.

87
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.670
Well that's a chick.
It's not a fully grown duck but,

88
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.840
but it's big.
It's big enough that it's crazy that that thing swallows it.

89
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.600
You know the one of the really fucked up ones and I saw recently I saw a toad

90
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:19.330
eat a rat or a mouse a want to see that your mouse?
Yeah.

91
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:21.340
It's either frog or a toad.
I don't know what it was.

92
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:26.140
But a big ass green frog looking type creature swallowed a mouse hole.

93
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.350
Watch this.
This is it.
Yeah.
This is crazy,
dude.
Oh this is not,

94
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:32.890
it does not it because this one's hidden.

95
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.420
There's one that's not hidden.

96
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.400
There's one where you could see it like in like a little glass container.

97
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.370
Damn.
I wish I could find it.
Um,
cause it's a really good one.

98
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:49.780
It's from like a top down view.
That's pretty good.
Watch this.

99
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.280
I didn't think that frogs ate mice,
man.
I used to think the frogs are like,
oh,

100
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:58.670
you know,
they just get bugs,
bugs out of the air.
Watch.
He's just not yet.
Not yet.

101
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:02.610
I want to make sure I get them.
Make sure you let him sniff around.
Oh,
you closed.

102
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.630
Maybe move a little bit of a move.
I'm on you.

103
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.520
And as soon as I decide you're lined up,

104
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.140
fuck you.
Look at that head first.
Just delete it.

105
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.110
Stuffing it in there with his greasy little fingers.

106
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.880
I mean,
think about what a pro,
get the mouse trying to get out.

107
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.910
The mouse is trying to get out because they don't have teeth,
right?

108
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:29.910
So they just got to get out.
Its head is out,
man.
Look,
it's eating it,

109
00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:34.030
asshole first.
Jesus Christ.
The mouse was like,
let me just let me,

110
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.730
I'm just curious me.
But I eat the butthole first cause that's the worst taste.

111
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.340
So Ethan,
I don't forget the bad taste out of how they're thinking.

112
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.790
That's just where it was.
I think it would have eaten it headfirst too.

113
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.850
But look at it.
It's just blinking.
Slowly swallowing the mouse.

114
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.990
Imagine you being able to eat a dog.
That's what that's like.

115
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.680
The size difference.
That's like you eating a German shepherd,
German shepherd,

116
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:57.680
just stuffing anymore face.
Dislocating my jaw,
putting it in.

117
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.530
How big is the frog's mouth?
That's crazy.
That's,
I guess,

118
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.630
what do you see those things that can dislocate their jaws?

119
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:05.840
I think that's incredible.
Animals that can fucking unhinge their job.
Snakes.

120
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:07.200
The snakes here.
That shit.
Yeah.
