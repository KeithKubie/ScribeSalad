00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.976
Azim Khamisa: We humans
have many defining moments in our lives.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.200
Sometimes these moments are joyous,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.216
and sometimes they are heartbreaking,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.600
tragic.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.200
But at these defining moments,
if we are able to make the right choice,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.856
we literally manifest a miracle

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.520
in us and others.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.896
My only son Tariq, a university student,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.375
kind, generous, a good writer,
a good photographer,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.816
had aspirations
to work for National Geographic,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.896
engaged to a beautiful lady,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.560
worked as a pizza deliveryman
on Fridays and Saturdays.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.576
He was lured to a bogus address

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.800
by a youth gang.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.120
And in a gang initiation,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.440
a 14-year-old shot and killed him.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.296
The sudden, senseless death

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.520
of an innocent, unarmed human being;

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.960
the overwhelming grief of a family;

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.040
the total confusion as you try
to absorb a new, hideous reality.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.976
Needless to say it brought
my life to a crashing halt.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.456
One of the hardest things
I've ever had to do

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.696
was to call his mother,
who lived in a different city.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.776
How do you tell a mother
she's never going to see her son again,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.256
or hear him laugh,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.480
or give him a hug?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.496
I practice as a Sufi Muslim.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.800
I meditate two hours a day.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.936
And sometimes,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.216
in deep trauma and deep tragedy,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.120
there is a spark of clarity.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.016
So what I downloaded in my meditation

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.200
is that there were victims
at both ends of the gun.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.256
It's easy to see that my son
was a victim of the 14-year-old,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.016
a little bit complicated to see
that he was a victim of American society.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.496
And that begs the question,
well, who is American society?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.776
Well, it's you and me,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.735
because I don't believe
that society is just happenstance.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.720
I think we are all responsible
for the society we've created.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.360
And children killing children
is not a mark of a civil society.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.200
So nine months after Tariq died,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.240
I started the Tariq Khamisa Foundation

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.496
and our mandate
at the Tariq Khamisa Foundation

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.976
is to stop kids from killing kids

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.776
by breaking the cycle of youth violence.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.696
And essentially we have three mandates.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.520
Our first and foremost
is to save lives of children.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.800
It's important to do.
We lose so many on a daily basis.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.200
Our second mandate

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.576
is to empower the right choices
so kids don't fall through the cracks

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.640
and choose lives of gangs and crime
and drugs and alcohol and weapons.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.200
And our third mandate is to teach
the principles of nonviolence,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.336
of empathy, of compassion,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.760
of forgiveness.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.696
And I started with a very simple premise

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.936
that violence is a learned behavior.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.880
No child was born violent.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.096
If you accept that as a truism,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.256
nonviolence can also be
a learned behavior,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.616
but you have to teach it,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.976
because kids are not going to learn that

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.280
through osmosis.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.800
Soon after that,
I reached out to my brother here,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.296
with the attitude
that we had both lost a son.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.576
My son died.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.840
He lost his grandson
to the adult prison system.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.736
And I asked him to join me.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.136
As you see, 22 years later,
we are still here together,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.936
because I can't bring Tariq
back from the dead,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.016
you can't take Tony out of prison,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.016
but the one thing we can do

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.096
is make sure no other young people
in our community

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.680
end up dead or end up in prison.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.936
With the grace of God,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.856
the Tariq Khamisa Foundation
has been successful.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.696
We have a safe school model

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.776
which has four different programs.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.736
The first one is a live assembly
with Ples and me.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.016
We are introduced,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.096
this man's grandson killed this man's son,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.456
and here they are together.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.576
We have in-classroom curriculum.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.079
We have an after school mentoring program,
and we create a peace club.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.416
And I'm happy to share with you

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.336
that besides teaching
these principles of nonviolence,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.760
we are able to cut suspensions
and expulsions by 70 percent,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.136
which is huge.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.296
(Applause)

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.520
Which is huge.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.856
Five years after Tariq died,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.776
and for me to complete
my journey of forgiveness,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.136
I went to see the young man
who killed my son.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.640
He was 19 years old.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.056
And I remember that meeting
because we were --

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.216
he's 37, still in prison --

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.056
but at that first meeting,
we locked eyeballs.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.896
I'm looking in his eyes,
he's looking in my eyes,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.576
and I'm looking in his eyes
trying to find a murderer, and I didn't.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.336
I was able to climb through his eyes

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.336
and touch his humanity that I got

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.976
that the spark in him
was no different than the spark in me

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.520
or anybody else here.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.576
So I wasn't expecting that.
He was remorseful.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.696
He was articulate. He was well-mannered.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.400
And I could tell that my hand
of forgiveness had changed him.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.456
So with that, please welcome
my brother, Ples.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.400
(Applause)

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.680
Ples Felix: Tony is my one
and only daughter's one and only child.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.856
Tony was born to my daughter,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.080
who was 15 when she gave birth to Tony.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.560
Mothering is the toughest
job on the planet.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.336
There is no tougher job on the planet
than raising another human being

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.016
and making sure they're safe, secure

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.880
and well-positioned
to be successful in life.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.080
Tony experienced a lot of violence
in his life as a young kid.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.656
He saw one of his favorite cousins

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.176
be murdered in a hail
of automatic weapon fire

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.536
and gang involvement in Los Angeles.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.040
He was very traumatized
in so many different ways.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.616
Tony came to live with me.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.816
I wanted to make sure
he had everything a kid needed

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.440
to be successful.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.096
But on this particular evening,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.496
after years of being with me

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.096
and struggling mightily
to try to be successful

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.640
and to live up to my expectations
of being a successful person,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.776
on this one particular day,
Tony ran away from home that evening,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.576
he went to be with people
he thought were his friends,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.056
he was given drugs and alcohol

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.336
and he took them

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.616
because he thought
they would make him feel carefree.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.136
But all it did was
to make his anxiety go higher

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.920
and to create a more ...

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.440
more deadly thinking on his part.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.696
He was invited to a robbery,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.680
he was given a 9mm handgun.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.336
And at the presence
of an 18-year-old who commanded him

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.496
and two 14-year-old boys
he thought were his friends,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.736
he shot and killed Tariq Khamisa,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.560
this man's son.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.256
There are no words, there are no words

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.320
that can express the loss of a child.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.696
At my understanding
that my grandson was responsible

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.416
for the murder of this human being,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.656
I went to the prayer closet,
like I was taught by my old folks,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.816
and began to pray and meditate.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.296
The one thing that Mr. Khamisa
and I have in common,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.256
and we didn't know this,
besides being wonderful human beings,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.500
is that we both meditate.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.680
(Laughter)

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.376
It was very helpful for me

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.896
because it offered me an opportunity
to seek guidance and clarity

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.696
about how I wanted to be of support
of this man and his family in this loss.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.776
And sure enough, my prayers were answered,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.736
because I was invited
to a meeting at this man's house,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.576
met his mother, his father,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.656
his wife, his brother, met their family

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.896
and had a chance to be in the presence
of God-spirited people led by this man,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.096
who in the spirit of forgiveness,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.640
made way, made an opportunity for me

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.656
to be of value and to share with him
and to share with children

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.896
the importance of understanding the need
to be with a responsible adult,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.296
focus on your anger
in a way that's healthy,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.776
learn to meditate.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.816
The programs that we have
in the Tariq Khamisa Foundation

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.896
provide so many tools
for the kids to put in their toolkit

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.176
so they could carry them
throughout their lives.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.496
It's important that our children
understand that loving, caring adults

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.056
care for them and support them,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.296
but it's also important
that our children learn to meditate,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.976
learn to be peaceful,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.456
learn to be centered

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.775
and learn to interact
with the other children

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.775
in a kind, empathetic

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:56.936
and wonderfully loving way.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.616
We need more love in our society

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.856
and that's why we are here
to share the love with children,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.496
because our children
will lead the way for us,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.096
because all of us
will depend on our children.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.696
As we grow older and retire,
they will take over this world for us,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.456
so as much love as we teach them,
they will give it back to us.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.856
Blessings. Thank you.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.880
(Applause)

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.096
AK: So I was born in Kenya,
I was educated in England,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.856
and my brother here is a Baptist.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.840
I practice as a Sufi Muslim.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.736
He's African American,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.656
but I always tell him,
I'm the African American in the group.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.376
I was born in Africa. You were not.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.696
(Laughter)

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.896
And I naturalized as a citizen.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.896
I'm a first-generation citizen.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.696
And I felt that, as an American citizen,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.856
I must take my share of the responsibility

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.320
for the murder of my son.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.536
Why? Because it was fired
by an American child.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.456
You could take the position,
he killed my one and only son,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.720
he should be hung from the highest pole.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.456
How does that improve society?

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.880
And I know you are probably wondering
what happened to that young man.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.496
He's still in prison.
He just turned 37 on September 22,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.416
but I have some good news.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.216
We've been trying
to get him out for 12 years.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.456
He finally will join us a year from now.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.120
(Applause)

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.976
And I'm very excited to have him join us,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.096
because I know we've saved him,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.576
but he will save
tens of thousands of students

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.096
when he shares his testimony

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.496
in schools that we are present at
on a regular basis.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.856
When he says to the kids,
"When I was 11, I joined a gang.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.776
When I was 14,
I murdered Mr. Khamisa's son.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.376
I've spent the last
umpteen years in prison.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.456
I'm here to tell you: it's not worth it,"

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.096
do you think the kids
will listen to that voice?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.656
Yes, because his intonations

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.976
will be of a person
that pulled the trigger.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.560
And I know that he wants
to turn the clock back.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.136
Of course, that's not possible.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.736
I wish it was. I would have my son back.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.040
My brother would have his grandson back.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.880
So I think that demonstrates
the power of forgiveness.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.720
So what's the big takeaway here?

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.136
So I want to end
our session with this quote,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.856
which is the basis of my fourth book,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.736
which incidentally,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.200
the foreword for that book
was written by Tony.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.736
So it goes like this:
sustained goodwill creates friendship.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.976
You don't make friends
by bombing them, right?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.896
You make friends by extending goodwill.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.336
That ought to be obvious.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.816
So sustained goodwill creates friendship,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.256
sustained friendship creates trust,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.696
sustained trust creates empathy,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.096
sustained empathy creates compassion,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.640
and sustained compassion creates peace.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.976
I call this my peace formula.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.976
It starts with goodwill, friendship,
trust, empathy, compassion and peace.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.736
But people ask me,
how do you extend goodwill

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.360
to the person who murdered your child?

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.336
I tell them, you do that
through forgiveness.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.496
As it's evident it worked for me.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.416
It worked for my family.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.096
What's a miracle is it worked for Tony,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.256
it worked for his family,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.496
it can work for you and your family,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.496
for Israel and Palestine,
North and South Korea,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.376
for Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.000
It can work for
the United States of America.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.936
So let me leave you with this, my sisters,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.296
and a couple of brothers --

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.296
(Laughter)

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.080
that peace is possible.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.736
How do I know that?

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.616
Because I am at peace.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.616
Thank you very much. Namaste.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.720
(Applause)
