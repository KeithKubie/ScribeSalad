00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, thanks everyone, for coming
to an authors at Google talk today.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.690
I know the weather was kind of iffy.
So thank you, Mr. Thomson, for making it all

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.539
the way from San Francisco.
We have a very special treat today.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.520
David Thomson is a San Francisco-based film
critic and historian and the author of more

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.590
than twenty books, including the new biographical
Dictionary of Film.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.390
Regarded as one of the best reference works
on the cinema and it's in its fourth edition.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.660
He was born in World War II-era London, when
movies like Red River, The Third Man, and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.590
Susan Cain first ignited his passion for film
as a child.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.220
Today, he'll talk about his latest series
called 'Great Stars' where he examines the

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.180
back stories of Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman,
Bette Davis, and Gary Cooper and the films

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.329
that made them legendary.
Please give a hand for David Thomson.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.239
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:04.580
David: Thank you very much. Can you hear me
fine?

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.890
People like stories about movie stars.
So I will give you some stories.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:24.400
There was a company named Selznick International.
Selznick International was a partnership of

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.700
David O. Selznick, who was born into the movie
business, and Jock Whitney, who was at the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:43.600
time one of the wealthiest heirs in America.
And one of the first things they did in 1935

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.530
when they made their company was, they bought
the screenrights to a novel called 'Gone with

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.350
the Wind'.
These are the people who made Gone with the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:03.479
Wind, which -- no matter what people tell
you about Avatar -- has taken more real money

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:11.120
than any film ever made in this country -- still.
And here's the story about what happened in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:21.650
the New York offices of Selznick International.
There was a Swedish elevator operator.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.819
And every day, he would take Kay Brown up
and down to the offices.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.430
And Kay Brown was the chief literary talent
scout at Selznick International.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.360
She was the person who recommended to David
that he buy Gone with the Wind, even though

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.690
he hadn't read the book.
She had a hunch it would do something.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.810
One day, in the elevator, the operator says,
"Oh, Miss Brown, I hear from home the most

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.430
fantastic stories about this beautiful, young
girl there is in Sweden.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.560
Her name is Ingrid Bergman.
And really, my relatives have sent me pictures

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.769
of her.
I don't know whether you can possibly get

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.640
any of her movies, but I really think you
should look at them."

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.069
And Kay Brown never discounted a hunch, even
if it came from humble sources.

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:34.420
She got an Ingrid Bergman film.
She looked at it -- couldn't understand a

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:44.260
word of it of course, but she could see that
the camera loved Ingrid Bergman.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.300
That is not so common a thing.
And it is one of the things that people in

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.319
the picture business to this day still live
for -- to find someone like that.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:04.830
So she speaks to David Selznick, and she says,
"There's this young woman in Sweden, and I

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.739
think maybe she's got something."
And Selznick says, "Well, go over to Stockholm

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.720
and see her." She's a poor Swedish girl.
She can't possibly come here.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.779
Go over to Sweden. See her."
Kay Brown makes her way to Sweden on a boat

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:27.319
in the winter -- very difficult.
She gets there.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.509
Ingrid Bergman opens the door carrying a newborn
baby -- not a good sign.

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:39.309
The actress has a newborn baby; there could
be conflict of interests.

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:45.979
But she sees straightaway that this woman
has got something amazing.

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.490
And she says to her, "Well, would you perhaps
come to Hollywood to see Mr. Selznick, because

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.689
I think he might be prepared to put you under
contract?

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:07.300
It could transform your life."
Ingrid says, "Well, I have a newborn baby."

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.240
And Kay Brown actually says to her, "I know,
and you know, the world is not looking good."

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.999
This is 1939.
"There's probably going to be a war.

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:23.789
If I were you, I'd stick with your baby and
stay in Sweden, which looks as if it might

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.969
be a safer country than other countries if
a war comes."

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.561
And Ingrid Bergman says, "Oh, no. I'll come.
I'll come."

00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:38.869
In any event, she leaves a six-month-old baby
with the father.

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:45.300
You can always tell the real determination
in some stars early on.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:54.160
She leaves the child, and she goes to America
 -- big journey in those days -- she turns

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:02.750
up, carrying her suitcase, at the Selznick
house in Beverly hills.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:09.319
And Mrs. Selznick is there. It's a Sunday.
And she's listening -- it's a Saturday, I

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.879
beg your pardon.
She's listening to the Kentucky Derby on the

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.439
radio.
And she just signals to Ingrid Bergman, "Wait,

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.119
wait.
Till the race is over. I want to concentrate

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:25.279
on the race."
And Ingrid Bergman waits, standing in the

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:32.749
sun with her suitcase having come 6,000 miles.
And at last, she's waved forward into the

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:37.629
royal presence, so to speak.
And she says, "I'm Ingrid Bergman. I've come

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.340
from Stockholm."
And Mrs. Selznick says, "Oh, yes, of course.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:47.589
The trouble is, my husband is at the studio."
They worked at the studios on Saturdays in

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:50.479
those days.
And they would have done anyway, because he

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:59.520
was shooting at the time Gone with the Wind.
So Mrs. Selznick says to her, "Never mind.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.129
I will look after you.
I'm going to a party later on today. You come

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.389
with me.
And Ingrid says, "You sure that's all right?

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:13.589
I shouldn't stay here and wait for Mr. Selznick?"
And Mrs. Selznick says, "We never know when

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:16.539
he will come back.
Just stick with me.

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:22.580
Sooner or later, we'll bump into him."
They go to the party. She's traveled.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.460
She's meeting stars and celebrities at the
party.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.669
She goes back to the Selznick house.
David Selznick has still not arrived.

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:39.150
She falls asleep, actually.
And someone nudges her and says, "Mr. Selznick

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.209
is here.
He's in the kitchen eating.

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:47.550
Hasn't eaten all day. He's been working.
He's stuffing himself with food in the kitchen."

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:55.699
She goes out to meet him -- the man who has
brought her all the way from Sweden.

00:07:55.699 --> 00:08:03.199
And he looks at her, and he says, "Oh, dear.
You are too tall."

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:08.449
She was very tall. She was taller than David
Selznick.

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:13.550
And they talked for a few minutes.
And he looks at her in a sort of very professional

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:20.289
way.
And he says, "Your teeth need a lot of work,

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:24.849
and your chin is a real problem.
I can see them straight away. And I'm not

00:08:24.849 --> 00:08:31.020
a cameraman.
And you know, 'Bergman' sounds too Germanic

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.169
a name.
We're going to have to change your name if

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:44.769
there's any chance of you having a career."
And this is the decisive moment.

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:49.350
She says, "Mr. Selznick, I think you're being
very rude.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:56.389
I've come all this way to see you.
It's a long journey. I've left my daughter

00:08:56.389 --> 00:09:01.319
behind.
Sometimes that upsets me.

00:09:01.319 --> 00:09:07.120
And now, you make personal comments about
my appearance, about my name, about my height,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.130
all of which you had an information before
I came here.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:18.069
All of which were in photographs.
You could have saved yourself a lot of money,

00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:20.400
a lot of time and trouble.
I needn't have come here.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.949
I could have stayed in Stockholm.
I could be nursing my daughter."

00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:28.980
And David says, "[snapping fingers] I got
it.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:37.339
You are the tall, natural, honest, Swedish
type who will talk back to the boss.

00:09:37.339 --> 00:09:42.149
I see a whole career."
And she says, "What do you mean? What do you

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:47.870
mean?"
And he says, "I see who you will be for us.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.500
We will do nothing in the way of making you
up.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:56.560
It will be a big part of your publicity campaign
that Ingrid Bergman wears no make-up.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.970
And she says, "Well, I do wear a little make-up,
you know, I mean, most women wear a little

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.760
make-up."
He says, "You will wear no make-up at all."

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.209
[laughter]
"We will emphasize how tall you are.

00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:15.439
You are a nordic queen, a princess.
We will concentrate on the name Ingrid Bergman,

00:10:15.439 --> 00:10:19.620
and you will always be as you were with me
just now.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:25.690
You will be candid. You will be direct. You
will tell the truth.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:34.040
You will not be like American stars -- kissing
up to the press, kissing up to anyone.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:41.230
And I think you can have a career.
Well, in two or three years time, she had

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.199
made Casa Blanca -- not for Selznick.
He loaned her out.

00:10:45.199 --> 00:10:49.390
In other words, what he did was, he paid her
a holding salary, and then, loaned her out

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.439
at a much larger salary to Warner Brothers.
So he made a huge profit on it.

00:10:54.439 --> 00:11:07.610
He did that with her a lot of the time.
And, Ingrid built a publicity image around

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:20.060
this true, simple, Swedish, peasant girl without
make-up, without lies.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:25.230
Alas, it bore very little resemblance to the
real Ingrid Bergman.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:31.779
Anyone who noticed her realized that one reason
was she had left her husband and her child

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:34.410
in Sweden.
They came over eventually, but one reason

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.689
why she had left them there in Sweden was
that she liked flirting with any man she met.

00:11:39.689 --> 00:11:45.950
On almost every film she made, she had one
or two romances.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:53.160
This was not unknown in Hollywood at that
time.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:01.089
And you have to realize that this was a time
when, in Hollywood, the private lives of stars

00:12:01.089 --> 00:12:07.699
could be controlled by the studios.
The press were extremely kind and generous

00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:15.100
to this kind of thing.
With this result, that Ingrid Bergman became,

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:23.500
by 1946-7, No. 1 box office figure in the
world.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:30.730
She had won the Oscar in Gaslight, she played
a nun in the Bells of St. Mary's with Bing

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.310
Crosby -- quite atrocious film, but a huge
box office success.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.269
Nearly everything she made was box office
money.

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:45.959
And because the screen role she played was
so appealing and so charming, and because

00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:53.199
they dovetailed so well with the publicity
that was applied to her by the studio -- in

00:12:53.199 --> 00:12:59.790
everything from still-photo sessions to stories
that were put out for fan magazines, written

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.470
by the studios, but as if written by her -- the
whole thing fitted together.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:10.660
And the public believed and would have voted
if they had been given a chance, that Ingrid

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:20.310
Bergman was the truest, the most natural,
the most honest of all the movie stars.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:27.040
She became bored with Hollywood.
She -- you would have to read the little book

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:33.310
I've written about her to get all the affairs,
but they were more than the public dreamed

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.610
of.
They were habitual.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:43.420
She became bored, though, with American films.
And one day, she walked into a theater in

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:49.839
Los Angeles, and she saw a film called 'Rome,
Open City,' directed by Roberto Rossellini,

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:54.339
one of the first, Italian, near-realist films
 -- a film actually made while the Germans

00:13:54.339 --> 00:14:00.300
were in Italy.
A film made with great difficulty and a raw,

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:05.389
naturalistic, realistic film.
And she loved it.

00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:12.019
The young Anna Magnani had a lead part in
the film, and she wanted to be like that Anna

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:17.759
Magnani.
And she wrote a letter to Roberto Rossellini

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:26.560
saying, "If you could use a Swedish actress
who can only say 'I love you' in Italian -- it's

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.800
the only words of Italian I know, I am at
your disposal."

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:41.420
Well, Roberto Rossellini -- a scoundrel, great
director, and a scoundrel -- was living to

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.290
come to Hollywood.
He gets this letter.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:48.230
He thinks, "My chance! Ingrid Bergman, the
biggest star in the world.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.279
If I make friends with her, I find the right
script for her.

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:58.209
I go to Hollywood. I become world-famous director."
Ingrid Bergman was dying to go to Europe.

00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:05.279
"Ah, I could make a real, true, political,
radical, tough film.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:10.329
Not this sentimental crap that I'm making
in Hollywood, pretending I'm a nun with Bing

00:15:10.329 --> 00:15:16.670
Crosby singing to the children."
Appalling stuff. She ends up having to make

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:21.029
the journey.
She goes to Italy.

00:15:21.029 --> 00:15:26.230
She starts to make a film with him called
Stromboli, about a refugee who goes to live

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.399
on the volcanic island of Stromboli in the
Mediterranean.

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:36.329
And not surprisingly, they've developed an
affair.

00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:42.360
This affair -- because it's in Europe, outside
studio control -- hits the press.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:49.720
The world goes mad as if it were the O.J.
Simpson case.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:58.269
You have to read the documents of the time
to understand the outrage.

00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:06.439
Ingrid was condemned on the floor of the Senate.
She was condemned from pulpits all across

00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:12.430
America.
People sent in their signed photographs of

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:18.240
her, torn to pieces, in demonstration of how
shocked they were.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:24.949
And suddenly, she became box office poison.
She did not work in America for six or seven

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:29.040
years.
She had to live in Europe, in Italy, with

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:36.110
Rossellini, having three more children -- one
of whom you know, Isabella Rossellini, making

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:41.930
a number of very interesting films that never
did anything at the box office.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:46.730
And she was only allowed to come back to America
to make a film called 'Anastasia', for which

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:51.689
she won her second Oscar.
But her whole career -- I'm trying to show

00:16:51.689 --> 00:17:00.629
you -- was premised upon public image.
And the whole thing was there from the beginning.

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:05.010
Selznick says, "You're pure. You're wonderful.
You're true."

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.529
She says, "Well, I'm not really -- not at
all."

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:15.260
But they make her that, and it makes her for
a few years, and then, it destroys her.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.400
One story.
We're going to have time for two of these

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.110
good stories.
Humphrey Bogart.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:29.750
Of the four people I've written about, Humphrey
Bogart was the only one who was remotely upper

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:36.149
class -- came from a good family, a moneyed
family.

00:17:36.149 --> 00:17:41.929
His mother was an illustrator for popular
magazines, and she used young Humphrey as

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:49.080
her model.
And Bogart goes on the stage, and nobody can

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:55.870
place him.
They try to place him as a young, romantic

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:02.890
lead, because he looks quite good.
But he doesn't smile very well.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:11.049
And he looks sour, and he has a scowl.
So by the time he goes to Hollywood, he's

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:19.020
a villain.
And Bogey started making films in 1935.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.970
And he was a villain for seven or eight years
 -- not a star.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:30.880
The stars at Warner Brothers -- his studio,
in that time -- were Jimmy Cagney, George

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:37.660
Raft, Elmer G Robinson, later Errol Flynn.
He played supporting parts.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:43.649
He's the gangster whom Cagney kills at the
end.

00:18:43.649 --> 00:18:48.270
And his career was not taking.
He became a drunk because of that.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:55.890
He went through three marriages.
He was an extremely difficult, unpleasant,

00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:02.049
needling guy.
And he blamed his agents.

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:05.340
He said, "You can't get the right kind of
part for me."

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:10.340
And they would say, "Well, Bogey, what is
the right kind of part for you?"

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:16.500
And he said, "I don't know. I'm just an actor."
And actors never know what the right parts

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.870
for them are.
There may be some exceptions, but on the whole,

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.289
they never know what the right parts for them
are.

00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:31.210
And Bogart goes on and on.
Until one day, he runs across a man -- a young

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:37.570
man, screenwriter named John Huston.
And Huston is working on a gangster film about

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:46.950
an elderly gangster, a veteran, who's let
out of jail and goes on the run, is killed

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:57.770
in the end, but is a gangster who is sympathetic.
And Huston says, "You know, it's sort of a

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.980
quality Bogart's got.
Bogart's nasty, but you sort of know Bogart

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:08.460
wants to be liked."
And they put him in a film called High Sierra,

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:17.539
1941, and it begins to happen.
Bogart relaxes, because he knows that the

00:20:17.539 --> 00:20:24.240
script likes his character.
He treats people badly in the film -- he kills

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.470
people and so on and so forth, but film is
on his side.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:36.039
Straight away, Huston, who wants to direct,
takes him up and puts him in a film called

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:44.600
The Maltese Falcon, playing a private eye
named Sam Spade who behaves like a gangster.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:53.760
And you have this image building -- Bogart's
really not aware of it -- of a new kind of

00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:04.140
guy, tough, hard-boiled, mean, sarcastic,
needling other people, goading other people,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:09.930
but instead of the audience disapproving of
him, which had happened all through the '30s,

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:14.679
they sort of start saying, "Don't you like
Bogart when he's like that?

00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:18.670
When he really puts it to the woman?
When he really tells Mary Astor what a shit

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:24.820
she is in The Maltese Falcon?
Don't you think Bogart's never been better?"

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:30.260
And this turns into the Humphrey Bogart that
you all know.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:36.340
And it reaches its sort of epitome in films
like Casa Blanca, again.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:42.260
One film that figures in the career of both
people.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:50.250
To Have and Have Not, and The Big Sleep.
And all of a sudden, Bogart is established.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:58.120
And as if you never have the courage to believe
in magic, this man who has had a disastrous

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:05.990
series of marriages, in one of these films,
To Have and Have Not, finds himself playing

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:15.320
opposite a girl of nineteen.
She acts about 92, but she was 19, who had

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.870
never made a film before, whose name was Betty
Perske.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.120
But she would be called Lauren Bacall by the
time the film comes out.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.500
And he finds he's falling in love with her
in front of the camera.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:34.730
And she falls in love with him.
And they become the union that is still, I

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:42.720
think, probably the most romantic, smoke-enshrouded
coupling that Hollywood ever put together.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.309
I cannot tell you that either one of them
was totally faithful to the other through

00:22:48.309 --> 00:22:54.360
the short years of their marriage, because
Bogart was dead by 1957, but still, it was

00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:00.450
an extraordinary union and marriage.
And it made Bogart a star when his career,

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:08.440
in fact, was about two-thirds over.
So those are the two stories that I have time

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:17.970
to tell you that show you what a very strange
business stardom can be.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:25.380
And how, as a rule, the people who are the
stars have no control over it.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.029
Sometimes there are other people off to one
side who have some control over it.

00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:35.570
You can make a star if you're lucky and you
know what you're doing, but the stars themselves,

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:44.500
rarely have the authority.
But, once you've got a persona that the public

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:53.769
will buy, you're hung.
It works in the media still, to this day.

00:23:53.769 --> 00:23:59.929
No one really knows -- I would argue -- who
Johnny Carson was, or who David Letterman

00:23:59.929 --> 00:24:03.590
is.
They're both, I think, deeply mysterious people

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:09.840
who can survive going on television, so to
speak, every night week after week.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:16.669
But they have a charm with the camera.
If you ask them to define it, I know they

00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:20.840
couldn't do it.
It's all they can do to go on and, three nights

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:25.880
out of five, make it work.
Now, a lot of stardom -- and the thing we

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:32.669
call 'stardom' -- which still makes the movies
function to a great degree -- has to do with

00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:39.300
this extraordinary relationship some people
have -- if the dialogue is right, if the lighting

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:44.559
is right -- the relationship they have with
the camera.

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:49.210
I'm sorry to rush it, but there was a slight
misunderstanding over timing.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.049
If I'm not back in the city by 3:00, my wife
will kill me.

00:24:53.049 --> 00:24:56.700
So I have to be there, but I'm so glad you
came out.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.510
I'm delighted to have met you.
And we've got 10 minutes, certainly, for some

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:11.780
questions or comments if anyone would like
to.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:18.200
Q Hello. I can just ask it.
I'm curious if you believe that stars such

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:26.799
as Bogey and Ingrid Bergman would still be
considered -- or would still have the opportunities

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:31.200
and the chance -- like, fortune -- that they
had back then, if they would still have now?

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.070
Because I know there's different acting methods
and you watch them now -- there's a certain

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:40.840
charm to their whole style of acting.
I'm curious how that would fit in with movies

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840
of today?

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.720
A I think stardom lasts a very short time
now.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.149
You know, a lot of the people I've written
about in this series, are people who had really

00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:57.630
long careers -- 30, 40-year careers nearly
 -- that is extremely hard to see in today's

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.230
light.
And I think the kids who do become famous

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.769
know it.
And they take great advantage of their fame

00:26:04.769 --> 00:26:10.450
as quickly as they can.
They cash in. It's very difficult to sustain

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:14.830
a career like that.
The other thing is, you must remember, all

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:21.409
of these people worked for studios.
They worked for the house -- for the publishing

00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:26.590
house.
And there were six writers at Warner Brothers,

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:37.049
let's say, employed full-time as screenwriters.
And one of their chief tasks would be a Bette

00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:43.330
Davis picture, or a Bogart picture.
And of course, the writers know the types

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:48.100
they're working for.
They know the kind of film Bette Davis appears

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:54.240
in where Bette challenges men as really no
one else did on the screen in those days.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:00.440
So they look for parts like that, for roles
like that.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:08.320
And then, when they start to make the film,
you go on set, and Bogart sees the photographer,

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.880
Sid Peacock, let's say, who has photographed
him six times already.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.080
In other words, he knows how you photograph
Bogart.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:26.429
So that -- the costume department knows how
you dress him, so the backup that went with

00:27:26.429 --> 00:27:32.880
the stars, the support system, which includes
people in the publicity department who knew

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.070
how to hush up certain stories, was enormously
kind to the stars.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:45.130
Because a star career, once you had undertaken
it, was a thing a studio cherished.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:53.330
They had you under contract for seven years.
Essentially, a lot of stars made most of their

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.710
films for one or two studios.
So, you cultivated them, you built them, and

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:04.320
you kept them going a long, long time.
The studios don't exist like that anymore.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:11.340
There are no long-term contracts, you know.
Every film is made up on a one-off contract.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.850
So nobody thinks of the future. Nobody really
builds careers.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:21.170
And the young people who've got something
 -- and there are plenty of young people who

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:26.250
have got talent -- they are told, "Cash in
as quickly as you can."

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:31.059
So you see careers that go up very fast, right
away.

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:35.370
And maybe then vanish after ten years, or
five years, even.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:39.710
So no, I don't think it's the same kind of
thing at all.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:45.779
Television is still kinder to stars.
It perseveres with them -- keeps them -- but

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:47.289
not the movies.

00:28:47.289 --> 00:28:55.049
Q Thank you. A much shorter question, which
I'd love for you to delve more into is, "Which

00:28:55.049 --> 00:28:56.710
is your favorite film of 2009?"

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:57.710
A 2009?

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:04.179
Q I would say this year, but there's only
been like a month, so last year.

00:29:04.179 --> 00:29:13.149
A The film I would really look forward to
seeing again was the Coen Brothers', "A Serious

00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:18.649
Man."
I thought that was so funny, and I loved it.

00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:23.320
I'm not sure it's intended to be as funny
as I thought it was. [laughter]

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.860
I loved it. Loved that one very much.
Yes, sir.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.120
Q Just following up on one of your comments
from your previous question.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:34.150
It's true that there are fewer careers nowadays
where you can star -- we can point to those

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:40.250
people of the last, even 30 years who have
built up very strong careers.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:46.320
Two that come to mind are like, Christopher
Walken, Michael Caine who have been in the

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.770
film industry for ages.
So I guess my question is, from this perspective

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:53.460
that stars last for less time, does that mean
that people can't be?

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:58.730
A Michael Caine and Christopher Walken, if
they were here, and I've talked to both of

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:08.039
them -- would tell you, "I'm a character actor.
I've lasted because I play supporting parts."

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:12.360
Now, occasionally, they have played leading
parts -- it's true -- and I don't wish to

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:17.259
disparage their ability at all.
But they really have survived as long as they

00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:21.159
have, because they play supporting parts.
The supporting actor is a quite different

00:30:21.159 --> 00:30:22.159
phenomenon.

00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:23.330
Q Okay.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:28.009
A They earn far less, obviously.
And they probably go on forever, all their

00:30:28.009 --> 00:30:33.289
lives.
Yes, yes. And we have a very rich crop of

00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:40.370
them at the moment.
Yeah, yeah. Johnny Depp is a star.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:46.809
Johnny Depp made a film last year, Public
Enemies -- hugely promoted when it came out.

00:30:46.809 --> 00:30:54.450
Not being talked about in the Oscars at all.
Johnny Depp is a star who's not -- he's never

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:59.940
found that one, big, knockout picture that
will make him forever.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.940
He may find it; he may not, I don't know.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:08.379
Q The other actor I can think around perhaps
is Robert Downey Jr. whose career sort of

00:31:08.379 --> 00:31:09.379
survived a seven-year hiatus.

00:31:09.379 --> 00:31:11.740
A Robert Downey Jr. is a very interesting
figure, yeah.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.820
Q So, I don't know if you can really state
any other careers that could possibly be?

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:21.559
A I think he's a character actor in the end.
But he's a very smart, interesting guy who

00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:25.850
married very well.
He was making a great mess of his life, and

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:31.090
I don't know whether you saw him on the Golden
Globes, but that woman who is next to him,

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.460
she has revised his career totally.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.029
Q Very good. Thank you.

00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:44.101
Q I don't want to keep listing actors for
the remaining five minutes, but since no one

00:31:44.101 --> 00:31:48.860
has a question, along the same line, I would
think of Harrison Ford or Sean Connery or

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.860
Denzel Washington.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:57.760
A I think they are all stars -- I would agree.
I mean, you know, clearly they -- all except

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.909
Denzel -- have faded away now.
Connery has become a veteran.

00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:07.049
He's nearly retired.
Harrison Ford talks about being retired.

00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:13.200
Harrison Ford -- there was a period in his
life -- ended about 15 years ago, I'd say

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.539
 -- where he probably had made more money
 -- his films had grossed more money -- than

00:32:16.539 --> 00:32:22.470
any other actor who's ever been.
And he was an authentic star. Connery was

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:26.029
a great star too.
And James Bond made Connery.

00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:27.389
There would not have been anything but for
that I think.

00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:28.389
Yeah.

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:37.700
Q This is falling out pretty much on part
of the answer to your first question about

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:38.970
the differences because we don't have the
studio system anymore.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:46.240
And one of the things you also said was that
stars themselves don't really have much sense

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.111
of what it is that is their thing that could
carry them on.

00:32:49.111 --> 00:32:55.879
But are those actors more responsible for
their own careers these days, or is that not

00:32:55.879 --> 00:32:57.389
true?

00:32:57.389 --> 00:33:05.950
A Oh, absolutely. Once upon a time, actors
were told what parts to play by the studio.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:12.659
In the Bette Davis story I've told, she went
to London to break her contract.

00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:17.440
And Warner Brothers took her to court in London,
and she had to come back.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:25.559
And she had to fulfill her contract.
And she was like many stars of that period;

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:30.129
she had no option about what she did.
She searched for material herself and recommended

00:33:30.129 --> 00:33:33.679
it to the studio, but there was no guarantee
that they would do that.

00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:41.559
Nowadays, every star has a little entourage
of people who read material for them and advise

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:47.159
them and suggest what they do.
And that entourage has to be paid for out

00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:51.549
of the star's salary.
It's a big reason why stars get as much money

00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:55.529
as they do.
And generally -- I've been in on some of those

00:33:55.529 --> 00:34:02.250
conversations -- generally, the advice the
entourage give is appalling, you know, really

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.990
appalling.
And stars are not, on the whole, very good

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.990
at choosing.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:12.910
Q So does that mean we should expect there
to be fewer, or?

00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:13.910
A Yes.

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:14.910
Q It's more chancy -- more calculated?

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:18.150
A There's still thousands of people who want
to get into the movies.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:24.470
And they are ready to replace everyone.
You know, someone looks as if they've got

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:32.580
a great career ahead of them.
The only actress in America in modern times

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:40.230
who has really gone beyond youthfulness -- and
the end line for youthfulness, ladies, I hate

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:48.560
to tell you this -- it used to be forty -- the
only one who's done it is Meryl Streep.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.120
And if you saw Meryl Streep on the Golden
Globes, you saw her confession about what

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:59.000
a hard life it is being her, you know.
Now, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Barbara

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.420
Stanwyck, once upon a time, many others -- went
way beyond that.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.610
Very hard to do it today.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:13.170
Q Is it possible that part of the replacing
of actors -- stars -- is done by directors

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.170
becoming stars?

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.460
A Yes.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:21.840
Q It's a time where directors are really perhaps
like taking?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.940
A Directors are the stars.
And directors love to make stars.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:33.820
So that, for instance, if you're a director
 -- here's an option -- you've got a part.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.500
Little uncertain about how all the women is
in the film.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:49.910
Let's suppose the choice comes down to Nicole
Kidman, who wants 15 million for it.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:55.400
And you can just about come out 15 million
still.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:02.990
Or this kid you saw doing a play at Yale will
do it.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:10.210
She'd do it for nothing.
It has a huge effect on the economy of pictures.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:14.250
That's why you get so many newcomers coming
into the movies.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.300
They're more malleable. They'll do as they're
told.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:23.750
And they're giving you a gift on the budget
straightaway that is enormously important.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.530
So yes.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.890
Q But they are increasing the risk as well.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:31.880
A I'm not sure they are.
I'm not sure, for instance, that the public

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.210
hasn't seen Nicole Kidman and what she has
done to her face enough.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:44.340
And if the young woman they've got is beautiful
enough, and she's good enough, and there's

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:49.110
a load of talent around, you know.
I'm not sure that that's not the best way

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.460
to go.
So I think you're going to see kids, you know,

00:36:52.460 --> 00:37:01.270
I mean, the young woman who's in on education
 -- Carey Mulligan, who will certainly be

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:07.110
up for the Oscar -- a film worth seeing if
you haven't seen it.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:12.430
She probably did that film for, I don't know,
20,000 pounds maybe.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:21.100
Well, if you're trying to set up a movie,
that is a huge advantage.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:27.680
So that's always going to count.
Can we make this the last question?

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:34.720
Q So, your personal opinion -- given this
great change in the landscape of the industry

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.020
 -- has that affected the quality of movies?
Have they gotten better or worse or are they

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.020
just different?

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:44.850
A It's affected the nature of movies.
I'm a critic, and I'm 68.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:49.770
So I can easily fall back on the things which
says, "Well, they don't make them the way

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:53.150
they used to."
They don't, but they don't intend to.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:57.110
They're making a different kind of movie.
I don't like Avatar.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:04.540
It doesn't matter that I don't like it; millions
of people adore it.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:09.200
That may be mysterious to me.
And for me, in my position, it's worth trying

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:18.980
to work out why they like it.
I think we're going into a future where less

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:23.870
and less of the movies being made in America
are the kind of movies I'm going to like.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:29.510
On the other hand, a lot of the movies being
made in independent America, and being made

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:36.400
in Europe, and being made in Africa and Asia,
I like more and more.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:41.200
And if you are a filmgoer, this is getting
to be a pretty exciting time.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:47.210
But you need to know which writers of film
to read to sort of get your recommendations,

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:50.820
because there's an awful lot of films coming
in.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:59.610
I think the Great Age of American film -- Hollywood,
in other words -- is over.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:03.430
American television, at the moment, is amply
replacing it.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:07.940
American television is having a Golden Age.
Enjoy that while you can, you know.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:18.690
And hunt down some of the rarer films that
are out there.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:19.910
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
