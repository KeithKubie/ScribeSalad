00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to the first unit of Online Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I will be teaching you the very, very basics today.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is Unit 1 of Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Welcome.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The purpose of this class is twofold:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Number 1, to teach you the very basics of artificial intelligence

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so you'll be able to talk to people in the field

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and understand the basic tools of the trade;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and also, very importantly, to excite you about the field.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I have been in the field of artificial intelligence for about 20 years,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and it's been truly rewarding.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So I want you to participate in the beauty and the excitement of AI

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so you can become a professional who gets the same reward

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and excitement out of this field as I do.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The basic structure of this class involves videos

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
in which Peter or I will teach you something new,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
then also quizzes, which we will ask you about your ability to answer AI questions,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and finally, answer videos in which we tell you what the right answer would have been

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
for the quiz that you might have falsely or incorrectly answered before.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This will all be reiterated, and every so often you get a homework assignment,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
also in the form of quizzes.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And then we also have video exams.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000
An AI program is called wetware, a formula, or an intelligent agent.

00:01:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Pick the one that fits best.
