&gt;&gt; Jonah Hill: Hi.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.000
I am Jonah Hill and I am shooting this video
for the promotional tour of Moneyball.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.370
I will be doing an exclusive interview right
here on YouTube and I want to get questions

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.880
from you so I can answer them during the chat.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.370
Anything you are dying to know about me, well
here's your chance to ask.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.350
Send me a question or video right here at
youtube.com/atgoogletalks.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.089
And while you are there you can vote on the
questions that you most want to hear me answer.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.409
You have until the end of the day on Thursday,
September 15th to ask.

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.359
So what are you waiting for?

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.610
I am clearly reading this off a sheet of paper;
I am not going to deny that because I am lazy

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.860
and forgot to memorize it.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:43.100
So remember, tune into the live show at 4pm
pacific on Friday at youtube.com/atgoogletalks.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.100
I am reading off a sheet of paper.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.210
Good bye.
