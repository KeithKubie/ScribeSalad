00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
Imagine you wake up one morning, and you're
under a tree, and you don't recognize anything.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.300
You're surrounded by low, grassy hills. It's raining a bit and smells like waffles and potatoes.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.800
As you rub the sleep from your eyes, you notice a woman, and she's like "Qu'est-ce que tu fais dans la pluie?"

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.640
and you're like "What? Where am I? Was that French? Did I fall asleep in my house and wake up in France?"

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.820
Then another guy walks up, and he's got a mustache that, frankly, not a lot of other guys could pull off,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.500
and he's like "Wa zijde gij hier nu feitelijk aant doen in die regen?" And that was clearly not French.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.289
And then a little kid comes up with an umbrella,
and says "Wat doe je hier buiten in de regen?"

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.329
Okay... Do you know where you are?
Give up? Belgium.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.409
And you know what's an awful lot like unexpectedly
waking up in Belgium with a bunch of people

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.389
speaking several different languages you don't
understand? Chemistry.

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:59.009
[Theme Music]

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.149
Maybe more than any other scientific discipline,
chemistry has its own language.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.869
Not jargon, though it has that too,

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.960
but a whole system of speaking and writing
that's unique to the study of chemicals,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.560
a way of translating symbols and numbers of
chemical formulas into words that can be spoken.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.780
Chemistrian, if you want to call it that (and
I do), can be tough to learn at first,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.140
but it can be done, once you know the rules.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.470
And of course, as with all languages, fluency
really only comes with lots of use,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.440
so I don't expect you to walk out of this
video spouting off about three-keto-two-carboxy-arabinitol,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.380
but I do want to get you off on the right
foot.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.420
So, talking about chemistry can sometimes
be like describing a rainy day in Belgium.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.980
I mean, all three of those people in the beginning
of the video, they were saying the same thing.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.000
They just used different sets of rules to
describe it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.840
The woman using French, the kid, Dutch, and the guy with the 'stache, a Dutch dialect called Flemish.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.270
So the trick is knowing which rules to apply
where,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.130
and fortunately for Chemistrian, there's a
kind of phrasebook, the Periodic Table.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.130
Just as there are parts of Belgium where different
dialects are spoken,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.430
the rules for describing an element can change
depending on where in the table it is.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.800
This is especially the case with the things that we're going to be talking about today: ions and acids.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.940
These rules apply not only to their formulas, that is, the chemical symbols that we use in equations,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.180
but also to their names, how we write and
say them.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.150
Let's start off with ions.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.540
Atoms become ions by gaining or losing electrons,
giving them a positive or negative charge.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.280
Ions that have lost electrons, and therefore
take on a positive charge, are cations.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.040
Whereas ones that gain electrons to become
negative are anions.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.280
You'll notice, despite the rules of English, that
these are pronounced "cat-ions" and "ann-ions",

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.459
not "cayshuns" and "aniuns"

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.599
The most basic ions, called monatomic ions,
are formed from single atoms.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.389
To write one as a formula, you just use the
chemical symbol of its base element

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.200
and then add the charge as a superscript.
That's it.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.800
If the charge is just of a single electron lost or gained, you don't need to write the one,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.079
but any charge greater than that requires
a number.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.109
So the sodium ion is written like this, while
the ion of chlorine looks like this.

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.609
But the names of these ions change somewhat
depending on whether they are cations or anions.

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.799
Cations, for some reason, the name is just
the element followed by the word "ion".

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.040
So, in this case, it's just a "sodium ion".

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.829
But with anions, you use a special suffix,
"ide".

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.749
So, the anion of chlorine is chloride, and
is written so.

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:26.509
Now, when we name ionic compounds, we just
say the cation first, and the anion second.

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:27.680
You've done this.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.200
You just maybe didn't know you were doing it.
"Sodium chloride", "hydrogen sulfide", easy peasy.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.840
Now in order to figure out what's what, we have to rely on our handy phrasebook, the Periodic Table.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.389
The first two columns on the left are your
alkali metals, and your alkaline earth metals.

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.409
They all form ions readily when they react
with non-metals,

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.510
and when they do, they always lose electrons,
forming cations.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.700
On the other side of the table, you'll find most of the common anion-forming elements grouped together,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.260
particularly your halogens, along with oxygen,
sulfur, and nitrogen.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.000
These elements gain electrons to form those
negative ions ending with "ide".

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.580
And you've no doubt heard of most of them.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.650
But here's a wrinkle. Many elements can form
more than one kind of ion.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.959
Iron, for example, in the middle there, forms cations, but they can have a charge of either two or three.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.939
This is the case for many of the transition
metals in these middle columns of the table.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.640
They're grouped together precisely they have
these properties in common.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.220
Everything's where it is for a reason people,
that's the beauty of it.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.480
But it's in this middle region of your language map where really unique dialects start to crop up,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.139
changing how ions are named and written.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.669
The formulas for ions here are, thankfully,
as easy as anywhere else,

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.830
with the size and polarity of the ion's charge
written as a superscript.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.169
But when naming these ions, we introduce a
whole new naming convention,

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.139
and by new, I mean really, really old.
Roman numerals.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.880
Yeah, Roman numerals still have a practical application beyond telling you which Star Wars movie you're watching.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.729
In this case, when saying or writing the name
of a transition metal ion,

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.700
you use Roman numerals to denote the size
of the ion's charge, like Iron II or Iron III,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.139
and you write it this way whether the ion's
in a compound or by itself.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.680
Just be sure to put the numerals in parentheses with no space between the cation and the first parenthesis,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.860
because trust me, teachers will mark off for
that.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.140
OK, so I know what you're probably thinking
right now:

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.600
Why, in the name of Pliny the Elder, do we have to use Roman numerals like a bunch of Romans?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.699
Well, check it out:

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.040
Arabic numerals are already being used to denote how many atoms of an element there are in a molecule,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.520
the molecule's charge, its oxidation state,
the number of molecules reacting in an equation.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.449
We didn't need more Arabic numerals!

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.259
So the chemistrians decided to trundle out
the Romans.

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.849
Now, acids are ionic compounds just like any
other,

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.689
but when they ionize, their hydrogen ions,
just lone protons, become the cation,

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.800
and any negatively charged leftover is the
anion.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.780
So all acids are made up of one or more hydrogen
cations bound to an anion.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.180
Writing the formula of an acid is easy if
you know what the anion is.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.860
Because ClO3 is negative one charge, you can tell that it will bond with just one hydrogen ion to form HClO3. Simple.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.680
Now, when we name these acids and anions,
we have to kind of watch our mouths,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.020
because in the realm of chemistria, there's
a whole system of prefixes and suffixes that

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.449
you have to keep track of to make sure you're
addressing everyone by the proper title.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:14.919
Y'know, you don't want to offend anyone.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.519
Once you've acquired an ear for it, though,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.040
you can tell just from the name of an acid
or it's anion what its composition is,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.770
because these prefixes and suffixes practically
give you the formula.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.500
Specifically, they tell you how many oxygen
atoms it has.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.110
That's right, even though an acid is defined
by its ability to give up hydrogen ions,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.670
it is identified by it's oxygen content.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.300
Eh, when in chemistria.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.620
Let's go back to that ClO3 minus. You might
know that as the chlorate ion.

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.470
That's chlorate, with an "-ate". Not a number
8. A-T-E.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.170
Like we said, chlorate bonds with a hydrogen ion to form HClO3 which is called chloric acid.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.500
That's chloric with an I-C.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.420
As a rule, all anions that end in "-ate" form
acids that end with "-ic".

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.620
Phosphate ion has a three charge, so it bonds
with three hydrogen ions to form phosphoric acid.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.439
Similarly, the sulfate ion needs just two hydrogen ions to form sulfuric acid. You get the idea.

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:13.229
These compounds, the "-ic" acids and their
"-ate" anions, are really common and familiar,

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:17.020
so much so that they form kind of a baseline
for the language of acids.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.150
Chlorine, hydrogen, and oxygen can combine
to make chloric acid,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.520
but they can form way more other similar acids.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.860
And all these variations are named using a
special, super-explicit set of prefixes and suffixes

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.720
that tell you whether they have more oxygen atoms or less oxygen atoms than the baseline compounds.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.400
And by how many.
Take HClO2.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.560
Because we know that the cation is H plus,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.080
we can immediately see that the anion is ClO2
minus, which we know as the chlorite ion.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.689
In addition, we can see that HClO2 has one
less oxygen atom than HClO3.

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:57.930
The "-ous" suffix means "less than" and thus
gives us our name, chlorous acid for HClO2.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.789
So the chlorite ion forms chlorous (with an
"-ous") acid.

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:07.419
And indeed, all atoms that end in "-ite" form
acids that end in "-ous". O-U-S.

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:11.139
But what if it has two fewer oxygen atoms
than it's "-ic" counterpart?

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.320
For both the acid and its anion, you simply
use the suffixes I just mentioned, "-ous" and "-ite",

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.600
but then additionally, you add a prefix.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.780
It's from the Greek for "less than" or "under":
"hypo-".

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:29.039
So, HClO is hypochlorous acid, and likewise,
it's anion, ClO minus, is hypochlorite.

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:32.539
But there are still a couple of scenarios
that we haven't considered yet.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.740
Like, what if an acid has one more oxygen
than the "-ic" version?

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:41.520
In that case, you use a different prefix,
using "per-", Latin for "very" or "thoroughly".

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.920
Sounds like it'd be fun to find some uses
for that "per-". Let's do it.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:51.300
There's perplexed, like very plexed. Pervaded,
thoroughly invaded. Perfect, very... fect.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.160
I had to look it up. It's from the Latin for
"to complete".

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.769
So "perfect" is to complete something thoroughly.
I like it.

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:03.940
So the "per-" prefix is just a way of saying
"thoroughly oxygenated", completely, in fact.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.079
If you see the "per-" prefix, that's the highest
number of oxygens that can get on there.

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:14.060
So HClO4 is perchloric acid and it dissociates
into an anion called perchlorate.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.310
And what if, brace yourself, the acid doesn't
contain any oxygen at all?

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.820
Remember, hydrogen is the key player in acids, so even though oxygen is common, it's by no means required.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:29.160
When a hydrogen bonds with chlorine to form an acid, since there's no oxygen it's just called hydrochloric acid,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.820
and it's anion follows the same rules for
anions we talked about at the very beginning,

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.110
ending in "-ide", in this case, chloride.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.329
Now, considering what just happened to you
here,

00:09:37.329 --> 00:09:42.369
there's a 99% chance that you're now more confused than you would be if you woke up in a drizzly Belgian meadow.

00:09:42.369 --> 00:09:45.880
So, if that's the case, get a pencil and get
ready to pause the video.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.240
Now, copy this table down. It's all you need
to know.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.980
Be familiar with the "-ate" ions and the "-ic"
acids

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.200
and then simply cobble on the appropriate prefixes and suffixes based on the number of oxygen atoms present.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.440
It might not be as fanciful as waking up in
a Belgian meadow, but it is enlightening.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.140
Just look at all the stuff we learned, like how to determine the formulas and names of mono-atomic ions,

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.600
how to find cation and anion forming elements
on the Periodic Table,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:16.290
how to write the formulas and name transition
metals, and how to name acids and their anions.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.199
