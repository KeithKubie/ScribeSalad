00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:01.507
- [Instructor] So let's say you're running

00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:04.504
some kind of company and
you guys produce widgets.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:08.369
You produce some little trinket
that people enjoy buying

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.313
and the main costs that
you have are labor,

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:16.480
the workers that you have
creating these and steel.

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:19.804
And let's just say that your labor costs

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:22.387
are $20 per hour, $20 each hour

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.733
and then your steel costs are $2,000.

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:31.275
Keep the numbers kind of
related to each other.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:33.775
$2,000 for every ton of steel.

00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:37.277
And then you've had your
analysts work a little bit

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:38.940
on trying to model the
revenues you can make

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.056
with your widgets as a function of

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:43.400
hours of labor and tons of steel.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.790
Now let's say the revenue model
that they've come up with.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.153
The revenue as a function
of hours of labor

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:51.820
and then S for steel, let's say,

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:57.141
is equal to about 100
times the hours of labor

00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.817
to the power of 2/3 multiplied by

00:00:59.817 --> 00:01:04.137
the tons of steel to the power of 1/3.

00:01:04.137 --> 00:01:05.573
If you put in a given amount of labor

00:01:05.573 --> 00:01:08.213
and a given amount of steel,
this is about how much money

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:10.274
you're gonna expect to earn.

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:12.146
And of course you wanna
earn as much as you can

00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:13.461
plus you actually have
a budget for how much

00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:15.455
you're able to spend on all these things.

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:17.705
And your budget is $20,000.

00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:25.367
You're willing to spend $20,000

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:27.355
and you wanna make as
much money as you can,

00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:30.057
according to this model based on that.

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:32.366
Now this is exactly the kind of problem

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.910
that the Lagrange multiplier
technique is made for.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.055
We're trying to maximize
some kind of function

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.583
and we have a constraint.

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:41.156
Now right now the constraint
isn't written as a formula,

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:43.438
but we can pretty easily
write as a formula.

00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:45.292
Because what makes up our budget?

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:46.481
Well, it's gonna be the number of

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.129
hours of labor multiplied by 20,

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:51.712
so that's gonna be $20 per hour

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:55.427
multiplied by the number
of hours you put in

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:58.260
plus $2000 per tons of steel times

00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:02.867
the tons of steel that you put in.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.784
So the constraint is basically that

00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:10.305
you have to have these guys equal $20,000.

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:11.495
I mean you could say less than,

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:13.657
you could say you're not willing
to go any more than that,

00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:15.883
but intuitively and in reality,

00:02:15.883 --> 00:02:17.257
it's gonna be the case that in order

00:02:17.257 --> 00:02:19.437
to maximize your revenues, you
should squeeze every dollar

00:02:19.437 --> 00:02:22.690
that you have available and
actually hit this constraint.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.928
So this right here is the
constraint of our problem.

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:26.810
And let's go ahead and
give this guy a name,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.387
the function that we're
dealing with a name.

00:02:29.387 --> 00:02:33.554
And I'm gonna call it g of h,
s, which is gonna be that guy.

00:02:35.638 --> 00:02:37.563
And now if you'll remember
in the last few videos,

00:02:37.563 --> 00:02:39.769
the way we visualize something like this,

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.206
is to think about the set
of all possible input,

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:47.819
so in this case, you might be
thinking about the h s plane,

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.843
the number of hours of labor on one axis,

00:02:49.843 --> 00:02:52.028
the number of tons of steel on another.

00:02:52.028 --> 00:02:53.765
And this constraint, well, in this case,

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:56.265
it's a linear function, so this
constraint is gonna give us

00:02:56.265 --> 00:03:00.519
some kind of line that tells
us which pairs of s and h

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.229
are gonna achieve that constraint.

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.367
And then the revenue function that

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:06.311
we're dealing with will
have certain contours.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.506
Maybe revenues of $10,000 have

00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:11.308
a certain contour that looks like this

00:03:11.308 --> 00:03:13.706
and revenues of $100,000
have a certain contour

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:14.641
that looks like this.

00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:16.573
But what we want is to find which value

00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:20.140
is barely touching the constraint curve.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.174
Just tangent to it at a given point

00:03:22.174 --> 00:03:23.888
cause that's gonna be the contour line,

00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:26.422
where if you up the value
by just a little bit,

00:03:26.422 --> 00:03:28.302
it would no longer
intersect with that curve,

00:03:28.302 --> 00:03:29.508
there would no longer be values

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:33.560
of h and s that satisfy this constraint.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.918
And the way to think about
finding that tangency

00:03:35.918 --> 00:03:39.631
is to consider the vector perpendicular

00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:41.835
to the tangent line to
the curve at that point,

00:03:41.835 --> 00:03:44.552
which fortunately is
represented by... (mumbles)

00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:46.682
Make some room for myself here.

00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:51.589
Represented by the gradient,
the gradient of our r function,

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:54.214
the function whose contour's
this is, the revenue.

00:03:54.214 --> 00:03:55.658
And what it means for this to be

00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:57.413
tangent to the constraint line

00:03:57.413 --> 00:04:01.181
is that there's gonna be another vector,

00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:05.204
the gradient of g, of
our constraint function,

00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:06.802
that points in the same direction,

00:04:06.802 --> 00:04:08.088
that's proportional to that.

00:04:08.088 --> 00:04:09.561
And typically the way you write this

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:13.036
is to say that the
gradient of this function

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:16.036
is proportional to the gradient of g

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:21.313
and this proportionality constant

00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:24.329
is called our Lagrange multiplier.

00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:27.329
It's called the Lagrange multiplier.

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.569
So, let's go ahead and
start working it out.

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.497
Let's first compute the gradient of r.

00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:42.236
So the gradient of r is gonna
be the partial derivative of r

00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:44.829
with respect to its first
variable, which is h,

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:47.054
so partial derivative with respect to h.

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:49.788
And the second component
is its partial derivative

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:53.955
with respect to that second
variable, s, with respect to s.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.478
And in this case, that
first partial derivative,

00:05:00.478 --> 00:05:03.217
if we treat h as a variable
and s as a constant,

00:05:03.217 --> 00:05:05.211
then that 2/3 gets brought down,

00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:09.378
so that'll be 100 times 2/3
times h to the power of,

00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:14.920
well, we've gotta subtract one from 2/3

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.576
when we bring it down, so
that'll be negative 1/3

00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:21.743
multiplied by s to the 1/3.

00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:24.713
And then the second component here,

00:05:24.713 --> 00:05:26.899
the partial derivative with respect to s,

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:29.211
is gonna be 100 times, well now,

00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:30.851
by treating s as the variable,

00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:34.304
we take down that 1/3, so that's 1/3,

00:05:34.304 --> 00:05:36.713
h to the 2/3 just looks like a constant

00:05:36.713 --> 00:05:39.439
as far as s is concerned
and then we take s

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:43.606
to the 1/3 minus 1, which is negative 2/3.

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.486
Great, so that's the gradient of R.

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:51.214
And now we need the gradient of g.

00:05:51.214 --> 00:05:53.050
And that one's a lot easier, actually,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.972
cause g is just a linear function.

00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:57.805
So when we take the gradient of g,

00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:01.509
which is its partial derivative,

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.852
with respect to h, partial
h, and its partial derivative

00:06:05.852 --> 00:06:08.269
with respect to s, partial s.

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:13.017
Well, the partial with
respect to h is just 20.

00:06:13.017 --> 00:06:15.451
The function looks like
20 times h plus something

00:06:15.451 --> 00:06:19.547
that's a constant so
that ends up being 20.

00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:21.108
And then the partial with respect to s,

00:06:21.108 --> 00:06:24.371
likewise is just 2,000,
cause it's just some constant

00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:26.795
multiplied by s plus
a bunch of other stuff

00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:28.531
that looks like constants.

00:06:28.531 --> 00:06:30.742
So that's great, and this means

00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:34.125
when we set the gradient of
r equal to the gradient of g,

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:36.627
the pair of equations that we get,

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:38.362
here let me just write it all out again,

00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:42.529
is we have this top one,
which I'll call 200/3 times,

00:06:43.992 --> 00:06:45.418
and let's go ahead and
do a little simplifying

00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:46.904
while I'm rewriting things here.

00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:51.071
So h to the 1/3 is really one
over, h to the negative 1/3,

00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:57.176
sorry, is one over h to the
1/3, that's s to the 1/3.

00:06:57.176 --> 00:06:58.807
So all of this, that first component,

00:06:58.807 --> 00:07:00.949
is being set equal to the first component

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:04.199
of the gradient of g, which is 20

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.024
times lambda, times this
Lagrange multiplier,

00:07:07.024 --> 00:07:08.916
cause we're not setting the
gradients equal to each other,

00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:11.510
we're just setting them
proportional to each other.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.360
So that's the first equation
and then the second one,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.784
I'll go ahead and do some simplifying

00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:16.603
while I rewrite that one also.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:20.770
That's gonna be 100/3
and then h to the 2/3

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:25.774
so times h to the 2/3
divided by s to the 2/3

00:07:27.084 --> 00:07:28.918
cause s to the negative 2/3 is the same

00:07:28.918 --> 00:07:31.262
as 1 over s to the 2/3.

00:07:31.262 --> 00:07:34.845
All of that is equal
to 2,000 times lambda.

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:39.876
And the important thing
it's that same lambda,

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:43.385
because the entire vector
has to be proportional.

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:45.161
And I think right here's
probably a pretty good point

00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:46.405
to stop and in the next video,

00:07:46.405 --> 00:07:47.470
I'll go ahead and work through the details

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.573
and we'll land on a solution.
