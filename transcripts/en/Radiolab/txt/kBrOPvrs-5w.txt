Speaker 1:          00:00          You're listening to radiolab, I'm Jad Abumrad, this is Radiolab and I am Robert Krulwich and let's begin today with something deceptively familiar. Fireflies are something that we all been of those kids, right? Catching them in the backyard, putting them in a jar and watching them glow so we don't tend to think of them as anything. All that mysterious. Well, they do one thing very nicely, which is flash on and off. That's all fireflies do flash, but what interests Steve Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell University is that there are places in the world in not here, but in in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia or Thailand, where fireflies don't just flash randomly like we're used to. They somehow flashed together. There are enormous congregations of fireflies along riverbanks. How many, it could be tens of thousands, tree after tree extending for literally miles along the rivers, all flashing in sync like a Christmas tree rows and rows of Christmas trees all wired together going off and it's one of the most hypnotic and spellbinding spectacles in nature because you have to keep in mind it is absolutely silent. I can picture it. There's a riverbank in Thailand, in the remote part of the jungle. You're in a canoe slipping down the river. There's no sound of anything, maybe the occasional, you know, exotic jungle bird or something and you're looking and you just see route with thousands of Mites on and then off, all in sync.

Speaker 2:          01:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:36          imagine all the cheese as far as you can see are all brilliantly lit and then totally dark, brilliantly lit, total darkness, all of them in sync. Yeah, and no Wessler had ever seen this site. There was folklore, there's the stories about it, but nobody had gone in and photographed and captured samples. Well not until 1965 and this was done by John Bark. John Bark, the see one of the great researchers or his other records. I'm 92 buck and his wife Elizabeth, mass buck went to Thailand and captured bags full of mail. Firefly catched. We checked them, shaking the branches, firefly rained out and brought them back to their hotel room and we turned off the lights. We turned them loose and saw that the fireflies flittered around on the walls and ceiling flew back and forth flashing random. He Elizabeth layer on the floor of the room. I was just tired. John stayed away and he was the one who saw within a few minutes little groups duos and trios formed and after a while fourth one would join in a closer, closer together. Then finally they were synchronized. The whole room was blinking in perfect harmony. He was excited. The next they

Speaker 1:          03:00          told me outlet. 20 years later John Buck is still asking this question, Oh what is going on? Because no one knows. There are literally 10 theories. What seems to be clear, so Steve is there is no one firefly that makes it all happen. It just happens on its own order, materializes out of nothing and that hasn't puzzled how can order come out of out of disorder and this is what the creation has loved to talk about and it's because they don't understand and neither do we this, this is the big, big mystery of science. I think bigger than plaque holes are bigger than super strings. I mean, science has had hundreds of years of success since the time of Galileo and Newton from reductionism, from looking at the smallest parts, whether they're jeans or Adam's, whatever. That's great. We need to understand the individuals, but that's not enough. Obviously we're not just talking about fireflies anymore. Today on Radiolab, we will do as Steve Urges and step away from the individual to find mystery, beauty and order in the group, not fireflies. They are groups of city dwellers. Groups have Internet, surfers, stock traders, even the group of neurons that are inside your head. This is a science called emergence. So let's begin. In the beginning, God created

Speaker 4:          04:16          heaven and earth. That's the King James Bible. That's how it starts. The ultimate expression of the boss, God telling everything else what to be, how to be. It's a top down kind of

Speaker 1:          04:29          what about midway through the Bible contains another passage, more of a bottom up thing from King Solomon, the wisest of the kings where he says, look to the ants. Consider her ways and be wise. Yes.

Speaker 4:          04:42          So we start in California, the office of an ant expert. I'm Deborah Gordon, professor of biology at Stanford. Hi Deborah Gordon has been studying ants for over two decades. It's because such mindless individuals collectively can do so much that I'm interested in. His might say she's the reigning ant Queen as long as you bring up the reigning part. When we went there I thought, well what's, she has a lot of answers but I wanted to see what the Boston looked like so she led us to our lab and going into the secret and place where we found to our disappointment that she keeps the ants and big Tupperware container. This is the foraging area of a colony that's stuck living in the lab instead of out in the desert where it would probably rather be and plastic box with plastic around it and little bits of sand on it. That's right and so I'm going to take off the top. Maybe we can see the queen better, but like this, I've never seen it before. When I'm looking for the clean one. What am I looking for? Just the ant and the center of the biggest crunch of other hand. Well, usually there are a lot of other ants around her. She doesn't look much different, but she's bigger. Does the ants know that she's special?

Speaker 4:          05:58          I think the ants know that she's the queen.

Speaker 5:          06:02          Okay,

Speaker 4:          06:03          and does it, what does that mean? Well, the queen in the way we think about clicks. Yeah. I mean that they know grows mommy or not even? I don't think so. No.

Speaker 5:          06:14          Uh,

Speaker 4:          06:14          I don't think they know anybody. Has Anybody. And remember she's not in charge. She's not telling anybody what to do. Wait a second. Wait a second. Yeah. This is different than I had actually imagined. I thought that Queens gave command. Like, you know an Alice in wonderland.

Speaker 2:          06:31          Bob, what? Bare hands kind of thing,

Speaker 4:          06:34          da. She says no, she's just a big hand that lays the eggs. That's it. That's it.

Speaker 6:          06:39          Every year there's a meeting flight and all of the colonies send out their virgin queens who have wings and nails who also have wings and they all go to one place and they gather and they meet and the newly mated queens fly off and start new colonies. That's how it starts. Queen scanner make babies, but that's all

Speaker 4:          06:57          they do. They're just the colonies, ovaries. They don't sit on a throne and decree anything nor are their generals or even bosses. The colony somehow gets by without any of that, which is especially hard to believe when you watch these ants. Ooh, tell us what's happening here. This is [inaudible] carrying a dead hat. I remember there was this one little EDBD and carrying a big fat dead and on her back and look at this. She seems to be gradually, although with some difficulty living twice my elbow. Then she dropped it. Then she picked it up again and she dropped it. You that up again. Now she's turning in the other direction. All the while carrying this heavy corpse. She made like it back and forth like that for hours sometimes can leave some objects we'll get in there that they can't all carry and they can spend months tagging it one way and tagging it the other way.

Speaker 4:          07:48          Month tugging back and forth on either side of one seed. It wasn't a seed, it was a little twig. One of them is thinking this way and I was thinking, oh, this way, going this way, this way. And that's all that's going on. Well, I don't know what they're thinking. Right. I know. I know that a fan, one of them is pulling one way because the stick feels like something that needs to be pulled and the other also feels right. The stick needs to be pulled and they just pull. It must be frustrating watching these mindless exchanges. It is. It can be very frustrating. I don't have very much empathy for apps. They're so, um, the more you watch the ants, the more weird it seems, the way they never get discouraged. They don't care if they do something well. Um, it's very alien. I think she hates them. Not really because here's the thing. You can make an argument that,

Speaker 2:          08:45          so the most successful species on the planet, they thrive in places that are too hot for us to dry for us. Even too cold for us. They outnumber us by a factor, many thousand in pure evolutionary math terms. They're winning, which intrigues her

Speaker 4:          09:04          and also forces you to think about them differently. I think about what the colony is doing and then I tried to think how it would work. If you do it like that, she says answer actually amazing, but you have to ignore the individual individually. They're totally incompetent and keep your focus big as colonies. They do great things. It's kind of a constant whiplash, zoom in stupid two and spoil a twig back and forth for months. You zoom out smart. I'm impressed that it works at all. It's somewhere between the zooming in and zooming out and bizarre intelligence appears almost like a phantom. I think the most intelligent thing I've ever seen harvester ants do is to build a little turret around the opening of the nest, just as the summer monsoons are gathering and then when it rains and floods, it's raised up so that the water doesn't go in. So when I see the first few ads coming out with their little twigs and I look up in the sky and I see a few clouds in the distance and I realized that there's some link between the change in the barometric pressure or something, and it really is a very tidy and effective little construction.

Speaker 3:          10:07          And what else do ans do? Well, let me just count them for you. Shall I? Aunts farm, they have livestock, aunts make garden pants, organize wars, have genitals and soldiers and things take slaves. There's the young man's tunnel involved. Incredibly good and sophisticated climate control. You can start from two opposite directions and meet precisely midway answer engineered hats, orchestrate massive public work projects that puts FTRs new deal. I'm talking about Tennessee Valley Authority from your homes. Hey, that's as nothing compared to what hands could do. Alright.

Speaker 2:          10:47          Hello, which raises the question at the center of this program, which is how do so many very stupid creatures with no boss add up to be so smart?

Speaker 3:          10:57          The scientist who first really tackled this idea with some success in the mid 1950s was e o Wilson from Harvard University because he made one of the great discoveries in all the science of communication. Certainly we know that creatures make noises to each other, sometimes touch each other, but he figured out pheromones. Pheromones are the key to understand the communication of the vast majority of animals species. We didn't know it then. It's a neat story. He told me that a few years back up at 92nd street y in New York City. One day I shut out, I was

Speaker 7:          11:27          culturing fire ranch then in the laboratory at Harvard and I said, I'm going to get to the bottom of this. And the way I did it was to, uh, dissect these tiny, tiny, it's very difficult to do, but I just checked them. And under magnification I can see that it's sticking out, sting and dragging the Stinger. Something's coming out of that sting. Kind of like a fountain pen or something's too bit like that. Yeah. Yeah. So a I proceed to, um, believe me, folks, this was the way science because I mean it really is simple minded. It's only later when you're doing the technical paper, you know, when you're producing the mathematical models and that it looks tough. It's really, this is the way you're thinking when you're doing shots. So I said, I'm going to find out what the organs are inside this. And so what I did was to do anatomy and then, uh, you know, just the sect that I knew approximately what the different glands were in showing you snipped off the part where the glands were you suited or while you just distract open.

Speaker 7:          12:32          Oh, you opened it. Right. You know, and, and just the way you would any animal alerts exceedingly difficult when it's about the size of greater salt. That's the tough part. But anyway, I took out the various organs one after the other and I made a preparation and I made an artificial trail, smeared out one Oregon after another no effect. Oh, so their aunts over here and you're drawing lines, right? Oh, gut stuff. I guess basically what it is, Yo Justin or different organs. I've watched each one in churn and then smeared it out and finally I came to a little finger shaped organ, which we didn't know. The function of it is just a tiny little thing talk down there and I mirrored that out and incredible. It wasn't, I didn't have to tell them to follow that trail. They exploded out of the nest running along that thing. I started playing around with this. It was sure effective for demonstrations. I would write my name,

Speaker 8:          13:32          a column of 102 hundred three a hundred ads would come pouring out back and forth and they'd actually write my name and I am

Speaker 4:          13:48          so that was the first clue. Smell. Ants may not take orders from above, but they can exchange information. See this one with the abdomen bent under? Yeah. That one is somehow reacted to us. Oh really strange smells that we're making that could Deborah Gordon's lab. As we watch the colony, one of the aunts even stopped what it was doing to smell us. When they wave their antennae in the air, they're looking around because their antennae or their periscopes sounds simple enough. Ants follow scent trails sorta like dogs. But if you stare at them long enough, you will see that when these ants get together, lots of them, these simple sniffing talents, they have add up to solve pretty amazing problems. Here's a forage or coming back. What's it in her mouth? It's a seed like this. Suppose there are a bunch of forged your ANZ in one part of town and something good to eat in another part of town. Like if there's a picnic, how does the colony get more ants to your picnic? They're blind and virtually brainless. So how do they do it? That's the question. How they do it. Hello,

Speaker 1:          14:52          I'm ABCDF G with that question in mind. We visited up Princeton biologist, Ian Kusan. This one here? Yeah. What is this? Now you pops open his laptop to show us a beautiful map he's made. So here on the on the screen you can see the individual paths coded by color and ant map. It's as if you gave a few hundred aunts a paintbrush and then let them wander over on canvas. On the computer has software which tracks the motion of each of these individuals. The resulting picture is vintage Jackson Pollock, lots and lots and lots of layers of squiggly lines so you can put the food in here. For example, I've got droplets of sugar water here that the ans love the feed on the end points to a splotch of white in the upper right hand corner. Then flips in the next image jumping forward in time. What what I've actually shown with this is that the ants have begun forming a chemical trail and you can actually show how they've laid a trail to this, this, this good food source.

Speaker 9:          15:45          This is the type of image that makes you want to stare at static on your TV screen and look for patterns. It's downright eerie. One minute the screen is a mass chaos of squiggles overlapping no patterns at all. The next is if by magic the squiggles of snap together to form a vein leading directly to the sugar. It happens every time. And what's weirder says Ian is every time it happens, it happens by accident error. Really. I mean this is really what we're talking about is these ants probably just made a mistake. Error is architecture. Imagine 500 answer, exploring a space number 411 finds the sugar completely by accident except it's not an accident because the aunt has left a sent trail in there. 500 other answers, surely one other will come along and make the same mistake. Suddenly you've got two chemical trails on top of each other, double e hot tracking a third which makes the trail triple hot, attracting five more, which makes it [inaudible] hot and soon what you've got as a blazing pheromone highway of bumper to bumper and

Speaker 5:          16:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         16:50          none. I'm like mid town during rush hour.

Speaker 5:          16:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         16:56          when I first saw the ants, uh, in person, one of the first thoughts I had was this looks like a small little city. Steven Johnson noticed this connection and wrote about it in a book called emergence. The connected lives of ants, brains, cities and software. A lot of what the ants do is positive feedback loops where they lay down a kind of pheromone chemical signal to recruit other ants to do something that they're working on and those ants lay down more of the same signal can. So very quickly you can get a whole bunch of ants working on a single problem. That's the similar effect that you get in a way that city neighborhoods form accidents that always happen. That is how ants find food and he says how cities find their shape. It gets to what I said was called the swirl

Speaker 5:          17:41          that comes with this

Speaker 10:         17:45          gun. When you're walking down the sidewalk going from point x to point y, you're going from subway back to your house

Speaker 11:         17:50          and you pass by completely accidentally point Z, which is a new boutique or a new restaurant, something that catches your eye and you swerve. You see this thing you've never seen before and you're like, hey, I want to check that out. The whole business in a sense of sidewalks and thriving urban centers revolves around the idea that somebody coming to see boutique a is going to be swerving into Boutique B or Boutique c just because they're near each other and because they're kind of window shopping.

Speaker 3:          18:16          What a neat idea. Yeah. Right? You wake up thinking, well, here's what I'm going to do in the city. I'm going to walk my daughter to school. I'm going to go to the new standard by a paper, and then on your way, something that you didn't expect, something new catches your eye. Begonias I will always want that. And Sally, that's the big Onia she wants, right? So you swerve, which begins as an accident,

Speaker 11:         18:37          but all these kind of local unplanned decisions all add up into this larger macro unit that does have a distinct personality and that crucially can

Speaker 3:          18:44          last for hundreds of years, which does make you wonder because the personalities of cities, we know about that. You know how come there are distinct neighborhoods for rich people? There are neighborhoods in some cities for artists, slums. Consider a 28th street in [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         18:59          today in the flower market we have hydrangeas and uh, some flowers from Florida. How many flowers, doors are on this block? If I had to guess, I'd probably say about 25 there are flower stores all around. It's like a Walmart for flowers in a week. How did this begin? Let's propose that someone for some reason came here and set up the flower shop, which picked up a few customers. So then a second flower merchant. Since he's getting the traffic, maybe if I opened a store, like the head of he is on the block, maybe I'll be able to pull some people away from him having swerve into my store. Location, location, location, and let's say that gets more traffic. You've got to be with the traffic, so then you get the third store. That works too. You could sell pencils that look like ducks and nothing else, and if you're writing them all time square, you know what?

Speaker 10:         19:46          You'll probably make money. That's the key. Traffic is everything. Once a neighborhood becomes the place for duck shape pencils or the place for flowers, what began as an accident then becomes a neighborhood. So much. So if I blindfolded a flower salesman and dropped him onto a hundred blocks, would he know which one was 28th street? Oh, absolutely. Yes. Shit. Why have I just died now my street man, I just smelled the flower. Highest Sense. You just build the highest as soon as you walk in there. I mean, of course I, I've, ah, it's all under the heading. Trucks. Rephrase, screaming, yelling. I mean please.

Speaker 11:         20:23          It's a quasi mystical concept. I really do think of it when you think about a neighborhood in a great city, whether it's New York and the West village or Paris in the Latin quarter of the middle class, you know, ask the question like, who created this neighborhood, right? Who created the things we love about this neighborhood? Who creates that kind of life force? And the answer is everybody and nobody at the same time.

Speaker 12:         20:44          Okay. [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          20:48          so that brings us again to the central mystery of this hour. We're studying here. The science of emergence, which asks where does organization come from? How do you get a neighborhood, a district or a city? How do you get the complexity of an ant colony if there's no leader and everyone in town is stupid? Steve, Steve Johnson proposes that a city is the emergent quality of the swerve to series of accidents, you know is always going to happen. You multiply the swerves, you get a neighborhood.

Speaker 4:          21:18          Debra Gordon is arguing that if you look very closely at the aunts and you watch them smelling and you multiply their smells, then you get the complexity of an IED colony but buried in the system. Both of them say is a rule, a sense of direction, but how do you see that? That's the wrong question and that's what's so uncomfortable. The instructions aren't anywhere. The instructions come out of the way that the colony lives and behaves. That's hard. It is hard. If you had one aunt on its own, you couldn't take it apart and find the substance that would make it behave in a certain way. Did you see how hard that is? Yes. I want to know. So when you asked her to find the rule, yeah. So when you did any individually, you see it when all the ants get together, but where is it? Well, where is the thought in your brain? Is it in a neuron? Does each neuron have a little piece of the thought? If you took your neuron out and lay it on the table, could you see the little tiny bit of the thought that's in that neuron? No, it's not in the neuron. It's in the way the neurons interact with each other.

Speaker 12:         22:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          22:31          think about a syrup painting. That one where they're all on the banks of the Cen River. Yep. You're the one, if you look at it up close, all you see is dots, right? You pull back and the picture emerges with all the ladies in their parents' cells. But the question with these systems, the big question is whether there is a syrup to make the dots, the paint, the picture, or if somehow the painting just materializes on its own.

Speaker 4:          22:55          Uh, well, you know, that I have an opinion about this, but it's not a, it's not a sciencey opinion. Uh, I think it's not just fascinating that there are these hidden patterns and hidden rules. I think it's just going to change the whole tone. I think it's kind of holy and I don't have to go scientific evidence because there's no science behind this. It's just an instinct. I think when you look at the way ants work or the way it's shot painting images before your eyes, you're looking at an author,

Speaker 9:          23:28          see, see, when you say that, all the air just gets let out of the balloon. For me, it's like the magic is gone. We

Speaker 4:          23:35          really can. I think so. Let's see what you're left with. Then everything that you see when you wake up in the morning is beautiful and we all agree that it's beautiful. Is Empty of purpose.

Speaker 9:          23:46          Is that okay with you? Yeah. In a way it makes it even more mysterious to be alive in any case, author or not. There's really good reason why these systems would not centralize, put all their eggs into one basket, one supreme being. Because if they did, they'd be vulnerable. Case in point, this story from producer Laura Star Chesky,

Speaker 1:          24:10          I'll walk you over toward the beehives, not about ants. So we're sort of in their flight zone, but don't worry bees and we'll just see if we have any luck here. She met up recently with a beekeeper named John Clayton. It's always hit and miss trying to find a queen, that's for sure.

Speaker 5:          24:28          She's right there. Get off me. Thank you.

Speaker 13:         24:35          One of the things that beekeepers really like to do is raise their own queens. All you need to do is take a frame out of an existing hive that has egg cells on it and a bunch of worker bees and put it in its very own box and they'll realize that they don't have a queen and they'll pull an egg or pull larva and start feeding it. The Royal Jelly make the peanut shape Queen Cell and 16 days later you got a brand new queen. Well, one time I uh, I made a brand new, Kwame was my first queen. I was probably 17 years old at the time and I had it out on my back porch and I knew it come day three, she goes out to mate. So I'm sitting there and here it sure enough comes to queen out the entrance and she flies off and she takes off and, and I'm watching and I'm watching the whole meeting process take place and it takes place in flight.

Speaker 13:         25:25          She made a inflight with about 10 drones and the drones die after mating. They come crash into the ground dying and the queen goes back to the hive. And while she started coming back to the hive and then I realized I had a piece of sticky fly tape hanging up on the back porch and she flew right into it and there's my queen all stuck to the fly tape like this, you know, I said there's my first queen and I killed the poor thing cause there was nothing I could do to save it. Yeah, it was just a horrible story. So it's one of those things you learn from experience, you know, but it was a sad moment because they a queens a special thing.

Speaker 5:          26:03          Just gonna chat there.

Speaker 1:          26:05          Thanks to producer Laura Starecheski and beekeeper, John Clayton coming up the science of how a trillion leaderless neurons in your head come together and music fashion to sing the song of the thought you are thinking right now, which if you're a caffeine addict like me, just might be

Speaker 5:          26:29          [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          26:29          I'm Janet, I'm Ron Robert Krulwich and I will continue in a moment.

Speaker 2:          26:34          All right, now your new assignments are, who's going to be read anyway? Who's going

Speaker 1:          26:44          to be round?

Speaker 14:         26:45          Hi, this is Steve Stroke at radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation and the National Science Foundation. Radiolab is produced by Wny C and distributed by MPR and this message,

Speaker 1:          27:03          this is Radiolab. I'm chat up with rod here with Robert Krulwich. Say Hello. Thank you. This hour we're trying on a way of looking at the world that has nothing to do with presidents or queens or mayors and everything to do with ants and sciences is an idea called emergence. How many, many stupid things can add up to something very smart like a colony or in our case a city. Now speaking of us, it is often and was often assumed that leaderless snus is a bad thing, a very dangerous thing. And this was especially the case in the late 19th century, early 20th which is our next stop. It was a time when throughout Europe hostile irrational crowds were everywhere in the streets. You really see this enormous backlash in large part in reaction to the rise of democracy. This is James Scher Wiki author of the book, the wisdom of crowds and he's talking about the people on the other end of the riots, the intellectual elite. Look at people like Thomas Carlisle who started the Bon of France. Nicha obviously for all these people, crowds were really the epitome of irrationality and stupidity

Speaker 12:         28:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         28:07          but that was about to change and he tells this story of a guy named Sir Francis Galton. Yeah, I'm sure Francis Gordon, who is this sort of famous British scientist and is actually a most famous cause. He was the founder of what we now know as eugenics. Oh, is that so, yeah. He's sort of a notorious elitist and a, what's funny is that this is a story about him finding the opposite of, of his basic assumptions. A to be true story goes on a nice fall day in 1906 Sir Francis Galton, a guy who truly believed that only the better classes should be allowed to vote rule or even have children. He decides to spend the day in the country.

Speaker 16:         28:43          Ladies and gentlemen, step right this way. [inaudible] county fair right over here. Now, this is going to be quite an experience for you young man.

Speaker 15:         28:52          The thing that caught Golden's attention that day was a competition involving and ox.

Speaker 16:         28:57          I mean, they're, they're on this way. You might want to avoid that unfortunate plot right there. I didn't like. Yeah. Know. What I want you to do, please, is I want you to examine this very fat ox [inaudible] touch the OP. What we do is we look at the ox and we weigh it in our mind. [inaudible] you know, the group was, was was a really diverse crowd. Family members, local merchants, most of whom were not experts at all in Wayne Oxen, young lady. You know how to weigh a package, don't you think you can weigh a package? Then you can weigh an ox. Here's how you do it. You take a, I don't know, a couple of packages and put them in your head and say, well, this ox seems to be about 70 packages to multiply the weight of a package by side.

Speaker 15:         29:44          They paid six pants and they would, you know, make their guests in the people that had the best guesses, woodwind prizes,

Speaker 16:         29:49          large cash prize.

Speaker 15:         29:52          So quite a few people. Yes, there's something like 800 people close to 800 and while none of those 800 or so people guessed the exact weight of the ox prizes were awarded, people went home. But the ever inquisitive, Sir Francis Hung around after the contest was over.

Speaker 16:         30:06          Excuse me, golden went up to the organizers. Wow. Would you mind [inaudible] who said, can I have the guesses if I take possession of all 787 ticket? You know the slips they had written the guesses on. Oh, right. You can have in, I suppose I don't see anything wrong with that, but why? Because I'm wondering something

Speaker 15:         30:24          Caesar. Francis figured these common people wouldn't have a clue. Most of them were overwhelmingly uninformed and an expert in bovine matters and he just assumed that if you added up a lot of uninformed on expert individual opinions, you'd get a very uninformed, an expert group opinion. That's what he was counting on. One of the things he did was he just calculated the average gap. That is the mid point, the me of all the guesses. He figured they'd be way off, but when he did that, it turned out that collectively the citizens of Plymouth said the ox weighed 1,187 pounds, 101,187 pounds, hope a cure, which was

Speaker 4:          31:09          astonishingly close. A oxys actual weight was 1,188 pounds.

Speaker 15:         31:16          They're a pound off. They were basically perfect and they were actually better than any single individual in the group. Colton was stunned. This went against everything he knew to be true, but you have to give him credit because he didn't publish the results. He was, you know, curious enough to acknowledge possibilities

Speaker 4:          31:38          that this experience that uh, they've gotten had. We went up to a lot of dumb people and collectively they somehow were smarter as a group than any one of them. [inaudible] is an experience that has been experimentally tested over and over and over. So it, liberal arts colleges all over the United States, professional liberal arts college because that's where these kinds of things happen. A science professor never happens. A vocational school is just that. It's, I'm being a Snob at schools everywhere. A science professor, a psychology professor usually puts a bowl of jelly beans in front of the room and says, how many people here can you just guess the number of Jellybeans? And over and over and over again. No one in the room gets the exact number, but everyone in the room at the mean comes closest. Somehow the group is smarter than even the smartest kids in the class. And according to James or Wiki, this is not just a history lesson, but that it actually is, is something you can see at work and a lot of other places and can be used to solve much more complex problems,

Speaker 10:         32:41          much more complex problems. Well, let's just take one example. The Internet, if you go back and read a lot of the discussion on the Internet from 1995 to 1998 it was totally dominated by people saying, yeah, the Internet's neat, but you can never find anything and nobody says that anymore. I mean, it's just a problem that Google just completely solved. It's an amazing thing. Just a few members, Steven Johnson, author of the Book Emergence, and here I argues that exact same mysterious crowds smarts that was president of the ox guessing contest is what allowed Google to become such a great search engine almost overnight. So what Google decided wanted

Speaker 11:         33:19          to do was to solve the problem of organizing the web in a bottom up rather than a top down approach. And what Google said was anytime somebody decides to link to a page, we're going to count that as a vote, as a positive endorsement of the page that they're linking to. So this, this is like a little democracy. So it's a little democracy. Exactly. And so what they said is pages that have a lot of people pointing to them are going to be more highly valued in the Google kind of system or algorithm than pages and nobody points to. So if some guy has a blog, which, which is really great and, and a ton of other people linked to him, he gets in essence what you're saying, a lot of votes. He wins the election, he went to votes and they added a second layer to it, which is that when that guy points to somebody else, his link is more valuable than your average Schmoe's because a lot of people point to him.

Speaker 11:         34:09          So he has more kind of googled juice. When you think about the way that city neighborhoods form, you ask the question, where does city neighborhoods come from? And the answer is, you know, well everybody and nobody at the same time as kind of creating this. When you search for something on Google and you get a list of results, that is often really, really good because Google gives these great results. Ask Yourself, who decided that this result? Here is number one in this result is number two. Well, the answer is everybody and nobody. It's nobody on staff at Google. You know Google isn't deciding that this is the premier site for. If you search for Steven Johnson and this is the second best site, if you searched for Steven Johnson, collectively all the people who are offering documents on the web have decided that this is the best site by choosing to link or not link.

Speaker 11:         34:51          Basically the intelligence of Google is an emergent property of all of these local decisions to link, none of which were made until recently with the intent of influencing Google. Now what's happened recently is that people have started to try and trick it was my next question to me. You can manipulate, you can manipulate it, so I actually have this experience. This is one of the most annoying things it's happened to me in the last year and it's ironic because it comes out of precisely the thing that I celebrated and championed and I've been an advocate for him for the last five years. Um, I have a website that a lot of people link to and thus I have a disproportionate power over Google here. When I point something, they will jump up in a, yeah. Have you seen this in practical tools? Absolutely. Well, one way you can tell is that for a stretch of time, if you searched Google for Stephen, I was the number one result.

Speaker 11:         35:41          Just Steven just evolved the Stevens in the middle of the Stevenson, the world of the Steven Spielberg's is Stephen Kings. I was the number one Stephen, and obviously on some level Google is wrong in thinking that I have the number one Stephen in the world. I mean, I like to think very highly of myself, but I'm not the most important Stephen in the world, but it's because I have a website that a lot of other bloggers and people in the kind of Internet community point to. Well maybe you are number nine, Steve. According to Google, I'm no longer Irish. I've dropped to number five or six, which has been a great tragedy in my life. Who's number one now? Uh, I think it, last I looked at was this, I think he's a country music star. Like Steven Curtis Chapman. Yeah, I'm still up there. So you know, it's all right. But anyway, so because I have this power with Google on my website, there's an open comment area where anybody can come and post a thought in response to something that I had posted.

Speaker 11:         36:29          And about a year ago people started posting these random kind of nonsense posts that would have a link in at pointing off to some, you know, free Viagra site or to a porn site or to, you know, kind of get a mortgage, you know? So it was a coattails thing. This guy's good. So I'm going to get on his coattails. Exactly, and initially I was like, look, I don't have that many people coming here that it makes sense to advertise in my comments area, but I finally realized that they weren't trying to attract the people who were hanging out at my site. They were trying to attract Google. They were talking purely to Google's automated kind of searching. They were saying, look, Google will see this as an endorsement from Steven Johnson pointing to this free gambling site and see this is what separates us from the ants right here, is that we're aware that this is a colon.

Speaker 11:         37:13          Yes, you can step out and play the system because people are smart and they have this ability to kind of reflect on this system that they're a part of. We're able to advance faster, but you also have cheats and spoilers. We'll destroy the system. And I eventually, you know, this is this tragic thing, but I had to, I had basically to shut down these conversation areas that I had on my site because because he spent, I would get literally a hundred of these spam posts in a day and a lot of them were really obscene. So it was like, you know, my mother would come to my side and be like, what are you doing? What is going on?

Speaker 15:         37:51          Steven Johnson is the author of the book emergence as well as mind wide open and he's working on a new one, which will be out soon about how everything that's bad for you is actually good for you. So it is no surprise that he is currently number four, Steven on Google binds, Steven Spielberg, Steven Soderbergh, Stephen King, but ahead of this guy

Speaker 5:          38:11          to the Massey and die.

Speaker 11:         38:19          This is Steven Curtis Chapman. So from a crowd, even a pretty dumb crowd can emerge magically. Beautiful complexity. And this after all was the great insight of Adam Smith wealth of nations seven no, you don't have to sell me. In 1776

Speaker 4:          38:36          he wrote a book in which you propose that there's an invisible hand when everybody wants to buy something and everybody else wants to sell something. Somehow it all comes together in a perfect balance. Down 30 to 40 speaking of which, my name's Ben Rubin. I'm a sound artist in New York City, and what you're about to hear is a piece I made called open outcry. We'll hear an excerpt.

Speaker 2:          38:57          Silver 44 78 crude oil, 30 53 silver, silver [inaudible] nine zero zero

Speaker 6:          39:27          sometimes I say to people, did you hear rebidding? And I know if they say, I didn't hear you, I know they're not telling me the truth because people always hear my voice. It's, it's unique and it's a strong voice too. If I'm selling October's, you know, you don't say, you say ark and you don't say the full hand. I'll just say like AUC at 10 so I'd just yell at, I get 10

Speaker 8:          39:47          oh it's 75 play by play five so 25 75 bit at 78 seven bedrock seven beds, 25 84 45 by a hundred

Speaker 17:         40:05          yeah. Listen to one person at a time. You're hearing everybody speak at the same time. It's like going to a symphony and hearing every piece of the orchestra, but yet hearing the music at the same time. And in the midst of that, you may observe, for instance, a broker that you've traded with for years. You notice face looks like when he's laughing, you know what his face looks like when he's upset about something at home and suddenly he's got a nervous look. You can tell when somebody's just bluffing. When somebody is not bluffing in this. These are all skills that are, you know, learned over time. It's really an internal gut feeling. And as far as just seeing the expression on someone's face, the way that somebody breathing, the way that somebody is leaning on someone else. I always knew when the guy behind me had a real order. Cause when he had a big, big order, he used to take my shoulder and shove it to the ground trying to hold himself.

Speaker 8:          40:52          He's too bad. These too too. So 50 decent toe [inaudible] he's too big. Nobody and a half. No, me. Five and a half, five [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          41:38          it takes the sound artists, Ben Ruben and the next big thing for letting us borrow that piece. Coming up the story of the biggest search and possibly discovery since the double helix. And it involves the same guy. I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Krulwich and I will continue in a minute. You're listening to radio lab. Keep listening. Okay.

Speaker 18:         42:00          Hey everyone, this is Matt in St Louis. Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          42:22          this is Radiolab. I'm Jab. I'm rod here with rubber crow, which this hour we're looking at the science of emergence. How the world often seems to organize itself into being without an obvious plan or a leader. Well, think about an ant colony or termites, right? I mean, they're trying to build a nest mathematician, Steve Strogatz. And if you look at any individual termite, it's just moving along and its antennas or wiggling and it's smelling fair amounts and it has no idea what it's doing. It doesn't know it's trying to build an s, it's just responding to whatever little chemical is right in front of its nose. And yet out of this, you see a coordinated group that looks like it's, you know, everybody knows what they're doing, but in fact nobody knows what they're doing. And the same thing with your brain. No cell in your 100 billion cells in your brain is having a thought. But together they are together. They're falling in love or are wanting to write music. So who's in there? Do we have any idea why this happens or how, I guess that's, that's the question.

Speaker 8:          43:22          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          43:22          and it's a really fascinating question when you really kind of pause to think about it. For example, look, I have here, you see this as my, my cup of coffee. Um, I'm looking at it and you know, it's a cup of coffee, but how does my brain know that this is a cup of coffee? It's something that's uh, in a way it's hard to even understand what the question is because this comes so naturally to us, right? We just look at something and we have this integrated perception of a cup of coffee.

Speaker 1:          43:48          Like what's the big mystery? I hear you did use all of her sacs. So you had him on the show recently. He would probably be able to talk to you in an interesting way about people for whom this does not come easily.

Speaker 3:          43:59          There is a famous case which was reported in Germany of a, uh, a woman who had lost motion perception. And there's a very nice description, for example, of her difficulty, Pauling t till that Oliver, now this woman, she takes the teapot and she starts to pour and suddenly the image just freezes. She would have stills lasting about 15 seconds. She would see a glacio. She used that term at glacio fluid coming from the teapot. Her brain was seeing something, not moving, but then her feet were getting, and then suddenly there was a puddle. They were getting wet and indeed crossing a vote. It was impossible for this woman in Germany. Dangerous. And so it's those people who help us realize the miracle of perception, right? That the, to see the world as a coherent thing is a miracle.

Speaker 19:         44:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          44:54          should we hit them at the same time? No. You can think of yourself as fireflies and you're out buzzing separate trees. Okay, so back to your miracle of the Coffee Cup. So yes, for those of us who are healthy, we do this all the time. The question however remains how I have trillions. And trillions of neurons in my head firing randomly. Every neuron that you're hearing here, just going a little, no, we can live on electrical thing and the question is how does this, which seems so rampantly disorganized, how does it resolve

Speaker 5:          45:28          the [inaudible] Cup of coffee?

Speaker 3:          45:34          Yeah, good question. Now, a few years ago, a number of neurologists trying to figure out how the idea of coffee comes to be came upon a kind of musical analogy that I'm bringing, creating a thought, creating, say a cup of coffee is kind of like a musical event. Neurons in one side of the brain and another side of the brain, I recognize them, color or shape or something, and if they vibrate together at about 40 cycles a second, if they create, say the same note in step, that synchrony is a cup of coffee, and what's happening in the brain is that there's a part of the brain responsible for the sense of smells, smell,

Speaker 20:         46:16          eh, neurons that recognize the coffee aroma or firing vigorously as they smell it. Meanwhile, they're colored detectors that happen to notice that it's a, you know, a Red Mug,

Speaker 21:         46:31          eh,

Speaker 10:         46:31          shape detectors as part of the visual system that are noticing the edge of the [inaudible]

Speaker 21:         46:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         46:39          least. What neurologists think is that it's the simultaneous firing of all of those that are looking at red and at sensing the aroma. It's the coincidence of their firing that's telling them this is one thing. This is not separate aromas and colors and shapes. This is a coffee

Speaker 3:          46:56          they'd be singing together, Huh?

Speaker 21:         46:58          The [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          47:07          a

Speaker 3:          47:14          so that is a cup of coffee and to think we do it every morning before we proceed, we should think the New York City LaGuardia composition class or neurons where my name's Harrison Hill and I'm tasting, my name is Melanie Charles. Danielle do visa boy. My name is Jonathan Chew and I am smell Jonathan Shoe. Mr Smell did the arrangements Robert Apostle conducted? No, we say wait a second here because this is interesting. Robert Apostle. Yes, their conductor told them what to do. Right. But in your head when you think of a cup of coffee, who's conducting you?

Speaker 8:          47:49          Huh?

Speaker 3:          47:50          And this is where we start getting into the, the very mystical or even most, most mysterious part of this is that who is it that's paying attention? I mean, because I mean, what is attention hut? How can you control you? I don't, I don't really even know how to talk about this, but, but there's something in you that that is, uh, that is the signal. Let's do coffee. Yeah. I mean cause it's confusing that the, what is it that brings one thing into attention and not the other? Anyway, I don't know. I'm a little out of my depth here.

Speaker 8:          48:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          48:21          somehow or other, whether we're looking at ants, cities with the Internet, wherever we look, the shape and organization of the world seems to emerge without an obvious plan. And yet there it is. And nowhere is this more mysterious and more difficult to really comprehend than in our own heads. Even right?

Speaker 22:         48:39          For scientists who work on a day after day in the lab, like this Guy Christoph Cock, I'm a professor of neuroscience and engineering at the California Institute of Technology. Chris stopcock is one of the most celebrated neurologists in the world and for him and for many others, they have a hard time getting rid of a model deep down, which says somewhere in there there's a conductor, someone is organizing the action. You made a mema. There's a movie by Woody Allen called everything you always wanted to know about sex. I do, but the way of way to ask this has great skits in it where he has um, a, a couple is petting in the back of it. Oh my God. Sydney, can't you wait? Do you want to do it right here in the parking lot? You'd see inside the boys veins is mission control, mission control. You have this NASA type control room. You have these big TV screen corresponding to the output of the eyes to eyes come in. I used to brain over and you have sort of all these white divest now for technicians running around. All systems go and we're going to get an erection in the scene that says we're trying to do. Yeah, exactly. Then you have these, uh, you know, all these Siemens that line up, they all have these little parachutes.

Speaker 22:         49:47          It's a little long tails. Scared. I don't want to go out there, but I mean the point is, so this is control of a metaphor that, that uh, you know, we can all laugh about, but a lot of people including scientists have implicitly the ideas that meet as a kissed off who sits inside meetings. I can tell you, most people can tell you it's, it's exactly between my two eyes, between here and here. And by the way, this Christopher I assume would be saying, okay sheet and this is in the movies. It okay, she likes me. Let's make the next one. That's exactly what happens. Of course in the Woody Allen movie. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          50:26          Show the points. Christopher [inaudible] is that the woody Allen Model? This idea that there's an inner command center, some conductor directing your brain that thinks is wrong. Now. Clearly there is no such person inside my head for a lot, you know, because who's sitting inside the head of this little Christoph and then who's sitting inside the head of the person sitting inside my head. You see the problem if Christopher's thinking about a cup of coffee and he gets the idea from an inner Christophe who's thinking about a cup of coffee, where did the inner Christoph get the idea? Maybe from an inner inner valve that wouldn't really solve the pong. We'll just push that one back.

Speaker 5:          51:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          51:06          these are heavy problems.

Speaker 3:          51:08          I mean, w what happens here is we're tiptoeing up the hill here to the Mount Sinai of of science.

Speaker 1:          51:15          Yeah, coffee cups in people sitting into controls. Well, these are kind of the smaller questions on the foothills to the bigger one, which is how does the mind reflect? Why does someone know who an I is? Why can you contemplate death? What is this consciousness? That's the big, if we can figure this out, whatever circuit is responsible for or circuits responsible for human consciousness. Think of what we can do. One day a doctor could walk into a patient's hospital room where the patient is laying comatose and a put a helmet on them. It's a conscious o meter, let's call it and measure how alive they are or maybe even tickle a part of their brain and make them back up. This

Speaker 3:          52:01          idea, by the way, came from one of the most famous scientists of the 20th century who worked very, very closely with Christopher Koch. Um, I'm talking about a man named Francis Crick and I, even if you know nothing about science at all, you've probably heard about the discovery of the structure of DNA, the DNA molecule by Watson and Crick. This is that crick. He was a British guy. He moved to southern California and at some point he and Christopher coke met. Now Coke was much, much younger, decades younger than the older guy, and yet they formed one of the more magical partnerships, a kind of Gilbert and Sullivan or Rogers and Hammerstein of neuroscience. And one of the ideas that crick had was that there is a way, they must be a way to figure out what consciousness is all about.

Speaker 22:         52:52          They developed this notion, there's no conscious entity inside my head that serves the whole of conductor. That's not to say that there may not be places in the brain that act akin to a conductor that sort of synchronized and that called Nate the various parts of the brain that find a penalty because one of the remarkable phenomena of conscience is everything's integrated. When I look at you and you talk, your voice comes out of your mouth. When you move, the most I perceive is attached to your head, not in the brain. All the things that analyze in different parts of the brain. So you need some sort of entity that pulls all these different networks of the brain together. Is there a place in the brain that does that well? So Francis Crick and I think so. In fact, it was a, the, the subject of his last paper that he worked on, on literally on the day he died, there's this odd structure in the brain called the to home close to means hidden away.

Speaker 22:         53:49          And it's a small area. It's sort of an elongated sheet like structure beneath the cerebral cortex. You have two of them, one on the left, one of the right. And what's remarkable about it? Indeed, this tractor receives input from almost every cortical area, the teams to be in an ideal position. If you want to go to the metaphor of synchronizing all the different activities and making sure they're all in some sort of lockstep. So Francis and you have this idea and he is very sick with cancer and he wants to get this idea down is what's calling it. Can you describe the scene there? You first had this idea 10 years ago and he talked about it in a, in his book that he published in 94. And then we never thought much more about it over the last year. We came back to this, um, this, this sort of somewhat obscure structure. So he was very, very interested in it. And Yeah, he felt his, he felt his, um,

Speaker 22:         54:42          you know, as he felt his illness coming on and getting stronger, he was very adamant about trying to finish up a manuscript. So he literally worked days and days and days. There's this beautiful photograph of his desk covered probably four inches deep, just with paper pertaining to the cloud storm. And he worked a particular over the last six weeks, um, DNI to try to finish a manuscript or to get it in reasonable shape for us to, to publish. And so he was on the day he died. He was still writing the scientist to the bitter end. Is a kind of Mozart's requiem quality to this? Yes, yes.

Speaker 5:          55:20          Yeah.

Speaker 22:         55:23          What was the last thing that you and he said to each other?

Speaker 5:          55:27          Hello,

Speaker 22:         55:28          I'll see you on thirsty. Or Friday I was supposed to visit him in the hospital to work on this manuscript. And was the manuscript completed? Uh, no, it's, I'm currently working on that. I'm editing it and then sending out and abouts send it out to friends.

Speaker 5:          55:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         55:52          because I feel a little bit exactly like, um, the student of Mozart, his names escapes and who finished his requiem. He had a student in finished spectrum and now musicologist today at deciding what is actually original Mozart and what was finished in the style of Mozart. And so I say, which aware of this and you're stuffing italics or something or something. Like on the other end, we publish 22 or 23 manuscript together and the way we always work that he wrote the first draft. It was so insistent upon that. Then I bought, you know, I edited and then he edit my edits and we integrated. Unfortunately, I can't do this anymore, so you know, I just have to edit his draft without the benefit of his feedback.

Speaker 5:          56:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          56:41          Christopher [inaudible] is a professor of neuroscience and engineering at the California Institute of Technology. His newest book is the quest for consciousness.
