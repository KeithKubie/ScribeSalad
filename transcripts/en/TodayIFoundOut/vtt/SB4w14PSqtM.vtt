00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.190
Weeds can be defined in a variety of ways:
a plant growing where it isn’t wanted, a

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.940
plant that interferes with farming or grazing,
a plant that was not intentionally sown, a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.940
plant that is persistent and detrimental to
the plants around it, among others.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.940
Basically, what it comes down to is that weeds
are plants that humans don’t want to have

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.940
around for one reason or another.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.510
In the United States, there is a federal weed
list and many states have their own weed lists,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.510
too.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.000
Some common flowers appear on the state weed
lists yet appear in gardens and flower bouquets

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
across the country.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.860
For instance, baby’s breath (Gypsophila
paniculata) is considered a noxious weed in

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.570
California, while the ox-eye daisy (Chrysanthemum
leucanthemum), your typical white daisy with

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.570
the golden centre, is considered a weed in
numerous states, including Colorado, Kansas,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.750
Ohio, and West Virginia.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.290
Some weeds are simply plants that are not
wanted in the place where they are growing,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.750
but are useful at other times.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.010
For instance, a wild raspberry plant smothering
a crop of strawberries planted by a farmer.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.690
In other areas, a weed might be an invasive
species of plant which threatens a country’s

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.750
natural flora.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.690
An example of this is broom, or Cytisus scoparius,
which grows abundantly in Scotland and is

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.530
used in ornamental landscaping, sand dune
stabilization, and wasteland reclamation.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.540
It was even used as a symbol of the Plantagenet
kings.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.030
However, in Australia, New Zealand, and parts
of North America, it is considered a pest

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.369
species and often eradicated.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.100
Sometimes weeds were considered undesirable
in the Old World before they came to the new

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.100
one.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.610
Weed seeds were unintentionally spread after
they were mixed in with seeds of other plants,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.159
like those of vegetables.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.439
Other times, farmers found weeds useful to
help other plants grow—such as sweet briar

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.909
in New Zealand, which was used to help grafted
roses grow, and then became a pest when it

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:35.909
spread.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.859
Typically, weeds also possess certain characteristics
that make them particularly irritating to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.689
the human race: they grow and spread very
quickly, which can hurt the surrounding plants

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.639
by depriving them of sunshine and nutrients
in the soil.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:51.130
Their spread can be attributed to their abundant
seed production and the hardiness of those

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.399
seeds, which can lay dormant in the soil for
long periods of time.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.459
Weeds themselves are also hardy, often able
to live in extreme conditions and in places

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:59.789
affected by human interference.

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.329
To sum it up, weeds are typically extremely
difficult to exterminate from a garden bed

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.569
entirely.

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.800
Other than acting as an invasive species in
new areas, weeds also are often considered

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.160
such as they are plants that pose a threat
to farmers and their crops.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.580
Weeds can contaminate crops, reducing crop
quality; they can host diseases which kill

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.000
the crop; shelter insects in the winter which
will then eat the crop; and they could also

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.720
produce toxins, infecting the crop with chemicals
that are dangerous for human consumption.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.580
Needless to say, farmers tend to want to keep
weeds away from their crops.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.830
They spend billions of dollars every year
on herbicides to keep weeds at bay, but even

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.570
that doesn’t stop all of them.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.390
Additional money is lost on crops that fail
or are contaminated because of weeds.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.450
Their loss in profit means higher prices at
the grocery store for the consumer.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.980
Despite all of the flaws of weeds, many do
have some benefits, too.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.150
They provide soil stabilization and nectar
for bees.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.840
They can be food for wildlife or even humans,
as well as occasionally used for medicinal

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.840
purposes.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.900
And, of course, as alluded to, weeds are big
business and many jobs are created because

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.900
of them.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.870
After all, how many fewer workers would be
needed and fewer home lawn and garden products

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:51.380
if weeds were as easy to kill as that houseplant
you’re always struggling to keep alive.
