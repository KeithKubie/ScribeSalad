00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.734
- [Voiceover] Part c.

00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:04.985
A researcher estimates
that in a certain organism,

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:09.243
the complete metabolism or
glucose produces 30 molecules

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:12.592
of ATP for each molecule of glucose.

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:16.005
The energy released from the
total oxidation of glucose

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:20.996
under standard condition is
686 kilocalories per mole.

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:24.717
The energy released from
the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP

00:00:24.717 --> 00:00:27.090
and inorganic phosphate
under standard conditions

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.723
is 7.3 kilocalories per mole.

00:00:29.723 --> 00:00:31.706
Calculate the amount of energy available

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:34.956
from the hydrolysis of 30 moles of ATP.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.347
Calculate the efficiency
of total ATP production

00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:42.596
from one mole of glucose in the organism.

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:45.067
Describe what happens to the excess energy

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:47.993
that is released from the
metabolism of glucose.

00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:49.423
All right, I'm tired of squeezing things

00:00:49.423 --> 00:00:51.212
in between the questions,
so let me go down here

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:52.641
to get some real estate.

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.106
So let's do the first part.

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:56.867
Let's calculate the
amount of energy available

00:00:56.867 --> 00:01:00.117
from the hydrolysis of 30 moles of ATP.

00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:02.783
So let me write this.

00:01:02.783 --> 00:01:03.700
Hydrolysis.

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:05.769
Hydrolysis of

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:09.401
30 moles

00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:12.587
of ATP.

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:17.864
So I'll draw this, and we've
got the title right over there.

00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:20.140
So let's just take 30 moles,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.223
30, 30 moles

00:01:22.723 --> 00:01:23.807
of ATP times,

00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:28.120
they tell us how much energy is released

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.338
when you hydrolyze that ATP per mole.

00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:34.685
They say, the energy released
from the hydrolysis of ATP,

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:35.953
let me underline that.

00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:39.399
The energy released from
the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.902
and inorganic phosphate
under standard conditions

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:44.405
is 7.3 kilocalories per mole.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.451
We have 30 moles,

00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:50.449
it's getting hyd, that
is undergoing hydrolysis,

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:53.699
and so 30 moles times 7.3 kilocalories,

00:01:56.335 --> 00:01:58.168
kilocalories per mole.

00:01:59.324 --> 00:02:01.242
And what is that going to be equal to?

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:02.997
Well the moles cancel with the moles.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:04.590
The units are going to be kilocalories,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.671
which makes sense, because
I want units of energy.

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:08.914
And what is 30 times 7.3?

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:11.580
See, three times 7.3 would be 21.9,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.790
so this is going to be 219,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.676
since this is 30 times 7.3.

00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:17.176
219 kilocalories.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:20.260
All right.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.592
Now let's do the second part.

00:02:21.592 --> 00:02:23.023
I'll do this in a different color.

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:23.856
If you're actually taking the test,

00:02:23.856 --> 00:02:26.470
you know I might get the
benefit of multiple colors,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.375
but this is for you, to help me help you

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:30.500
understand what's going on.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.101
Calculate the efficiency
of total ATP production

00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:36.518
from one mole of glucose in the organism.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.375
So I'll do that over here.

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:40.292
Efficiency.

00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:42.997
Efficiency is,

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:45.973
actually let me do it,

00:02:45.973 --> 00:02:48.801
well, efficiency is equal to

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.801
energy is going to be energy in ATP,

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.071
energy stored

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.963
in ATP,

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:02.411
over total energy,

00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:06.255
total energy from oxidation,

00:03:08.336 --> 00:03:10.170
energy from oxidation

00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:14.713
of glucose.

00:03:17.795 --> 00:03:19.292
So they say calculate the efficiency

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:21.761
of total AT production, ATP production,

00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:23.354
from one mole of glucose in the organism.

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:25.451
So this is going to be equal to.

00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:27.787
So they tell us what the energy production

00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:31.479
when you oxidize one mole of glucose.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.673
They say it is 686 kilocalories per mole.

00:03:35.673 --> 00:03:39.256
So the denominator here
is 686 kilocalories

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.240
and the numerator, the
energy stored in ATP,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.060
well, for this particular organism,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.036
it is able to produce 30 ATPs.

00:03:47.036 --> 00:03:48.742
The complete metabolism of glucose

00:03:48.742 --> 00:03:50.626
produces 30 molecules of ATP.

00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:51.958
So for every mole of glucose,

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.136
it's producing 30 moles of ATP.

00:03:54.136 --> 00:03:55.242
And so we already figured

00:03:55.242 --> 00:03:58.525
that's going to be 219 kilocalories.

00:03:58.525 --> 00:03:59.942
219 kilocalories.

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:03.760
So now we just have to do
a little bit of math here,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.733
figure out what 219 divided
by 686 is going to be.

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:10.357
Let me do it over here.

00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:12.857
686 divided by 200, oh, sorry,

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:16.590
219 divided by 686.

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:20.629
This is going to be less than zero.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:22.450
So let me go straight to, how many times

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.450
would 686 go into 2,190?

00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:31.098
Well, this is a little bit less than 700

00:04:31.098 --> 00:04:32.592
and seven times three is 21,

00:04:32.592 --> 00:04:34.255
so this looks, it's about three times.

00:04:34.255 --> 00:04:36.088
Three times six is 18.

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:40.424
Three times eight is 24 plus one is 25.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.906
Three times six is 18 plus two is 20.

00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:48.358
Let me subtract it.

00:04:48.358 --> 00:04:49.266
Let's see.

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:50.766
90 minus 58 is 32.

00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:54.088
So I have 132

00:04:55.054 --> 00:04:57.426
Then I can bring down another zero.

00:04:57.426 --> 00:04:59.378
686, well, let's see.

00:04:59.378 --> 00:05:01.494
It looks like this might
be one or two times.

00:05:01.494 --> 00:05:04.933
Let's see, two times 686 would be 1,200,

00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:06.721
this is actually going to be one time,

00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.135
by feeling, or maybe we'll
round up, it sounds like

00:05:10.135 --> 00:05:12.135
So one times 686 is 686.

00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:16.018
You subtract.

00:05:16.018 --> 00:05:20.081
All right, I will do some regrouping here.

00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:22.164
So I can make this a 10,

00:05:23.821 --> 00:05:24.738
this a one.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.493
So 10 minus six is four.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.449
Now I can make this a two and this an 11.

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.449
11 minus eight is three.

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:35.003
And then 12 minus six is six.

00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:37.003
So, 686 goes into 6,340,

00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:41.716
this is definitely going
to be more than 5 times.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.679
So if we want to approximate,
we would round up.

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:45.435
This is going to be approximate,

00:05:45.435 --> 00:05:46.572
so this going to be something else

00:05:46.572 --> 00:05:48.134
that is greater than five,

00:05:48.134 --> 00:05:50.504
so it's going to be approximately 32%.

00:05:50.504 --> 00:05:52.715
So I could write it, let me write it here.

00:05:52.715 --> 00:05:56.048
So this is approximately 32% efficiency.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.467
So roughly 32% of the potential energy,

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:03.288
or of all the energy that can be produced

00:06:03.288 --> 00:06:04.718
from the oxidation of glucose

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:07.449
actually ends up getting stored in ATP.

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.854
Now, they say describe what happens,

00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:11.805
I want this in another color for fun.

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:13.950
Describe what happens to the excess energy

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.551
that is released from the
metabolism of glucose.

00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:17.851
Yeah, what happens to,

00:06:17.851 --> 00:06:21.102
what happens to the
other 68% of the energy?

00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:23.280
So, I'll do it over here.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.791
The rest of the energy
is released as heat.

00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:28.374
The rest of energy

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.825
gets converted, or goes,

00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:34.825
is released,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.016
released as heat.

00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:45.515
And you could say it's
also released as entropy,

00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:48.538
increasing the number of
possible states of the cells,

00:06:48.538 --> 00:06:50.814
more things are bouncing
around in different ways.

00:06:50.814 --> 00:06:52.277
But this is the easiest
way to think about it,

00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:53.122
it is released as heat.

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:55.268
In general, when you think
about any thermodynamic process,

00:06:55.268 --> 00:06:56.373
if you think about the efficiency,

00:06:56.373 --> 00:06:57.617
and you think about,
well, where is all of that

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.665
lost energy that wasn't captured,

00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:01.421
it's usually going to be,

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.509
it's usually going to be heat.

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:06.915
All right, now let's do part d.

00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:07.890
Part d.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.393
The enzymes of the Krebs cycle function

00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:13.973
in the cytosol of bacteria,
but among eukaryotes,

00:07:13.973 --> 00:07:18.655
the enzymes function
mostly in the mitochondria.

00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:21.650
All right, mostly in the
mitochondria, an organelle.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.861
Pose a scientific question that connects

00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:27.664
the subcellular location of
the enzymes in the Krebs cycle

00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:31.012
to the evolution of eukaryotes.

00:07:31.012 --> 00:07:32.930
All right, well, we've talked about it,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.356
when we first talk about
mitochondria on Khan Academy,

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:40.982
but there actually is a
theory that mitochondria,

00:07:40.982 --> 00:07:43.667
or the ancestors of mitochondria,

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:47.898
might have been independent,
prokaryotic organisms.

00:07:47.898 --> 00:07:50.303
So we could say, the scientific question,

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.220
we could say, were the

00:07:54.116 --> 00:07:54.949
ancestors

00:07:57.237 --> 00:07:58.570
of mitochondria,

00:08:01.203 --> 00:08:02.203
mitochondria

00:08:03.998 --> 00:08:05.498
once independent,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.866
in-de, independent,

00:08:14.178 --> 00:08:15.178
independent,

00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:18.641
we could even say, well, prokaryotic,

00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:20.557
prokaryotic, kary-otic

00:08:23.644 --> 00:08:24.477
organisms

00:08:26.969 --> 00:08:29.130
whose descendants lived, learned,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.274
whose descendants became incorporated

00:08:31.274 --> 00:08:33.419
in euakaryotic organisms?

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.002
Whose descendants,

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.347
descendants, de,

00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:42.638
descend, descendants,

00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:46.209
whose descendants

00:08:47.653 --> 00:08:49.986
became, became incorporated,

00:08:52.854 --> 00:08:55.604
became incorporated, corp-or-ated

00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:59.328
inside eukaryotes,

00:09:02.411 --> 00:09:03.328
eukaryotes.

00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:07.710
So that's a scientific question,

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.498
and a really interesting one,

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:11.221
that, you know, if you look at any cell

00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:13.887
in the human body,
you're actually going to,

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.870
you're going to see these mitochondria,

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.658
or actually in the
great majority of cells,

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:21.201
and were their ancestors
once independent organisms

00:09:21.201 --> 00:09:23.839
that now have, whose
descendants now live in

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:25.529
symbiosis with our cells

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:29.112
because they're so good
at the Krebs cycle?
