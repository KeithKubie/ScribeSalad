And now you're done with lesson two. Woohoo. You've made

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.210
a huge step in being able to transfer data from

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.090
a server and bring it all the way down to

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.100
your device. Think about all the possibilities now of valuable information

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.050
you could bring down to users to be available at

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.560
their fingertips. And that's pretty powerful. Speaking about making an impact,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.560
have you thought about what you're going to do for your

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.540
final project yet? You can choose any topic that you want.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.570
Share your ideas in the class discussion forum, and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.686
you can share with your friends on social media too.

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:34.580
Over to beta now, while I take a quick nap

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.790
on this Done pillow. I'll see you in lesson three.
