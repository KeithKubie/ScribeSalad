WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.020
Australia to salute my brother.
A little brother.
Yeah.

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.240
Does it feel like I'm going to show time special?
I don't know.
I feel the same.

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:11.880
Little more stressed out.
Stressed out.
Yeah.
Stay away from them.

4
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:15.990
Comments on these,
the whole deal with all that stuff,
man.
He put it out.

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.280
You Watch it,
you hate it.
You get better forces.
You forces you to work.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.730
I fucking hate everything I do.
There's just no getting around it.

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.650
You're going to hate it.
You hate hearing yourself.
The editing is powerful,
man.

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.050
Delaware first,
but you'll get better.
You just take the,

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.840
some of the criticism to heart.
Understand what people were saying.
Four shares.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.800
Just a fucking keep on keeping on my brother.
I'm happy about it.
I just,

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.230
I,
I don't think I'm stressed out this week.

12
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.780
He's lasts because doing publicity for it like New York and doing all that.
Yeah.

13
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.750
I saw you did breakfast club.
Charlemagne and Charlemagne needed to get together.

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.830
You guys would be great man.
I was listening to his,
um,
his audio book.

15
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:59.500
It's very interesting.
He's had,
he's said some real bouts with anxiety.
Yeah.

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.380
Weird,
weird anxiety.
Yeah.
Where it anxiety,
right.
Shook ones,
I think.
Yeah.

17
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.100
I think it comes from talking shit.
I think when you talk a lot of Shit,

18
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:11.040
you worry about shit coming back at you and you're like,
Jesus,
what did I say?

19
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.240
At least that's how it is for me.
It depends if it's like legit,

20
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.680
like when me and Dana were going out.
Oh,
you're stressed.
Yeah.

21
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.280
I just don't want that name because it,

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.430
because it brings out like the course evilness and people,
you know,

23
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.730
everyone's like,
oh,
I hope he tears him up.
Oh,
I hope we respond in.
Yeah.

24
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:28.830
And then you're like,
oh,
I don't,
I don't really want this.

25
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.540
Do you see Gaffigan and Neil and Neil Brennan?
No.
Do no way.

26
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.890
Gaffigan lit Neal Brennan on fire.

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.160
Shit on his numbers for what?
Neil started it.
Why?

28
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:43.350
And he'll start it.
I'm going to,
I'm going to send it to Jamie.

29
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.310
I'm going to send it to Jamie.

30
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.230
I'm so in my sober October text message group and listen,
I love Neil

31
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.110
when someone gets roasted,

32
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.980
so I'm going to gets roasted and it's even better because he started it.

33
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.130
He started it for no reason.
Oh No.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

34
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.850
I tried to be Narky here.
Jamie,
I'm sending this to you right now.

35
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.640
Jim Gaffigan is a mama.
I'm a monster.
Fantastic.

36
00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:11.190
In Transylvania three Waze.
Oh,
amazing.
Oh,
I saw that man.
Hell son was hit.

37
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.870
He was van Helsing.
Oh my God.
It's amazing.
Great.
I love those movies are fun.

38
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.610
I love when my son gets into that stuff.

39
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.310
Just fucking animation today is so incredible.

40
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.300
I find myself sitting there watching the animation going,
this is amazing.

41
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.170
The shading and the,
just the detail of it.
He can get into it where it's,

42
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.300
even if it's meant for kids.
As a parent,
I'm good man.

43
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.470
To watch the despicable me's.
Oh yeah.
Great.
That's great.
Peripheries amazing.

44
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.920
All three of them are great,
but I love part three with the 80 soundtrack.

45
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.880
It's not the creative from a south park and isn't there another one with just

46
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.660
the fucking yellow dudes?
The minions.
That's good too.
That's good too.
Yeah,

47
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:47.470
I saw that one little long towards the end.

48
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:51.540
It gets a little weird when they get to London,
but very good.
Yeah,
they're good,

49
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:54.340
man.
That's so funny.
When you,
so this is the text,

50
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.860
Brennan Service.
So,
uh,
what happens is,

51
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.580
uh,
Gaffigan

52
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.090
<v 1>puts up a thing saying,
hey,
why are you looking at your phone?</v>

53
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.610
You can be watching my Netflix special.
I made them all for you.
And he says,

54
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.670
Neil says,
which one has the joke about food?
You say like a food.

55
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.190
And then you talk about it.
And I'd be over here dying.

56
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.270
And then Gavigan says Neil.
It's a special where I have three microphones.

57
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.870
One microphone is for jokes.
I pretend I can't remember that I read off a card.

58
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.600
One Mike is for emotional manipulation of the audience.

59
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.740
And one microphone is for mentioning the Chappelle show and celebrity friends.

60
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.960
Boom.
That's like,
oh,

61
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.790
that's like one of those bombs that goes off in the distance.
Did you see it?

62
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.890
And we're just like this with,
he's got a little frisky.

63
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:46.120
What app got a little frisky.
Seattle falls guy fired back.
Yep.

64
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:49.000
Sometimes this guy's fire bad.
A little vulnerable spot right there.

65
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.650
The liver was exposed.
Neil,
just bad out.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you.
Yeah.

66
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.950
You're supposed to bow out there.
You didn't do,
you fucked up.

67
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:01.630
You supposed to say ouch.
You got me herself to just joking,
man.
Yeah.
Um,

68
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.050
like sometimes one king of the Cynthia and I across each other and he's so good

69
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:09.580
at it.
Sometimes I'm just like,
I'm gonna sit out,
man.
Go ahead man.
I got nothing.

70
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.620
I've ran out of material deal.
Go ahead.
Some of the things he says are so Theo,

71
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.460
like he,
Theo is like,
there's a few guys,
Theo's one of them.

72
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:23.440
Sebastian's another one that have the like a style of comedy that you will never

73
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.690
be able to explain to someone.
They got to go see him.

74
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.980
Like you got to listen to him.

75
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.590
Isn't it so strange where most of the kinks thing podcasts is mostly me saying

76
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:34.960
something pretty average.

77
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.630
And then Theo just saying them up most outlandish thing.

78
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:40.320
You me laughing my ass off the funniest show.

79
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.200
What did you guys go back and forth at each other?
It's very funny.
So funny man.

80
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.850
Yeah.
He's in a unique dude.
Very unique dude is unique as they get,

81
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.910
he's in Australia right now.
He goes,
yeah,
he's in Australia,

82
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.050
Australian lento right now.
And he goes,
yeah,
this is this morning was,
yeah man,

83
00:04:57.051 --> 00:05:01.120
you got a qual comm.
Come to the hotel.
And I went,
Oh shit man.

84
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:05.200
Those things have chlamydia,
so make sure you wash your hands.
And he goes,
shit,

85
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.990
I have some things to,
he better wash his hand.

86
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.743
Just like

87
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.990
he better watch his hands.
Oh my God.

88
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.430
But it's legit a clause coming over to the [inaudible] hotel.

89
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.780
That's so Theo Brody was that way too.

90
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.570
Brody had the unique style too.
He's so special,
man.
That deal.

91
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.470
So special is very,
just know it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You just know it man.
I be,

92
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.980
we're asking what it's like to work with deal.
All you guys.
I said with you,

93
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.780
it's like he's the Lebron James of Cami.
So creative.

94
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.570
I'm just that shitty coach on the side trying to manage,

95
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.370
trying to manage his ball game.
Not to fuck it up,
man.
Yeah,
he's,
but he's just,

96
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.800
I mean there's other guys that are funny,

97
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.470
but they're funny in like a regular way.
Like,
oh,
he's really good.

98
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.650
His jokes are great.
Oh,
he's got a great PR presence.
He's great on stage.

99
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.680
But Theo's like,
try to explain that.
You can't explain that.

100
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:11.510
You gotta go see magical cluster of dark magic from New Orleans where he'll say

101
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:15.580
something and I'm like,
there's certain guys I can watch and I'll go,
oh,
he,

102
00:06:15.581 --> 00:06:18.290
he's definitely,
his Iq might be higher than mine,

103
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.180
but I see how he got there with this premise of the joke with Theo.
I'm like,
ah,

104
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.760
I have no idea how he got the I've,
it's not happening.

105
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.960
You know who gives me stress when I look at his schedule?
Russell Peters.
Yeah,
he,

106
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.130
this me and like,
she's all over the fucking pipeline right now.

107
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.540
He goes to Africa for like six weeks.
Like he's all,

108
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.910
you hear Michael Bisping almost got fucking robbed in Africa.

109
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.160
Did he really just doing a movie?
Fuck.

110
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:44.150
Was he doing in Africa doing a movie and spend was 19.
I don't know what it was,

111
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.820
is doing a movie.
You got a little liquored up.
Uh,

112
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:50.240
his cab dropped him off and said,
you're a,
your hotels over there.

113
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.910
He'd get out of the cab and he's like,
where are the flux?
My hotel,

114
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:55.610
the cab driver drives off and he's like looking around for the hotel is,

115
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.320
he said like 10 dudes just started rolling up on them saying,
I want your wallet.

116
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.110
You know,
if you want to live,
you'll give me your wallet.
Yeah.

117
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.520
Is this South Africa or this out?
This is like France in Ghana.
Lisa for Toria.

118
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.080
Fuck man.
So he ran and he got away obviously.
Yeah,
he got away.
Yeah.

119
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.400
But food's always gonna get caught,
right?
Yeah.
Black.

120
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.840
He's a big fella,
you know,
and not seeking this fight.

121
00:07:19.841 --> 00:07:23.240
This fellow knows how to fight and they probably could sense that a little bit,

122
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.550
but if there's 10 of them,
they usually don't probably hammered too.
Been,

123
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.040
what if it was 10 Francis in Ghana?
Oh Geez.

124
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.650
Then you're given your wallet and do just the homies.

125
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:32.730
Road trips is one Francis and Ghana.

126
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.770
What the fuck you got and do nothing and let the fuck you going to do.
Yeah,

127
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.920
I love them.

128
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.110
Bisbing Maddie hazard was telling me that when he was running he ran like 27

129
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.980
marathons in South Africa and when he went through certain sections of South

130
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.860
Africa they go stop.
You are not running through this area.

131
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.850
We're going to put you in a car.

132
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:52.520
We're going to drive you towards safe and then you're going to continue to run

133
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.750
but you will get robbed.
Like cause like there's areas where you just,

134
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:57.650
we'll get rob,

135
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.440
I have no interest in going to Africa and I was like oh it's beautiful.

136
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.170
Very cool.
I want to go you really?
Yeah.
I want to go.

137
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:07.010
I want to see what those animals look like in the wild.
I would love to see,

138
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.650
you know before we fuck Africa Up,
you've got 12 years.

139
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:14.240
They say before is everything's gone forward the way humans are fucking up the

140
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:17.690
world.
There is no going back.
If we don't make a change now.
Now it's from the,

141
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:18.930
it sounds like a Michael Jackson song

142
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.090
that's from the ending of little Dickies,
new video of saving the world.

143
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.660
But it does say it's like earth.org it's like that's a quote from them.

144
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.970
I don't think they know is.

145
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.330
See the reality is they know there's a real problem with carbon in the

146
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:38.210
environment.
They know that human beings are put carbon in the environment,

147
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.650
an unprecedented levels and they know that the earth is heating up rapidly,

148
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.880
but they don't know like what exactly is going to happen.

149
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:50.360
There's some models they predict,
none of them look good.
They don't really know.

150
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.880
But th really knows,
right?
Like some people are like ah,

151
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.310
global warming side Brielle ups.
Our president think it is.
It's real.

152
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:59.600
But if you go back to like the 1990s they were predicting shit was going to

153
00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:00.600
happen.
That never happened.

154
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.860
Same thing with the two thousands but here we are in 2019 we're,
you know,

155
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.930
we should listen to them because we're definitely fuck it up.

156
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.670
Don't be fucking up the mix either whales and stuff with like trash in the

157
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:15.510
stomach and that's hurt.
That's a giant problem.
There's also too many people,

158
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.130
but what are you going to do?
Well,
there's two schools of thought on that.

159
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:24.630
Even the schools of thought on people is what happens is as the world gets more

160
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:29.190
and more Westernized,
as people start developing careers,

161
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:32.520
people have less and less kids and that if you look at Japan and you look at

162
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.170
some westernized nations,

163
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.120
they actually have a shortage of kids and they,
they think that,

164
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.300
and this is purely speculative,
right?
It's just theoretical.

165
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.070
They think that as the world becomes more and more industrialized in Western

166
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:49.530
eyes and more technology and more advanced,

167
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.220
that people will start to have less kids.
That's a fair point.

168
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:58.200
But also even Americans,
they're having kids later and I think less as well.

169
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.040
Yeah,
that's a mic.

170
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.060
But also isn't there parts of Australia and Africa where no one's really there.

171
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:07.860
So if we had to,
we could colonize that and like make it more livable,

172
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.730
bro.
The only parts of Australia where no one lives,
no one wants to live.

173
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.630
You don't want to live in the fucking metal.
All the crocodiles are in shit,

174
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.570
but we could figure it out.
Yeah,
you could figure it out.

175
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.580
A couple of crocs field a lot of snakes everywhere.
That'll kill you.

176
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.760
I mean there's a lot of parts of Austria.
Australia is huge.

177
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.390
It's as big as the United States,
so big and that giant parts.
Africa,

178
00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:30.120
two giant parts where we could live if we had that.

179
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.800
Australia has less people than La.
No,
the whole goddamn country.

180
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.740
You've been there,
right?
Yeah.
Bunch.
I love it.
Love it.

181
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.780
[inaudible] I'm sure you've done comedy.
Yeah,
a bunch of times.
The best.
Yeah.

182
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.850
Sydney,
Melbourne and Melbourne's grade need to though.

183
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.650
I have a great time that I've been to New Zealand.
Yeah.
No,

184
00:10:47.651 --> 00:10:51.000
I've never been hurt to aim straight off of Jurassic Park.

185
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.810
Would you do their comedy?
No.
Shit.
Theater in New Zealand.
When did you do this?

186
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.130
I think like a year and a half.

187
00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:58.980
Two years ago I did a tour of Australia and that's when you would adjust

188
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:03.480
starting to,
that's crazy.
This out.
No openers came out cold.
Oh my God.

189
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:06.480
Why did you do that?
I don't crazy.
No one.
Hey Man,

190
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.080
I show a showcase on night and go to Australia and just go by yourself.

191
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.050
Then he didn't even ask.
I just sweat dude.
Here I am.
Show time session.

192
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.710
It was fun though.
Good expanses.
Oh,
they're good people.
I liked the people.

193
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.100
Everybody I met from New Zealand.
It's like very similar to Australian people.

194
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:27.200
Very down to earth.
Super Nice.
Yeah.
It's a beautiful place man.

195
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.650
Means they did the hobbit there for a fucking reason.
Yeah.
Good point.
Good food.

196
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:34.890
Good people.
Yeah.
I could,
not that I could ever leave la,

197
00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:37.760
but I could see I could live somewhere like I could live in Australia.
Me Too.

198
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.560
It's very American,
but clean and feel like.
Yeah,

199
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:42.450
but that's the driving on the wrong side of the road.

200
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:44.640
Shit like get it together folks.
We invented cars.

201
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.640
The fuck are you doing over there in the left lane.
That is strange.

202
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:51.510
Do you know where that came from?
Yeah.
No,
correct me.
Okay.
This is bro Science.

203
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.680
But when they were developing,
uh,

204
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.630
<v 0>it was the,
like the,
the wagons with the horses is Fort Sword Fighting,
right?</v>

205
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.780
Yeah.
For horses and sword fighting.
Yes.
You got it.
Yeah.

206
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.730
That's why you swing a sword with your right arm.

207
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.900
You want your right arm to be facing your opponent.
So you want,
yeah,

208
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.430
you don't want to the dude to be over here on this side,

209
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.980
reach over and try to hack does make sense.
But here's,
here's a,
here's a little,

210
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:17.890
a loophole.
Like if you want a dope ass,
like rare car,

211
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.800
you can get one with driving on the right and it's gonna be cheaper.

212
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.220
So if you want like a Ferrari f 12 TDF,
like a limited one,

213
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.420
you can save money if you get one that set up on the right because they're set

214
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:29.320
up on the right,

215
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:33.370
like an English course because they're harder to resell because there's less,

216
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:35.660
less people just throw them away.
Oh,
come on.

217
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.620
But you could just drive on the right who you're still in the doe fashion.
That,

218
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.960
can they switch it out?
Uh,
be expensive.

219
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:44.560
Probably just buy it on the other side from agile.
Like what are they gonna do?

220
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.590
Switch it out.
They'd have to change everything at debt nightmare.

221
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.760
I saw they did that to this rev ology car,
this 1965 Mustang.

222
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:54.100
They built one that was on the right hand drive and I'm looking at it,
I'm like,

223
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:56.440
this is all so screwy.
Like why would they do,

224
00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:59.830
why would people not come to an agreement on which side of the road to drive on?

225
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.490
It's very strange that you stick with it.
Yeah.
And it's different.

226
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.540
Differs from like in Europe,
it differs from country to country.
Yeah.

227
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.570
It's almost an ego thing now,
right?
Where they're like,
Nah,
fuck it.

228
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:14.260
Refuse to change.
Most of the world's on the left though,
man.
We don't care.
Well,

229
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.210
Germany makes the best cars or some of the best cars.
They're on the left Europe.

230
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:21.460
It's the best cars and they're on the left,
right?
Yeah.

231
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.220
American makes some pretty good cars,

232
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.090
but really the reality is they can't go toe to toe with Europe.
They just can't.

233
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.070
Dude,
I was a,
I was at this private car dealer and there's those,

234
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.360
uh,
Pagani says,
have you ever seen those?
Like a million dollar car,
right.

235
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.490
Some of them are,
you know,
you're looking six,
$7 million put for Donnie's.

236
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.120
There's Bugattis that,
that the,
the rear brand new Bugatti.

237
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.150
And then there's all these limited dish and Ferrari's and Lamborghini's.

238
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.270
And he goes,
oh,
Floyd bought that one.
You can sit in it though.
He won't kill you.

239
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:52.840
And Senate.

240
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.990
And there's all like carbon fiber nodes of how much is it and whatever the new

241
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:58.660
boot God is.
But there's a markup on them because they were like 20 of them.

242
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:02.440
Where the fuck it is.
And it was so expensive.
I got nervous.
I'm it.
I'm good man.

243
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.230
Here's you don't to say and what not.
I don't feel comfortable.
I'm good.

244
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.530
I just didn't feel comfortable open this thing.
I don't know.

245
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.470
I felt variable million dollars.
So yeah,

246
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.530
you could buy a car that's worth more than most people's houses.

247
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.150
99% of the world's houses.
Yeah.
99.9% of the world's house.
Yeah.

248
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.620
And you're just working that thing around and you just driving around in this

249
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:28.780
thing that you can sleep in and then most toilet,
he can't do shit and shower.

250
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:33.460
Try Fastest Shit.
Drive faster.
Shit.
25 g's.
Just changed the tires though.

251
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.370
Is it really?
Yeah.
Every year.
That's all if you're driving it,

252
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.630
but I'll sit right here.
Sorry.
Do you see how it's hurting?
Five scratching.

253
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:43.310
Go back to the beginning of that video.
Look at on your side,

254
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.240
the underside of the things Jack.
And that's all carbon fiber.

255
00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:50.920
So he scratched the fuck out of it,
man.
Yeah.
Wow.
Those cars,

256
00:14:50.921 --> 00:14:52.730
they scratch every time you hit a bump,

257
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.000
every time you go over curbs and that they're so low.
Jamie.
That's,
I mean,

258
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:58.790
that's when I have my little red car,
the Little Red Porsche.

259
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.200
Every time I leave the comedy store,
it's scrape.
It's embarrassing.
It's annoying.

260
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.990
And it's so sad.
Sad.

261
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.060
I didn't mind another days taking my dad to get ice cream and I hit the front of

262
00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:12.060
my car.
Caray ruin my night,
ruminate,
my Niggas,
it,

263
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.200
I don't give a fuck to him.
I was so disappointed.
I was sad.

264
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.480
I know it's just a car though,
right?
It is just a car.

265
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.190
It's the problem with nice things.

266
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:23.120
They've become a little velvet prisons but you got to drive him like uh,

267
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.260
the dealer I was talking to were where all these fricking dudes by these million

268
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:29.870
dollar cars.
He's like,
you know what bothers me is they don't drive them.

269
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.010
None of them drive them.
It's for them.

270
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:34.470
It's investment and then they flip in years from now he was,

271
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.190
we want people that drive the cars and now what frog is doing.

272
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:38.420
Like if you want to end though,

273
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.110
you want a certain like limited run TDF or the pizza.

274
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.210
If you want some of those real limited edition ones,

275
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.450
they look at your history cause you have to own like the past 10 Ferrari's.

276
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.170
Yeah they have a weird curriculum if you want to get a special limited edition.

277
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.330
But they now they check if you've driven it,

278
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.370
if you're just a collector they don't sell them to you anymore.
Oh my gosh.

279
00:15:57.371 --> 00:16:00.300
Certain ones they go back and look at your history cause you got to do it own

280
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.060
all the old Ferrari's to qualify to buy a Ferrari certain fries sir to take get

281
00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:07.980
on that accolation like the on the list,
let's say if you want to,

282
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.380
if you want like the new whatever the super fast,

283
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.890
the limited TDF they're going to do.
Yeah.

284
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:16.490
You have to own all the V twelves and certain ones before that.

285
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.670
That is hilarious because that just shows you how goofy people are.
Like they,

286
00:16:20.671 --> 00:16:24.230
they know that people are goofy and they know that all you have to do is like

287
00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:28.220
sneaking on them some sort of exclusive thing that nobody else can have.

288
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.220
So when you row up in it,
you look like a champ and no one else does.
Yeah.

289
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.440
Even if it sucks,
even if it's a sucky car.
No,
I like it though because some,

290
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.100
let's say some billionaire rich billionaire who daddy gave him all his money,

291
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:43.700
he can't roll into frame bike.
I'll take that.
That's kind of cool.

292
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.630
I mean now it's a little extreme with the 10 and you've got to own all the V

293
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:51.820
twelves but what do you mean that they can suck it?
You don't like it?
No,

294
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.050
because you can't.
Well,
you probably,
I don't know.

295
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.250
Who knows if I could get used though.
That's the thing you just buy using.
Yeah.

296
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.010
All right,
cool dude.
Yeah,
flux.
Get a buy it now.

297
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:04.340
She get it from him and not going to stop it.
It's like illegal streaming.

298
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.940
You guys are just dumb business people.
How about you make more cars stupid?
Well,

299
00:17:07.941 --> 00:17:10.990
no you don't.
No.
You don't want to become a Tesla Prius.
How could they say?

300
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.580
How much can they sell?
How many are they leaving on the table?

301
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.840
Think about it that way.
I don't think they care.
Right?
How many people,

302
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.710
how many people are buying Ferrari's?
Let's just take a guess.

303
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.030
Let's just say worldwide 100,000 people are buying for ours.

304
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:27.440
Maybe it'd be 200,000 maybe if they just started being twats to be 200,000

305
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.500
Ferrari's out there instead of 100,000 I don't think they want that though.

306
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.220
If everyone can have it.
You don't want it.
Right.
That's just weird,
man.

307
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.940
Girls are that way with purses.
You ever talked to girls about certain verses?

308
00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:40.610
Sure.
To get weird about purses.
So hard to get that prayer.

309
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:43.860
I'm like that with shoes though.
I don't want them to have shoes that pairs.

310
00:17:43.861 --> 00:17:45.590
You're kind of like that when you're not going to be,

311
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:48.410
you're kind of like that in my background with your custom cars,

312
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:50.190
like one of the reasons that make it really cool

313
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.990
<v 1>is you're not going to see that custom car anywhere else that is specifically</v>

314
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.560
designed by you.
That's true.
But that's not why I like it.

315
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.770
Well I like it is cause you could get something that you can't get anywhere else

316
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.400
putting on on me.
And as far as performance,
like,

317
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.360
like when I get the like a shark quirks car,
like the white car,
that car,

318
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:12.480
you can't,
it can't just get that car.
It's a six speed manual.

319
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:15.300
They don't make six speed manual gt three Rs is anymore.

320
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.130
It has a 518 horsepower engine.
You can get that.
They bought it out.

321
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:23.130
They put fatter tires in it.
They beefed up the suspension,

322
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:27.270
they changed everything for sure.
But like your resorts.
Yeah.
Okay.

323
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.190
It's pretty custom.
Can't buy those camp by him.
Right.
But honestly,
I'm for Joe.

324
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.560
That car is like,
that's a cool looking car.
Ellyette is,

325
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.130
but if you had a drive that every day,

326
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:41.010
you'd probably blow your fucking brains out unless you're one of those renegade

327
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:45.420
dudes.
Let's just start.
Lorenzo Lamas back in the day wore cowboy boots.
Dustin,

328
00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:47.760
his hair,
I feel like [inaudible] every day.

329
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.590
At the end of 2017 the total of Ferrari built and sold cars in the whole

330
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:56.730
company.
History is 109 nine thousand two hundred thousand ever.

331
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.180
You said 200,000 a year,
but your close.
Wow.
I was way off.

332
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:05.100
It's eight to 10,000 a year.
It looks like I want to just read some dope.

333
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:10.110
That's why it's so hard to get one.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's kind of cool.
Yeah.

334
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:13.650
Look,
it is definitely cool.
It's a,
it's a cool car.
I mean,

335
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:17.310
this is a reason why people want them.
They don't want shitty cars.
No,

336
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.400
they're good car.
I wouldn't mind.
They do.
There's a,

337
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:23.700
I think it's a four or maybe it's a,

338
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.850
I don't know if it's a four eight but they did make that in manual.

339
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.530
What I like too expensive.

340
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.980
What I like about like custom cars is that their mechanical,

341
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.280
like when I'm talking about like muscle cars or portions or stuff like that.

342
00:19:35.281 --> 00:19:39.680
What I like is that they're mechanical,
they're all stick shifts,

343
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.280
manual transmissions,
feel the gears and you feel the burn.
I like that.

344
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:47.520
I love that.
Yeah.
I'm that's,
I'm into that for whatever reason,

345
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.590
but I'm also into that fucking Tesla that Tesla's got me hooked.
Yeah,
for sure.

346
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.890
I think it puts a smile on my face.
I know you does it really?
Oh my God.

347
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.830
So then when you were Porsches?
Nope.
Not more.

348
00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:02.520
So it's going to lock in different smile.
Different smiles.
Yeah.
It's like wow.

349
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:06.480
The future's weird.
Yeah,
because it's just,
it doesn't make so much more capable.

350
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.650
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's not for Roche's.
Yep.
And Ferrari's ferocious.

351
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:16.260
Wow.
That noise.
The engine explosions behind your ear.

352
00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:18.520
Mid Engine car,
that's a different thing.

353
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:23.521
Like a muscle car that rumbled at fucking big Ass v eight and a fat tail pipes.

354
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.510
That's a different feel,
you know?
Completely different.
Yeah.

355
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:31.950
What'd you get from a Tesla is like,
whoa,
every other car just seems stupid.

356
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:33.750
It's like you just making a lot of noise but it just,

357
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.460
this thing just goes quicker.

358
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:40.850
It goes places it like with the Tesla does it violates what you think the laws

359
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:46.401
of driving on in terms of like how quicker car can get from there to there and

360
00:20:46.531 --> 00:20:47.440
it doesn't with no sound,

361
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.820
<v 0>there's no torque or anything.
Right.
It's just zero.</v>

362
00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:55.090
It's just said a thousand foot pounds of Toyotas and it just like it's a video

363
00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:58.820
game throws you back like the craziest roller coaster you've ever been in.
Yeah,

364
00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:03.040
because zero to 60 in 2.4 seconds you have the ludicrous one.
Yeah.
That's all.

365
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:06.360
I always leave it on.
Ludicrous.
Yeah.
I never switched off that shit way too.

366
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.510
Why would I?
Yeah.
I don't drive it.
You don't have to drive it like an asshole,

367
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.170
but when you want to,
it's right there.
It's using up more of the,
Oh yeah.

368
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.460
AIDS,
that battery kid.
If you want to drive,
what do they say?

369
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:23.260
Kids 317 miles.
Mile like grandma drive.
Yeah,

370
00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:26.230
and they're like,
daddy drives,
it gets like one seven,
three,

371
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.400
one 72 way I drive.
They were saying that,
uh,

372
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.480
people applying for a driver's license,
so she,
kids like our kids,

373
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.660
I don't know if they'd even be into cars.
Like I was talking to my dad.
I went,

374
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:41.020
how cool is it?
Like Tigers has all,
he's been on all these cool cars.

375
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.600
Hopefully he's into cars when he gets older.
And my dad's like,
yeah,

376
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:46.030
maybe if he even wants to driver license is now,

377
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:49.540
it's so low of kids passing the driver's license test because they just Uber

378
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:52.420
everywhere.
It's like,
why?
What?
Why do I pay for a car?

379
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.330
I'm just gonna do some great thing that you don't have to think about like that.

380
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.440
That does help a lot.
Like you don't think about drunk being drunk,

381
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:03.040
driving drunk,
you know,
going to someone's house after the bar.

382
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.180
It's cool to option,
but it's not cool that kids,
there's something,

383
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.900
there's some freedom about driving,
like there's a good feeling to it.

384
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.530
There's also the problem with things like Uber is you're going to get into a car

385
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:18.640
with a person that you don't know,
and I'm sure most of them are great,

386
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.193
I'm sure.

387
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.500
But every now and then you're going to get into a car with someone who's fucking

388
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:27.730
nuts and they're going to have some crazy political podcast on want to talk to

389
00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:30.850
you about Hillary Clinton's emails an option now you know that.
Yeah,

390
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.000
you can click the,
they don't talk to you.
Do you want them to talk?
No,

391
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.520
that's a new option they're doing.
They don't have to abide by it.

392
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:40.240
I don't think it's like a preference for the variety.
Like,
Hey,
by the way,

393
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:42.670
as I get in your car,
I really would prefer you.
Don't talk to me.

394
00:22:42.671 --> 00:22:44.910
But the driver is like,
you're in my car.
Fuck you up.
Yeah.

395
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.340
But most drivers you might go,
he clicked.
Don't talk if he's like,
hey,
I'd like,

396
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.780
dude,
did you see the known talk or yeah,
the move is,
hey,
you got music up there.

397
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:56.230
Can you turn it up?
Then they usually don't talk,
but there has been a thing,

398
00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:00.880
to your point where there's been people,
you know,
faking,
like duper drives,

399
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:04.630
putting the sign on.
Then murdering women.
There's that.
Yeah,
there has been that.

400
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:06.310
I heard about that recently.
Do you like,

401
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:08.260
I've been in this and I've been having terrible dreams.

402
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:11.830
I need to get off of it or just figure out how to deal with manage it better.

403
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.780
But I was doing a show on Sirius with Jim Norton and he brought in this,

404
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.840
the guy who basically created mine,
hunter.
He was this like,

405
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.530
he's interviewed all the serial killers and speaks to them and they brought him

406
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:26.980
in,
I think his name is John Douglas.
They brought him in.
He used to talking to,

407
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:29.830
it was fascinating.
I was like,
Oh shit.
So I got his book,

408
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.230
almost finished his book.
I'm like,
this is great man.

409
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.200
And then started listening to a podcast he's on,

410
00:23:35.201 --> 00:23:37.210
it's just about like murder and death.

411
00:23:37.211 --> 00:23:40.150
And I started looking up all this Charles Manson stuff that I'd been having

412
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:44.560
awful nightmares and been a little depressed.
And you know me,
I'm,
it's very rare.

413
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:47.630
I'm down.
It's just a dark fucking world man.
Yeah.

414
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:51.350
You Watch those true crime shows will fuck your head up dude and makes you

415
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:54.260
scared of everything going on.

416
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.970
It's going on in very small numbers,
very,

417
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:00.710
very small numbers.
But it is going on.

418
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.310
What it is is like people that have been abused,
people that have been fucked up,

419
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.540
psychopaths and people that have been through the correction system through,

420
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.760
through the penal system.
Yeah.

421
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.970
That's a lot of it's so dark men is not that many of them.
And this,

422
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:16.280
this guy has a three daughters and I was like,

423
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.630
how can you like keeps telling about this seven year old,
terrible story.
And uh,

424
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:23.960
I was like,
how can you go home and sleep?
He's like,
eventually,
you know,

425
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:27.200
it's just a job.
Like it does affect me a little bit.
And I'm like,

426
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:30.380
do you just lock up your kids?
Like I'd be like,
just from hearing you,

427
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:33.500
I don't want my son going to school.
I don't want,
I'm leaving.
He's like,

428
00:24:33.501 --> 00:24:35.450
now you learn to manage it.
And he did say that.
He's like that.

429
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.270
This is the exception.
Like there's some dark stuff out there,

430
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:41.120
but these gentlemen that he interviewed,
Charles Manson,

431
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.890
you've seen how he's five too,

432
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.500
and he always has to speak over you no matter what's going on.

433
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.800
So they were in this room,
there's three people and Charles Manson,

434
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.030
he got on a chair and stood over him,
shouted down to him.

435
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.260
Was he saying I didn't pry,
try and convert them into a home.

436
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.060
He people who may meet your car.
Meech man,
man,

437
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.920
I'm a product of your society,
man.
He's fucking crazy.
He was crazy.

438
00:25:06.921 --> 00:25:10.850
He had to close down.
He has a quote.
Does reading again,
I'm too into it.
Men.

439
00:25:10.851 --> 00:25:14.780
I'm quoting Charles Manson,
what's going on in my life?
Um,
he was saying that,
uh,

440
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.780
he used to be like,
you are the exception when you're crazy.

441
00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:20.560
Now everybody's crazy.
That's what Manson was like.
Yeah.

442
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.150
He's like used to be kind of cool.
The end thing to be crazy.

443
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:27.500
Now inside everybody's crazy.
Well he made it popular.
The fuck.

444
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:31.280
Do you know how popular that fucking crazy serial killer is and all his

445
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:33.380
followers?
Oh my God.
Even to this day,

446
00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:35.210
like as I was reading this article in rolling stones,

447
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:39.650
how many books and even merge and buy lots of his,

448
00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:40.700
here's 50 grand.

449
00:25:40.701 --> 00:25:44.390
It's going for 50 grand by locks of his hair and how he sells merge.

450
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.020
That's 50 grand of locks of his hair.
Yeah.
How much does a lock,

451
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.280
like what does that mean?
What does that get you?
I don't know.
Well you could.

452
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.010
I lost out on the,
I lost out on the bid.
Cut a lock in half.

453
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.620
You know what I'm saying?
Let's,
I'm going to say how many go?
Let's split it.

454
00:25:57.621 --> 00:26:01.880
Put it in his essay.
How many hairs block?
Big piece though.

455
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:05.090
What if he shaves his balls and you give like a Saran wrap Baggie of his pubes.

456
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:09.240
How much does that weigh?
100 gs piece of is probably Dick pays a hundred gs.

457
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.130
Charles Manson,
Dick piece.
He was married when he died.

458
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:16.880
Some the crazy bitches find serial killers in jail and marry them.

459
00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:19.130
Happened with Richard Ramirez,
the night stalker,

460
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.180
if there's some sexual thing too,
right?
Yeah.
They,

461
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.400
some women want to be around killers and even in particular guys have killed

462
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:32.810
women.
How?
How crazy is that?
It's very crazy.

463
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.010
Can you imagine when your daughters,
when they're,
let's say 20 to Mary's,

464
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.340
a serial killer in prison leash,
you know,
she's not gonna die but safe.

465
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.230
Look,
there's people out there.
I don't have to tell you,

466
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.040
I do a fucking terrible job of raising their kids.
You know?

467
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.100
It's one of the reasons why people like you,
people like me,

468
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:52.380
people that get into being a parent that really enjoy it.

469
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:54.570
When you see something like that,

470
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:57.870
it's even more disturbing because you know that when you see a serial killer or

471
00:26:57.871 --> 00:27:02.040
someone's fucked up,
that person was a baby that had a terrible life.

472
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.880
Like almost always.
They just got a shitty roll.
The dice,
they got bad parents.

473
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.910
It's usually the moms.
It's a relationship with the moms that fucked him up.

474
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.260
Not so much.
The father's usually them.
It's um,
the mother son relationship.

475
00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:14.100
Really?
Yeah.

476
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.900
It's usually always mother's son and that's what usually causes the whole swine

477
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.420
Norman Bates from psycho.
So,
so dead on,
right?
Yep.

478
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.960
And he's dealing with his mom and dress up like his mom's and that guy and he's

479
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:27.870
the one who literally,
he's Jeffrey Dahmer.
Charles Manson.

480
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:31.200
It when there's something go like,
uh,
he was talking about Jon Benet,
which,

481
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.850
you know,
I'm from Denver,
went to school in Boulder.

482
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:37.500
That was the Jon Benet Ramsey murder case was such a big deal and still can't

483
00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:39.900
sell that house.
They can't,
they can't sell it.
And I had a buddy,

484
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.870
my strength coach,
a.
Dot crease rented it.
It was like,
ah,

485
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.670
fuck it ghost and moved in there like right after the murders.
Anyway,

486
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.350
so,
uh,
the uh,
handle it,
the freak out now he's cool.
He's from Louisiana.

487
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:56.220
Like real tough dude.
Didn't give a fuck.
They're missing a chromosome down there.

488
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:56.361
Yeah.

489
00:27:56.361 --> 00:28:00.270
You gotta be pretty crazy to move in there even though it was a great deal and

490
00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:04.890
is a great spot.
But home was for sale for years,
for years.
I knocked it down.

491
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.040
They should,
I drove to the Oj Simpson should knock it down.

492
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:11.250
They should take out all the dirt and replace it with new dirt.
Yeah,

493
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:12.420
they should be doing everything.

494
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.120
Does knock it down and dig a hole all the way to hell.

495
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.200
Whenever the fuck dirt was,
they're so dirty man.
But um,
that dude,

496
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:22.470
he was just talking,
talking and it was fascinating.

497
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:24.810
I didn't say a word and then went into Jon Benet.
I'm like,
Ooh,

498
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:27.810
I'm going to chime in here cause I know this case and I know it well.

499
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.740
And Jim asked him a question that was like,
my time to jump in.
I go,
yeah,

500
00:28:31.741 --> 00:28:36.000
but yeah,
but it's probably the parents.
Right?
Or maybe the sun.

501
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.580
And he hasn't acknowledged me this entire interview.

502
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.620
I don't know if Jim remember noted this.
And he goes,
what'd you say it was?

503
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.240
And I could tell I fucked up.
I go,
this is probably the parents or the sun,
right.

504
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:51.090
And he goes,
absolutely not.
Absolutely not.
Brendan.

505
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.920
And then goes on how ridiculous they have an assumption that is,
and I go,
well,

506
00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.940
but who does he think did it?
Uh,
he was,
it's not them.
He any and he goes,
you,

507
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.070
the promise is the narrative that got painted outside of that,
when every,

508
00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.790
the media was going crazy and even the pup,
the boulder police,
he goes,

509
00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:13.680
they were so far off and he listed like 10 reasons why it wasn't them.

510
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.830
And I kind of felt like an idiot.
I went,
very cool.
I'll buy the book.

511
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.120
I'm going to shut the fuck up.
Now.

512
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.690
The only problem was that that a handwriting expert had connected the mother's

513
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:26.640
handwriting to the ransom note.
You do get them on this podcast.

514
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:28.770
We fucking fascinating.
He's doing promotion right now.

515
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.340
I mean I have no idea who killed John [inaudible].
This guy doesn't remember.

516
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.580
I don't think he knows.
No,
no.
He knows.

517
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:39.510
He can tell you from his 70 years of experience dealing with murders.

518
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.930
It's not the parents,
but he had like evidence why it

519
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.070
<v 1>wasn't cause I said the same things.
Right.
I'm balls deepened.
Jon Benet,</v>

520
00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:47.920
I grew up around it.
It was like such a cultural phenomenon.

521
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.530
Did he say who he thinks it is?
Yeah,
he did and I forget,

522
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.110
but it's not the panel on who's alive.
I don't know.
You got to have a monitor.

523
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.010
It was so fun.
I'm telling you,

524
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.640
I've listened a shitload of show shit and I was so into this man.

525
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.860
I didn't even promote my special.
I was there a promo,
my special,

526
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:03.783
I didn't say a word.

527
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.760
I made one stupid calm about Jonbenet's family and then he was like,

528
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:09.160
shut the fuck up.
Those fucking shows are very compelling.

529
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:11.440
Then you also see the crime shows.
What do you think?
Why are,

530
00:30:11.441 --> 00:30:14.920
why are we were like,
why am I drawn to him?
I fucked up.
Now.

531
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:17.320
Why am I drawn to this?
Serial killers are fucked up.

532
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:21.280
You're just like everybody else because I showed by Charles Manson's pubes on

533
00:30:21.281 --> 00:30:26.150
Ebay.
How much do you pay?
70 Geez man,
I can't even imagine.

534
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:31.540
72 put his pubes.
They plucked him out so it has some DNA and um,
dude,

535
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:34.570
you could recreate Charles Manson.
What does this Charles Manson's here,

536
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:39.460
$2,400 that does this deal bag of hair off the head of Charles Manson was

537
00:30:39.461 --> 00:30:43.570
obtained July,
2016 from an associate of Charles Manson.
Oh No,

538
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:48.571
that's Leo will be a certificate of authenticity will be included upon purchase.

539
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.500
By the way,
do art.

540
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.460
There are no certificates of authenticity when it comes to Charles Manson's
hair.

541
00:30:54.461 --> 00:30:58.840
It's not like there's an accrediting body who's like,
Hey,
let's definitely,

542
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:03.190
we'd go over every aspect of this purchase.
That shit's week though,

543
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.870
and you want that 1970s hair straight.

544
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.980
You don't want the updated [inaudible] gray or when he cuts it off.
Really?

545
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.450
Yeah.
You want to film him cutting it off and then you want a vacuum,

546
00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:16.270
seal it and sign it and film the whole thing.

547
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:20.860
You put it in one of them fucking vacuum bags and bags and then seal it.
Yeah.

548
00:31:20.861 --> 00:31:23.620
That way no one's touched it chops right off his hair.

549
00:31:23.621 --> 00:31:24.790
You've got video footage of it.

550
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.570
You've got video footage of him authorized or a autographing.
The bag,

551
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.080
the fuck is wrong with us.
Why are we talking about this?
It's fascinating to me.

552
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:35.150
Did you watch the game of Thrones finale?
Did you get bummed out?
I got,

553
00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.310
you know what?
Somebody else wrote it.
I think they did.
Yeah.
It's very strange.

554
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.600
I thought they did.
I loved,

555
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.230
I did like season eight and has kids the other seasons.
Hey Lis,
who's felt,

556
00:31:43.231 --> 00:31:47.470
let's get everybody to know right now.
Spoiler alerts.
Hold up.

557
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.650
What is today?
Thursday.
Yeah.
Yeah,
but some people have jobs.

558
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.520
Some people have jobs.
Pregnancy.
Some people work all day,
four days.

559
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.080
Some people were called at the New York Times,

560
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:59.200
like put it on the front page of the paper up Monday.
Clear Bro.

561
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.930
Serious take your laptop.

562
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.820
But they did that because they can do that and not because they should do that

563
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.800
the next days.
That'll fuck.
Well I think,
I think,
I think movies is,

564
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.130
you got a week movies.
You've got a week,
a TV show.

565
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.690
Two days to,
especially for that.
What are we not supposed to talk about it?

566
00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:20.530
Cause you're busy.
That's insane.
Did you like back what it is?
No,

567
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.620
I didn't [inaudible] satisfied.
I did.

568
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.010
I left unsatisfied when they made a spoiler.
Homeboy the king.
I was like,

569
00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:30.160
what in the fuck are you talking about?
He didn't want it.
The whole,

570
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.870
all the sudden everybody's fighting to the death over who's the king.

571
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.860
They're ready,
ready to stab their brother killed her mom.
They'll kill anybody.

572
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:43.940
They'll betray lovers.
But now this guy is like a,
all right,
I'll take it.

573
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:45.950
And everyone's like,
you should be the king.
They're like,
okay,

574
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.270
like that were all great.

575
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.580
And how about that one guy that just stood up and he's like,

576
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:52.170
maybe I could be the cane.
They're like,
sit down.
Sit It as this.

577
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:55.910
Just soprano's like what do you,
what are you doing with strange?
This guy,

578
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:58.370
Bobby Lee had that guy,
Bobby Lee had the greatest,

579
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:02.270
I thought it's such a good ending.
So he says when everyone goes,
you know,

580
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:06.070
when the design who to be the king and then homeboy who's crippled is like,

581
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.300
I'll do it.
And then when the wheel on my way,

582
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:12.440
he just looks over and he has the fucking White Walker I,
oh,
that would work.

583
00:33:12.441 --> 00:33:15.170
And then it closes.
You know what should happen.
It's Bobby Lee's idea.

584
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:19.010
Jon Snow should've fought to the death with that dude who has no dick.
Yeah.

585
00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:22.190
I want to see that.
The shift to the death,
they hated each other.

586
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:25.970
They hated each other.
How about that dude was like,
yeah,
you just killed my girl.

587
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.870
CEO.
Big Deal.
Just a you get on the boat.
Yeah.

588
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.450
There's no way they should have fought to the death.

589
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:35.570
100 did you like episode three?
I'll tell you what I liked though.

590
00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:39.920
They'll like when the one that the hound knocked the mountain off into the fire.

591
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.810
That was dope.
That was,
that was like just that showed me by fire.
They die.

592
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.490
That was a dope scene.
That shit was dope.

593
00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:50.960
The best scene in the whole fucking series though was when under the beds best

594
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:54.290
scene in the whole fucking series when when she was telling that dude that he

595
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:58.220
betrayed her and then from the darkness that Dragon's face appears and you're

596
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:01.970
like,
oh Jesus.
It's where I was a powerful scene.

597
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.870
Those dragons are so fucking so scary.
I'm so happy.

598
00:34:05.871 --> 00:34:08.070
There's people out there that do special effects like that.

599
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.320
That shit was [inaudible] used to be Kinda like Samurai Corny,

600
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:14.270
like super corny.
You remember what was that movie?

601
00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:18.380
There was a good dragon movie with Matthew mcconaughey back when Matthew

602
00:34:18.381 --> 00:34:22.220
mcconaughey was jacked.
Oh,
fun.
So just brought this up in the show.

603
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:27.080
Home boy from Australia was in it to Batman.
The fuck's his name.
Oh fuck.

604
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.530
What's his name?
Christian.
Bearish and base.
Your band was in both the fire.

605
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.250
What is it called?
Rain of fire.
Yeah.

606
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:37.240
The dragons in there were corny compared to the games of Thrones.
Nasbe believe.

607
00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:40.080
Let me see.
Let me see a video that posts look sick.

608
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:44.120
Obviously we can't show it on the podcast or will get arrested and go cast.

609
00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:46.640
Rachel Carnahan was just talking about this bro.

610
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.310
This fucking movie was not a bad movie.
It was a little corny,

611
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.960
but for a dummy like me who really likes dragons,
it was great stuff.
Um,

612
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.520
it was an interesting movie,
but the dragons,
it's just crazy.
How much,

613
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.950
cause I want to say this was probably 2004.

614
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.350
Am I correct for that 2002 I was pretty close.
Yeah,

615
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.700
pretty close to it you've been on too.

616
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:11.730
But the difference between what the dragons looked like 17 years later in terms

617
00:35:12.741 --> 00:35:15.380
of flex,
special effects,
even dinosaurs from [inaudible] park.

618
00:35:15.381 --> 00:35:17.990
One to address park world.
Yeah.
Like look at them.
They look,

619
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.410
I'm not showing you much then I that's a dragon's vision though.

620
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:26.240
It's kind of gay.
Oh,
why is it dragon's vision homosexual?

621
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.560
I wish when I said why did I say that?
Because you're a man.
Why is that?

622
00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.140
And we've been doing,
I know why we learn it.
I know.

623
00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:36.280
We've got to reprogram our brains,
dude.
How about with Charlemagne?

624
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:40.800
I wa I said Bitch,
I went,
oh that bitches hot.
And he goes,
he goes,

625
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.290
in 2019 you're still calling women bitches.
I went,

626
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.430
no where you work.
But yes.
Yeah,

627
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.910
but what apparently says I won't get a good point.
Um,

628
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.410
sometimes I do it on act it like when we were watching fight,

629
00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.560
when we do a fight companion,
I attend.
That bitch is tired,
but you don't.

630
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.230
It's all,
here's the thing,
man.
Contents.
Yes.

631
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:03.000
Don't make more words toxic.
It's all about intent.

632
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.370
Like what are you trying to say?
Like if,
if a,

633
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:10.460
if a girl is a beast and she's just a bad ass woman and she walks out and she's

634
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:13.080
got,
I'm good,
I'm good.

635
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:17.820
And she's got like this crazy tight skirt on his bang and by that she's worked

636
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:21.600
hard at it in the gym and she's got a beautiful dress and she looks great.
Like,

637
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:26.130
damn,
that bitch is hot.
That is not negative.
It's not negative.

638
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.090
Is it derogatory though?
But does it?
No,
but it's not negative.
If,
if you go,

639
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.120
you fucking silly bitch to me,
I'll laugh.
I'll fall down on the floor.

640
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:35.850
I'll start laughing.
Like you can call me a bitch and I think it's funny,

641
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:41.250
but if you like,
hey man,
you know you fucking made fun of me on the podcast,
Bro.

642
00:36:41.251 --> 00:36:45.540
That was a bitch move.
I'd be like,
Hey,
whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
But it's different.

643
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:49.500
Same thing as like when a car drives by,
be like,
damn,
that mother fucker's bad.

644
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:53.490
But if the guy rolled down his window was a k mother fucker right.
Different,

645
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:55.320
different,
yeah,
it's intent.

646
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.350
The problem is when you have a word that you can't say,

647
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.230
that word has too much goddamn power.

648
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:03.780
It's not that you should say the word like don't get me wrong.

649
00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:08.520
Like there's certain words you probably shouldn't say because we've all agreed

650
00:37:08.521 --> 00:37:11.520
that those words have a negative impact probably.
Right?
Yeah.

651
00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.820
Faigy we've lost probably one.
We stay away from all greed.
Yeah.

652
00:37:14.821 --> 00:37:16.950
We've all agreed it has a negative impact on people,

653
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.890
but the real problem is intent.

654
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.900
The real problem is homophobic behavior in that,
in that or at home fog,

655
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.520
homophobic thinking,
homophobic ideology,
thought processes,

656
00:37:29.521 --> 00:37:31.800
thinking that gay people are bad thinking there's anything wrong with being gay.

657
00:37:31.801 --> 00:37:35.550
That's a real problem.
If there was no problem with that at all,

658
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.380
I just feel like,

659
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:43.020
I feel like it's not the right move to make words the problem.

660
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:46.410
The problem is the way people think and behave and I think ultimately there's a

661
00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:50.070
real problem with language itself because I think language is too limited.

662
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:51.211
I think we're,

663
00:37:51.211 --> 00:37:55.740
when you have magic words that you can't say and they have all this extra power

664
00:37:55.741 --> 00:37:56.820
connected to it gives them power.

665
00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:00.660
Lenny Bruce talked about that in the 60s he had a great bit about that,

666
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:03.930
about saying all these words because you could take away the meaning of them and

667
00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:07.410
it won't hurt anybody's feelings anymore.
But don't you think if,

668
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.180
let's say you are a homosexual and gay is like that's what we refer to you as

669
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.680
gay as such a negative connotation because growing up gay men like not good.

670
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:22.020
So I'd be like,
God,
you look gay dude,
that car's gay.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah,

671
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.110
that's,
that's a problem.
That's problem.

672
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.120
So in great vascular then the problem is it's such a good sound to for that

673
00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:33.000
thought,
the same thing as like calling someone a faggot.

674
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.980
You faggot like that word.
Like when you say it

675
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.350
<v 0>like that,
even if it's your friend,
like your best friend,</v>

676
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:43.780
it's got that sag because it sounds good.
It's got a pop to it.

677
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:48.760
It's going to power.
It starts with a fuck you and starts with an f.

678
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.620
It's so bad.

679
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.400
And it has zero to do with being gay,

680
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.340
but you can't say it anymore because it hurts people's feelings.

681
00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:01.750
Like when Mike Tyson goes,
I'm gonna Fuck you until you love me faggot.
Right,

682
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:05.770
right,
right.
They make sense.
You're gonna fuck around and call him a faggot.

683
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:07.870
That was what your fucking hit.
You're trying to fuck him.

684
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.400
Who was the fucking reporter?
He was yelling at us here.
Fuck.

685
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.680
Is that because that guy is,

686
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:17.740
that guy did he vanished off the face of the earth after that?
I was,

687
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:21.340
that guy was,
I was ringside when Deontay Walder knocked out Brazil.

688
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:26.140
I was on Brooklyn for that with my brother,
bro.
Dude,
Bro.
Dude,

689
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:29.710
that guy.
It's I and I've been a lot of fun.
I've been in fights.

690
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:33.070
I've been knocked out.
I've been at UFC fights were dudes get knocked out.

691
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.840
I have never in my life heard someone get knocked out like that.
My brother goes,

692
00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.970
oh my God,
and my brothers a brawl dude.
Oh my God.

693
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:47.180
And they sat us next to his family and it ruined it for me because you can't

694
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:51.970
cheer.
I saw the wife Elijah.
I just went,
oh my God,
I didn't chew.

695
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.490
I wouldn't cheer anyway,
but I was just like,
oh my God.

696
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:57.580
And this is the funniest part is uh,
my boy shout out to Brian.

697
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.170
Brian Dailey at showtime goes,
so in between rounds,
um,
probably uh,
two and three.

698
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.550
Jim Gray's going to come in and interview about your,
a showtime special on you.

699
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.650
Oh,
that,
that'd be cool if they told me the day before.
So yet this nice outfit.

700
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:09.520
My brother's looking on the,

701
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.230
I really think it was going to get to run toward go under four.

702
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.810
I didn't think one round,

703
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.130
but I thought there was a chance they sent me there and that they're like Jim

704
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.210
Guy,
he's going to come and then [inaudible].
All right.

705
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:23.830
I should probably get out of here.
Huh?
John to dude,
I'm telling you man,

706
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.400
he's something special.
So special man.
He's such a good dude.

707
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:32.590
You've never had them on here was amazing.
He's great.
We had a great time.

708
00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:35.740
How passionate is he?
He's a sweetheart.
He's like a really nice guy.

709
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:39.610
That was my problem with him going,
Oh,
I want to murder this guy.

710
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:42.630
I want to kill this guy and I want to exercise my right.
I'm like,
ah,

711
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.360
I expect that from these,
for lack of better term,
these animals,

712
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.850
these guys who aren't at your level,
but he's such a good person.
I'm like,
ah,

713
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.210
dude,
don't do that.
Cause they can paint you into that box.

714
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.590
I believe that's going to just go away,
but it's gone.
That's gone.
It's gone.

715
00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.440
His performance was so spectacular.
I think it goes away,

716
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.770
but I think it's also that was his legitimate mindset at that time.

717
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.090
You know what I mean?
That guy,

718
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:07.510
if you listen to my podcast when I interviewed him and talked about how he got

719
00:41:07.511 --> 00:41:11.200
into boxing because of his daughter,
just do it on yours as well.
Talk about that.

720
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:13.210
Yeah.
That's a special person,
man.

721
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:16.930
I mean he became a bronze medalist in the Olympics after a year and a half of

722
00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.200
boxing.
That's insane.
So specialties,
that's insane,
man.

723
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.760
You got to imagine he was Bob.

724
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.370
If he was in a year and a half of boxing and he's entering into Olympics,

725
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:28.660
he's going to be having matches against guys who have 10 years experience,
easy,

726
00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:30.820
hundreds of fights,
100 amateur fights,

727
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.340
hundreds and he's got like virtually no experience.
And

728
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.250
<v 1>he's not like the slickest guy in the world either.</v>

729
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:41.090
So he has to be able to take a shot.
But he's got two giant advantages,

730
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.390
huge reach and ridiculous power.

731
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.630
And I think lettuces because,
yeah,

732
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:50.720
and I think because of the fact that he's not a big heavyweight,

733
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.390
I don't think he gets his tired as they do.
I agree.

734
00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.270
I think he came in this last fight,
the heavy seas ever been.

735
00:41:56.271 --> 00:41:58.180
He came in at two 23 and what did he really,

736
00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:03.250
that's interesting cause usually two 14 to 13 to solve,
get this mother fucker.

737
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.750
He punches so hard,
man.

738
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.560
He's the scariest heavyweight knockout artist since Mike Tyson.

739
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.920
Hundred percent when he was walking.
Well you Gregory,
when he's walking,

740
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.470
I looked up my brother,
I went,
I went.
You know how you feel right now?

741
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.680
You had goosebumps.
I want imagine being on Mike Tyson,
fight in,
in his prime.

742
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.040
How that fucking crowd must've felt.
Yeah,
because when he's walking out,

743
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.400
I felt so bad for Brazil because I'm like,
we're next to his family.
I'm like,

744
00:42:25.401 --> 00:42:27.560
he's such an underdog.
He's going to get knocked out.

745
00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.980
[inaudible] I think we're going to see that with Deontay wilder.

746
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:32.480
I think Deontay wilder.
It's a pneumonic.

747
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.570
Tyson hundred percent I think he's the new Mike.

748
00:42:34.571 --> 00:42:37.790
He's that hard and what's instrumented him is everyone gives me shit like you're

749
00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:41.690
such a homer cause you work for showtime.
No,
no,
no.
Here's the thing about that,

750
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:46.220
Joe.
What people don't realize is Deontae while his fights are on showtime,

751
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.150
he's an independent contractor.
He doesn't have a promoter.
He says,
team,

752
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.330
you know the design often hundreds of billions of dollars,

753
00:42:53.331 --> 00:42:57.260
same as they offer Joshua and canal.
He turned it down.
Dan.
You know why?

754
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.530
Because he wants,
he wants to fight Joshua's to fight fear.
He goes,
well,

755
00:43:00.531 --> 00:43:03.770
if I'm with them,
that's going to limit me fighting fury or Joshua.

756
00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.950
If I'm independent,
I can fight.
Joshua can fight wilder.

757
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.130
If I was up Joshua or wild,
I'd be terrified.
Right now.

758
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.750
Why do you think they me not wild or rather a fury.
Joshua fewer.

759
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.640
I'd be terrified of that mind,
that mindset.
Definitely easier fights.

760
00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.810
But he's the scariest fight of all time in the fucking 12th round when he cracks

761
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:23.810
Tyson fury and drops in like that.
You're like in the 12th round,

762
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:27.440
he still has this ridiculous power and he's only getting better.

763
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:30.770
But I think what happens is him,
it's more likely,

764
00:43:30.771 --> 00:43:33.590
especially looking at the way promoters work.

765
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:37.640
You didn't get Joshua verse wilder before he get fury.
Oh,
I think so.

766
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.120
I think it was just kind of,
so all I'm taking any of them.
Yeah,
I'm fine.

767
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.040
I want all three of them.
I do these fucks.
Oh,
it these flux.
It's context.

768
00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:50.990
Remember these fucks oh it to yes to the legacy of box in a fight each other.

769
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:51.381
Well,

770
00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:54.410
it's one of those rare moments in the heavyweight division where you have three

771
00:43:54.411 --> 00:43:56.240
unbelievably compelling guys.

772
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.870
And then one of them was a former champion who by the way,

773
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.600
the last fight was a draw and I thought he should have wanted decision.

774
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.870
So if you look at it,
I thought he should have wanted decision,

775
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:10.760
but I agree with the results too.
This is what's real squirrely preach.

776
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:13.520
Because the way Wildred heard him,

777
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.530
dropped him and then knocked him down and almost had him flat lined in the 12th

778
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.590
end.
If you go over the actual count,

779
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.700
the actual 10 count from one to 10 from the time he dropped,

780
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:29.210
which is not what Tyson's series jobs is,
Tyson fury jobs get up in.

781
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.470
The referee says nine and he did that.
He did that.

782
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.940
But if you go buy an actual clock,
11 or 12 and yeah,
you go buy an actual clock.

783
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:39.530
It's about 11 and 12 second yeah.
Tyson fury lost that 10 count.
But fear,

784
00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:43.290
purity one the rounds.
Yes.
Siri.
One more rounds.
Hands down the outbox him.

785
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:47.370
Did you write that count was longer than 10 yeah,
he,
he should have.

786
00:44:47.371 --> 00:44:49.230
If you were just going by 10 seconds.

787
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.860
Deontay wilder has a real argument that should,
he should have won by knockout.

788
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:57.180
Here's the thing,
that's why I liked the draw the draw.
Fantastic.
Cool.

789
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.910
Run it back.
Let's get a clear winner.
And then Joshua,

790
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:03.900
who's this animal out there?
Who's just this fucking,
he's so damn good.

791
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.860
He's just honestly though,
what the fuck is a 10 count?

792
00:45:07.861 --> 00:45:11.730
Four if it's not 10 seconds.
Why is the referee human error accounts human error.

793
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.410
There should be in every fucking corner,
every corner,
wherever the fight is.

794
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:20.370
There should be a clock.
And then once someone goes down,
someone else,

795
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.030
not the referee hits that button.
[inaudible] second one.

796
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.980
Oh you could really do three,
four,
five,
six cause cause you go one,
two,
three,

797
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:33.360
four,
five.
Yeah.
But he goes one that he's jacked up with adrenaline.

798
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.440
There's a huge knock out the crowd.
Like want a guy to get up.
He might want to,

799
00:45:37.441 --> 00:45:37.921
got to get up.

800
00:45:37.921 --> 00:45:41.910
He might want to help them extra time to rub the gloves on his chest.

801
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.950
Ask him a couple of questions and they grabbed that towards me.
Walk towards me.

802
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:49.170
What's Today's date?
You could do all that shit.

803
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.880
You can give them a little bit of a break.

804
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:54.090
Do you like to Hu human error part like same with baseball.
Like the jumps.

805
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:55.380
They fuck up.
No.

806
00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:00.060
All the time to the greatest of the greats like Herb Dean and John McCarthy.

807
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:03.260
Have you made mistakes?
You,
it is impossible to not fuck up.

808
00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:06.060
Herb Dean is the Goddamn gold standard.

809
00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:08.310
He's the best of the best of people working today.

810
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.360
And he will occasionally say that he made an error.
John Daughter.
Yeah.
Amazing.

811
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.450
Amazing,
fun mixing people make mistakes.

812
00:46:15.451 --> 00:46:18.120
They're human beings and I think is there John though,
bro?

813
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:21.870
Their job is so I fuck up all the time and I do commentary and their job is so

814
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:23.820
much harder than mine.
So much harder.

815
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:27.450
All I'm doing is talking while the fights going on,
what they're deciding.

816
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:32.130
If the fight ends,
I disagree.
Voice to go fucking mad.
This is bro.

817
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:36.900
It's not that Oh yard to watch another organization go watch another or when

818
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:39.810
you're not working.
Since I'm not being,
I'm not,
I'm not being humble.

819
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:42.180
I'm just telling you it's not that hard.
You,
brother,
I'm telling you,

820
00:46:42.181 --> 00:46:46.980
it's a tough fucking gig.
Go watch another fight.
Go,
go watch.
Go Watch design.

821
00:46:46.981 --> 00:46:51.150
We Canelo fought.
It was so bad.
It was comical.
Who was doing the commentary?

822
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.770
Not sure.
Does it matter?
Not Good.
It was so bad.
It ruined the fight.

823
00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.630
That kind of,
it was so bad.
It was entertaining.
Well,

824
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.610
they were show pro Canelo and they just weren't,
it wasn't professionally done.

825
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:07.740
You know who I like that uh,
is in a world of shit right now.

826
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.850
You get a,
you're talking to MMA or boxing.
Who?
Paulie.
Malignaggi.
Uh,

827
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:16.220
what's the best,
why is he spitting on people?
What's he doing?
Macy,

828
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.280
great commentator,
man.
I threw me the best.
He's the best.

829
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.400
I think my number one favorite.
Here's,

830
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.750
here's my three top that I get excited when they're doing the same as mine.

831
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.650
Roy Jones Jr Andre Ward and Paulie Malignaggi.

832
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.400
I think you could see Andre and Polly both.

833
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:38.430
You can switch out [inaudible] like Roy because Roy Christ in me.

834
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.640
Yeah,
that's okay though.

835
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.900
This is why when he was at his best,

836
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:48.190
he was the motherfucker of all motherfuckers.
He was like,
Floyd Mayweather,

837
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:49.690
but he was knocking people dead.

838
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.260
He was putting his hands behind his back and knocked people out.

839
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.040
He was doing shit that no one could do.
He was fucking people up.

840
00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:00.580
Roy Jones Jr went on a streak for a long time where he was,

841
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.120
he had this freak athleticism in this.

842
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.170
He didn't even throw jabs half the time.
Three.
Love your,
appreciate it.
Oh my God.

843
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:10.630
So you,
because the end of his career at them,
well,

844
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:14.500
you know when Glen Johnson Kao Dim when um,
uh,

845
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.550
magic man k owed him,
but that was,

846
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.320
but he had this run of greatness that we should appreciate.
Like,

847
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.910
like when I think of Anderson Silva,

848
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.780
I don't think of him bitch out because he got kicked against Khan there.

849
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:30.070
I think of Anderson Silva fucking front kick and Vito Belfort Front kick and

850
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:32.860
fucking,
you know,
all these guys.
Like of course I think of that.

851
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:36.280
So it's weird with Roy,
I think because he's currently,

852
00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:39.370
he just got knocked down in Russia like six days ago or whatever.

853
00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:41.860
Did he really know?
But you recently got knocked in Russia,

854
00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:44.110
but I thought he won his last fight.
I think he won his last fight.

855
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:48.340
That's going to be his last last wildfly Seattle.
Yeah.
Paulie's amazing though.

856
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:52.840
But Paulie,
um,
when he,
when he was going to fight,
um,

857
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.560
that bare knuckle,
I want a little bit of rant on my show.
Me and polio close,
man.

858
00:48:56.561 --> 00:48:59.480
I went on a rant and I was saying,
I don't think you should do it.
And it,

859
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.770
I feel like he's punching down.
He's one of the best commentators.
Here's a job.

860
00:49:02.771 --> 00:49:05.950
So many people want then of course me and probably work together.

861
00:49:05.951 --> 00:49:09.970
So we're breaking down the wilder Brazil fight in New York and there was this

862
00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:13.780
weird Pollyanna gonna hear this there.
I felt like there's this weird kind of,

863
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.280
well,
of course.
I mean,

864
00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:18.160
you're telling them not to do something that he's definitely going to do.
Yeah,

865
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:20.220
I know.
So you're resisting his idea.

866
00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.810
But if I was doing something you didn't want me to do,

867
00:49:22.811 --> 00:49:25.060
if you're doing something right and we have an open conversation with,

868
00:49:25.061 --> 00:49:26.290
there's no weirdness.
Like,

869
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.870
why can't we talk about if Polly went up to him was like,
dude,

870
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:32.320
I'm doing it cause I'm like this fuck out.
Do and hopefully I get McGregor out.

871
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.930
And also I'm just kind of bored with my life.
Man,
this could be fun for me.

872
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:38.140
I went,
oh cool man,
I support you.
There's no,
I'm not shaming him.

873
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:40.210
I agree with you.
I feel where you're coming from.

874
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:43.780
And I agree that I would want you to tell me if you thought it was fucking up

875
00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:48.490
and it was a bad idea.
But I think that,
um,
with a guy like him,

876
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:51.940
you know,
this is,
he not,
I don't know what kind of options he has.

877
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.070
Nobody was beating down his door to fight him,
you know,
and that,

878
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:56.950
I know that Connor didn't want to fight him.
He wasn't interested in that.

879
00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.280
And I don't know other,
what other options he's got [inaudible] for boxing,

880
00:50:00.281 --> 00:50:02.120
but then also,
so,
but then that's what I'm saying,

881
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.890
the greatest analysts in the game,
but he,

882
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.020
if he's going to fight a bare knuckle boxing fight like this,
got it.

883
00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:09.610
There's gotta be a financial motive for that.
That's,

884
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:12.640
I would hope that the only thing that makes sense is that that's a financial

885
00:50:12.641 --> 00:50:15.540
motive.
But I listened to showtime paste them.

886
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:21.160
Showtime pays them well do they?
Yeah,
man.
Yeah.
So it's like to do that,

887
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.420
you know,
and you look at the payday,

888
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:25.260
like automate I think 50,000 for the last fight.
So let's,

889
00:50:25.261 --> 00:50:28.460
so let's say they pay him triple,
let's pain,
quadruple say make,

890
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.230
what does that fucking $250,000 is that enough to do a bare knuckle fight when

891
00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:37.730
you're making six figures,
you know you could get your face fucked up too.

892
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.510
That's the reality.
Those knuckles,
man,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm changing my tune a little bit,

893
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.750
but not all them on.
You got a little bit in Gel a little bit,

894
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:45.584
but here's the thing,

895
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:50.180
like you do get caught up more in bare knuckle boxing,

896
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:54.050
but you're also not kicking or using take downs or anything else in bare knuckle

897
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:54.740
boxing.

898
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.780
I think it'd be way more brutal if there was take down and kicks because with

899
00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:00.560
maybe,
I don't think the best guy wins.

900
00:51:00.561 --> 00:51:05.561
Also in a bare knuckle cause you know Polly has way more fighting experience in

901
00:51:05.661 --> 00:51:07.400
art.
Right?
Susie?
Again,
more scar tissue.

902
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:11.240
So if there's a guy with a ton of scar tissue,
your face opens up like a,

903
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.210
it looks like a murder scene taking Charles Manson murder scene because of the

904
00:51:14.211 --> 00:51:18.920
knuckles.
So he might,
you might land seven shots to his too,

905
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:20.120
but your face is fucked up.
They,

906
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.870
us nothing cuts you up more than elbows and elbows are a hundred percent legal

907
00:51:23.871 --> 00:51:28.160
in the UFC and the the [inaudible] unless his ground and pound.
Mm.
Yeah,

908
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:32.030
like standard.
Like I can't like all that you can while he does that.

909
00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.070
How about Johnnie Walker?
Johnnie Walker's gotten nasty.
He gonna get fucked.
It's,

910
00:51:36.071 --> 00:51:38.030
he really hurt cause you haven't heard from at all.
Right?

911
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:41.600
I think he recovered like whatever was wrong with his shoulder recovered.

912
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:43.340
But the reality is if you're,

913
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.700
if you hurt yourself so bad that you can't move your arm afterwards.

914
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.760
Coming from someone who's had some shoulder injuries,

915
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.870
that to me is like you've got some damage in there.
You know why else?

916
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.420
It's alarming because when he did it,
his adrenaline was so high.

917
00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:00.110
Usually you can go through some shit if you got hurt bad enough where your

918
00:52:00.111 --> 00:52:02.330
adrenaline's you.
I mean you're,
you just want a huge fight.

919
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:05.510
You're doing the worm after victory and you can feel the pain.

920
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.530
That's when I'll fuck there's,
there's probably damaged there.
Yeah,

921
00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:10.580
cause you're drilling so high.
It numbs every,

922
00:52:10.581 --> 00:52:13.280
just imagine if that one's up defining his career.

923
00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.690
I don't think developed shoulder problems.
I hope not already.

924
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.940
Clover clover's had some serious shoulder palms ever since the John Fife.

925
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:24.200
It's also 70 years old.
He's been fighting in Brazil since he was three,

926
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:28.400
but when John grabbed his arm and yanked it back when Glover was the top

927
00:52:28.401 --> 00:52:29.240
contender member,

928
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:33.130
John got him in that over Hook and ripped his fucking arm up my bro.
That was,

929
00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:35.900
I never saw anybody do that before.
I was like,
that's genius.

930
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.740
That's a really smart thing because you're fucking super vulnerable in that

931
00:52:39.741 --> 00:52:42.770
position.
Nobody really thinks that Americans just grabs and goes.
Yup.

932
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:47.390
Just yanked it shoulder.
John's the goat.
The goat.
He used to go close.

933
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:52.070
Well he is him and the best expression in terms of like what I've seen in the

934
00:52:52.071 --> 00:52:53.150
octagon is mighty mouse.

935
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:57.050
But he had just didn't fight different level of competition except for so Hutto

936
00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:00.330
we're finding out.
So who knows the fucking man.
Here's the thing,

937
00:53:00.331 --> 00:53:04.570
we're definitely finding that out.
So then my dumb ass,
he's going,

938
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.090
he knows I love fucking my mess.
I humor John can do one or two.

939
00:53:08.091 --> 00:53:12.860
The problem with him be a number one is that that weight class,
the,
the,

940
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.330
the margin of error is way higher.
So if I go,
if I zig left when I showed zig,

941
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.000
right,
I'm not getting knocked down.
I can learn from go back.

942
00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:23.150
If John Zigs left when she went right by Glover,

943
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:27.150
he's getting knocked the fuck out.
Get margins are so small.
John can take a shot.

944
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:30.240
But if it's rumble Johnson,
he's getting knocked out.
Maybe.
Yeah,

945
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.460
we don't know John's that good.
But the thing is,

946
00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:34.700
let's see here was the mighty mouse.
So when he beat pseudo rights,

947
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:38.640
who had seven fights the first time smoked them.
So who took gains experience?

948
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:42.750
Then he beats him.
Yup.
So that takes the pound for pound.

949
00:53:42.751 --> 00:53:45.360
That takes a little off of mighty mouse.
But I think he's,

950
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:49.010
as you agree with the decision,
when pseudo beat him,
it's so tough to talent.

951
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.920
It's tough.
It's fucking,
listen,
if they would've gave to mighty mouse,

952
00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:55.080
I would've been mad at,
I wouldn't have been mad at you.
And how about your boys?

953
00:53:55.081 --> 00:53:59.790
Sage Northcutt yeah.
Cosmo Alexander.
Cosmo killed a guy.

954
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:04.750
He's a beast to sage is still in the hospital.
17 fractures in his face.
Yeah,

955
00:54:04.751 --> 00:54:07.890
I know.
He's still not won championships and killed the guy outside of that.
No,

956
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.250
because you know,
surgery Crow Cova love did.
Yeah,
I know.

957
00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:15.000
Coppola have killed a guy in a fight.
Um,
well,
cosmo logs.

958
00:54:15.001 --> 00:54:19.080
Andrew is a worldclass more Thai fighter.
I mean,
John Wayne par fought him,

959
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.550
you know,
he fought.
Nikki holds can,
he's world class as far as striking.

960
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:27.180
It's a completely different level.
But I guess because it was an MMA fight,

961
00:54:27.181 --> 00:54:30.540
he was willing to take it,
but they,
they fought,
they fought,

962
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:35.541
stand up for management and sage took that karate stance and the dude circled

963
00:54:36.181 --> 00:54:38.260
off,
um,
to his right in Atlanta,

964
00:54:38.261 --> 00:54:41.100
that fucking right hand and it was on the business.

965
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.030
The hardest right hand I've ever seen.
I was,
can you imagine?

966
00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:48.950
I can't think just from a world class striker with flounce gloves on and he's

967
00:54:48.951 --> 00:54:52.920
circling into the right.
Yeah.
And it's like a fucking bomb.

968
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:56.640
It's pretty God damn strong.
And Cosmos is a beast of a man.
I mean,

969
00:54:56.641 --> 00:54:59.550
he's a big thick dude.
See,
I mean,

970
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:03.120
a big thick dude with multiple world titles to his name.

971
00:55:03.121 --> 00:55:05.820
Don't you feel bad watch?
How do you feel bad for sage?
Yeah,

972
00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:08.000
it's a terrible match up.
I don't know why they,
uh,

973
00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:12.750
agreed to let him fight that guy.
Boom.
It's just not smart because that,

974
00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:16.020
because the,
the kickboxing in the standup,
like he doesn't have the experience.

975
00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:19.590
I don't know.
He's,
I mean,
sage is good.
He's very good.
But these,

976
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.170
these kinds of losses are terrible for a few,

977
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:26.550
for his future because their mismanagement losses in my opinion.
I agree.

978
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.880
I think sage is what 20 to like look at that punch that lands.

979
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:33.660
I mean that is ferocious from a worldclass try.
Yeah.

980
00:55:33.661 --> 00:55:37.610
I mean that's sort of left full blast to that is a full blast.

981
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:42.450
She sugar right?
You can't,
you can't get hit cleaner than that.
Now you came here.

982
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:44.330
It's be hard to hit a fucking,
but meanwhile,

983
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:49.440
do you ever seen him when he fought Nikki hold skin?
Uh,
cosmos.
Yeah.
Yeah.

984
00:55:49.441 --> 00:55:53.250
You gotta keep class.
Michelle's can fuck him up.
There is the three levels.

985
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:58.110
There's levels but in MMA sages and even remote,
he shouldn't be,

986
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.620
they shouldn't be shinned same marine.
Well Cosmo's,
why would I,

987
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.890
why would I bring this,
this stud,

988
00:56:03.891 --> 00:56:08.700
this American Stud who looks like right from street fighter and go,

989
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:12.570
Hey,
first fight,
here's the most worldclass director we got on the roster.
Well,

990
00:56:12.571 --> 00:56:15.990
because they want him to be tested.
And I think that if I was a cha tree,

991
00:56:15.991 --> 00:56:17.310
I would be looking at it like this.

992
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:22.170
When a guy like Eddie Alvarez gets code or a guy like sage Northcutt kits code

993
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:26.080
or a guy mighty mouse gets tagged and has a real fight on his hands,

994
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.110
then you're showing the whole world like,
Hey,

995
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.830
these guys that are coming over here that are world class fighters,

996
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:36.160
they're fighting worldclass fighters.
I did it get knocked out.

997
00:56:36.161 --> 00:56:40.390
I get that here on the other.
It's a great thing for him.
I think certain certain.

998
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.910
So with uh,
Eddie Alvarez of veteran,

999
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:46.870
he should be hall of Famer Bell Champ,
UFC champ.

1000
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.350
Give him the best she got.
He's seen it all to be tough to get bone passed them.

1001
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.710
Sage Northcutt mighty mouse.
Give him the best you got.
He's seen it all.

1002
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:57.790
Good luck getting past him.
Sage.
Northcutt you're investing in his future.

1003
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:00.820
He's not ready.
It's good point.
You've kind of fucked a man.
Well,

1004
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.630
so you're trying to get in the American market,
but Cosmo's not an MMA fighter.

1005
00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:07.210
That's the thing.
This is cosmos first.

1006
00:57:07.211 --> 00:57:09.670
MMA fight would sage just takes them down and smashes him.

1007
00:57:09.671 --> 00:57:12.000
That would've been great.
Yeah.
But I mean that could have happened too.

1008
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.890
So when you,
when concerts last say style,
he's not a grappler.
Okay.

1009
00:57:14.891 --> 00:57:16.000
But he knows how to grapple.

1010
00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:19.450
Say just taking guys down in the octagon before taking cosmo downs easier than

1011
00:57:19.451 --> 00:57:22.510
said he's trained with me and Rashad at Black Zealand's them.
Fuck us up today.

1012
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:26.890
Yeah.
The nightmare.
Yeah.
So when I saw it for sage,
I'm like,

1013
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:31.960
what also are you building cosmo?
He's older man.

1014
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:37.200
While he's only 34 37 is e three seven has 1000 kickboxing matches.

1015
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:42.910
Like you're gonna invest in that now from a business aspect.

1016
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:43.743
Doesn't make sense to me.

1017
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:48.820
I think it does though because it shows with two giant results over the last two

1018
00:57:48.821 --> 00:57:49.654
months.

1019
00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:54.220
That one has world class talent there and I think it makes people pay more

1020
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:58.780
attention to one,
not me.
It put me off of him.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh that's crazy.

1021
00:57:58.781 --> 00:58:03.520
Fucked up.
No,
see,
listen man,
I'm a sideshow is a fucking Moy Thai fighter.

1022
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:04.990
I mean that's his bread and butter.

1023
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:07.420
He fights Moyie Thai since his bread and butter.

1024
00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:11.410
So when cosmo goes and fights in an MMA fight,

1025
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.830
you would think at least in one area,
is going to be at a disadvantage.

1026
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:20.170
If stay sage chooses to have a stand up fight with a worldclass Dan fighter,

1027
00:58:20.171 --> 00:58:23.260
that's just bad strategy.
It's that state sages game,
those,

1028
00:58:23.261 --> 00:58:26.500
especially as a young fighter,
but he's a mixed martial arts fighter,

1029
00:58:26.501 --> 00:58:29.890
then he should become a kickboxer if that's his game is just to stand up and

1030
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:33.650
strike the people that just stay a kickboxer.
Because if you're going to find,

1031
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:37.270
listen man,
if you're gonna fight in MMA,
in MMA,
you could do everything.

1032
00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:40.900
What do you want to do in this fight?
Don't you want to win?
Okay,
good.

1033
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.640
I want you to win.
Here's how you win.

1034
00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:46.210
You don't stand with one of the best fucking strikers in the world.

1035
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.140
How old is he?
22 sage.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1036
00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:54.100
but you just tell him I says Twitter sizes strategy.
You,

1037
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:58.690
you keep that side stance.
That's fine Beta man.
But then shoot,

1038
00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:01.810
get,
just get the clench and drag that mother fucker to the ground.

1039
00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:05.330
Let's where I'm out.
I'm with Ya.
Which he's never done to any fight ever put,

1040
00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.110
let's ask taken guys down before.
Yeah,

1041
00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.740
but let's say you serious manager and they go,
Hey,
here's cosmetic.
Go.
Hold on.

1042
00:59:11.741 --> 00:59:14.200
Let's just let me go through this.
With these sage prose,

1043
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:18.850
you beat a straight worldclass,
kickboxer and MMA.
He's also 37 years old.

1044
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:22.280
Not a lot of pros.
Cons,
okay,
but he's 37 years.
He came down.

1045
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:26.480
He fucking starches you in your face is broken 17 places and your career is

1046
00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:31.070
probably not going well.
The trajectory is definitely off the rails.
Pros,

1047
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:32.990
cons,
that's true.
It's just,

1048
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:36.770
if you look at the way boxing has always done it and it's been often criticized,

1049
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:39.260
but there's some real good points to it about developing a fighter.

1050
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.790
You give a guy a fighter,

1051
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:43.720
a difficult fight that you think that he has the advantage in,

1052
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.430
but it's an advantage that will teach him some things like the f.

1053
00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:47.570
Then the guy fights with them.

1054
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:51.710
What does this Jimmy Cosmo's ninth fight was against stage.
Oh,

1055
00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:55.730
he's had a bunch of MMA fights.
Why did he say that?
He knocks out everybody.

1056
00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:59.690
He set it on his,
um,
his,
uh,
his,

1057
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.290
what the fuck is Instagram post about us?
Know that he doesn't fight MMA.

1058
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:06.230
No fuck on gender.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1059
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.650
Start to everyone will championship goes here you go.
Yeah.

1060
01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:13.940
He looked at yours I guess.
Oh,
I was 16.
Three years for you though.

1061
01:00:13.941 --> 01:00:16.430
May cause he's training with the best of the best as well.

1062
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.510
Bottom line is as a striker,
he's superb and he's,
he's fucking,

1063
01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:23.870
but then as hard crazy,
the thing is pull up the Nicky holds can fight.

1064
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:26.630
Nikki holds,
can knocks out cosmo.
Alexandra,

1065
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:29.000
that just shows you how many levels there are.

1066
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:33.710
But then Nikki whole skin just lost to a region.
Ursel just lost to him.

1067
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:37.370
Just got dropped with a knee.
It's so interesting man.

1068
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:42.140
When you see levels upon levels upon levels and you don't necessarily know that

1069
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:46.280
these levels even exist unless you're balls deep in the fucking sport.

1070
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:49.760
Like you see a guy like Niki for Princeville and Nikki's like,
wow,

1071
01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:54.761
the best body punchers in kickboxing and this is a kickboxing fight as opposed

1072
01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:59.780
to a Moyie Thai fight as well.
So no elbows limited.
Clenching and,
uh,

1073
01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:04.460
you can only hold for like three seconds when you and throw a knee.

1074
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:05.750
You can only like,

1075
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.890
you can only hold while you're like think one knee at a time or something like

1076
01:01:09.891 --> 01:01:11.720
that.
They have weird rules.
You know.
Here's the thing,

1077
01:01:11.721 --> 01:01:15.770
the fact that cosmo Alexander went toe to toe with Nikki Holton,

1078
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.540
I'm probably going to pass on my young 22 year old wide eyed youngster fighting

1079
01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:24.280
him.
Nikki holes can had an amazing career in glory to some fucking incredible

1080
01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.250
siphon.
Joseph [inaudible] where he knocked him out in the last round.
Yeah,

1081
01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:33.170
he's a,
he's a beast man.
Super,
super tactical and it's just tough as shit.
Yeah.

1082
01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:33.591
I mean,
look,

1083
01:01:33.591 --> 01:01:35.660
it's just the way these guys are standing in front of it that just checking

1084
01:01:35.661 --> 01:01:40.100
everything.
Perfect.
Perfect technique.
Perfect defense.
Oh,

1085
01:01:40.101 --> 01:01:43.190
we dropped him with that left hook.
Yeah.
Look,
hold skins.
I'm a monster.

1086
01:01:43.191 --> 01:01:45.110
This is by the way,
a kickboxing fight.

1087
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.850
Holtz can also fought Kosmal og Sandra and knocked him out in one FC.

1088
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.230
This is,
uh,
this is,
it's showtime in Amsterdam.
This is quite a few years ago.

1089
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.180
It's showtime was the shit man.

1090
01:01:56.181 --> 01:02:01.181
He should get it on access TV back when access TV was HD net over that Mark

1091
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.120
Cuban's fog 14.
That was dealt with at the MMA live with Ron Crook.
Yes.

1092
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:06.260
I used to go on there all the time.

1093
01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:10.400
Bas Rutan and who's the other guy that boss ruin was on with our boy.

1094
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.410
Maranello no,
no,
no.
The other guy,
there was another guy who was on Kenny.
Kenny.

1095
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:17.570
Kenny.
Kenny.
Kenny.
Ready say rice.
Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah.

1096
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:20.040
What's it Myra on there too,
for a long time?
I don't

1097
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.140
<v 0>know.
Was moral on that.
Myra was on their mind crate.</v>

1098
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:27.120
Am I going crazy?
Kenny was on there though.
Katie.
It was definitely on there,

1099
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:28.830
but my truck was the best.

1100
01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:32.820
They used to have all these great kickboxing matches from like Amsterdam and

1101
01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:36.920
shit.
But you see ESPN now has a Pfl on it if you want to do that,

1102
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:41.760
if you're a palsy day of Pfl was on that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1103
01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.990
I would see the lunch at times.
The,
um,
I've been on a couple of times,

1104
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:50.820
but the um,
what the first nine seasons in associate by Kenny Rice.

1105
01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:55.860
Oh,
and then moral came on later.
Yeah.
Can he use to fly in from uh,
Kentucky?

1106
01:02:55.861 --> 01:03:00.340
I remember just fly and do the show.
Fly back out.
I'm like,
for sure.
Huh?

1107
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.110
Yeah.

1108
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:05.430
Well maybe really likes Kentucky and he loved it half to what do you like about

1109
01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:09.060
it?
I have,
I don't know.
Kentucky Derby once a year.
Keep you there.

1110
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.380
Is that what it is?
Bourbon.

1111
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.530
I want to go to the Kentucky Derby to let stress chronic acid.

1112
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.670
I'm so down for that.
And where did they wear suits?
Like dumb and dumber.
Yeah.

1113
01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:22.740
Yeah.
Next get sloshed off fucking bourbon.

1114
01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:26.610
Got next year I take acid and go to the derby.

1115
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.650
That buffalo trace a distillery or whatever that

1116
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:37.210
buffalo trace distillery.
Did I drink whiskey?
Ah,

1117
01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:41.130
almost every day now.
Really know what's happening there.
I don't know.

1118
01:03:41.131 --> 01:03:45.570
I'm getting older.
I got the palate for whiskey.
A lot of stress.

1119
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:48.620
What about cigars?
Do like scars?
Nope,
not my thing yet.
I like olives.

1120
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:53.280
I used to hate all this.
Love Olives now and whiskey,
dude.
I don't know why.

1121
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.360
That's hilarious.
What whiskey is this?
I'm a little more,
by the way.
Um,

1122
01:03:57.361 --> 01:04:01.620
what's it called again?
Jamie Blanton's.
Blanton's.
Blanton's.

1123
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.830
It is delicious.
I have no idea.

1124
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.370
It could have been Sam angels.
Anybody could have brought,
I don't remember.

1125
01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:11.550
Honestly.
This can't be cheap.
Just feeling this goblet,

1126
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:18.060
this grenade goblet.
They got into this game of Thrones.
Goblet is sick.

1127
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.740
Someone gave me Johnny Walker,
White Walker.
Whiskey.
Shout at night.

1128
01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:24.750
Feldman White Walker whiskey,
bringing that shit up.
Jane White Walker.

1129
01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:28.770
Whiskey limited damage.
Drones.
In addition.
I'm not drinking that Zombie pissed

1130
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:34.530
go bottles.
So sick.
I don't want people touching it.
Really?
Oh,

1131
01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:37.570
it's a collector's item in collecting.

1132
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.850
We collected bottles of game of Thrones.
Oh my God.
That shit,
Bro.

1133
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.740
Is it sold out?
Enzo Ferrari.
Oh,

1134
01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:51.660
they want that for you to have your birthday,
John.
Yeah.
Dude.

1135
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:54.930
How dope is.
That's pretty cool.
Here's a white walker.
Yeah,

1136
01:04:54.931 --> 01:04:57.900
but what do you want to be aligned with the biggest fucking assholes in the

1137
01:04:57.901 --> 01:05:02.160
realm?
Come on,
Johnny Walker.
I wish they would've Johnnie Walker with the Nazis.

1138
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:06.210
I will say with Johnny Walker Nazi Vodka.
What'd you,
what'd you buy that?
No.

1139
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:10.590
Why the fuck you bind White Walker whiskey that's or white Walker Bourbon or

1140
01:05:10.591 --> 01:05:14.490
whatever it is.
There's a Gif,
bro.
Fuck that.
They can eat the white wall.

1141
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:18.130
Can you drive my fry home bro for me?
I'll give you get hammered bad

1142
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:21.970
<v 1>when it minds stick around.
Yeah.
Shoot some arrows.</v>

1143
01:05:21.971 --> 01:05:23.650
Shoots is getting the flow tank.

1144
01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:27.580
Relax my friends relax.

1145
01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:31.120
So while there are some other good fights that happened this weekend,
oh dude,

1146
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:35.230
hop held those.
Sandra's versus Kevin Lee.
Um,
I didn't see a bro.

1147
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:38.320
That's how busy I've been.
I was at the wilder fight.
I missed the,
I know.

1148
01:05:38.321 --> 01:05:41.540
It doesn't just look good and be Kevin Lee.
Kevin and needs a new camp.

1149
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:43.920
Heavenly needs a camp.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1150
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:48.760
I think Kevin Lee should go to for us a hobby.
That's my advice or Jackson.
Well,

1151
01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:52.210
the reason why for outside Bobby is cause Kevin Lee skill set is very similar to

1152
01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:54.870
George.
Saint Pierre is quite striking,
poetic,

1153
01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:58.840
very athletic and great timing of his takedowns.

1154
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:02.460
Nobody knows how to coach that better than frost a,
it's a good idea.
Yeah.

1155
01:06:02.461 --> 01:06:05.110
It's not bad at all.
So what I think who'd old,
uh,

1156
01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.620
Aaron Peko just went to Jackson's?
Yes.
I think that's a great move to Pico.

1157
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:12.080
Oh yeah.
I hooked him up with my boy Vinny shoreman too.
So,
uh,
I,

1158
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.250
I told him that I think that he should go to frost.

1159
01:06:14.251 --> 01:06:18.880
So hobbies and I told them about Vinny shoreman,
who's a incredible mental coach.

1160
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.160
You know,
he's got to be champ.

1161
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:25.360
She believe that if he gets his shit together and goes to a legit camp because

1162
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.280
you remember it's coach passed away,
right?
Yeah.
Folders.

1163
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:31.300
Who was very close with them to Shane.
Amazing,
amazing guy.

1164
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:34.090
And so he passed away and then it was like,
he was like,
oh,

1165
01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:38.860
I'll just stay here and put together this kind of rag tag group and we'll figure

1166
01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:42.760
it out at the UFC now is at such a high level to compete with the guys he's

1167
01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:46.840
competing with.
You got to have a good camp man.
Like a legit,
yeah.
Coach,

1168
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:51.670
head coach,
leader.
It's no disrespect to any small camps or small gyms.

1169
01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:54.310
Don't have the experience.
No,
I'm not.
I'm not trying to be,

1170
01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:57.520
I'm just saying that an athlete has a small fucking window man.

1171
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:02.710
Like Kevin is a 26.
Right?
So he's got 10 years.

1172
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:05.410
The last one,
it's three out of his last four.
Yeah.
Not Good.

1173
01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:07.690
UFC don't play with that.
Chan before that,

1174
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:11.410
I was a PFL leading guys in pretty spectacular fashion.
Right.

1175
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.800
Robert Foal was his death had a tremendous impact on him as a fighter,

1176
01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:18.670
as a person.
And then he fought some really great fighters too on top of that,

1177
01:07:18.671 --> 01:07:22.350
you know,
and uh,
ally,
Quintin man,
I mean from the jump of that fight from the,

1178
01:07:22.351 --> 01:07:24.970
the get go,
when he hit him with that spinning back fist,
he let them know like,

1179
01:07:24.971 --> 01:07:28.210
this is,
you're in a dog fight,
man.
Tony Ferguson fight was a dog fight.

1180
01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.400
A dog fight.
A dog fight.
Yeah.
These guys have dogfights and uh,

1181
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:36.160
when the tour would be first and fight,
he had a staph infection clear 100%.

1182
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.670
And he looked good though.
20 hold me down was going down.
Choked out.

1183
01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:43.440
God is my fucking God,
man.
Look when you have,
you've had staff before,
right?
Yeah.

1184
01:07:43.441 --> 01:07:48.160
It's awful.
And the way it drains your body,
it drains your body.

1185
01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.390
Well the staff does too.

1186
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.790
I mean if you get it too is as far as where it is with him.

1187
01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:54.700
He's in a full infection.
He has a full infection so it's in his blood stream.

1188
01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:59.010
But the thing that fucks your cardio and your energy like like no other,

1189
01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:02.800
they antibiotics.
Fuck you.
So bad to do.
But so does the staff,

1190
01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.030
especially when it's that bad.

1191
01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.690
I mean he's got a fucking giant squirrel growing out of his tit.
Remember that?

1192
01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:10.480
What could you told DC not saying.
That's how I saw it.

1193
01:08:10.481 --> 01:08:13.330
Immediately he walked into the octagon.
I'm like,
he's got staff.

1194
01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:16.790
Got that staff out decent.
Say I go,
hey did DC I go,

1195
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:20.810
is that staff that looks like staff to me and they go do not talk about the

1196
01:08:20.811 --> 01:08:24.520
staff.
He goes,
that looks like staff to meet Joe.
These,

1197
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:26.180
he doesn't give her like,
bitch,

1198
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:29.660
you talking to Daniel Cormier there when you're talking about the guy who knows

1199
01:08:29.661 --> 01:08:32.030
stuff better than anyone.
That Guy Dan Marino,
fuck out of here.

1200
01:08:32.031 --> 01:08:33.860
It's like a wrestling coach.
Listen,

1201
01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:37.310
we would be doing a massive disservice to the viewing public if we did admit

1202
01:08:37.311 --> 01:08:39.620
that it was staff.
It's a far,
it's part of the drama.

1203
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:43.460
It's part of what makes the fights interesting.
But my take on Kevin Lee is,

1204
01:08:43.461 --> 01:08:45.560
he's a great guy.
I really,
I'm going to have him on again.

1205
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.930
He's going to come on again.
So he's the best.
He's a great person.

1206
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.710
I like talking to him tomorrow because I'll put them on the food truck.
Diarrhea.

1207
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.850
Okay.
He's great.
I'll text you.
I'll split the cost with you woody row.
Nah,

1208
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:59.420
don't worry about it.
Um,
but anyway,
um,
I,
there's a,

1209
01:08:59.421 --> 01:09:03.800
there's a defining moment in a fighter's career when they realize they need to

1210
01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:04.551
make changes.

1211
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:07.280
They're not doing things the way they should be doing them and they need to make

1212
01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:10.220
some changes.
But I think one of the reasons why you care,
and I care,

1213
01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.890
especially with Kevin,
if it was somebody else,
some other guys,

1214
01:09:12.891 --> 01:09:15.830
I won't mention names,
but with Kevin I go,
well no,
he can be champ.

1215
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.900
He just has to change a few things here.

1216
01:09:17.901 --> 01:09:20.170
You see this kid is champion in another kind of like catch,

1217
01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:21.050
keep doing what you're doing.

1218
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:24.680
He hunted or 100% is the skills and the mindset and he has the full package.

1219
01:09:24.681 --> 01:09:28.580
He looks good,
speaks good dress as well,
has the skills sign me up.

1220
01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:31.860
He's a good person to talk to.
So when you talk to him was a good feel.

1221
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:33.020
It really is a good person.

1222
01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:37.010
He's just got to make some changes and he needs a maestro.

1223
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.470
He needs a fucking conductor.
He needs a Greg Jackson.

1224
01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:45.430
Matt Hume can't get there without it.
These Duke Roufus uh,
Mike Brown at att.

1225
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:49.910
Yup.
Yup.
Do that.
Does employee on food diaries and that's amazing.
I'm sorry,

1226
01:09:49.911 --> 01:09:52.370
not my brand I does employee on,
but he's talking about Mike Brown.

1227
01:09:52.371 --> 01:09:55.700
How great is that dust in the diamond Poria and um,

1228
01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.450
he started talking about his wife,
dude.
I,

1229
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:03.080
I'm balls deep into chicken waffles,
eating the food truck,
you know,
stuff.

1230
01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.600
And he starts talking about her and we're probably 30 minutes in it.

1231
01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.970
I started getting teary eyed.
He starts container,
right?
Oh,

1232
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:11.090
he's just talking about how,
um,
cause I was telling him like,
dude,

1233
01:10:11.091 --> 01:10:12.770
it's a long journey.
However you're not like,

1234
01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.800
I can't believe you didn't stop at some point like you've been doing since

1235
01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:20.120
you're 18.
I haven't gotten stopped.
And he goes,
I wouldn't,
he was onsite.
He goes,

1236
01:10:20.121 --> 01:10:22.100
I haven't said this before.
I would've stopped.
Like I,

1237
01:10:22.101 --> 01:10:25.130
I've thought about retiring and my wife told me I can't.
She's like,

1238
01:10:25.131 --> 01:10:27.380
give me these pep talks.
And like that's nuts,
man.
How long have you been willing?

1239
01:10:27.381 --> 01:10:29.180
It goes,
oh,
she drove me to my first fight,

1240
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.070
my first fight before I got out of the car.

1241
01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:32.840
I get emotional now because before I get out of the car,

1242
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:35.970
she told me going to be world champion.
Whoa,
dude.
I got shit.
I'm like,
Dude,

1243
01:10:35.971 --> 01:10:38.780
you get me fucking chills.
I'm like,
well,
not because you are a champ,

1244
01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:42.080
people would always interim champ.
I don't care.
It's still part of chain.

1245
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.850
One of the best fighters on earth.
Pound for pound.
Yeah.
I'm 45 great.

1246
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.450
Yeah.
Top three be the best 145 pounder ever.

1247
01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.350
And he's without a doubt one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world.

1248
01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.460
Dustin beat him.
Yup.
Yeah.
There's no doubt about it.
So he said he's a champion,

1249
01:10:58.461 --> 01:11:03.360
some form.
He still,
he has a belt and then you made it.
And I told him,
I said,
uh,

1250
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:05.810
I'm terrible at this.

1251
01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:09.650
So this is me telling you this by me deflect and what I should be doing.

1252
01:11:09.651 --> 01:11:12.770
But you know you're going to fight cubby.
And I said,

1253
01:11:12.771 --> 01:11:15.690
I don't a fuck how that fight goes.
You've done it brother.

1254
01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:19.800
When you were 18 you decided to go on this journey,
become UFC champion.

1255
01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.620
You had all these dreams,
your wife,
how many sacrifices?

1256
01:11:22.621 --> 01:11:25.560
You guys have a little girl now and you're there,
man.
I said,

1257
01:11:25.561 --> 01:11:29.700
I don't care if could be beat your ass for five rounds.
You've done it,
dude.

1258
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.030
How cray.
I was pleased to hear that though.
Nobody wants to hear.

1259
01:11:33.031 --> 01:11:37.230
I don't care if could be,
but what I'm telling him is you've,
you've succeeded.

1260
01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:40.410
Mission accomplished,
mother mission,
a comp.
I went,
how crazy is that?

1261
01:11:40.411 --> 01:11:43.230
Their mission accomplished.
What did he think though?

1262
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.230
Probably doesn't think like that.
I probably thinks he's still on the quest.

1263
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.120
I don't think you can.
Do you think like that?

1264
01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:52.820
Do I think that the guys who have that weird engine in adult think like that?

1265
01:11:52.821 --> 01:11:55.740
I've never,
like I've,
I've never felt more not to make it about,

1266
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:58.230
I've never felt more pressured my life to come up with new,

1267
01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:01.500
become a better comic than when I released my special,
of course I'm like,

1268
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:03.450
Oh shit,
now,
now the work starts.

1269
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:06.600
That was whatever to how to work stone ever satisfied with myself.

1270
01:12:06.601 --> 01:12:10.290
More than like 1520 minutes a week.
Mostly.

1271
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:13.110
I wish I had 15 minutes where I was.
I couldn't tell you it was,

1272
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:16.650
I've seen 20 minutes a week I'll have a glass of wine.
I'll put my feet up,

1273
01:12:16.651 --> 01:12:21.000
I'll kick back and then the little voice in the back of my head,
it's like,

1274
01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:24.210
are you doing everything you can do?
Get up.
C'Mon.

1275
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:28.260
It's kind of a shit ton of a demon.
Those as Joe,
like 100% like my,

1276
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.740
one of my dreams was to buy the car that I bought and I bought it and we're in

1277
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:34.000
bed.
Micro goes,
how do you feel it

1278
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.390
exactly the same like I think what you like,
material things,

1279
01:12:39.391 --> 01:12:42.600
they don't matter at all and then next day we wake up my my,

1280
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:46.080
I get it when my son every morning and we always watched cars on youtube and she

1281
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:48.840
goes,
what the f?
I'm watching a different car.
She goes,
what the fuck you doing?

1282
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:51.360
I'm like looking at the next car.
She's like,
there's no way.
I'm like,
I need,

1283
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:54.750
I need goals.
As soon as we bought a,
bought our house,

1284
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.730
I swear to God the next morning she was,

1285
01:12:56.731 --> 01:12:58.860
what are you doing truly ago looking at the next house?

1286
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.650
I don't know what to do now though.
That's normal.

1287
01:13:03.651 --> 01:13:08.651
I message to Dustin was enjoying this but don't get the thing about stuff though

1288
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:14.990
as opposed to like goals is like stuff you could always just keep buying stuff

1289
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:18.870
and making money to buy stuff and then you find yourself being one of those

1290
01:13:18.871 --> 01:13:21.660
people that just does stuff for money because you want to buy this stuff.

1291
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:24.210
I've never done that.
But there are people like that out there.
Right.
You know,

1292
01:13:24.211 --> 01:13:25.890
I've heard Steve Harvey talk about money,

1293
01:13:25.891 --> 01:13:27.860
like how much money he wants to make per year and,

1294
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:31.170
and someone was making fun of it and I was thinking,
well,

1295
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.720
he's in this vibe where he's trying to get stuff and make money and you've got

1296
01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:40.730
to make money to get stuff and you get sort of in this game of accumulating more

1297
01:13:41.521 --> 01:13:44.040
and bigger and better things.
For me,

1298
01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.870
the most important thing is the stuff that I put out.
If people like it,

1299
01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:52.800
like if I do a podcast,
let's say if I do a UFC and I suck,

1300
01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.740
if I stumble through something or I make a bad call or it's not,

1301
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:58.890
that shit will fuck be up for days.

1302
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:00.930
And there's nothing you can do to nothing I could do to fix it.

1303
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:03.360
You had to get a the Lamborghini on Friday.
It's like there's enough fill.

1304
01:14:03.361 --> 01:14:07.920
That void wouldn't do a damn thing.
So same with a podcast.

1305
01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:11.710
If I do a podcast that doesn't go well,
if I do a set,

1306
01:14:11.711 --> 01:14:14.080
the set doesn't go well or stumble through a joke.

1307
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:18.430
All I care about is the stuff that I do in terms of like agree,

1308
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:21.700
like progress.
I focus all my progress in that.

1309
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:24.810
I'll distract myself with stuff,
but like look,

1310
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:27.770
this watch costs like 50 bucks or something.
I don't know.
Yeah,

1311
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:30.070
I've been taught earlier that's a taser,

1312
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:34.780
not 50 but military watch looks like 300 bucks maybe.
You know what I'm saying?

1313
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:39.370
But it doesn't matter whether that's 500 or 300 bucks or this is 22 grand.

1314
01:14:39.371 --> 01:14:43.660
Not a big deal.
22 grand,
25 grand.
It doesn't Matte American money.
Gas,
stone,

1315
01:14:43.661 --> 01:14:48.400
cold cash.
Not a big deal.
Rolex talking,
just talking shit.

1316
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:52.270
You're just talking shit.
Just talking shit,
but no Rolex.
My point is,

1317
01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.540
is this like that doesn't make you happy.
Does it make you feel anyway?

1318
01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:59.230
This doesn't make me feel any way.
None of it.
The more I learned,

1319
01:14:59.231 --> 01:15:03.550
the more I accumulate these material things.
It does.
It mean she doesn't help.

1320
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:06.610
The only thing that means shit is your friends and your loved ones and what

1321
01:15:06.611 --> 01:15:09.520
you're trying to do with your life.
Bob Dylan said it best.
He said he,
they said,

1322
01:15:09.521 --> 01:15:12.430
uh,
you know,
what's,
what's success to you?
He goes,

1323
01:15:12.431 --> 01:15:14.800
not having to work for assholes and waking up,
going to bed,

1324
01:15:14.801 --> 01:15:18.390
doing exactly what I want.
Yeah.
Boom.
Set.
Match.
You already doing.

1325
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:23.410
I'm already doing that.
The only time I ever felt,
I guess somewhat successful,

1326
01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.550
I'd really don't,

1327
01:15:24.551 --> 01:15:29.050
but the only time I felt a little successful is when I turned down a big Gig on

1328
01:15:29.051 --> 01:15:32.320
a major network to do TV.
I went,
now I'm kind of good man.

1329
01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:35.950
I'm good doing what I want to do and I own all this stuff and I don't,
I don't,

1330
01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:39.030
I'm not pressed to do it.
Do you imagine what it'd be like if you had a boss?

1331
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.720
Remember the shit that you guys were dealing with at Fox?

1332
01:15:40.721 --> 01:15:43.270
We were telling you to stop cursing on the fighter and the kid.

1333
01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.760
Hilarious to imagine how bad that advice is.

1334
01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:50.080
Think about how many fucking millions of downloads of the fighter and the kid

1335
01:15:50.081 --> 01:15:50.860
had been out there.

1336
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:54.520
How many humans on the planet earth have you could see an overhead map of all

1337
01:15:54.521 --> 01:15:55.360
the people on the planet.

1338
01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.390
A light went off every time a dude was listening to the fighter and the kid,

1339
01:15:58.410 --> 01:15:59.590
he's like,
holy fuck.

1340
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:04.050
It would freak you out and see that number and that Fox guy was like cleaning up

1341
01:16:04.051 --> 01:16:07.750
wise.
You know what that guy told me to?
I started arguing with him.

1342
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:11.320
He kind of got my face and went just like you have your black belt in the

1343
01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:16.150
octagon.
I got my black belt and TV.
Oh,
that's cool.
Shit.
God,

1344
01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:19.000
did he really say that it's got his black belt in TV?

1345
01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:21.430
Let me tell you if he got fired from Fox by the though of course you did.
Yeah.

1346
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.920
The dirty little secret is about all those guys.

1347
01:16:23.921 --> 01:16:26.800
They don't know what the fuck they're doing.
They find talented people.

1348
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:29.710
They have no idea.
If you get still should be doing that.
Yeah.

1349
01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:32.440
If you get fucking Max Kellerman,
you get all those guys.

1350
01:16:32.441 --> 01:16:34.010
Those are the guys that are on your television show.

1351
01:16:34.011 --> 01:16:35.530
The television show was going to do well.

1352
01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:38.470
If those are the guys that are doing commentary for you,
they're excellent.

1353
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:42.490
They're compelling,
you're going to listen to it.
You're not a great producer.

1354
01:16:42.491 --> 01:16:45.610
That's not why the show's great.
No,
it was talent.
You fucks.
Yeah.

1355
01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:49.930
When you're telling them a podcast,
the one free medium left on the planet earth.

1356
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:53.020
When you can distribute to millions of people and no one can tell you what the

1357
01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:57.550
fuck to do.
There's not another thing like it on earth.
Not One,
not one,

1358
01:16:57.790 --> 01:17:02.440
maybe websites,
but it's [inaudible] content you can get.
Yeah,

1359
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:07.030
and to be able to have that with no producer,
no executive,

1360
01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:10.340
no filter,
and to have it available to you while you're doing other stuff.

1361
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.670
<v 0>Right.
You could be mowing your lawn right now.
It's in your ear.
You're running,</v>

1362
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.470
it's in your ear.
You're driving to work.
It's in your ear.
You're on the subway.

1363
01:17:16.471 --> 01:17:18.180
It's in your,
no people too.
Like if,

1364
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:21.740
let's say you were a 2019 Jay Leno,

1365
01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.510
that's what you were at this like doing the shows as grilling,

1366
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.060
doing Johnny Carson at the time,
right.

1367
01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:28.700
Let's say you're that guy that states that overproduced show.

1368
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:32.450
No one really gets to know.
Did you know Johnny Carson from the tonight show?

1369
01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:36.080
Do you know Jay Leno?
No.
It's one when they went on to do stuff after the fact,

1370
01:17:36.081 --> 01:17:39.640
but now people know you pretty fucking well,
people know me pretty well.

1371
01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:42.530
Pretty well.
Yeah.
You're not on board or you're not.
Yeah,
it's different.

1372
01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:45.230
It's different.
But even Conan talked about that,
how,

1373
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.730
you know when he was doing the cone and I heard my Howard stern and he was
doing,

1374
01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:54.020
he said,
well I do the Conan show and you know,
we had a band and it would,

1375
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.400
I was going through this interview,

1376
01:17:55.401 --> 01:17:58.940
but at the stop it like I was in balls deep in this interview,
man,

1377
01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:02.090
I have to stop it because the band's playing.
We've got to get to that.

1378
01:18:02.091 --> 01:18:05.720
Or we go to the next bit and he's like,
no,
no,
no.
Just let me go,
man.

1379
01:18:05.721 --> 01:18:06.830
Let me have this conversation.

1380
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:09.980
So he's even come over to podcasting and even Howard stern goes,

1381
01:18:09.981 --> 01:18:13.010
well that's one of the reasons I want to do long form is because they want to

1382
01:18:13.011 --> 01:18:16.140
overproduce all this stuff.
But if I,
if I have to get to,
you know,

1383
01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.080
I want to talk to somebody,
I want to get to know him.

1384
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:19.940
I don't want to cut to commercial breaks.

1385
01:18:19.941 --> 01:18:22.610
I don't have to cut for this band or this bit.
You want to do,

1386
01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:23.840
let me talk to this guy,
man.

1387
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:26.140
Well there's a lot of guys that are still cutting their podcast off with

1388
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:29.120
commercials.
They'll stop in the middle and do a commercial.
Do you guys do that?

1389
01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:33.710
Uh,
we've done it before.
I don't know if we currently do.
We just left.
Um,

1390
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:37.220
our current advertisers was a nightmare.
We just signed with paragon,

1391
01:18:37.221 --> 01:18:41.180
shout it to paragon.
So,
um,
you know,
I don't know,
sometimes we might,

1392
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:46.340
sometimes you might Joe,
to be honest with you,
but you know what we are doing,

1393
01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:49.010
if you're going to do it,
you're only going to do it once,
right?
Once.
Yeah.

1394
01:18:49.011 --> 01:18:52.790
But what's different with king in this thing is so when we do our read,

1395
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:55.460
I don't you guys do it before and there's no video,

1396
01:18:55.461 --> 01:19:00.320
but we do it mean Theo do it together on camera and have fun with it.

1397
01:19:00.321 --> 01:19:03.920
So it's part of the show,
different animals.
Theo doing a read for it.

1398
01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:09.260
I don't wanna read for this financial thing and he goes and you can save I think

1399
01:19:09.261 --> 01:19:13.430
$75 a year.
And I,
when I said $75 a year,

1400
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:17.780
you know I didn't preread I $75 I cut a crack.
And then Theo goes,

1401
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:22.720
yeah,
a smooth $75 a year.
You go dude.

1402
01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:25.580
And financial people get mad at you.
I don't know.
I don't give a fuck.

1403
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:28.530
We were laughing so hard.
I go,
yeah,
go with him.

1404
01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:31.130
Get $75 is that really what they're offering?

1405
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:34.640
And forget 70 7,575 but well,

1406
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:39.070
7,500 different dif.
I forget what it was,
but yeah,

1407
01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:41.270
it was something super low and I could not stop laughing.

1408
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.430
Then Theo start laughing.
They left it in.

1409
01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.240
I feel like that reed would do better than than the others maybe,

1410
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:49.790
but it would be too.
It would do better in terms of financial,

1411
01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:52.370
I mean a about in terms of clicks,

1412
01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:56.150
but it probably wouldn't do better in terms of people like going there and using

1413
01:19:56.151 --> 01:20:00.260
the product.
[inaudible] funny,
great.
They don't matter.
It doesn't matter.

1414
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:03.080
It doesn't matter.
We've got,
we'll find someone else.
Yeah.
That's the thing.

1415
01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:03.740
It's like an animal.

1416
01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:07.980
You have too many podcast sponsors who's days I'd say no to him every day.
I get

1417
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.680
<v 1>tons of them coming in.
Yeah,
I bet.
But it's not.</v>

1418
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:15.900
It's got to make some sense Peskin that connect with what you're going to be a

1419
01:20:15.901 --> 01:20:19.230
good thing too.
It's like gotta be a valuable product.
Yeah.

1420
01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:22.470
You gave me the best advice ever when when I started doing uh,

1421
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.140
advertising on podcasts because there's a while before we started doing it.

1422
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.770
You better believe in it,
man.
You Sell Shit people and stop tuning in.

1423
01:20:28.771 --> 01:20:29.670
They're not going to believe you.

1424
01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:32.640
I've had a bunch of things that I turned down because I w I researched it and I

1425
01:20:32.641 --> 01:20:35.700
was like,
what is this?
How does that work?
Yeah,
Brian's great at that.

1426
01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.800
And I was like,
oh,
this is sketchy.
There was one of them.

1427
01:20:37.801 --> 01:20:39.960
They want to do an Uber for babysitting.
I'm like,
yet,

1428
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.290
that's a fuck here out of here,
don't you?
Crazy.

1429
01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:44.970
The biggest argument Cowan I ever gotten,

1430
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:49.470
I fucking 90 year relationship is burger king came towards us and I,

1431
01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:53.430
I grew up eating burger king,
man.
I grew up in a whopper with cheese.

1432
01:20:53.431 --> 01:20:57.390
Not every day,
but I'd fucking have one.
We've got them American.
Brian said,
no.

1433
01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.300
Yeah.
He's like,
we can't push that off.
And we got in the straight up argument.

1434
01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.300
How did end?
Uh,
I think we did burger king rate.

1435
01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:10.090
Shout out to Burger King.
They're hungry and they're open.
Yeah.

1436
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:11.400
Fucking a whopper with cheese.

1437
01:21:11.401 --> 01:21:14.520
The Best Burger on planet earth that fuck you in the now that's not true.

1438
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:20.280
So not true.
Catch up.
Only take you to a doctor right now and get a cat scan.

1439
01:21:20.290 --> 01:21:24.670
You like [inaudible] fucking double from in and out.

1440
01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:27.810
Side note,
I can't do and then on day two or five guys,

1441
01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:30.190
burgers fabric or five guys over in it now,

1442
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:36.390
but we can agree on one thing.
I told them guys,
Nazis,
not five,
not,
not,

1443
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:40.560
not in and out.
What's in it for a number one much for number one.

1444
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:44.970
I like five guys and I look in and out like five guys.
Number one though.
Yeah,

1445
01:21:44.971 --> 01:21:48.540
I think I like five guys better because five guys offers bacon and also

1446
01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:49.351
Jalapenos.

1447
01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:53.040
I'm not just water the speed of in and out of such deterrent to sometimes it

1448
01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:57.360
takes a long time.
How dare you.
The one right up here.

1449
01:21:57.450 --> 01:21:59.850
Well five guys,
doesn't that drive through though,
right?

1450
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.550
Five guys doesn't do the drive.
They're like pitch,
sit down,

1451
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:06.960
come on in and they have milkshakes at in and out.
That's a big plus.

1452
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:10.830
If you're ready to fuck your body up,
it's poisoned food that tastes great.

1453
01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:14.430
Depth shakes,
shakes,
do it to you till they'll give it to you.
Dude,

1454
01:22:14.431 --> 01:22:16.840
I've been so stressed out with this special ed.
My Diet.

1455
01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:20.670
You work out to crate my diet.
All that.
Get girls pregnant.
Yeah.

1456
01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.180
Pickles and ice cream and shit.
She's like,

She tired.
Um,

Oh,

1458
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:32.250
I don't know what it is,
dude.
It's no fun.
I'm going to fuck dude.
Old Stress.

1459
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:35.340
They've actually said that the people under stress make poor decisions.

1460
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:40.670
Poor decisions,
cheating.
Everything was to really,
yeah.
People.

1461
01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.940
People make poor decisions.

1462
01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:44.400
Foodwise I did buy a front end of eat pizza every night.

1463
01:22:44.401 --> 01:22:47.460
Maybe you might be on to something.
Yeah,
I think you're a,
you're freaking out.

1464
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.590
Not freaking out though.
A little bit.

1465
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:53.370
You think it's okay and we'll figure that normal.
No,
no.
You're not freaking out,

1466
01:22:53.371 --> 01:22:54.204
but you're under stress.

1467
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:59.240
You Look [inaudible] I'm getting judged by hundreds of thousands of people's.

1468
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:02.130
Very weird.
It's weird.
Yeah.
It's weird.
And every time I do it,

1469
01:23:02.131 --> 01:23:04.930
I stay offline for weeks.
Yeah.
That's what you told me to stay offline.

1470
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:09.400
Can read it.
Like I do my best.
I try hard.
I do my best.

1471
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:12.790
And you might like it.
You might not like it,
but I do my best and when I'm done,

1472
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.130
as long as I know I did my best,
I can just release it.

1473
01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.380
I've been able to do that for triggered and I did that for a strange time.

1474
01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:21.220
Switched over.
I was like,
I'm good,
I'm good.
I mean,
you might like,

1475
01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:24.230
you might not like it,
but I couldn't have done it better.
You don't mind.

1476
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:26.020
Thing is,
is,
uh,
the,

1477
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:29.370
I think with anything as you get more popular with,

1478
01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:32.860
with its do podcasting or stand up or whatever you do,

1479
01:23:32.861 --> 01:23:34.440
if you're an artist you put on the album for,

1480
01:23:34.441 --> 01:23:36.610
you're paying your pet out of painting.
If you're a fighter to take a flight,

1481
01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:39.550
it's a big fight on your track.
More eyeballs.

1482
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.850
You can get a lot more people that love it.
Then you,

1483
01:23:41.851 --> 01:23:44.290
a lot of you can get more hate because you're out there more.

1484
01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:48.040
So also you being shoved down people's faces.
Yeah.

1485
01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:51.190
Because you're going to do a lot of press.
Yeah,
man.
That's why I don't do press.

1486
01:23:51.191 --> 01:23:53.810
It's one of the reasons why I know you gotta love.
You don't have to.
I don't do,

1487
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:59.640
I don't want to,
I don't want anybody to have to listen to me.
I don't,
I don't,

1488
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:02.870
I don't want you had such a different level than I have.
I have to do.
I know,

1489
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.240
I guess a little bit,
you know what I'm saying?

1490
01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:07.380
But I don't do it for stand up anymore.
When I go to towns,

1491
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:11.590
I'm not depressed anymore.
Beautiful.
But when you're getting 100% your fans.
Yes.

1492
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:13.900
And also with,
with the special,

1493
01:24:13.901 --> 01:24:17.530
it's different because I didn't want like our group,

1494
01:24:17.531 --> 01:24:21.310
like you guys who vouched for me or especially show time,
who was like,

1495
01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:23.320
let's give to kids.
Especially,
I didn't want to embarrass embarrassed.

1496
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:27.100
I want it to go well for them.
Like,
you know?
Yeah,
no,
no.
What you're saying.

1497
01:24:27.101 --> 01:24:29.620
Like I want them back.
All right,
we're proud of this,
which they are.

1498
01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:32.650
So I should be good with that.
You know?
And I know you guys are proud of me,

1499
01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:36.040
so I should be good with that.
Just provide,
give a fuck you,
you're,
you're,

1500
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:39.100
you're trying to get better with something that's very difficult to do.

1501
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.190
Some say the most difficult than,
than you put out a special two years in,

1502
01:24:42.191 --> 01:24:44.140
which is ridiculous.
I told you not to do it.

1503
01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.510
Of course you wanted to come to me with,
uh,
but uh,
but yeah,

1504
01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:48.610
I knew you were going to do it.
So you guys know me.

1505
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.660
I mean we went down there and we helped you out.
We opened for you.
We,
you know,

1506
01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:53.650
it was time.

1507
01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:57.550
It was a great time and you're going to look back on it like in eight years from

1508
01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:59.950
now when you have a,
another killer special out,

1509
01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.370
well you don't like or several down the line.
Yeah.

1510
01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.410
When you think you'll do another one,
do you think you wait another two years?

1511
01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:08.870
Like have you thought about three years before I was talking to week?

1512
01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:11.620
I don't mean to interrupt you.
I think it's sweet.
Cool to look back and go,

1513
01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:15.340
holy fuck yous three years in this way he did.
And then four years from now,

1514
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:18.700
see the progression for your phone and see the progression.
Yes.

1515
01:25:18.701 --> 01:25:22.600
And you can go back and look.
I think that's to me fucking cool,
man.
Yeah.
Oh,
100%.

1516
01:25:22.601 --> 01:25:26.260
Yeah.
Listen,
man,
there's some videos me from when I first started out,

1517
01:25:26.261 --> 01:25:28.480
they're terrible.
There's no way you're not going to be,

1518
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.050
you're going to be terrible.
Yes sir.
You're,

1519
01:25:30.051 --> 01:25:31.870
you're just learning how to do something again.

1520
01:25:31.871 --> 01:25:35.740
It's like judging your roles when you a wipe out versus your roles as a black

1521
01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:38.200
for sure.
It's like you don't know what you're doing.
Yeah.

1522
01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:42.850
You're fucking flailing around.
It's real similar.
Yep.
That's fine,
man.
It's,
it's,

1523
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:45.460
uh,
were you gonna say though about specials most?
Most,

1524
01:25:45.461 --> 01:25:48.250
like especially seasoned once every,
I think three years.

1525
01:25:48.251 --> 01:25:51.820
What Kevin say for why I was gonna say Jessalyn Nick Jeff's neck has a really

1526
01:25:51.821 --> 01:25:55.900
interesting thought process on it and he was telling me that he does,

1527
01:25:56.230 --> 01:25:59.410
he did the podcast recently.
I love him,
by the way.
I do too.
He's great.

1528
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.200
He's fucks a comptroller,
man.
Outstanding.
He's a new special fasten.
Yeah.

1529
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:06.200
And it's on Netflix.
It's available right now.
Just came out amazing.

1530
01:26:06.201 --> 01:26:09.050
What's it called?
Thoughts and prayers is that it?
I think sell thoughts in pairs.

1531
01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:13.220
Um,
anyway,
that might be his other one.
He's about several,

1532
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:17.020
but his new one just dropped on Netflix like a few weeks ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1533
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:18.030
I don't think it's thoughts and purse.

1534
01:26:18.031 --> 01:26:20.480
I think thoughts or personal fire in the maternity ward.

1535
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:24.890
Close fire in the maternity ward.

1536
01:26:24.891 --> 01:26:29.210
So what he does is he works on the material for a year,
like in La.

1537
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:32.860
He just does like little,
little sets here and there and publish together,

1538
01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.980
puts together his hour.

1539
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:37.160
Then he takes his hour on the road and does clubs for a year.

1540
01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:41.510
Just clubs from one year to,
then he does theaters for a year,

1541
01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:45.170
three and at the end of that year he films,
so every three years,

1542
01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.250
which is not a bad idea if you don't get tired of your shit.

1543
01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:52.040
The problem as you do a lot of sets,
like I'll do four sets a night.

1544
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:56.900
Sometimes I get really tired.
Your Shit,
I get tired.
I get tired of new bits.
Yeah.

1545
01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:59.630
Especially during that many times.
Doe?
Yes.
It's hard.

1546
01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:03.890
It's hard to stay motivated the same bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it's also,
look,

1547
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:08.330
I feel so lucky that I can do it.
I feel so lucky.

1548
01:27:08.331 --> 01:27:09.590
Like every time I go to do a set,

1549
01:27:09.591 --> 01:27:12.300
like I went to the store last night and hanging out in the back would

1550
01:27:12.301 --> 01:27:14.720
Fitzsimmons and Ian Edwards and Owen Smith,

1551
01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:17.900
who I'm trying to convince Owen Smith and never write again cause I think he's

1552
01:27:17.901 --> 01:27:21.740
the fucking own Smith Cambridge up to do you gotta come see him.

1553
01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:26.590
That guy's a monster.
She burst.
So Goshen the other night he sighed.

1554
01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.290
Oh and Smith is so good and he's got this gig where he's,
he's,

1555
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:32.280
he's always writing,
but there's an,

1556
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:35.930
there's a writer's strike right now is he's a ride for like a major series,

1557
01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:39.830
Tom's and shit.
But dude,
his stand ups out of control.

1558
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:44.030
So he came with us to that super nice dude.
He's the bass.
Really Nice.
Super.

1559
01:27:44.031 --> 01:27:47.060
So it that a little Josh Martin,
Josh,
she's fucking charge to cheeto.

1560
01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:49.250
Santina was fucking amazing.
That was a killer show.

1561
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:51.560
We did two shows at the Improv.
We're doing more of those too.

1562
01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:56.080
He ends up fucking gain.
Kids are killer to the rider too.
Yep.
Same deal.
Same,

1563
01:27:56.081 --> 01:27:57.920
same deal.
And I tried to talk to him about it to,

1564
01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.530
Ian's been on the road with me for years and years.

1565
01:28:00.531 --> 01:28:03.440
He opened for me when I did triggered,
he took,

1566
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:06.850
I've taken them on the road for years.
He's amazing.
This guy in the world nights,

1567
01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:10.130
he's so nice to him.
Nicest guy.
Someone Santina.
Santina was a nice,

1568
01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.030
he's a man's man.
Santiago,
that guy.
I love that going.

1569
01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.750
Let me to have a close bond was in shut up a cheeto.
Um,
you know who I podcast?

1570
01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:21.310
Tiger Bell.
I did with Bobby Lee.
I told him,
I said,
you owe,

1571
01:28:21.650 --> 01:28:26.540
you owe it to comedy.
Do a fucking special man.
At least 30 minutes.
And he goes,

1572
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:29.980
and he goes,
I think,
I think that's my broken.
Won't have me on.

1573
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:33.050
He's disappointed in me.
I went,
I just think you get your shit together.

1574
01:28:33.051 --> 01:28:36.470
Do a specialist.
Well,
that's not true that it won't have mine.
Every time I say,

1575
01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.160
Oh,
do you want to come on my podcast?
He runs away.
He's sleeping,
he gets panicky.

1576
01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:43.220
Well he doesn't wake up to one,
but he gets panicky.
I don't know why.

1577
01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:47.360
He's a great dude.
He's got stuff in his head that shouldn't be in there.

1578
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:50.990
It's also smart dude.
He has a lot to say.
Oh yeah,
I love Bobby.
Right on here,

1579
01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:51.290
dude.

1580
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:54.380
I've been friends with Bobby Lee's since [inaudible] 96 it's been a commie for a

1581
01:28:54.381 --> 01:28:58.450
hot second.
That dude forever just started doing economy thing cause I'll start,

1582
01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:01.010
let me kill this trip club in San Diego.

1583
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:04.380
That's what we started in Mexican gang bangers with tattoos on their face and

1584
01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:05.700
long black hair.

1585
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:08.790
Bobby Lee's trying to tell the girlfriend to give him a lap dance and I had to

1586
01:29:08.791 --> 01:29:11.610
grab him and drag him the fuck out of here.
I'm like,
listen to me,
Bobby,

1587
01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.970
listen to me.
Those guys are serious.
We gotta get the fuck out of here now.

1588
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:17.350
And he's like,
fuck those guys are here to do shit.
And I'm like,

1589
01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:20.790
I will fucking leave you here.
I'm like,
I'm going.

1590
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:24.930
I jumped in my super turbo and we fucking hauled ass out of there and Bobby

1591
01:29:24.931 --> 01:29:27.090
leaves in the backseat.
I was like,
probably shut the fuck up.

1592
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:30.660
They were going to kill you.
You have no idea.
I'm like a certain dudes.

1593
01:29:30.661 --> 01:29:33.870
You looked him in the eye and you go,
oh,
this guy's for real.

1594
01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.360
They got the eyes great white shark.
Yeah.
And like,
look,

1595
01:29:36.361 --> 01:29:39.150
I'm not the most street smart dude.
I'm not saying that,

1596
01:29:39.151 --> 01:29:42.350
but I can read a room though.
I can read predators.
Yeah.

1597
01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:46.500
I've been around a lot of fucking stone cold killers in my life and now I saw

1598
01:29:46.501 --> 01:29:48.540
that guy and I was like,
oh,
okay sir.

1599
01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:51.720
I'm gonna just take my little friend and stuff from the back seat of my fucking

1600
01:29:51.721 --> 01:29:56.130
Japanese car and peel out of here.
Is it Toyota Supra?
Yeah,
Dude.
It was scary.

1601
01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:59.610
Bobby was so ridiculous.
So you're not gonna do shit.
I'm like,
oh Jesus Christ.

1602
01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:04.470
I was like,
get in the fucking car,
man.
Come on.
So fun.
You gotta get Outta here.

1603
01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.950
That was my introduction to Bobby Lee because he was working at the La Jolla

1604
01:30:07.951 --> 01:30:10.440
comedies because it saves a door guy.
That's how he started.

1605
01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:14.340
I don't even remember how we wound up at that fucking strip club because like

1606
01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:17.700
all I remember was like the world zoomed in,

1607
01:30:17.701 --> 01:30:21.930
like goes looking at it through a a toilet paper roll a group and I'm looking at

1608
01:30:21.931 --> 01:30:26.931
this Mexican gang banger who stood up with his hands out there like this and,

1609
01:30:26.961 --> 01:30:30.990
and Bobby Lee is act like it's not a big deal.
I'm like,
oh my God,

1610
01:30:30.991 --> 01:30:34.980
we're gonna die holy photos like that.
Just moments where you like,

1611
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:39.180
you almost get hit by a car.
Like that's,
that's what it felt like.
I was like,

1612
01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:42.520
oh my God,
Bobby.
Like that guy's a real criminal.
Like this.

1613
01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:43.560
We gotta get Outta here.

1614
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:47.610
And his girl was one of the dancers and Bobby was apparently trying to get his

1615
01:30:47.611 --> 01:30:52.410
girl to give him a lap dance.
Oh,
we ran out of there,

1616
01:30:52.411 --> 01:30:54.030
man.
We fucking hauled ass.

1617
01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:58.290
I drove very fast and I got off the first exit and I turned around and went back

1618
01:30:58.291 --> 01:31:00.150
the other way.
Just in case someone was following me,

1619
01:31:00.151 --> 01:31:03.960
I was making sure no one was following me.
Jesus.
I was like,
this is real.
Bobby.

1620
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.510
Bobby's hilarious.
We were talking about La Jolla comedy club.

1621
01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:09.710
I was telling how like specialists to me clinically,

1622
01:31:09.930 --> 01:31:12.990
no stuff about staying in the condo.
And I was,
I would go,
oh,

1623
01:31:12.991 --> 01:31:15.630
it was great because they have redundant and Jim Carrey state there and he's my

1624
01:31:15.631 --> 01:31:19.230
hero.
So you know,
for me,
especially us,
man,
we have a deal.
He goes,

1625
01:31:19.231 --> 01:31:22.230
I wish I had the same kind of admiration for that,

1626
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:26.520
that comedy store in La Jolla Condo.
He goes,
cause when I was there,
uh,

1627
01:31:26.521 --> 01:31:29.820
I forget the comic stained with some gay comic.
He goes,
he,
he,

1628
01:31:29.821 --> 01:31:34.200
they used to take like 14 dudes back there and run trains and come all over the

1629
01:31:34.201 --> 01:31:38.640
walls.
He goes,
that's why the walls were blue for a long time.
Went,
oh,

1630
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:41.940
I don't know if that's true.
He says,
Christ Bobby.
I don't know if that's true.

1631
01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:46.130
[inaudible] it's a lot of these,
a lot of adding to that,
you know,

1632
01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:49.160
maybe there's just one guy named on God on the wall.
You guys came in,

1633
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:53.390
you guys and sandy are running the tray.
It's not that far fetched.
Yeah.

1634
01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:57.930
You don't have to say,
do you know who the hodge twins are?
Yes,
they do.

1635
01:31:57.931 --> 01:32:02.200
You know about it?
Comment.
They have to,
they have a fucking,
there's a,

1636
01:32:02.201 --> 01:32:05.470
they were reading an article about men getting pregnant like that.

1637
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.120
Women aren't the only ones who can get pregnant

1638
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.810
because the way they talk,
you know,
you know the way they talk,

1639
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:14.140
their big old Jack Dudes,
you know,

1640
01:32:14.141 --> 01:32:17.680
and I'm on the podcast interview and they get seriously amped up,

1641
01:32:17.681 --> 01:32:20.560
but they were talking about busting a nut inside of Dude's ass.

1642
01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.840
You cannot get them pregnant about how deep you go in that man's anus and

1643
01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:30.130
they're the same.
They're like,
yeah,
they talk fucking like,
because dude,

1644
01:32:30.131 --> 01:32:35.010
because people are saying some crazy shit.
That's not,
that's a crazy,
yes,

1645
01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:39.580
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
This is a real argument.
You know,

1646
01:32:39.581 --> 01:32:43.060
Yale started putting tampons.
Dispensers,

1647
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.700
get the fuck in the men's room because they said,

1648
01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:50.110
not everyone who menstruates is a woman.

1649
01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:56.950
Hi.
Hi.
Welcome to the upside down world.
Wow.
Did you ever,
uh,

1650
01:32:57.010 --> 01:32:59.650
did you ever watch a stranger thrilling come to Trump's for this?

1651
01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.810
What you were watched stranger things?
Fuck yeah.
I love that.

1652
01:33:01.811 --> 01:33:05.320
We're in the opposite down.
The world is upside down right now.

1653
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:07.990
That's what's happening.
So disciplined,
flipped over to the other side.

1654
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:10.000
People are getting,
they're so progressive.

1655
01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:13.180
They're literally denying science for PR for feelings.

1656
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:17.350
Do you feel like a woman then you're a woman.
Fuck,

1657
01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:21.250
I gave her identify as a woman.
Do you feel like a man will then you're a man.

1658
01:33:22.150 --> 01:33:26.350
Amazing man,
Bro.
Congratulations.
You're going to make the best mom,
dad,

1659
01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:28.660
whatever the fuck did I ever dad,
mom,

1660
01:33:29.230 --> 01:33:32.860
these dudes are coming and dude's ass and say they can pray.
It's a funny,

1661
01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:37.350
it's a funny little thing that they did.
Did you find it?
I was looking for it.

1662
01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:37.751
They made me,

1663
01:33:37.751 --> 01:33:40.610
I stumbled across that mouth they just talked about which was you just talking.

1664
01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.110
They're all over youtube there.

1665
01:33:42.670 --> 01:33:46.090
What does this meet the formerly transgender man who now identifies as a

1666
01:33:46.091 --> 01:33:48.100
genderless alien.
Oh yeah,
I seen that.
Did.

1667
01:33:48.101 --> 01:33:50.260
We showed that guy before his surgery and shit

1668
01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:54.910
set a bunch of surgery to look like an alien.
I don't give a fuck.

1669
01:33:54.911 --> 01:33:58.210
Just don't force it on me that I'd have to,
if I fuck him,
call you a him.
Yeah.

1670
01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:02.080
I say congratulations to them.
Yeah,
there you go.
You've made it.

1671
01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.960
Congrats man.
A lot of people want to be special,

1672
01:34:04.961 --> 01:34:06.190
but they don't want to work for it.

1673
01:34:06.250 --> 01:34:08.440
And the problem with that is you get that kind of shit.

1674
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:11.680
You get people that are pretending to be something super special to get

1675
01:34:11.681 --> 01:34:15.280
attention so they get attention and you're not doing anything and there's

1676
01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:19.120
nothing there.
You know what I really love?

1677
01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:21.350
I had Eddie Izzard on who's,
uh,

1678
01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:25.540
probably one of the most famous transgender people ever and just,

1679
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:29.920
I did a search engine.
I saw your picture.
Just decided.
He,
that's what he likes.

1680
01:34:30.490 --> 01:34:35.140
And we,
once you get past that and just talk to him,
he's amazing humans.

1681
01:34:35.141 --> 01:34:38.620
A human man.
He's amazing.
I don't care what I care is,

1682
01:34:38.621 --> 01:34:43.330
when you say crazy things like men can get pregnant,
that's insane.

1683
01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.650
That's not real.
Have you had crested back,

1684
01:34:45.651 --> 01:34:49.450
done the navy and was running for governor.
I don't know what she's doing now,

1685
01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:54.451
but we cal and I went to lunch with her afterwards and normal shit man.

1686
01:34:55.151 --> 01:34:57.320
Normal also talked like bike,

1687
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:59.990
like you might go when you were in battle this and just talks like,

1688
01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:02.750
like a fucking human because he only give a fuck.
Yeah.
All right.

1689
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:04.010
You want to wear a dress?
Yeah.

1690
01:35:04.011 --> 01:35:06.800
Everyone's looking at you cause you got the physique of me and he got a fucking

1691
01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:09.170
miniskirt on.
All right.
Whatever.
Who Cares?

1692
01:35:09.230 --> 01:35:11.420
Who gives a fuck you and once you get used to it,

1693
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.110
like you're used to the way people dress,
period.
Yes.
You used to everything.

1694
01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:18.560
You know,
it's just nonsense.
It's nonsense.

1695
01:35:18.561 --> 01:35:22.790
Like I don't care.
As long as you're not hurting me,
you're hurting someone else.

1696
01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:27.560
I don't want cash in it on care.
Don't push it on.
Betty is there and say what?

1697
01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:31.070
Like he always felt like that this is a man can have babies now

1698
01:35:33.090 --> 01:35:34.850
areas by the way,
look got angry,

1699
01:35:34.851 --> 01:35:38.390
shut up to the Hodgkin's tobacco play this.
Jamie,

1700
01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:40.700
can we play it or we get pulled?
We'll probably get some Twitter.

1701
01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:43.830
We'll get pulled.
Nah,
no,
no,
no.
It's their show here.
The volume.

1702
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:46.610
Just hear the audio though and just,
no,
no,
no.
We'll just tell people what is the,

1703
01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.230
just decides men can have babies now and it's on their youtube.

1704
01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:54.870
You can we hear it really broke copyright laws.
No,

1705
01:35:55.830 --> 01:36:00.370
it doesn't matter.
We don't have to edit it out later.
Haters,
haters.

1706
01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:01.670
It's just look,

1707
01:36:01.671 --> 01:36:05.390
you tubes in a weird place right now in terms of copyright and we've gotten

1708
01:36:05.391 --> 01:36:09.530
claims on us for watching something on a screen in the background.

1709
01:36:09.531 --> 01:36:13.430
Like you see a picture in a picture and you,
you don't even hear it.

1710
01:36:13.670 --> 01:36:16.850
And they want all the ad revenue for the entire show.
How about the LG?

1711
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:20.000
That's ridiculous.
So Erin,
how about the,
when the combine guy,

1712
01:36:20.001 --> 01:36:23.330
we're talking about his dick that got flagged when I was like,
Hey,

1713
01:36:23.331 --> 01:36:27.470
she's dick popped out for tack for nudity.
Yeah,
I come on,

1714
01:36:27.471 --> 01:36:29.410
come on his fucking Dick.

1715
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:34.250
You have to have hopped out and you'd have to pause it and just go frame by

1716
01:36:34.251 --> 01:36:34.791
frame and go,

1717
01:36:34.791 --> 01:36:38.750
is that the desk kind of pixelated and they sound there for half a second.

1718
01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.530
Don't even know what you're looking at if I don't tell you.
And well,

1719
01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:46.970
what youtube is doing is making a boatload of cash.
They know what they're doing.

1720
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.500
Oh my God,
I just don't run the way they run the world.
Well between Facebook,

1721
01:36:51.501 --> 01:36:55.310
youtube,
Twitter,
Instagram,
youtube,
Facebook owns Instagram.
No,

1722
01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:58.880
they all in the world.
Look,
Facebook is changing elections.

1723
01:36:58.970 --> 01:37:01.190
Facebook is influencing the way the world votes.

1724
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:04.820
Did you hear what they're going to start doing with the,
I think it's Instagram.

1725
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:07.750
They're going to start.
Uh,
you can,
as the user,
you're,

1726
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:09.350
you're owner of your own page,

1727
01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.190
but the rest of the world can't see your followers and likes.
Huh.

1728
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:17.640
That's interesting because kids in high school and I then I can with a three

1729
01:37:17.641 --> 01:37:20.480
year old son.
It's scary worlds was social media,
I'm sure with your daughters,

1730
01:37:20.481 --> 01:37:23.120
you can understand is people suicide,

1731
01:37:23.121 --> 01:37:26.390
especially in teenage girls has never been higher because they're putting so

1732
01:37:26.391 --> 01:37:30.380
much,
so much weighs on their social media.
So how many followers,

1733
01:37:30.381 --> 01:37:33.740
how many likes they get,
so we get rid of that might help.
Well,
you know,

1734
01:37:33.741 --> 01:37:37.420
they're reaching the same kind of people that we're talking about.

1735
01:37:37.450 --> 01:37:40.010
We're talking about haters,
but they're reaching it like local,

1736
01:37:40.011 --> 01:37:43.820
like their friends and people from school and they're shitting on each other and

1737
01:37:43.821 --> 01:37:46.490
being mean to each other and they don't understand what that does to a person

1738
01:37:46.491 --> 01:37:49.670
yet they don't have compassion the way a grown adult has.

1739
01:37:49.671 --> 01:37:51.650
When they understand they have perspective,

1740
01:37:51.651 --> 01:37:55.260
they understand what kind of emotional influence it's going to have on a person.

1741
01:37:55.261 --> 01:37:58.320
When you shit on him like that,
I've seen it happen,
man.
It's not pretty.

1742
01:37:58.410 --> 01:38:00.420
But also like when you and I were bullied,

1743
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:04.020
especially you back in the day when you're bullied,
you could go home,

1744
01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:07.230
you'd think about it,
but you didn't have to constantly get it all.

1745
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:09.540
If your daughter's been bullied at school?
Well,

1746
01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:13.860
she goes home at three o'clock and now it's on the Maya and then they gang up

1747
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:17.700
and then this person from another school gangs up in this person from Ohio,

1748
01:38:17.701 --> 01:38:20.470
gangs up and then they're all fucking taken fire.

1749
01:38:20.471 --> 01:38:23.250
I've seen them play little games with each other too.
It's weird.

1750
01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:26.310
It's weird watching kids play little emotional head games with each other.

1751
01:38:26.311 --> 01:38:30.900
I was like,
Jesus Christ,
like people are button pushers,
right?
They see a button,

1752
01:38:30.901 --> 01:38:33.300
they push it,
they want to see what it does and they find out does something.

1753
01:38:33.301 --> 01:38:35.130
They want to push it again,
make it do that thing again.

1754
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.460
When you find out you can make someone upset,
you press their buttons.

1755
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:42.390
You know there's girlfriends do that.
Boyfriends do that.
Friends,
lovers,

1756
01:38:42.391 --> 01:38:44.550
family members,
people press buttons.

1757
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:47.190
But I've had family members that would do that.

1758
01:38:47.190 --> 01:38:49.110
They would just press buttons just to fuck with you and I.

1759
01:38:50.130 --> 01:38:54.030
But even on social media,
it's like people can press buttons if you,

1760
01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:57.210
if you let them know that that button gets to you.
Right?
I,
I never,

1761
01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:01.740
I never punched down.
So if the,
if it's a guy with an egg for an Avatar,
so,

1762
01:39:01.741 --> 01:39:02.281
and I don't know,

1763
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:06.030
I never ever very rarely I've punched down or coming back and an average,

1764
01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:06.990
that's what they want.
Right.

1765
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:11.850
What's interesting to me is it affects people like Kevin Duran who's possibly

1766
01:39:11.851 --> 01:39:15.330
the best basketball player on planet earth and he just got into a Twitter war

1767
01:39:15.331 --> 01:39:17.700
with just like he's been known to have fake accounts,

1768
01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:22.350
burner accounts defending himself online,
caught doing that.
He this,

1769
01:39:22.351 --> 01:39:23.220
this um,

1770
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:27.810
this guy who works a commentator and Alice for Fox was like,
oh,

1771
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.240
critiquing him,
he started firing back at him.

1772
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:34.520
Then another guy like a troll with 55 followers talk shit to,

1773
01:39:34.570 --> 01:39:38.870
he fires back.
What are you doing?
But here's the,
here's the message with them.

1774
01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:42.240
I see all that.
I'm like,
God,
what the fuck is he doing?
I'm like,
Holy Fuck.

1775
01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:45.660
If Kevin Duran,
who's worth $600 million,

1776
01:39:45.690 --> 01:39:48.990
the best basketball player on planet earth,
if it affects him,

1777
01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:53.010
what do you think a 13 year old girl with body issues is feeling?

1778
01:39:53.011 --> 01:39:55.260
Like that's what's scary.
Yeah.
Or Boy,

1779
01:39:55.620 --> 01:40:00.230
boy or girl says kids are the suicide with teenage girls is a lot.

1780
01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:02.280
Have you ever read Jonathan hates books on that?

1781
01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:06.330
Jonathan Haidt who he's been on my podcast,
Cowen knows him,

1782
01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.870
I think maybe can talk to him too,
I believe.
But uh,

1783
01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:13.110
he wrote a book called the coddling of the American mind and part of the book

1784
01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:17.240
was about the influence of social media and what is happening when Itunes,

1785
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:19.380
a couple of years ago.
Yeah.
Maybe a year.

1786
01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.800
I'll be here a pretty recent because you'd have to be up to date to know he's a

1787
01:40:22.801 --> 01:40:27.470
shit.
He's brilliant.
He's brilliant.
I really enjoyed talking to him.
It's um,

1788
01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:30.180
it's one of those things where you go,
yeah,

1789
01:40:30.181 --> 01:40:34.170
this is nothing that were designed for.
It's not normal.
You know,

1790
01:40:34.171 --> 01:40:36.840
when girls talk shit about you across the,
you know,

1791
01:40:36.841 --> 01:40:40.260
like you see them across the breezeway,
like you're walking to your classroom,

1792
01:40:40.261 --> 01:40:43.290
they're over there and they're talking shit about you.
Like fuck those bitches.

1793
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:43.621
Put,

1794
01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:48.240
if they're saying it online and you read it on a Facebook page that her ankles

1795
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:50.850
are fat,
fucking loser.
Get that nose job,

1796
01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:55.510
lol and kids will do shit like that until we job lol.
Yeah,

1797
01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:57.190
kids will do shit like that to each other,

1798
01:40:57.191 --> 01:41:00.370
but if you read it now all of a sudden an impact.
Is it real?

1799
01:41:00.371 --> 01:41:03.310
It becomes re it hits you in a way that it doesn't hit you.

1800
01:41:03.311 --> 01:41:04.420
If you see them talking shit,

1801
01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.580
if I see some dudes talking shit about me and they're over there,

1802
01:41:06.581 --> 01:41:10.900
I'm like you or you really took to,
what do you do?
What about feel good,

1803
01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:14.200
feel good,
insulting people.
Fucking loses.
Concentrate in your own life.

1804
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:17.140
Get your shit together about online.
Like you ever go to une,

1805
01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:19.870
you've never read a comment like I've read comments before,

1806
01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:22.330
but I don't read them anymore.
Did it affect you?

1807
01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.870
It affected me when I first started being on the Internet,

1808
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:28.270
but over the course of my being on the Internet,

1809
01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.480
I've learned how to not emotionally engaged chalices well did you just learn

1810
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:36.940
bullshit?
It's calluses.
What people are like.

1811
01:41:36.941 --> 01:41:41.410
If I've done something that was poor and it wasn't good and someone said that

1812
01:41:41.411 --> 01:41:44.930
sucked,
it burns.
But you know why burns cause they're right.
True.

1813
01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:47.830
Cause they're right.
Yeah.
When that happens that's,

1814
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:50.200
that's an opportunity to get better.
That's what that is.

1815
01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:54.520
That's an opportunity to look at yourself to reassess,
start from scratch,

1816
01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:59.530
just look at it with fresh renewed vigor and understanding that the negative

1817
01:41:59.531 --> 01:42:03.070
consequences of failing or doing poorly or you know,

1818
01:42:03.071 --> 01:42:07.630
just not putting enough attention to turning on.
What do you mean?

1819
01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:08.590
Like lately you're not,

1820
01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:12.580
I'm sure what's the last thing you did that you got negative but it doesn't

1821
01:42:12.581 --> 01:42:15.160
matter.
That's how I looked at it.
It's like,

1822
01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:19.540
but that's one of the reasons why cause I'm always tweaking it like that and

1823
01:42:19.541 --> 01:42:22.480
I'll have sets that are off and a lot of the times it sets that are off cause

1824
01:42:22.481 --> 01:42:27.040
I'm experimenting with Shit,
I'm moving stuff around,
you know,
doesn't matter.

1825
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:31.270
But it does.
Wow.
I don't like it.
I don't like,
like people go,
no,
no,
no.

1826
01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:35.530
When I don't do well I'm not,
I'm not listening to what other people are saying.

1827
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:38.740
I'm my own worst critic.
You have to,
so yeah.
Yeah.

1828
01:42:38.741 --> 01:42:41.590
So the bottom line is if they're wrong,

1829
01:42:41.591 --> 01:42:44.140
like if someone says something in there wrong,
it's like I don't care.

1830
01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:47.920
Like it doesn't bother me.
If you say mean things and you're wrong,
I don't care.

1831
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:52.840
But if your right eye care and the reason why cares cause I haven't done a good

1832
01:42:52.841 --> 01:42:56.050
job so I care more about what I've failed at,

1833
01:42:56.410 --> 01:43:00.030
then the person's opinions,
they can't be all invested in that.

1834
01:43:00.031 --> 01:43:03.820
People's opinions that people you don't know because everyone's words look the

1835
01:43:03.821 --> 01:43:05.080
same when they're typed out.

1836
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:09.400
Like you don't get to see if there was like an an intelligence quotient and

1837
01:43:09.401 --> 01:43:11.530
emotional intelligence and social intelligence.

1838
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:16.090
If you could find out how to stir up somebody was by the text just looking at
it,

1839
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:18.760
you'd get a better understanding of whether or not you should listen to this

1840
01:43:18.761 --> 01:43:21.070
person's opinion.
Yeah.
When you just look at text,

1841
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:23.230
it could be it's very black and white.
Yeah.

1842
01:43:23.290 --> 01:43:28.120
I mean it could be Cornell rest wrote that or it could be fucking Richard

1843
01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.040
Spencer Rhoda.
It's just words like it doesn't,

1844
01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:33.790
you don't convey who the person is from those words.
It's very difficult.

1845
01:43:34.210 --> 01:43:37.840
So someone can say something insulting or Shitty.

1846
01:43:37.841 --> 01:43:42.110
Do you designed to try to get you.
They're just trying to hope to get you.
Why?

1847
01:43:42.150 --> 01:43:44.800
Why do you,
why do you think it's such an,
why do you think you get it?

1848
01:43:44.801 --> 01:43:47.680
I don't get to do get it.
I guess they're helpless.
They're helpless.

1849
01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:50.430
So that's why there's so much negativity.
Yes.

1850
01:43:50.850 --> 01:43:54.050
That's of the reason why it shouldn't be a positive atmosphere for some,

1851
01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.320
you're positive.
You have a fucking Ferrari,
you live in a mansion.
It's easier.

1852
01:43:57.350 --> 01:44:00.410
A handsome guy,
you 10 feet tall.
It's all good things.
It's got a giant take here.

1853
01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.720
You've got big Dick Energy.
It's all right.
All these things are full.

1854
01:44:02.721 --> 01:44:06.590
Also worked for,
you didn't work for that deck.
I was born with this thing.
Yeah,

1855
01:44:06.591 --> 01:44:11.480
that's what I'm saying.
It's a,
for some things,
I'm sure it is.
Poor boy you had,

1856
01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:15.260
you've had many good brakes.
Some people have had none.

1857
01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.290
Some people have had none and they also have a phone and they have a Twitter

1858
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:21.400
account and they're like,
fuck you.
Yeah,
but fuck you in your further.

1859
01:44:21.401 --> 01:44:24.110
That's while you're still Q in your mansion.
Yeah.
Fuck you.

1860
01:44:24.111 --> 01:44:29.030
And everything you stand for because they can't see a real path.

1861
01:44:29.210 --> 01:44:30.380
Like if you're standing there,

1862
01:44:30.381 --> 01:44:33.740
but that's why they're a loser because you cause you're getting online,

1863
01:44:33.741 --> 01:44:36.240
you spewing out hate cause you're not happy with your lawyer.

1864
01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:40.120
They're 17 like they don't get it yet.
Let's say they're not a lot,

1865
01:44:40.130 --> 01:44:41.090
but there's a lot of that.

1866
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:44.930
Where are 17 they used to be a loser at 17 now they're 27 and nothing's gotten

1867
01:44:44.931 --> 01:44:48.320
much better.
There's a lot of that going on.

1868
01:44:48.321 --> 01:44:51.320
Instagram and shitting on someone who's successful is going to get you to where

1869
01:44:51.321 --> 01:44:54.260
you want to go.
No,
unless you're really funny.

1870
01:44:55.130 --> 01:44:58.350
There are people that just do a comp.
Yeah.
There is some kind of juicy,

1871
01:44:58.351 --> 01:45:01.580
you'll have a section where we,
we read off the people roasting us.

1872
01:45:01.581 --> 01:45:03.970
We need it back and forth to each other.
People are good.
Some people,
Hillary,

1873
01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:05.360
most are awful.
There's,

1874
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:09.980
there's people that have like formulated a comedy career from Dunkin on folks

1875
01:45:09.981 --> 01:45:14.630
online,
right?
Yeah.
But that'd be a Jenny Johnson,
Jenny Johnson high five.

1876
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.050
It's like,
that'd be the minority though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But if you're a good writer,

1877
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:21.410
here's the thing.
The world is not,

1878
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:24.860
it's like good ideas and good writing and being funny.

1879
01:45:24.861 --> 01:45:26.420
It's not exclusive to professionals.

1880
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:29.480
There's a lot of people out there who are really funny,

1881
01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:33.020
who never figured out a way to,
to do capitalize on it.
Yeah.
Look,
dude,

1882
01:45:33.021 --> 01:45:36.080
when I was a fucking open miker when I was first starting out,

1883
01:45:36.081 --> 01:45:39.620
I worked for a guy named Dave Dolan.
He's dead now.
He's a private investigator.

1884
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:43.580
To this day,
one of the funniest fucking dudes I've ever met in my life,

1885
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:47.470
who we used to call him dynamite.
Dickless Dave Dolan,
who was an animal it,
oh,

1886
01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:51.410
hold on,
hold on.
Dynamite.
Ticketless Day triple d.

1887
01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:52.580
He died a few years back,

1888
01:45:52.581 --> 01:45:55.690
but he's one of the rare people that I save his voice mails.

1889
01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:00.750
Now you save people's voicemails.
I used to after they're dead.
Yeah.
Like I,
I,

1890
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:03.920
he's one of those guys.
I'm never fucking delete.
How'd he pass away?

1891
01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:08.170
Listen to this.
I can't wait.

1892
01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:11.290
<v 2>Oh,
Derek was very rare.</v>

1893
01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:16.600
<v 1>Dickless Dave here.
How Boston is that,
Liz?
Just,</v>

1894
01:46:16.630 --> 01:46:19.920
it's hard to hear it because I can't put it on speaker.
Dave here.

1895
01:46:20.230 --> 01:46:25.200
Why does it not go on speaker?
What did he pass away from?
Ah,

1896
01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:26.130
you got cancer.

1897
01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:31.200
<v 2>Joe.
Derek was very rare.
Joe,</v>

1898
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:33.560
your comedy still funny as a mother fucker.

1899
01:46:34.650 --> 01:46:39.410
<v 1>He's so modest.
He left me this long email or a voicemail,</v>

1900
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:43.460
but I never delete that.
He's,
yeah,
I love that guy forever.
But he,

1901
01:46:43.461 --> 01:46:47.690
when we were friends,
when he was alive,
he,
I always said,

1902
01:46:47.691 --> 01:46:50.650
why don't you do comedy?
Well,
how the fuck are you not a Canadian?

1903
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.540
He was one of the finest human beings I've ever,
like Joey Diaz level.
Funny.

1904
01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:57.240
He was.
So we do it just didn't have the balls.

1905
01:46:57.330 --> 01:47:00.350
You liked being a private investigator,
like busting people.
He got a kick out of,

1906
01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.960
it was a game for him that works for him and his brother or his cousin rather.

1907
01:47:03.961 --> 01:47:07.860
It was Billy Downs and Billy Downs owned the comedy connection.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

1908
01:47:07.861 --> 01:47:11.370
So we had an N.
Yeah.
Could he is easier than for most people.

1909
01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.910
When I started working for him,
I had no idea that he was Billy Downs cousin.

1910
01:47:14.911 --> 01:47:19.410
I responded to an ad in a newspaper where a private investigator needed an

1911
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:21.360
assistant and I was like,
what a great,

1912
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:23.670
what a great job like as you try to be a comedian,

1913
01:47:23.671 --> 01:47:25.830
be it private investigators assistant is going to be awesome,

1914
01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:27.960
but what he really needed was a driver.

1915
01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:32.820
He lost his license from driving while intoxicated.
Okay.
He's awesome.

1916
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:35.790
He was the best,
but he quit.
He quit booze.

1917
01:47:35.791 --> 01:47:38.970
Fucking cold Turkey right then and there and didn't go to meetings and do any of

1918
01:47:38.971 --> 01:47:42.720
that shit.
Just quit gangster.
Oh Man.
He was a beautiful person,

1919
01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:46.080
but he was one of the funniest people I've ever met in my life.
That guy,

1920
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:48.810
if he had Twitter and he would just want to dunk on people,

1921
01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:50.460
he would have been fucking you up,
man.

1922
01:47:50.461 --> 01:47:53.700
You would have read his shit and fall on the ground laughing.
He was just funny.

1923
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:58.900
It's funny.
People are just funny.
Funny is not exclusive.
Sessionals call you are,

1924
01:47:58.930 --> 01:48:00.690
you aren't,
you can cultivate it.

1925
01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:03.660
I know some comedians that weren't that good and they got way,
way,
way,

1926
01:48:03.661 --> 01:48:04.890
way better,
but I'm sure they were.

1927
01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:08.430
But be the comedian then also being funny in person.

1928
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:11.160
That little bit of difference different.
Yeah.
There's some guys just,

1929
01:48:11.161 --> 01:48:14.010
they're just funny.
Like Richard,
Jenny,
who's in my mind,

1930
01:48:14.011 --> 01:48:17.790
one of the best comedians of all time.
He was always real somber in person.

1931
01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:20.700
Like it's never,
it was never really serious who's depressed,

1932
01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.000
which is why he killed himself.
He just wasn't happy,

1933
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:27.030
wasn't just a little uncomfortable in his own skin.

1934
01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:29.970
And there's comedians like that now,
even at this store.
Oh yeah.
You meet them.

1935
01:48:29.971 --> 01:48:33.780
You're like,
Oh wow,
you're,
you're very serious.
Come up Brody.
You know,

1936
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.980
Brody mean he wasn't that serious or at least around me the few times when I was

1937
01:48:37.981 --> 01:48:42.970
around him.
He,
he was fun.
He can't dark.
Can we get dark enough?

1938
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:47.430
I can pretend I did.
He was always very cool.
Yeah.
I mean,

1939
01:48:47.670 --> 01:48:52.110
I think guys like you and I,
um,
one thing,
especially coming from athletics,

1940
01:48:52.111 --> 01:48:54.860
coming from martial arts,
you're,
you're,
uh,

1941
01:48:55.890 --> 01:49:00.890
more likely to like suck it up and you're more likely to not give in to the

1942
01:49:02.431 --> 01:49:05.880
negative demons and you're also more likely to exercise regularly.

1943
01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:07.110
You're more likely to,

1944
01:49:07.230 --> 01:49:09.480
so when you see someone who's struggling with something they shouldn't be

1945
01:49:09.481 --> 01:49:12.390
struggling with,
you're like,
but you're frustrated.
You're good though.

1946
01:49:12.391 --> 01:49:14.730
It's frustrating from doubt.
You're fucking,
you're really good.

1947
01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:17.610
Like if you are doing really good as a comic,
you know,

1948
01:49:17.611 --> 01:49:20.790
you'll call me up and you'll say pro fucking killed tonight was amazed.

1949
01:49:20.791 --> 01:49:23.530
Like I had such a great set of it.
That's great.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1950
01:49:23.610 --> 01:49:27.270
It's not bragging.
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's happiness.
It's happy to tell you,

1951
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:31.140
cause I know you relate to it.
So Brody,
who was a murderer,

1952
01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:34.590
you could never say he was great.
You would never say like,
Brody,

1953
01:49:34.591 --> 01:49:37.640
you fucking kill me.
If he would,
he would like skirt around here.

1954
01:49:37.641 --> 01:49:40.750
Like Rogen always supportive.
Rogan.
Yeah,

1955
01:49:40.751 --> 01:49:45.120
they always fled to flood zone would always deflect it.
He never,

1956
01:49:45.121 --> 01:49:46.530
I don't think he wanted to,

1957
01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:50.590
I don't think he wanted to accept the fact that people loved them.

1958
01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:53.560
Like when you know,
when he had it would have a great set.

1959
01:49:53.561 --> 01:49:56.500
It would almost like it wouldn't elevate him.

1960
01:49:56.710 --> 01:50:00.490
Like some guys get off steel like Hinchcliffe Hinchcliffe a murder I'll get off

1961
01:50:00.491 --> 01:50:03.540
stage will be like,
Woo.
Yeah,
you'll come to your,
you're the Kaiser.

1962
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:07.570
His eyes would be giant will high five everybody,
he's feeling it,
you know.

1963
01:50:07.630 --> 01:50:09.790
But Brody didn't get like that.

1964
01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:13.810
And I'm not saying feels the same in any regards to what Brody was suffering

1965
01:50:13.811 --> 01:50:16.250
with,
but you know,
Theo has his demons,
whatever you need.
It's very,

1966
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.751
it's out there.

1967
01:50:16.751 --> 01:50:20.140
I'm not outing feels the same way where he'll do a set and I'm like,
dude,

1968
01:50:20.141 --> 01:50:24.130
that is one of the best things I've ever seen,
man.
Be like,
get the fuck,
stop.

1969
01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:27.390
Get the fuck [inaudible] on.
I'm telling you,
it's so good,
dude.
I,

1970
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:30.130
it's a version of it feels got his own version.

1971
01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:32.800
It's not as extreme as everyone has their monsters.
Yeah.

1972
01:50:32.801 --> 01:50:37.510
But like a guy like you or me,
we're very,
you're goal oriented.
You see,

1973
01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.430
you try and get better at things.
You see things.

1974
01:50:39.431 --> 01:50:40.630
That's how you got good at Jujitsu.

1975
01:50:40.631 --> 01:50:42.850
It's like I could have fighting until you get good at comedy.

1976
01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.370
Everything you want to get good at,
you get good at.

1977
01:50:45.371 --> 01:50:48.640
By focusing on it and setting goals and trying to get better and better.

1978
01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:52.030
And when you do get better,
you celebrate.
You enjoy it.
It's fun,
it's exciting.

1979
01:50:52.690 --> 01:50:54.670
Some people don't get that feeling,
man.
They don't,

1980
01:50:54.730 --> 01:50:58.300
they don't ever get those highs and those highs just don't exist.
So it's,

1981
01:50:58.630 --> 01:51:02.110
and for me,
you know what,
what,

1982
01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:05.830
what gets me more than anything now is new stuff.

1983
01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:07.670
What gets me more than anything,
it's creation.

1984
01:51:07.671 --> 01:51:10.390
It's like those little things you come up with those nuggets.

1985
01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:14.680
Like if you knew walk and show and a walkway go,
oh fuck,

1986
01:51:14.890 --> 01:51:19.410
how come the back go,
dude,
I wrote down with killed.
I'm like,
Oh my God,

1987
01:51:19.411 --> 01:51:23.330
you're recording right?
Yeah.
I can run with that.
So there's something there.
Yeah.

1988
01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:27.370
Then I'll walk away on like the highest time,
man.
It's amazing.
No shows.

1989
01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:31.450
What's interesting is hanging around you as much as I have is,

1990
01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:33.880
um,
you're,
you're serious.

1991
01:51:33.881 --> 01:51:37.690
But you and I are more similar than like me or delete or me and Callan.

1992
01:51:37.810 --> 01:51:40.480
Callan dalea show silly all the time.

1993
01:51:41.090 --> 01:51:44.140
Delay might be funny or off stage.
He's amazing onstage,

1994
01:51:44.141 --> 01:51:45.240
but he's so funny offstage.

1995
01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.520
Brian is so fun now stage where they're constantly on like they get around,

1996
01:51:48.521 --> 01:51:52.270
they mess around all the time and you're like,
you don't have to be that way.

1997
01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:57.010
I thought for the lungs I had to act that way because that's the way cause I

1998
01:51:57.011 --> 01:52:01.240
hung out with Brian and Kevin and dilly is so much and like this I don't want to

1999
01:52:01.241 --> 01:52:01.451
do,

2000
01:52:01.451 --> 01:52:05.930
like I just want to chill and do my set and then talk about cars or whatever and

2001
01:52:05.931 --> 01:52:08.560
it gives a fuck out.
It'd be myself.
That's,
yeah,
I'm not them.

2002
01:52:08.561 --> 01:52:10.840
I don't want to have to be on and fuck around all day.

2003
01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:13.820
I don't like fuck around all the time.
We'll delete your,

2004
01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:17.080
the only one who they avoid like real conversations.
They don't talk,

2005
01:52:17.110 --> 01:52:20.890
they just fake insult each other.
Yeah,
they just insult each other.

2006
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:24.980
Where I'm like,
all right,
well,
all right.
What else man?
Like I was lying.

2007
01:52:24.981 --> 01:52:29.790
Did Collin got boxing mitts made that have faced?

2008
01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:33.760
That's fake.
That's on someone put it on Photoshop.
Those on there.
That's amazing.

2009
01:52:33.761 --> 01:52:36.630
They did a great job.
It's hilarious though.
I thought he actually hadn't.

2010
01:52:36.631 --> 01:52:40.920
Mits made a,
I was like fuck to them,
but those guys are shut that like that's,

2011
01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:43.100
that's who they are.
Their count.

2012
01:52:43.110 --> 01:52:47.720
If it's a room of three or 30 he's going to entertain him.
He's the,
he's the,

2013
01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:51.230
he's the,
you know the,
the clown.
That's why I took them hunting.
That's not me,

2014
01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:54.160
man.
That's not,
that's not what I wanted to do.
I want to talk to you.

2015
01:52:54.161 --> 01:52:57.390
Either ask about your family and then go on stage and be flooding.

2016
01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.840
Looking at them.
They're your prime count.

2017
01:52:59.841 --> 01:53:02.870
Ron Punches like a guy who's never been punched.

2018
01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:09.920
You said,
oh,
maybe that.
Maybe those are real.

2019
01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:14.840
I think you're right.
You're right.
You're right brother.

2020
01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:19.370
He just,
no way can we fake.
Whenever I see cal hidden Mitts,
I fast forward.

2021
01:53:19.371 --> 01:53:21.920
I go to the next page.
I know.
He's so silly.

2022
01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:24.470
He's so sassy getting into boxing at 80 years old.

2023
01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.980
Look at this and it keeps telling me his shoulders are fine.
I'm like,
well,

2024
01:53:27.981 --> 01:53:32.270
why are you punching so slow then if your shoulders are fine,
what is wrong?

2025
01:53:32.590 --> 01:53:36.050
Like are you in a room with thick air?
He's obsessed with it.

2026
01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:39.980
Like what is happening at high altitude?
Why is the tide the altitude?

2027
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:44.540
If there's no attitude,
at least your hands would move quicker.
That's real.

2028
01:53:44.541 --> 01:53:47.900
Do you know that?
That that's with ballistics.
With archery,

2029
01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:52.610
you shoot high and high altitude.
Oh really?
Yes,
because there's less drag.

2030
01:53:52.611 --> 01:53:57.020
That makes sense.
There's less air.
Why is his hands moving so slow?

2031
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.270
He's to be so sad.
Weird.

2032
01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:03.950
He's been boxing with with private lessons for a while.
He goes,

2033
01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:08.390
Wayne thinks,
ah,
you know,
I could probably fight pro.
I went talent.

2034
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:12.410
I would count on your pain.
That man money.
Dot.
I love Wayne Talk.

2035
01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.060
Here's the problem.
I say you're 57 years old and you're paying that man money,

2036
01:54:17.061 --> 01:54:19.970
so if you went Callen you look terrible,
you're going to go,
well,

2037
01:54:19.971 --> 01:54:23.450
you're the one coaching me.
So,
of course I went,
let me ask you something.

2038
01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:26.610
You play tennis,
right?
He goes,
yeah,
what you hit with a pro,
right?
He goes,
yeah,

2039
01:54:26.611 --> 01:54:28.040
I went,
you pay him right and go.

2040
01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:31.800
Has He ever told you he thinks she could maybe compete us?
Yeah,

2041
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:36.350
that's what they do because they got to show progress and hype you up.
Otherwise,

2042
01:54:36.351 --> 01:54:38.840
if he's like,
dude,
you're awful.
Never fight again.

2043
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:43.670
You're not gonna keep paying them.
Dude,
in a great though.
That's Callan,

2044
01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:47.540
this just people.
It's talent in a nutshell.
It's just great people that do that.

2045
01:54:47.541 --> 01:54:50.390
Their coach you that blow smoke up your ass.
Gotta be super careful.

2046
01:54:50.391 --> 01:54:54.350
Those Su pretty careful Eddie's students had this guy who was,

2047
01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:56.420
he was a Jujitsu guy and uh,

2048
01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:00.170
he was fighting in the UFC and this coach is Moitai coach was like,

2049
01:55:00.171 --> 01:55:04.220
he's Bangkok ready?
He's,
and I was like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

2050
01:55:04.221 --> 01:55:08.990
Like as a striker.
I was like,
no,
he's not like,
what are you talking about?

2051
01:55:08.991 --> 01:55:11.750
Like the,
they blow smoke,
they get a fat,

2052
01:55:12.290 --> 01:55:15.530
one of these Tommy Chong joints firecracker.
Look at this joint.

2053
01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:19.160
It's a firecracker from this stuff,
this in your ass hall.
Now

2054
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:25.160
they blow that smoke because you're like this on the other end and you start

2055
01:55:25.161 --> 01:55:27.920
believing it,
man.
You start believing I'm going to to bank crock.

2056
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:29.060
Fuck those dudes up.

2057
01:55:29.210 --> 01:55:31.580
I always told that he should make a shirt that says Bangkok ready.

2058
01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:34.160
I think he did.
Did he base somebody made a shirt that said,

2059
01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.550
do you remember that story?
You remember that?
Fascinating.
So I was there.

2060
01:55:37.551 --> 01:55:39.710
I was in the locker room and he said he's Bangkok ready.

2061
01:55:39.711 --> 01:55:43.470
There's not a better term ever.
Well,
it's not a better ever,

2062
01:55:43.471 --> 01:55:47.440
especially when you know the guy's not elite striker and ask about Jesus Christ.

2063
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:51.930
Bangkok.
Ready?
Yeah.
I'd watch them kick the bag and I'd be like,

2064
01:55:52.050 --> 01:55:55.590
oh no,
you better take this guy down.

2065
01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:59.460
Take this guy down and get y'all strangle on in Australia.

2066
01:55:59.610 --> 01:56:02.040
So he's just told fight sage was in Bangkok ready?

2067
01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:07.020
Sage was not one championship ready siege.
You know he's an Alpha male now,
right?

2068
01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.270
Is he still there?
I believe so.
Left Alpha male recently did Lance Palmer relief,

2069
01:56:12.330 --> 01:56:15.270
I think Lynn's plumber while ago.
Mark Henry,
who's the chick,

2070
01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:19.590
the Badass since Cynthia Kavio.
Yeah,
she would she go,

2071
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:24.330
I don't know
how much progress she left.
She's a bad,
no.

2072
01:56:24.450 --> 01:56:28.500
I mean,
I don't know what they're doing over there,
so I can't really comment.

2073
01:56:28.590 --> 01:56:31.530
I don't either.
But I do know that when Bang Ludwig was there,

2074
01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:34.890
they make it some giant ass fucking progress.
Everybody started moving better.

2075
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:38.000
Everybody started putting together combinations better click.

2076
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:40.290
You need a head coach.

2077
01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:44.130
Fighters need a head coach and even then you might not win right now.

2078
01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.700
It's tough enough.
You need a hot,
you need a head coach.
You need that.

2079
01:56:46.701 --> 01:56:51.630
You need a beast.
He looked at,
if I was,
if I was competing,
really,

2080
01:56:51.631 --> 01:56:54.420
if I was a young man and I was thinking about fighting and MMA,

2081
01:56:54.450 --> 01:56:55.530
I'd probably move to Montreal.

2082
01:56:56.290 --> 01:57:01.290
I got to Montreal or I was talking to a Dustin about this at a att.

2083
01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:04.950
There's so many guys was you guys in the UFC.
They get there and they were the,

2084
01:57:05.150 --> 01:57:07.110
you know,
the big swinging dicks that they're small gym.

2085
01:57:07.111 --> 01:57:09.970
They come to att and they're expecting the same attention.

2086
01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:13.590
It's problems with two problems with how Florida,

2087
01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:17.760
Pussy and Pussy and cocaine.
The cocaine.

2088
01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:19.650
I've never tried it and maybe that I've never done it.

2089
01:57:19.651 --> 01:57:20.520
That was what I said though.

2090
01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:22.110
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

2091
01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:26.970
<v 1>of personal resilience.
Woo.
Manish spans Colombian.</v>

2092
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:29.640
She could checks.
That's a reason to go down there,
bro.
You,

2093
01:57:29.641 --> 01:57:31.760
Dick is going to be hard.
Every time the wind blows,

2094
01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:34.510
you're going to be excited and you're not going to be focusing and you're going

2095
01:57:34.511 --> 01:57:39.410
to get cracked.
Yeah,
so maybe New Mexico.
Huh?
Also has hot ass girls.

2096
01:57:39.411 --> 01:57:43.310
The other thing about this is I really believe about some camps can have too

2097
01:57:43.311 --> 01:57:46.670
many killers and you can get fucked up as you're trying to learn and grow and

2098
01:57:46.671 --> 01:57:49.940
you never have enough guys that are,
that you could practice on.

2099
01:57:49.970 --> 01:57:54.740
I think Aka because they're so tough.
They've injured each other and I'm like,

2100
01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:55.850
I should get fucked.

2101
01:57:55.851 --> 01:57:58.910
If I was wanting to learn how to wrestle and I wanted to be like a,

2102
01:57:58.911 --> 01:58:02.600
a better wrestler.
France and gotten,
yeah,
I agree.

2103
01:58:02.601 --> 01:58:06.950
Because dcs has was funny and Steve Bay left.
Yeah,
he's on his way out.

2104
01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:09.140
Canes there.
You already beat him.
Go there,
dude.

2105
01:58:09.230 --> 01:58:13.250
That's why I say that's what I say.
Yeah,
he's in France.

2106
01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:17.030
But because his fucking striking the power.
Yes.

2107
01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:20.720
It's like such a fucking checkmate weapon.
Then no matter what anybody does,

2108
01:58:20.721 --> 01:58:23.420
you're always ready for checkmate.
Boom.
It's like wilder,

2109
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:26.330
that kind of ridiculous power.
You're always ready for checkmate.

2110
01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:30.050
You're always ready.
Wilders is even more impressive than Francis.

2111
01:58:30.410 --> 01:58:34.300
I don't know about that.
Let me tell you something that is amazing.
13 that isn't.

2112
01:58:34.301 --> 01:58:35.840
It just has to cut to Marty.

2113
01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:40.370
My motherfucking words at Francis in Ghana decides to jump ship and go

2114
01:58:40.371 --> 01:58:42.610
heavyweight,
cheerful.
Where are you going with this?

2115
01:58:42.611 --> 01:58:46.500
He will knew some fools nukes of water.

2116
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:49.880
Oh well let's kind of take a long time to get to Wilder's level said wow.

2117
01:58:49.890 --> 01:58:53.370
As a world champions undefeated yet they say,
but if Francis and got,

2118
01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:55.600
look Francis and Ghana not ready to box wilder right now,

2119
01:58:55.601 --> 01:59:00.250
but let me tell you some starch in 30 seconds.
He might or he might connect.
No,

2120
01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.070
he could list against one.
There's not the slickest guy in the world.

2121
01:59:03.071 --> 01:59:05.980
We're not talking about Muhammad Ali [inaudible] Olympic level.

2122
01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:10.390
Bob Francis knows sort of sort of a year and a half in,
he was in the Olympics,

2123
01:59:10.391 --> 01:59:15.040
but he mostly gets by on power and range.
He's Olympics,
Olympics metal,

2124
01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:17.380
but it's only a year and a half into boxing.
I mean,

2125
01:59:17.410 --> 01:59:21.910
I think France is probably can 12 rounds.
He did.
No,
no,
no doubt about it.

2126
01:59:21.911 --> 01:59:25.720
He's amazing.
But if Francis has a problem with grappling,

2127
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:28.300
you think about what he did,
what does he not have a problem with striking?

2128
01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:31.630
He kaos owl circles in the UFC.
True.
True.

2129
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:34.240
But Alistair Overeem is a world class striker.
I mean,

2130
01:59:34.241 --> 01:59:38.950
he's a kick boxer at the highest level.
When's The k one Grand Prix?
I mean,

2131
01:59:38.951 --> 01:59:40.570
he's knocked out Badr Hari.

2132
01:59:40.810 --> 01:59:44.830
He's been beaten fucking Turkish Tyson for sure.

2133
01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:48.520
He's beaten some good guys.
He's a little older,
a little older.

2134
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:53.090
And this is the other thing.
If Alistair Overeem entered the boxer me with,

2135
01:59:53.091 --> 01:59:57.700
without,
with Deontay wilder,
he wouldn't last a minute.
I agree with you.
However,

2136
01:59:57.730 --> 02:00:02.590
maybe we'll,
if he kick his legs straight,
buy shorts,
what we're talking about.

2137
02:00:02.650 --> 02:00:04.660
But it was in Muay Thai food.
I mean it was an MMA fight,

2138
02:00:04.690 --> 02:00:05.790
so he's allowed to do everything.

2139
02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:09.130
I'm just saying it straight box and talking about apples and oranges.
Right.

2140
02:00:09.131 --> 02:00:09.964
But think about that.

2141
02:00:10.030 --> 02:00:14.560
If Deontay wilder fought Allister over him in an MMA fight right now,

2142
02:00:14.561 --> 02:00:17.080
how do you think that would go?
He finished him in under a minute.

2143
02:00:17.110 --> 02:00:18.780
He like kicked the shit out of Saint [inaudible].

2144
02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:21.490
You Ain't need you to take him down and took around three seconds.

2145
02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:24.610
But he couldn't do that to Francis and Ghana.
Couldn't leg kick him,

2146
02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:26.980
couldn't keep them off him because I wasn't going to May.

2147
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:30.990
But if it's Allister and,
and uh,
Francis wind to the box arena,

2148
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.350
they get absolutely annihilate.
I agree with you.
But the thing that's holding,

2149
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:38.440
well,
unless they focused on it for as long as those guys did,

2150
02:00:38.441 --> 02:00:43.390
but the thing that holds back Deontay wilder from people,

2151
02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:47.770
oh,
like all the boxing pundits praising him is that they think he has awkward

2152
02:00:47.771 --> 02:00:52.480
technique.
He's wild,
but his results are spectacular.
Okay.

2153
02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:55.300
Frances and Ghana knew everybody.

2154
02:00:55.301 --> 02:00:58.240
He connects on other than steepy goes night night.

2155
02:00:58.390 --> 02:01:03.040
Steve Bay is the only guy steep,
a CPA,
survived steep pay,

2156
02:01:03.041 --> 02:01:07.300
figured out how to use his championship medal and his grit and use his take

2157
02:01:07.301 --> 02:01:10.480
downs and won the fight.
Derrick Lewis state some shots.

2158
02:01:10.481 --> 02:01:14.530
I was just a terrible fight.
That fight.
I don't even think that counts.

2159
02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:17.980
That doesn't count.
That fight is so that's such a mess from top to bottom.

2160
02:01:17.981 --> 02:01:20.920
That was the worst fight.
Maybe in the history of the fucking sport.
Agree.

2161
02:01:21.190 --> 02:01:22.030
They didn't throw anything,

2162
02:01:22.410 --> 02:01:26.350
but the problem with that fight it was because there are such knockout artists

2163
02:01:26.351 --> 02:01:29.470
you would expect in such fireworks.
Dude,
it was a big disappointment.

2164
02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:33.910
I said to everybody,
there is not a fucking way this fight concise,
and I said,

2165
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:36.160
we can never say that because it always sucks.
I know.

2166
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.500
Whenever you say there's not a way this fight can suck,
it's to suck.

2167
02:01:39.501 --> 02:01:43.040
So disappointing man.
It was so disappointed.
It was.

2168
02:01:43.041 --> 02:01:48.041
But then when he comes back and he knocks out Curtis blades for the second time,

2169
02:01:48.590 --> 02:01:51.170
you know,
which I thought great blades had a way better shot at them.

2170
02:01:51.171 --> 02:01:53.360
The second me too.
I actually thought he was probably beat him,

2171
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.960
especially after the Francis and gone.
Oh fine.
Yes,

2172
02:01:56.030 --> 02:02:00.220
but it showed that or the Derrick [inaudible] but it showed them in Ghana is

2173
02:02:00.230 --> 02:02:04.820
really got it back together again and that's fight jds.
They moved it though.

2174
02:02:04.821 --> 02:02:09.290
It was supposed to be in Vegas.
They moved it.
It's a dangerous fiber.

2175
02:02:09.291 --> 02:02:13.280
JDS didn't right for both guys really,
but yeah,
you can do ads.

2176
02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:16.820
I just think in Ghana has,
if you're going to stand in front of him,
man,

2177
02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:20.690
he's going to hit you or something.
Yeah,
it's a fascinating thing.

2178
02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.530
He's one of those,
I'm going to hit you with something Kane.
I was like,
holy fuck.

2179
02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:27.110
Yeah,
man on his leg blew out her so bad.

2180
02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:30.380
He really did think that's what happened.
When you look at the replay,

2181
02:02:30.381 --> 02:02:32.760
he clearly got hit with an upper cut,
like a shelf.

2182
02:02:32.761 --> 02:02:37.130
There's still like a car when almost taught needs that guy all he needs to touch

2183
02:02:37.131 --> 02:02:41.180
you.
I just need to end.
The more he does it,
the more confident he gets in it,

2184
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:44.930
the better.
He's only been fucking training for six years.

2185
02:02:45.170 --> 02:02:47.790
Do people want to send in their heads?
See Him verse John.

2186
02:02:47.791 --> 02:02:51.200
So bad numbers of John Jones.
Yeah.
What do think would happen?

2187
02:02:51.201 --> 02:02:52.880
I think John will tickets.
I think John smoked him.

2188
02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:58.180
John would take them down and Jenkinson John easily could be 240 pounds easily

2189
02:02:59.030 --> 02:03:02.090
just go.
I think what he's doing is he's going to clean out light heavyweight.

2190
02:03:02.091 --> 02:03:03.210
There's really no one there for him.

2191
02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:05.150
He's gonna clean that out and then go to heavyweight.

2192
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:09.740
Maybe he's in it or maybe he just stays at light heavyweight and just goes down

2193
02:03:09.741 --> 02:03:12.680
as the goat and just keeps beating up on them.
All the contenders.

2194
02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:16.680
It's where to be.
DC wants that fight again at light heavyweight,
like come on,

2195
02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:21.100
do it.
At least that heavyweight
heavyweights,
the way to go,

2196
02:03:21.101 --> 02:03:25.440
it's an ego thing for DCC gets passed steep a,
which is a big f.

2197
02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:29.720
Realize like DC DC connected with that beautiful punch in the clench,

2198
02:03:29.721 --> 02:03:34.550
but Steve Bay has had over a year to stew on that.
It's been driving him.
Fuck.

2199
02:03:34.551 --> 02:03:36.770
I don't think that's a good thing.
I think it's good for Steve.

2200
02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:39.410
Steve is an animal.
I'm not.
I'm not worried about that.

2201
02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:43.070
I think he's going to be better.
I think green routes in issue.
I don't think so.

2202
02:03:43.130 --> 02:03:46.280
DC's been way more active,
but Steve pays a real veteran man.

2203
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:49.100
He's a real veteran and he's a crumbled dudes,
a hard ass.

2204
02:03:49.101 --> 02:03:51.740
He's not going to come in there with a lot of expectations on himself.

2205
02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:53.690
He's just going to do his best,
I think.

2206
02:03:53.691 --> 02:03:57.740
I'm not worried at all about the a tougher fight for DC.
Look,

2207
02:03:57.741 --> 02:04:01.700
if Donald Cerrone was taking a year plus off and then we kind of fight for the

2208
02:04:01.701 --> 02:04:04.520
title,
I'll be like,
Ooh,
I'd like Donald to get a fight in God.

2209
02:04:04.521 --> 02:04:07.040
I wish she would do that.
You and I are off on this.

2210
02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:11.450
I wished Donald would take a fucking break and not fight Tony and a three days'

2211
02:04:11.451 --> 02:04:13.070
notice.
No,
I agree with that too.

2212
02:04:13.071 --> 02:04:15.980
I wish you would take a break and not fight Tony in three weeks notice,

2213
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:21.050
but three weeks after his last fight,
but when Donald fights a lot,

2214
02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:24.740
as long as the best on reason,
it's the best.
Donald.
That's what he wants.
Yes.

2215
02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:27.350
He's just,
Oh,
I used to get in the groove.
He likes to stay active,

2216
02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:29.930
I think for steep be champion and do that though.

2217
02:04:31.010 --> 02:04:35.480
Named Sonia who's done it go named one guy.
Well,
everyone's different.
I'm not,

2218
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:39.370
I'm just,
I'm just going off who measurements?
There's no one who's that?

2219
02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:44.730
Who's ever fought like the multimers champion,
who's fought the most,

2220
02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:50.250
the most like the most like active champion.

2221
02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:54.150
Most DC's pretty active at light heavyweight and heavyweight.
Pretty fucking act.

2222
02:04:54.151 --> 02:04:56.970
Pretty fucking active.
And I think John is trying to be really active.

2223
02:04:56.971 --> 02:04:59.300
I mean think about whole divisions.
Fuck yeah,
he's,

2224
02:04:59.330 --> 02:05:03.570
he's going to clear out all those dip out and leave them like the fucking queen

2225
02:05:03.571 --> 02:05:08.310
of the dragons.
Okay.
George Saint Pierre Fought 15 title bouts.
Wow.

2226
02:05:08.311 --> 02:05:13.080
He had 15 title.
Wow.
That's crazy.
Radio tour 15 how about Randy coture,

2227
02:05:13.081 --> 02:05:17.430
but that doesn't mean that all these years later,
still in 15 over seven years,

2228
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:20.250
that's still all those years later.

2229
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:24.030
Randy coast tour is still tied for the record of the most title fights.

2230
02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:25.110
That's crazy.

2231
02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:30.560
Mighty mouse right under that with 14 Anderson 13 the differences with all those

2232
02:05:30.871 --> 02:05:34.690
guys,
you know,
I mean it's all different eras,
different divisions.

2233
02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:37.200
Jeremy did everything because I think what John's doing,

2234
02:05:37.201 --> 02:05:41.820
the current era is more impressive.
I'm like Randy or George or any Anderson did.

2235
02:05:41.850 --> 02:05:44.250
Who Do you think is a danger to John Right now?

2236
02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:48.620
There's no one at light heavyweight.
Yeah,
no one,
absolutely no one Thiago Santos.

2237
02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:51.540
I know we got a hypen and be like,
oh,
puncher's chance.
Yeah,
for sure.
I get that.

2238
02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:55.320
There's no one at light heavyweight.
Maybe you don't want Johnny Walker,

2239
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:57.540
but he's so far removed right now.

2240
02:05:57.541 --> 02:06:01.380
He has to get by maybe three more guys before we start and being like,
hey,

2241
02:06:01.381 --> 02:06:05.160
you might be a threat,
but he's maybe a potential hope.
His shoulders.
Okay.

2242
02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:09.540
If his shoulders,
okay.
What that guy does is crazy.
He starts his people.

2243
02:06:09.541 --> 02:06:13.710
He stocked starts Kahleel Roundtree with an elbow in the clinch.
I remember that.

2244
02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:17.340
Yeah.
Standing wishes that crazy.
This kind of Elisha,
one of them bad boys.

2245
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:21.030
Vicious Kaos him with that.
And then chaos.
Misha,

2246
02:06:21.031 --> 02:06:25.140
Sir Chernoff with a flying knee,
right to the fucking chops freak.
He's a freak,

2247
02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:30.300
but he hasn't done it like John has to show gun who uh,
to function.

2248
02:06:30.690 --> 02:06:32.180
No comparison with Cheetah.
I mean,

2249
02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:35.610
there's no comparison to anyone who's ever fought in the light heavyweight

2250
02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:39.270
division and Jon Jones right now,
there's no comparison.
There's no threats,

2251
02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:43.790
but except DC.
But DC lost the lost twice.
Not a threat at light heavyweight DC.

2252
02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:48.090
I still be ways as red light,
heavy weight.
I think he's a threat.
Not heavyweight.

2253
02:06:48.091 --> 02:06:50.400
Yes.
Heavyweight.
He's a threat is power goes up.

2254
02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:55.550
We've seen how it works out for DC if DC got more dedicated and disciplined with

2255
02:06:55.681 --> 02:07:00.150
his diet and said,
what if DC fights against DPA and says,

2256
02:07:00.170 --> 02:07:03.630
so when is this deep a fight happen?
Is it July?
July?
Okay.

2257
02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:07.080
So what if a DC says,
okay,
August,
September,
let's,

2258
02:07:07.290 --> 02:07:12.290
let's plan for New Year's Eve with Jon Jones that weekend and he takes a week

2259
02:07:13.111 --> 02:07:16.020
off.
It goes to fucking Mardi gras or whatever the fucking wants to do.

2260
02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:19.200
Drink some drinks and beer shadows in New Orleans.
Yeah.

2261
02:07:19.290 --> 02:07:21.430
Have some pizza kicks back.
Yeah.

2262
02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:26.700
And then goes on a serious diet with a real good nutritionist who's gonna check

2263
02:07:28.951 --> 02:07:31.180
his macros,
make sure he's eating healthy food.

2264
02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:33.390
You think that's why he's not being John?
No,

2265
02:07:33.391 --> 02:07:37.120
but I'm saying where he could get down to two oh five healthy where he doesn't

2266
02:07:37.121 --> 02:07:41.740
have any look.
Daniel Cormier,
if there's anything has ever held him back.
He's,

2267
02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:46.720
he's not the best at his diet and within swarms DC.
Great.
Well,

2268
02:07:46.721 --> 02:07:48.790
he's one of the things that makes them great.
He's a wrestler.

2269
02:07:48.791 --> 02:07:50.320
He's a fantastic rest,
so that makes them great.

2270
02:07:50.321 --> 02:07:53.800
He's time shit that makes him great.
He's got his intelligence,
his great,

2271
02:07:53.890 --> 02:07:58.660
incredible [inaudible] fat.
I don't know about all that.
That's some people say,

2272
02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:01.680
think about that.
Think about the most shredded guys in the UFC.
Well,

2273
02:08:01.681 --> 02:08:04.350
I don't mean he should get shredded.
What I mean is she,

2274
02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:08.470
he should make two oh five with no problems where he could go to war for five

2275
02:08:08.471 --> 02:08:10.660
rounds with a guy like Jon Jones without weakening him.

2276
02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:13.780
I Dunno if that's possible.
You might be right.
I don't know if it's in his DNA,

2277
02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:16.700
especially I've had to a 40 years of age.
She can't be with the way to go.

2278
02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:20.360
I think heavyweight,
his powers up,
we saw that with Steve Bay.
I think if he,

2279
02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:23.710
and he's going to connect what she has in the clinch against John,

2280
02:08:23.711 --> 02:08:27.490
the power's there,
the the the,
I still think he'll be an underdog,

2281
02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:30.550
but that that gap narrows that heavyweight and light heavy weight.

2282
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:32.170
It doesn't switch it at his age.

2283
02:08:32.290 --> 02:08:35.860
I think it's even further apart now that John's being more active.

2284
02:08:35.861 --> 02:08:38.560
Well maybe he wants to do that to prove a point because that's the piece.

2285
02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:42.520
John Heavyweight Tillman,
light heavyweight and heavyweight dude,

2286
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:46.210
you're the champ John.
If he wants to have that likes,
he fight that rubber match.

2287
02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:51.220
Go with,
even though he's two and I'll go there and let's see what happens now.

2288
02:08:51.550 --> 02:08:53.950
Now that I'm thinking about it,
I kind of agree with,
especially for DC,

2289
02:08:53.951 --> 02:08:55.420
it's like DC dude.

2290
02:08:55.450 --> 02:09:00.070
If you beat John at heavyweight and you ride off into the sunset game,

2291
02:09:00.071 --> 02:09:04.300
set match,
best of all time to ever do it.
Like how about this?

2292
02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:08.020
Tito Ortiz right now owns chocolate dough,
right?
Chocolate.

2293
02:09:08.021 --> 02:09:10.690
Dell smashes him two times when they're in their prime,

2294
02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:15.250
but then Tito knocked him out and chuck looked terrible.
Tito code him.

2295
02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:19.450
It looked really bad and tuck will never fight again and Tito will always sleep

2296
02:09:19.451 --> 02:09:22.210
at night knowing he just fucked chuck Liddell up.

2297
02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:25.180
Does just think about those other ones.
You don't even think about it.

2298
02:09:25.181 --> 02:09:27.430
He got it back.
He got it back in a big way.
DC,

2299
02:09:27.431 --> 02:09:30.580
we got it back the way you want it to clipped him with a right hand and put his

2300
02:09:30.581 --> 02:09:33.610
lights out and then punched him a couple times when he's out and that's a replay

2301
02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:37.280
and for and for DC it's like he,
even after the John Loss,

2302
02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:41.560
he went on deaf fucking heavyweight to knock out steep at who some can argue

2303
02:09:41.561 --> 02:09:44.440
it's the best UFC heavy weight of the time he went on to beat Derrick Lewis who

2304
02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:48.550
so dangerous.
And then you've,
unless say Pete,
Steve Bay for a second time,

2305
02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:51.340
what the fuck?
You know?
You know what I was really impressed with?

2306
02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:53.440
I was really impressed with the way chuck handled that last.

2307
02:09:53.441 --> 02:09:55.510
Did you see the way chuck talked about it on an Instagram,

2308
02:09:56.290 --> 02:10:00.370
he just basically said,
you know,
hey man,
you know you,
you put yourself out there,

2309
02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.640
you go out there and you set goals,
you know you,

2310
02:10:02.641 --> 02:10:05.770
you try and if you fail it doesn't,
doesn't mean you quit.

2311
02:10:06.090 --> 02:10:08.650
You get back on your horse and you can get right back to it.

2312
02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:12.970
I try not to be so judgmental,
let go of all the handouts,
all the bullshit.

2313
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.680
I was very impressed.
Me Too.
And I liked chuck.
He's a good person.

2314
02:10:15.710 --> 02:10:19.570
I check if Tito's or rather John John's number one,

2315
02:10:19.571 --> 02:10:23.320
Chuck's number two as far as light heavyweights,
great light heavyweights.
He's,

2316
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:28.180
he was a fucking man.
I mean he was,
when he defined the early days of the UFC,

2317
02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:31.870
one of the things about the UFC was like this crazy thing was like cage fighting

2318
02:10:32.050 --> 02:10:34.520
and here's this guy with painted toenails in a Mohawk

2319
02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:38.600
<v 0>and I'm Ted Tattoo and he's just murking people.
Merkin people.</v>

2320
02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:43.610
Biggest like was like the first big,
Big Star in the sport and goes,

2321
02:10:43.770 --> 02:10:48.040
go on to entourage and have commercials.
Don't fucking automotive commercial.

2322
02:10:48.041 --> 02:10:51.830
It was like a rock star too.
I mean that dude went hall.

2323
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:53.130
Where do you stand to?

2324
02:10:53.150 --> 02:10:55.470
Remember that one interview that he did where he was hammered.

2325
02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:59.420
He was on something.
He was on all the drugs,
everything.

2326
02:10:59.690 --> 02:11:03.820
And he's like doing morning TV.
He's like,
yeah,
I'd like to fight the hall.

2327
02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:09.010
She was real in that gray.
I love that too.
What the fuck he said,

2328
02:11:09.011 --> 02:11:12.380
but he was clearly on cloud nine like he's an animal man,

2329
02:11:12.381 --> 02:11:16.130
like a legit won't do you stand on letting those,
whose responsibility is that?

2330
02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:19.240
The guys like Bj Penn.
It keeps losing.
It's defined his leg,

2331
02:11:19.241 --> 02:11:20.840
his snout guy like Anderson Silva.

2332
02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:23.690
Where do you stand on letting those guys fight?
It's a very good question.

2333
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:26.750
If you're Dana White,
what do you do?
Because at the end of the day,

2334
02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:30.230
only do submissions can go all physically.
Yeah,
man,

2335
02:11:30.231 --> 02:11:32.750
he passed the fucking physical so we gotta let them fight.

2336
02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:36.350
But at the end of the day,
if they don't have a resource or a job from the head,

2337
02:11:36.351 --> 02:11:40.460
man,
if Dana calls Bj or chuck just like you did chuck,
he's like,

2338
02:11:40.461 --> 02:11:42.620
I'm not giving you a venue to find that it's not happening.

2339
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:46.360
So I wonder at what point,
if your day,
now,
let's say your data,

2340
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:48.020
at what point do you tell these guys stop fighting?

2341
02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:51.230
Because I feel like for Anderson,
although I don't remember him that way,

2342
02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:54.770
the new generations remember him for being this guy for Bj.

2343
02:11:54.771 --> 02:11:58.970
The new generation only knows him as losing.
We know him as one of the greats.

2344
02:11:59.690 --> 02:12:03.170
So I feel like here's my [inaudible] to say you can't fight anymore.

2345
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:04.191
I don't know.

2346
02:12:04.191 --> 02:12:09.191
Bj is capable of competing at the level that he's competing at right now when

2347
02:12:10.281 --> 02:12:11.330
he's losing to these guys.

2348
02:12:11.331 --> 02:12:14.360
I don't know if he is because it doesn't seem like he's capable of it wastes

2349
02:12:14.370 --> 02:12:15.970
last what,
six in a row.
Yeah.

2350
02:12:16.370 --> 02:12:21.020
And if I looked at the Bj that I saw against Ryan Hall up until the time he gets

2351
02:12:21.021 --> 02:12:24.990
leg locked,
he looks fucking great.
That after that happened fast though,
bro.
No,

2352
02:12:24.991 --> 02:12:28.940
I know.
I'm with you.
I'm saying he looks like he's fit.

2353
02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.090
He looks like he's in shape.
He looks like he's a top fighter,
but

2354
02:12:33.650 --> 02:12:38.150
he almost needs to fight a young guy coming up so we could see when he fights

2355
02:12:38.151 --> 02:12:42.590
Clegg Weda or you find someone like that.
It's almost losing.
And then Ryan,

2356
02:12:42.591 --> 02:12:47.390
Holly's losing.
I feel like,
I don't know.
He's not who he used to be.
No,

2357
02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:50.930
obviously not.
But I don't even know where his heads.
I feel like if I'm,

2358
02:12:51.170 --> 02:12:53.660
if I'm Dana,
I'm going,
hey man,
I'm doing you guys a solid.

2359
02:12:53.661 --> 02:12:57.230
You can't fight here anymore.
And now they might go on to other organizations,

2360
02:12:57.231 --> 02:13:00.860
but it's not the UFC.
So they can go on there and compete.

2361
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:05.210
But you're not going to tarnish your legacy at the highest level here in the
UFC?

2362
02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:09.830
Not under my watch,
no.
So I it,
I couldn't do it.

2363
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:13.340
I was like,
I'll never pick against Bj.
I would never pick against Randy couture.

2364
02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:15.700
I just,
I don't have it in me.
So when Bj fights,
I'm like,
Oh,

2365
02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:18.930
I'll take PJ because I refused to pick against and that's how much I respect

2366
02:13:18.931 --> 02:13:22.970
them.
But at some point I not gonna do it and I don't honestly Danna can either.

2367
02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:27.170
Could you be like,
hey dude,
no more.
We're done.
Well,

2368
02:13:27.171 --> 02:13:29.930
I'd have to be friends with them like I was friends with you.
Yeah.
You know,

2369
02:13:29.931 --> 02:13:32.310
I mean,
when,
when Rodriguez three 60

2370
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:35.830
<v 1>roundhouse kicked him in the face,
that should've been the end.
I mean,
uh,</v>

2371
02:13:35.890 --> 02:13:36.900
well that was a,

2372
02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:41.820
you saw that and compare to Bj when Bj beat Sean Sherk like you're looking at a,

2373
02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:46.150
this is a severely different fighter whose job,

2374
02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:49.920
family and friends,
no one's job.
You know,
here's the thing,
man.

2375
02:13:49.950 --> 02:13:51.720
We can't let the fighter besides,
well,
what is,

2376
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:54.660
I don't think he should be competing at the highest level,
the sport.

2377
02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:57.720
But if he still wants to compete,
like who's to say Kent?

2378
02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:01.110
Who is to say you can't go to a small organization and fight for them?

2379
02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:05.070
Clues to say.
I mean,
he's not choices it Justin,
he's not getting sparked out,

2380
02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:09.060
you know,
I mean,
he's still conscious.
He's not,
yeah,
I know he's getting beat,

2381
02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:12.480
but it's not getting crushed help and not all the fights at least,

2382
02:14:12.481 --> 02:14:16.640
I mean the Ryan Hall one is probably like the most,
um,
um,

2383
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:19.920
Brian Hall skin tear.
Anyone's in the off though.
Hey,
I can tell you.
Oh yeah,

2384
02:14:19.921 --> 02:14:22.710
if you get,
if they give him anybody's going to do that to your knee.
Well,

2385
02:14:22.711 --> 02:14:27.150
he's a phenomenal grappler and it's super,
super intelligent guy too.
But um,

2386
02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:31.440
that was probably the kindest way for him to lose,

2387
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:35.370
just to get tapped real quick rather than just get a black belt beat up like

2388
02:14:35.371 --> 02:14:40.080
Frankie Edgar did to him,
you know?
But I guess maybe again,

2389
02:14:40.081 --> 02:14:40.651
the commission,

2390
02:14:40.651 --> 02:14:44.700
they have a tough job because like physically we can't seem to his brain,

2391
02:14:44.701 --> 02:14:46.200
but physically he's passing all the tests.

2392
02:14:46.201 --> 02:14:50.790
Like who you tell Bernard Hopkins I take that last fight when he got knocked out

2393
02:14:50.791 --> 02:14:53.670
of the fucking ring,
whose job was to tell Roy Jones,

2394
02:14:53.671 --> 02:14:58.110
don't go to rush and get knocked out.
Yeah,
that's a story that's so old.

2395
02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:01.350
So it repeats itself.
These guys that were,
they got,

2396
02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:04.590
that's what makes these stories so great when they're in their prime and you're

2397
02:15:04.591 --> 02:15:06.420
watching on the come up and so special.

2398
02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:09.630
But it's also what makes this sport so fucking heartbreaking because you know

2399
02:15:09.631 --> 02:15:12.390
who does do that?
The NFL and the NBA,
they tell,
you know,

2400
02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:14.970
they tell you now that's it.
And it's very black and white.

2401
02:15:14.971 --> 02:15:18.210
That's because someone has to fill that position and they're not about nostalgia

2402
02:15:18.211 --> 02:15:20.310
there about who does the best job in that position.

2403
02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:21.570
Shouldn't the UFC be that way?

2404
02:15:21.571 --> 02:15:25.020
But it's not that the UFC doesn't know who does the best job in that position

2405
02:15:25.021 --> 02:15:28.230
until they set you up with somebody.
When they see over and over and over again,

2406
02:15:28.590 --> 02:15:30.730
then we've saw when again,
the yardsticks.

2407
02:15:30.810 --> 02:15:32.610
But the argument is he's not getting crushed.

2408
02:15:32.611 --> 02:15:34.650
It's not getting sparked out and not getting knocked out.

2409
02:15:34.850 --> 02:15:38.130
He just not as good as it used to be.
No,
it's not a good argument,
but he's not,

2410
02:15:38.131 --> 02:15:41.340
he's not as good as you used to be it.
And I'm not saying that I'm not arguing.

2411
02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:47.490
Why do you think it's still at the UFC?
Um,
why was it fashion?

2412
02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:50.130
I don't know why the cause he's still a draw.

2413
02:15:50.131 --> 02:15:54.030
Maybe that's a good question because right now the respect,
is it out of respect?

2414
02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:55.680
Like what is it,
what he's done for the game.

2415
02:15:55.681 --> 02:15:58.450
He's earned the right to go out on his own note.
But the,
the,

2416
02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:01.410
the stakes are so high in fighting.
It's different than basketball.

2417
02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:04.770
I don't know whose job,
but it's not,
I don't have the answer and I wish I did.

2418
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:09.810
I don't know.
It's a,
it's the most heartbreaking thing in sports I think.
I agree.

2419
02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:13.590
And I think with Bj,
if he would have found,
and I,
I don't know Bj well enough,

2420
02:16:13.591 --> 02:16:17.790
but a few would have found a passion like I did with standup or podcasting or

2421
02:16:17.791 --> 02:16:21.090
something else.
You probably would have been out and never come back maybe.

2422
02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:25.830
But the thrill of what makes Bj yeah,
I mean he's a multiple time world champion.

2423
02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:29.560
The thrill of Bj when he was in his prime.
It's probably indescribable.

2424
02:16:29.590 --> 02:16:31.930
Like what brings Nate Diaz back?
Even though he has money in the bank,

2425
02:16:31.931 --> 02:16:35.710
what's going to bring Connor back?
Yeah.
It's not money.
Yeah.

2426
02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:38.630
Those guys were born fighter.
They're natural born fighter.

2427
02:16:38.631 --> 02:16:42.490
This is what they do and that's,
that's what makes them feel alive.
So I dunno.

2428
02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:46.780
Yeah.
The excitement and the thrill.
The fucking,
I mean,
and look,

2429
02:16:46.781 --> 02:16:50.000
we're all going to die.
Sorry.
You,

2430
02:16:50.650 --> 02:16:52.540
when people say you should look out for their health,

2431
02:16:52.541 --> 02:16:54.580
well then we should stop fighting all together.
Correct.

2432
02:16:54.581 --> 02:16:56.340
And stop playing football.
Yeah.
Stopped doing.

2433
02:16:56.450 --> 02:16:59.950
I stopped drinking and no more driving.
Yeah.
Driving is dangerous.

2434
02:16:59.951 --> 02:17:02.950
Go walk everywhere.
If we just walk and people getting accidents walking,

2435
02:17:02.951 --> 02:17:05.590
they'll be fine.
They'll bump into each other's.
Yeah.
Big Deal.
That would be cool.

2436
02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:10.480
Yeah.
I mean it's,
there's a real argument for that,

2437
02:17:10.481 --> 02:17:14.020
right?
Like this is this.
Do you have a small window?
The experience,

2438
02:17:14.021 --> 02:17:17.950
this life doing what you want.
But yeah,
with a guy like Bj Penn,

2439
02:17:17.951 --> 02:17:22.951
the reality is there's probably be a number of fights that you lose in the UFC

2440
02:17:23.111 --> 02:17:26.020
where you can just get cut.
He used to be three.

2441
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:31.810
Was it assigned in paper thing?
No,
but man,
when you've lost two,

2442
02:17:31.811 --> 02:17:33.280
which I did that third one,

2443
02:17:33.281 --> 02:17:35.680
Joe Silva would tell your manager and he told my manager like,

2444
02:17:35.681 --> 02:17:38.920
McMann Lex McMahon goes together with this one.
You know,
it's,
it's probably over.

2445
02:17:39.330 --> 02:17:41.010
No,
he wouldn't say that.
He'd go wood,

2446
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:44.290
we're giving them one more and he knew that was like,
that was your shot.

2447
02:17:44.291 --> 02:17:47.740
If you lost,
you're done.
Even if you won by decision,
they wouldn't cut you.

2448
02:17:48.010 --> 02:17:50.620
You knew if as long as you got the job done,
you extent,

2449
02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:53.350
I saw one of your interviews is really interesting.
You're talking about,
um,

2450
02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:54.041
if you bomb,

2451
02:17:54.041 --> 02:17:57.340
you could always go tell him the Improv and have a new set redeem yourself.

2452
02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:02.350
But when you're fighting,
if you lost,
you'd have like six months.
Yeah.
Per Worse.

2453
02:18:02.370 --> 02:18:04.420
It just dwell on that and Jay and be like,
no,

2454
02:18:04.421 --> 02:18:07.210
I promise you I'm getting better and stand up and be like not,

2455
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:09.850
I promised I bombed with the gum store.
I went to the problem.
They laughed.

2456
02:18:09.851 --> 02:18:13.890
So what's up?
What's up?
Yeah.
The,

2457
02:18:13.891 --> 02:18:18.891
the life of a fighter is probably the most stressful job in all sports and

2458
02:18:19.210 --> 02:18:21.940
certainly in all of entertainment besides,
you know,

2459
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:25.820
obviously when we're at war and soldiers it's close thing and get to spark.
Yes,

2460
02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:27.790
and I do not,
I don't admire it.

2461
02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:29.770
I feel sorry for them because I've been through it,

2462
02:18:29.771 --> 02:18:32.580
but that's from my perspective,
a lot of those guys,
they,

2463
02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:36.840
they fucking live off that man.
I watch and I'm like,
well,
you're guys.
Yeah,

2464
02:18:36.850 --> 02:18:38.980
I'm too nice.
I felt horrible for Brazil.

2465
02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.980
I felt bad for wild or when he got down like,
God,
he's such a good dude.

2466
02:18:41.981 --> 02:18:43.630
I wish you would find something else to do.

2467
02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:45.940
You didn't tell us till the show time guys.
I'm like,

2468
02:18:45.941 --> 02:18:48.790
God parlays this into something really cool.
After this,

2469
02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:50.200
he can make hundreds of millions of dollars.

2470
02:18:50.201 --> 02:18:52.420
I think Deontae $20 million that night.
Yeah.

2471
02:18:52.530 --> 02:18:55.450
He's going to go down as one of the greatest of all time.
I think so.

2472
02:18:55.451 --> 02:18:55.950
I think he's,

2473
02:18:55.950 --> 02:18:59.620
he's getting better with every fight and I think of Joshua gets hit on the chin

2474
02:18:59.621 --> 02:19:01.120
with one of those fucking bombs away.

2475
02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:03.610
We can see some crazy shit thinking about wow.
There is,

2476
02:19:03.611 --> 02:19:06.790
he knows how to take it to,
he could take it.
He got blasted by Ortiz.

2477
02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:10.150
If you're noticing the Brazil fight,
he got caught.
He backs up,

2478
02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:12.610
he got blast against fury.
Yup.
He gets hit.

2479
02:19:12.611 --> 02:19:16.270
He got hit in the 12th round against fury.
Josh are so interesting.
Oh yeah.

2480
02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:20.290
Cause Joshua cracks.
Oh he does.
He does.
And he's been hit before and I dropped,

2481
02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:22.750
I didn't find her view.
Latimer Klitschko yeah,
for that fight.

2482
02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:25.120
And he got back off the ground and starched them.

2483
02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:28.220
I did this interview with a Fox

2484
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:31.880
<v 0>sports,
uh,
Lee.
Hey.
And uh,
she goes,
who's the most overrated?</v>

2485
02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:35.720
A mainstream boxer.
And I answered,
I'm like,
hmm,

2486
02:19:36.050 --> 02:19:39.320
I'm going to say Anthony Joshua.
Just cause I want him to hear this.

2487
02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:43.040
And he's like,
Oh fuck down in a fight.
Wild are now.
But people ran with,

2488
02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:45.440
it was like,
oh,
he thinks Joshua was overrated.
No,
I don't think Joe,

2489
02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:49.810
I think Joshua is such a fucking gold medalist.
Overrated.
Now he's being girls.

2490
02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:53.600
What do you take?
These don't make sense.
Amazed.
I just want him in wild fight.

2491
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:57.360
He's also built like a Greek God.
You know,
it might be a six man alive.

2492
02:19:57.361 --> 02:19:58.191
You might be.
It's fun.

2493
02:19:58.191 --> 02:20:03.191
He's talked at like two 45 jasper shredded and you heard him commentate.

2494
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:09.050
Yeah,
he's brilliant ticket and that accent.
It's lovely.
Lovely champ.

2495
02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:13.670
If as gay it'd be so on.
Let's go champ.
It'd be so on.
Yeah.
Um,

2496
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:17.660
what is happening with my man,
Chan,
the cannons bank of the legs.
Let's go champ.

2497
02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:21.230
He's been trying to get a fight forever as he still,
yeah,

2498
02:20:21.231 --> 02:20:24.290
he's always trying to get a fight.
Yeah.
He's those too old and it's like,

2499
02:20:24.291 --> 02:20:28.660
too much of a risk is man horse race.
You know,
he's skew horseman.
Yeah.

2500
02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:31.310
If you're not those three,
no one will see fight anybody.
Yeah.

2501
02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:36.090
And you would have to be moving him up to line was too old to hear Jim gray

2502
02:20:36.091 --> 02:20:37.310
after the fight.
What he said,
he goes,

2503
02:20:37.311 --> 02:20:40.940
the wilder he goes and people were booing him because he goes,
I get,
and I,

2504
02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:45.740
I love it,
but I also get why people are booing.
He goes,
he goes,
champ,
louder.

2505
02:20:46.050 --> 02:20:49.430
Great performance because I hate to tell you in Brazil's behind him,
he goes,

2506
02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:52.910
no one wants to see you do is to Brazil.
No one wants to fight or tease next.

2507
02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:55.760
That's supposedly what was supposed to be next.
I want to see fight or t's next.

2508
02:20:56.210 --> 02:20:59.210
It's either Joshua or fury.
That's all we want to see.

2509
02:20:59.211 --> 02:21:03.020
What are we going to get that the crowd,
which is Brazil got starts.
I'm like,

2510
02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:05.540
come on,
he's in the ring.
But Jim,
Greg is no fence.

2511
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:08.650
So they were booing Jim gray when he said that.
He asked that.
But,
but I'm,

2512
02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:09.171
I'm like,

2513
02:21:09.171 --> 02:21:12.980
I've been shouting from the rooftops and my podcasts in the exact same thing.

2514
02:21:13.250 --> 02:21:15.620
It's hard.
It's hard.
And I,
and I told showtime this,

2515
02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:20.540
it's hard to sell these fights because no one cares unless it's the ones we want

2516
02:21:20.541 --> 02:21:23.810
to see,
which is why what's makes the UFC so great?
You know,

2517
02:21:23.811 --> 02:21:25.550
you're gonna get one versus the champ,
you know,

2518
02:21:25.551 --> 02:21:27.140
to get the number two guy versus the champ.

2519
02:21:27.610 --> 02:21:31.610
The best are fighting the best night in,
night out.
Yeah.

2520
02:21:31.611 --> 02:21:36.130
So they got mad at a Jim Gray for telling the truth.
Yeah.
She going to get mad.

2521
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:37.910
That's just,
that is what it is.

2522
02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:41.030
Jim Gray knows what the fuck [inaudible] on the truth.
It's the truth.

2523
02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:46.970
He knows what the fuck he's doing.
Look,
man,
I'm all,
I want to see Louis Ortiz.

2524
02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:51.440
I want to see that fight.
You want to see what Louis Rdcs in wilder again,

2525
02:21:51.850 --> 02:21:54.290
100% you'd rather you think that should be next?
No,

2526
02:21:54.291 --> 02:21:55.700
I'm not saying that should be next.

2527
02:21:56.060 --> 02:22:01.060
I look if t j if Joshua and Tyson fury decided to fight and Louis decides to

2528
02:22:01.221 --> 02:22:04.940
fight a wilder,
I'm fine with that.
You want to see it again?
I'm fine.

2529
02:22:04.970 --> 02:22:09.260
I'm fine with that.
Who sort is a beast?
He's a beast.
Not,
it's not the best fight,

2530
02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:12.440
but I would watch the shit out of that fight more than Dominic Brazil.
Oh,

2531
02:22:12.441 --> 02:22:13.790
for sure.
I would love to see that fight.

2532
02:22:13.791 --> 02:22:15.260
I would've loved to see that fight instead,

2533
02:22:15.261 --> 02:22:18.080
and I think they offered a toward teas,
but I think Ortiz had an injury.

2534
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:22.410
Daft or tease Joshua,
because Joshua was June,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.

2535
02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:25.740
To offer it to him and he said,
no,
he wasn't here,
but this is,

2536
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:29.220
<v 1>this is boxing his man.
It goes,
we want more money in that one.</v>

2537
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:33.120
Double Joshua's team went on short notice.
Now we're,
we're giving you,

2538
02:22:33.121 --> 02:22:36.330
I think it was 5 million.
He went 10.
Oh look,

2539
02:22:36.331 --> 02:22:39.480
Lewis were teases Lee jet Bro.
Lead Shit.

2540
02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:44.460
He's a fucking cubic Olympic limpic box or no idea how old he is,
but to come on,

2541
02:22:44.461 --> 02:22:47.960
how bad asses.
Goddamn.
Deontay wilder.
I mean he's,
you know,

2542
02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:51.810
house full or teases.
Yes.
Any cracks.
Somebody's house.

2543
02:22:52.170 --> 02:22:57.130
He hits so fucking hard.
So does Ortiz.
No,
he does not.

2544
02:22:57.190 --> 02:23:01.060
Tease is a killer killer,
but he is not a killer.
The way 90 while there is,

2545
02:23:01.061 --> 02:23:04.260
that's a totally different jobs.
Fury on a killer like water.

2546
02:23:04.261 --> 02:23:07.320
When it comes to one punch power,
dude,
why is it in the world?

2547
02:23:07.350 --> 02:23:12.060
Wilder is made out of wood.
That dude is iron.
When he,
when he fucking hits dudes,

2548
02:23:12.061 --> 02:23:15.740
he hits dudes in a different way.
It's like the getting clubbed.
Boom.
No,

2549
02:23:15.810 --> 02:23:19.170
he says it's amazing,
dude.
The first thing I asked him what he did the podcast.

2550
02:23:19.171 --> 02:23:23.310
I'm like,
how the fuck do you hit so hard?
Like look,
he just knows he can.

2551
02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:25.110
He can absorb shots.

2552
02:23:25.410 --> 02:23:29.100
He's just smart enough to hang on there and just stand in front of you.

2553
02:23:29.101 --> 02:23:33.750
If you're standing in front of him,
he can.
Uncork kidding.
He is 17 pounds.

2554
02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:37.020
This is a tough fight.
This is what I'm saying is losing this fight.
Dude,

2555
02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:39.450
look at this.
He's getting his body worked.
He's getting beat.

2556
02:23:39.470 --> 02:23:44.470
His wife got club there too and he is getting fucking hurt so this is not,

2557
02:23:44.730 --> 02:23:48.780
this is not an easy fight for him and I think the rematch will be even harder.

2558
02:23:48.781 --> 02:23:52.890
I really truly believe that.
I think whatever Ortiz has got left in his body,

2559
02:23:52.891 --> 02:23:57.420
he's going to come at them and Deontay wilder knows that this guy could fucking

2560
02:23:57.421 --> 02:24:00.180
box.
The difference I think is with wilder.

2561
02:24:00.181 --> 02:24:03.450
You're dealing with a guy who is getting better with every fight because he's

2562
02:24:03.451 --> 02:24:06.420
literally learning on the job as one of the most successful heavyweight

2563
02:24:06.421 --> 02:24:09.450
champions of all time because he's only been fighting since he was 20 he's

2564
02:24:09.451 --> 02:24:11.730
getting better and better and better for loose all t's.

2565
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:14.660
Louis Ortiz is like maintaining right now,
60 years,

2566
02:24:14.670 --> 02:24:19.260
49,000 years old years old from Cuba.
We have no,
he has 70,000 flights.

2567
02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:21.960
He's only lost once.
It's still wilder.
He's been popped.

2568
02:24:22.170 --> 02:24:26.520
He's been popped for Stoikos Josias.
It's fucking fury or Joshua,

2569
02:24:26.521 --> 02:24:29.910
go fuck your mother.
And then he dropped him and he dropped him here.
I know.

2570
02:24:29.940 --> 02:24:33.600
This is where it moves into the Joshua Wilder next.
Listen Bro,
if we don't,

2571
02:24:33.601 --> 02:24:35.640
I'm telling you I am down to see this fight again.

2572
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:40.240
I'm down to see this fight again or teas.
Oh,
he hurt.
Wow Man.
Wow.

2573
02:24:40.250 --> 02:24:44.340
This isn't that fun.
Yup.
He hurt.
Wilder does the happiest.
That dude,
I fucking,

2574
02:24:44.341 --> 02:24:47.460
I lost that job.
I love that guy.
I love his story.

2575
02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:52.140
I love how he is as a person.
He's fun person.
He's great.
And his also,

2576
02:24:52.141 --> 02:24:54.230
it's interesting how small he is as a heavyweight,

2577
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:58.320
so thin when he fought Tyson fury way two oh nine it's nuts,
man.

2578
02:24:58.321 --> 02:25:02.220
Two Oh nine my favorite part is he's such a beast of a debt to bring this kid.

2579
02:25:02.530 --> 02:25:04.920
He was a baby,
brings him in,
his wife everywhere,

2580
02:25:05.350 --> 02:25:08.100
thinks the rest of the kids everywhere.
Like I was surprised how sweet he was.

2581
02:25:08.101 --> 02:25:10.750
Like he's like a warm friendly guy.
You love him.
Right?

2582
02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:13.670
His blessings to everybody and blessing his blessing talent,
man.
Yeah,

2583
02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:18.000
like vibrates.
Yes.
This is the real deal,
man.
I'm get to be around.
I'm,

2584
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:21.240
I'm excited about the heavyweight division two because I feel the same way about

2585
02:25:21.241 --> 02:25:21.780
Joshua.

2586
02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:25.150
Joshua seems like a chore like Champ of a Person I've ever talked to him seems

2587
02:25:25.151 --> 02:25:27.670
awesome and we get all these interviews he like comes across,

2588
02:25:27.671 --> 02:25:31.900
he's smiling and he's charismatic and he's interested in probably got one of

2589
02:25:31.901 --> 02:25:34.540
them.
Land Rover v Eights defenders,

2590
02:25:35.610 --> 02:25:37.120
just fine the girls.

2591
02:25:37.390 --> 02:25:40.840
I'm saying that because I saw a video of him where there was a car show where

2592
02:25:40.841 --> 02:25:42.940
they drove Anthony Joshua around.

2593
02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:47.560
He got to drive around one of those a land rover defenders,
those box.

2594
02:25:47.570 --> 02:25:49.980
He looked military vehicles.
I lizard her though.

2595
02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:52.990
They're about to release a new one.
They're coming out with a new one.
Yeah.

2596
02:25:52.991 --> 02:25:55.450
Land roads coming out with a new defender.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

2597
02:25:55.451 --> 02:25:57.640
They have a new model since there's such hits.

2598
02:25:57.641 --> 02:26:00.220
Just like Ford's come out with a bronco.
Yeah.

2599
02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:03.400
They're coming out with a bronco and they're also going to have like a smaller

2600
02:26:03.401 --> 02:26:04.970
Bronco just uh,

2601
02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:09.010
took the baby bronco or a two door in a four door and wait til they do like this

2602
02:26:09.011 --> 02:26:13.380
VT version of the raptor vision of the Bronx.
Shit.
Get rid of the rafters,

2603
02:26:13.770 --> 02:26:16.270
your rafters.
One of my all time favorite trucks.

2604
02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:19.160
It is such a meat head move to get a goddamn rafter.

2605
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:23.410
Especially in such a meathead like you've got bales of Hay back there son.

2606
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:25.840
What are you using that pickup?
Four zero thing.

2607
02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:30.960
What am I using for being awesome.
Being awesome.
Yeah.

2608
02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:35.170
The thing about those tools lifted with fucking monster truck raptors are

2609
02:26:35.171 --> 02:26:39.400
preposterous cars cause they give someone the ability to drive like a real off

2610
02:26:39.401 --> 02:26:43.840
road vehicle with 500 plus horsepower and just get it from a factory and has a

2611
02:26:43.841 --> 02:26:44.830
craziest suspension.

2612
02:26:44.831 --> 02:26:47.170
You could just drive over the fucking moon with [inaudible] pension.

2613
02:26:47.350 --> 02:26:49.840
I mean it has a crazy travel in those wheels.

2614
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:51.850
So when you drive it on the highway too,

2615
02:26:51.851 --> 02:26:56.240
it's like smooth cause it feels like an s class almost absorbs everything but

2616
02:26:56.241 --> 02:26:57.500
yet it's huge.
Yeah.

2617
02:26:57.550 --> 02:27:02.080
It's a monster of a vehicle and you could accessory the fuck out of that bitch

2618
02:27:02.081 --> 02:27:06.210
with some crazy bumpers and rear bumpers.
Tail bumpers.
Sure.

2619
02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:09.880
Side pipes.
I mean sidesteps and shit.

2620
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:14.910
What does that Deontay Wilder Gatorskin oh no.

2621
02:27:18.670 --> 02:27:23.350
Oh No.
Let's go champ.
No,
I don't support this.

2622
02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:28.040
I said,
Hey,
I love him more now.
No.

2623
02:27:28.041 --> 02:27:32.380
Oh I want more pictures.
Yeah.
What are you gonna do with gaps?

2624
02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:36.730
Listen,
first of all,
that's a wrap.
Okay.
That's not really asking.
It's a wrap.

2625
02:27:36.970 --> 02:27:41.620
What if it was real gatorskin they would have to glue it to the cop and the on

2626
02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:44.320
it you,
there's like divots on the little things

2627
02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:52.450
hush your mouth.
That's not August.
Did I have an alligator skin?

2628
02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:55.390
I hate alligators.
I don't know if you know this.
I don't like him.
I don't,

2629
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:58.790
I don't talk about it too much,
but I have like a hate fear.
Scared of them.
Yeah.

2630
02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:00.070
Yeah.
When I was a little kid,

2631
02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:05.080
I lived in Florida when I live in Gainesville from age 11 to 13 and we live near

2632
02:28:05.081 --> 02:28:08.920
a place called Lake Alice and Lake Alice had alligators and I knew there was a

2633
02:28:08.921 --> 02:28:11.950
lady that was walking her out,
her and walking her Haugen,

2634
02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:17.140
walking her dog by the lake and the algorithm came out and snatched her fucking

2635
02:28:17.141 --> 02:28:19.600
dog and I didn't see it.
I didn't see it.

2636
02:28:19.601 --> 02:28:23.210
But I remember that being a thing and I remember seeing those goddamn things all

2637
02:28:23.211 --> 02:28:26.240
the time and everybody telling me that you don't have to worry about it.

2638
02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:29.420
When I'm 11,
my,
my sister,

2639
02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:32.780
my sister is 10 and we'd be hanging out this lake and I'd be like,

2640
02:28:32.781 --> 02:28:37.160
what the fuck is to stop an alligator from eating us?
Nothing.

2641
02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:41.930
And I real,
I,
and I remember looking them in the eye and I'm fascinated by them.

2642
02:28:41.931 --> 02:28:43.550
Right?
They're amazing.
Cause I always love dinosaurs.

2643
02:28:43.551 --> 02:28:45.740
When I was a kid that was a sore.
It is a dinosaur.

2644
02:28:45.741 --> 02:28:46.820
And I'm just always in a nature,

2645
02:28:46.821 --> 02:28:49.700
I'm always into to cool nature of shows and documentaries.

2646
02:28:49.701 --> 02:28:52.720
So I'm looking at this thing thinking like,
oh,

2647
02:28:52.730 --> 02:28:56.330
we're just used to them being around.
Like we shouldn't allow them to be around.

2648
02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:59.330
We're just used to them being around.
So we think it's cool that they're around,

2649
02:28:59.450 --> 02:29:03.080
but they will fucking eat,
you know,
eat your Doni chance they get.

2650
02:29:03.170 --> 02:29:05.780
So I started buying,
I buy a alligator.

2651
02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:09.860
I always have alligator always add.
All my belts are always alligator.

2652
02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:14.450
That's gangster,
dude.
I have alligator,
um,
bags from my pool cues.

2653
02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:18.890
I'm been alligator alligator,
which like alligators.
I have an alligator wallet.

2654
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:22.490
If I told you I did dude,
I don't like them or to kill them.
Oh Wow.

2655
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:24.170
I want to kill them.
If alligators,

2656
02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:26.750
if there's too many of them and they were near you,
you'd want to kill them too.

2657
02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:29.470
They're eating machines.
They're heartless eating machines.

2658
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:32.570
They got a brain the size of a thumb.
I don't like him,
dude.

2659
02:29:32.571 --> 02:29:35.210
How about the one at Disneyworld?
The parents that their kid,

2660
02:29:35.211 --> 02:29:39.170
they're the two year old.
Yes.
Eight.
The fucking kid.
They had no,
at Disney world,

2661
02:29:39.171 --> 02:29:40.550
they have a real problem in Florida.

2662
02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:44.090
They have to scan the fucking property looking for alligators.

2663
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:48.560
They have to go through it.
They've waters there.
I took my daughter,
my youngest,

2664
02:29:48.561 --> 02:29:50.450
we went fishing there.
There's a,
there's a,

2665
02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:52.970
there's a lake that where he'd go bass fishing.
It's amazing.

2666
02:29:52.971 --> 02:29:56.540
There's grades of alligators in there.
Fuck.
Gather is,
you've gotta be careful,

2667
02:29:56.541 --> 02:30:00.710
man.
Anytime you've got a body of water and land around Florida.
Yeah.

2668
02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:05.180
No swimming in Florida.
That's my role.
No swim in those lakes swimming.
No.

2669
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:08.390
Any row.
Don't know swimming.
So there's no water.
Schwartz in Florida.

2670
02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:11.810
That's the rule in out of the water.
No,
I sent Tampa.

2671
02:30:11.820 --> 02:30:13.790
They're going to go to the beach.
No,
fuck you.

2672
02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:18.500
Fuck you and your saltwater crush sharks.
Sharks.
You got shark soup down here,

2673
02:30:18.501 --> 02:30:21.800
bitch.
Fuck that.
Fuck this.
You tell me ways to die in Florida.
Dude.

2674
02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:25.100
The craziest thing is happening right now in the everglades is the pythons.

2675
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:30.370
They said that there has been a 90 plus percent decrease in the amount of

2676
02:30:30.741 --> 02:30:34.850
rabbits,
possums,
raccoons,
deer.

2677
02:30:34.970 --> 02:30:39.970
Like all the major mammals that live in the Florida everglades are gone.

2678
02:30:40.300 --> 02:30:44.750
They've all been killed by python.
God,
they took a Judas Python.

2679
02:30:44.751 --> 02:30:47.060
You know what a Judas Python is?
They take a python,

2680
02:30:47.061 --> 02:30:48.740
they put a chip in it so they can track it.

2681
02:30:48.800 --> 02:30:52.760
So they had this male python and they sent him out there to find the females,

2682
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:55.910
and they used him to locate through the,
you know,

2683
02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:59.870
using the gps to locate a 16 foot python,

2684
02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:03.810
16 foot female python that was pregnant.
Came,
set,
match.
Yeah.

2685
02:31:03.811 --> 02:31:06.040
So he's banging these bitches out there,
make it,

2686
02:31:06.041 --> 02:31:10.370
I'm pregnant and he's homeless or lunch and these evil fucking snakes look at

2687
02:31:10.371 --> 02:31:13.620
that thing.
Is that it?
Stake hold stakes boyfriend?

2688
02:31:14.930 --> 02:31:18.200
They have to kill it.
Hands off.
No,
no,
no.
They're,
they're invasive.

2689
02:31:18.201 --> 02:31:23.040
They're not supposed to be.
It had 73 eggs to me it was more than 17 feet long.

2690
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:26.040
You imagined stumbling across that thing.
You're dead.
You're dead.

2691
02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:29.820
That thing weighs as much as you do.
You're dead.
Holy Fuck.
Yeah.

2692
02:31:29.821 --> 02:31:32.880
That's probably a 200 pound snake.
Oh my God.

2693
02:31:32.890 --> 02:31:36.330
Says that this little bitch ass hundred 4,440 and getting away from that,

2694
02:31:36.470 --> 02:31:40.050
I get in my face if I got the knife.
So he a snake on the live.
He's so hard.

2695
02:31:40.290 --> 02:31:43.710
God Pay.
