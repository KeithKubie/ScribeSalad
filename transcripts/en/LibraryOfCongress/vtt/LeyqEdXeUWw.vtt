00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.310
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So, I'm
Pam Jackson, I'm director

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.500
for the Center for the Book
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.710
We are part of the library's
newly created national

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.660
and international outreach
unit and I welcome you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.300
and thank you for being here.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.360
To our partners and colleagues
cosponsoring today's events,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.010
to the program participants and
to our speakers, to collectors,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.260
to friends, to each of
you tonight thank you

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.330
for joining us, thank you
for giving us your attention

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.830
and being generous with us.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.780
The library's central mission is
to provide the American people

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.370
with a rich, diverse,
enduring source of knowledge,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.690
one that can be relied
upon to inform and inspire

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.650
and engage people to
support their intellectual

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.840
and creative endeavors.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.810
And a part of our vision
here at the library is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.980
that we are the chief steward
of the record of knowledge

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.180
for America and thus the world,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.590
creating a springboard
to the future.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.440
It's a future that I hope to be
one of compassion and courage

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.890
and industry and excitement
and remarkable accomplishment

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.460
and achievement, and one of
tolerance and acceptance.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.770
And so, today's collectors
in their own rights are part

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.230
of our goal and hope and
desire for stewards of records

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.630
of knowledge and I applaud
you in your commitment

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.490
and you celebrate
the accomplishments

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.590
that will be shared tonight.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.830
Here, at the Center for the
Book, which includes the Poetry

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.110
and Literature Center and the
Young Readers Center we promote

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.110
books and libraries,
literacy and reading,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.460
poetry and literature because
we believe beyond a shadow

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.510
of a doubt is the best way to
empowerment, to enlightenment,

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.520
to educate and inform societies,
to protect and uphold democracy.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.480
We believe more than
anything else books

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.170
and reading are the best
weapons against ignorance

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.090
and intolerance and we thank you
for being part of our mission

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.230
of service and fulfilling on
the promotion of knowledge

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.130
and the inspiration
that books bring us.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.260
It's my job and my honor to
introduce our next speaker

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.830
in the program John
Cole, John Y. Cole.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.470
Historian of the
Library of Congress,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.010
more importantly the founding
director of the Center

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.100
for the Book which is
celebrating its 40th year

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.090
in existence next year.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.470
With just the deepest gratitude
John for you and your role here

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.190
at the library what you've
created and what's to come,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.190
thank you for creating
this event tonight

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.450
and for leading us
the way forward.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.250
Welcome John Y. Cole.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:17.050
[ Applause ]

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.350
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you Pam.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.070
As you can see, I'm still
easing my way out of the Center

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.690
for the Book, but very
excited about being the Library

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.950
of Congress' first historian.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.960
And one of the things I
can record is the success

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.350
of a program such as this one
of which has been transferred

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.430
to the Library of
Congress in recent times.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.370
I want to say just a quick
word about this awards program.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.270
In 2005, the magazine Fine Books

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.590
and Collections started this
program and competition to honor

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.760
and to award student
book collectors

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.790
and they went along very
well, but eventually some

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.800
of the other people in the
book world, including people

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.730
who are eager to become involved
agreed that we would take

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.840
over in a new partnership
the sponsorship

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.560
of the awards program for
certain here at the Library

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.560
of Congress, but also with other
partners the administration

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.860
of the program.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.680
And our purpose always has been
to kind of broaden the reach

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.000
and to get more schools
and more students

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.570
and more people involved
in book collecting.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.860
The purpose really is to
honor young collectors

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.210
which we're doing tonight
and kind of push them gently

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.070
and maybe not so gently into
becoming lifetime book lovers

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.650
and accomplished collectors
and even bibliophiles

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.130
if they aren't careful.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.420
So that's one of the ways

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.940
that we are bringing
several groups together

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.830
for the sponsorship of this.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.950
If you look at your program

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.500
which you may have missed
the other sponsors are the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.820
Antiquarian Booksellers
Association of America,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.290
the Rare Book and Special
Collections Division

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.300
of the Library of
Congress, the Fellowship

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.220
of American Bibliophilic
Societies, and the Grolier Club

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.230
and we are very grateful
to all of them and also

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.190
to the contributors
and supporters

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.050
and friends who've made
financial contributions

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.540
at various levels
to this program.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.220
We hope that you like it, we
hope you continue to support it

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.160
and we promise that
we will continue

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.300
to bring you very
high-quality winners

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.370
which we are doing tonight

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.900
and I think you will enjoy
meeting them and learning

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.800
about what they are able to
think about as collectors,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.040
it's really quite amazing.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.640
I would like to welcome
the Grolier Club

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.880
as our latest partner
in this partnership

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.390
and president Scott Clemons
is here and Scott would

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.690
like to say a few words.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.570
Scott. There you are.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.870
&gt;&gt; Scott Clemons: Here I am.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.600
Thank you, John.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.900
I just -- the Grolier Club,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.290
how many of you know
of the Grolier Club?

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.530
Oh, this warms my
heart to see this,

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.770
thank you that makes
my day to see that.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.050
The Grolier Club was founded
in 1884 originally as a club

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.520
for private collectors of books

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.710
and since then it's
broadened a great deal

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.440
to include institutional
collectors as well.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.400
Anyone tangibly involved
in the book arts,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.480
so there are bookmakers,
there are typographers,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.100
there are still a healthy dose

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.590
of private collectors
such as myself.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.600
So, as sponsors of this award
it just makes all the sense

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.070
in the world for the club
to meet collectors early on

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.450
and introduce them to the
resources the club has to offer,

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.760
most of which are people who
have been in this passion for 10

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.360
or 30 or 50 or 60 or
more years as collectors.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.910
So, one of the things
that we did last year

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.310
and that we're doing again this
year is that we are to each

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.610
of the four honorees
offering a year's membership

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.820
in the Grolier Club with all the
rights thereunto appertaining

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.500
as the lawyers would say.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.070
And we hope to see
those people at the club

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.930
and the various events
that the club does,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.760
including quite a
few here in DC.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.540
There are number of club
members in the greater DC area.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.460
We do three or four events a
year here in DC and nationwide,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.030
and increasingly even
worldwide as well.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.240
And as a matter fact I would
invite all of you to come

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.740
to the Grolier Club in spite
of being a private club

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.010
on 60th Street in
Manhattan it is also open

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.990
to the public six days
a week with exhibitions

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.600
and two different galleries,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.890
public lecture series,
a research library.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.420
So, stop by and when
you do ask for me

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.540
and if I'm there I'll
say hello to you.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.320
So, thank you again for
letting us be a part of this

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.670
and it's a privilege for
us to be a part of this

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.970
and thank you John as well.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.480
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.780
Thank you.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.080
&gt;&gt; Scott Clemons: Thanks.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.380
&gt;&gt; John Cole: And tonight,

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.910
I'd like to offer a special
thank you to ABAA and especially

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.900
to Susan Benny who has carried
the administrative burden

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.550
for this contest and has
kept everyone in line

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.800
and has had many wonderful
ideas that we do our best

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.870
to incorporate, don't we Susan?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.070
And we talk about other
ideas and it's interesting

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.700
that with the Grolier Club
of course there's a concern

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.740
about young collectors, with our
organizations there's a concern

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.920
about young collectors and this
is an alliance I think that all

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.970
of us involved in
are working on.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.930
The other partner
within the Library

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.300
of Congress is the Rare Book
and Special Collections Division

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.250
and at this time I'd like to
introduce Mark Dimunation.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.610
Mark is the judge on the part
of the Library of Congress,

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.350
but Mark is more than that.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.630
Mark also is part of the
package that winners get

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.340
when they arrive here and
get a program this afternoon,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.640
it was held at the Rare Book

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.510
and Special Collections Division
having Mark talk about a few

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.850
of the treasures, we have a
few books and things based

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.550
on collecting and
Mark does that so well

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.900
and I know everyone
there appreciates it.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.440
I'd ask Mark to say a word
or two before we move ahead

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:08.860
with our speaker about the
process of judging and come

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.540
on Mark you can cover it
up pretty well, come on.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.510
Let's give Mark a hand.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:20.810
[ Applause ]

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.110
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Thank you.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.410
imagine the terrified
look on their faces

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.290
when they're informed
I'm part of the package.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.920
Welcome everybody, it's a
lovely event and for those of us

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.960
in the rare book in the
world this is always exciting

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.430
because we know we're looking
at the future of collections

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.810
across America, whether they
land in Goucher or the Library

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.470
of Congress so that
we're still talking.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.100
I want to give you a sense of
what it's like to participate

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.340
on the end of actually
reading a variety of essays

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.060
from young collectors
who are talking

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.150
about the reasons
behind why they collect,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.520
how they collected, what
prompted them to begin.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.330
For those of us who live
with rare book collections

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.030
of course this is
the story we tell

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.020
of almost everything we
have in the division,

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.900
so it's a very familiar
tale to be told.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.080
But I just want to give you a
sense of what we were coping

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.860
with just in the spirit of
the four prizewinners today.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.260
Imagine if you will
in the reading of more

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.360
than a dozen essays that
include lists of books.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.750
These are the people
who have filtered

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.530
through their local
competitions, that have come

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.610
to a national competition,
that have then been sifted

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.380
through to a final
round and that's

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.380
when the final judges
step in to read.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.140
There are other people in the
room here who are participating

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.020
in this conversation
and they can back me up.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.830
It's kind of a wild ride
that we go on in part

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.600
because we're confronting
in some cases materials

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.680
that we're very familiar
with and we want

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.470
to see the particular
take of the collector.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.880
In other cases, as is the case

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.610
with the first-place
prizewinner, we were introduced

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.380
to someone we've never heard of.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.350
And so, we're introduced
to not only the topic

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.270
but also the notion
of collecting

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.810
for the first time afresh.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.240
So, in the range

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.800
of the conversations
imagine making a decision

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.280
between the collection of a
particular individual who comes

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.980
from Mobile along the southern
coast compared to a collection

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.250
on Sacco and Vanzetti and
finally, to the stories

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.310
of resistance during Jewish
resistance during the Holocaust,

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.360
and then finally a collection
of sailboats from somebody

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.100
who lives in New Mexico.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.430
And to try and wrap your head

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.280
around these what it means is
diving deep into these essays,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.860
which are extremely important to
the understanding and I think,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.180
I suspect may actually be
helpful to the young collectors

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.140
as they're being
asked to explain maybe

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:45.900
for the first time what started
them and why they collect now.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:54.580
So, Megan who collected the
Sacco and Vanzetti books talks

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.090
about her first introduction
to the trial and then sort

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.100
of running into conflicting
information and the bother

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.230
that that creates for her
and the effort to sort

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.060
of set the story right.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.470
Whereas, Micaela who's writing

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.400
about Jewish resistance
during the Holocaust,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.880
discovering that there's a great
deal of material from the period

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.560
but not so much about
resistance and the need

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.590
to keep that story alive.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.890
Until we get to Luke's
story about Eugene Walter,

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.650
king of the monkeys which I
have to confess I kind of moaned

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:27.720
when I read the title I thought
he's collecting a naturalist.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.930
Well, it couldn't be
further from the truth.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.220
Eugene Walter is an
amazing individual

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.520
and we had quite a ride

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.980
and ultimately Luke's collection
landed in first place,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.960
not just because of the
nature of Mr. Walter himself

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.840
who affiliated himself from
anything from Peggy Guggenheim

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.860
to the film Innovate and a Half
to writing cookbooks to talking

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:58.290
about Alabama to going back and
forth to writing about his life,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.670
one book of which is
called the Untidy Pilgrim.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.520
It's an amazing ride
of an individual

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.050
and you'll hear more
about that later.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.110
So, it's a difficult
decision to be made,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.850
this is how we make
that judgment.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:15.300
How true to the topic and
to the goal and the mission

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.650
of their collecting are
these collectors and that's

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.910
when the prizewinners very
quickly sort themselves

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.780
out from the other contributors,
all of whom are writing

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.500
about interesting collections.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.570
But what we find in the four

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.360
that have been given awards
today is a real passion not just

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.750
for the subject, but
also for collecting.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.260
And it's the combination of
the two, of adding some sort

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.350
of material reality to
the interest of the topic

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.960
that they're writing about
that makes them true collectors

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.500
in the minds of those
of us who live

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.040
with these on a daily basis.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.050
These are very erudite
essays in many cases

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.340
and I can say this an old
man now, it makes one proud

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.550
of the next generation who
are writing in full sentences

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:00.430
about books and that
just warms my heart.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.060
It was lovely to have three
of the four here today to talk

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.750
about slightly more
polished collectors in a way,

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.100
giving them a sense of the
family that they've joined

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.490
as collectors and the
continuity in the world of books

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.660
of people seeking out books
because they love them

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.350
as things, because they
love them as ideas,

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.440
because they love them as
something that's come to us

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.130
from another person and the
stories that they reveal.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.340
So, imagine for a moment,
sitting on the phone

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.230
with several individuals
staking your claim

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.440
around a particular topic
and you have a sense

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.800
of what it must be like to be
a judge in this competition.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.600
So, congratulations
to everybody.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.500
[ Applause ]

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.130
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well as Mark
hinted, one person cannot be

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.600
with us today and we're sorry.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.340
The essay prize winner
Samantha Flitter

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.480
from Princeton University
she wrote her essay

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.310
and Mark referred to it,
the Sand and the Sea and Age

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.730
of Sail Library, Sail Libraries,

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.970
reading about sailboats
in rural New Mexico.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.560
So, she had quite a story
and wrote about it very well

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.180
and I'm sorry she
isn't here tonight,

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.960
but she was unable to make it.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.000
However, it's my pleasure now
to introduce an individual

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.910
who besides loving books
and quite obviously food,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.320
which we will hear much more

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.200
about is also an award-winning
author, a journalist, a teacher

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.180
and a community activist.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.690
Toni Tipton-Martin is a very
busy person building a healthier

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.510
community for all of us
through her books, her teaching

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.850
and classes and now
her own foundation.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.080
She has been invited twice
by First Lady Michelle Obama

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.320
to the White House
for her outreach

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.080
to help families live
happier and healthier lives.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.350
And she received the 2014
Southern Foodways Alliance John

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.090
Egerton prize for this work.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.590
With the Egerton
prize's seed money

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.940
over the past June
16th weekend in Austin,

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:18.310
Texas Toni hosted Soul Summit,
a conversation about race,

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.350
identity, power and food.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.590
It was and sounds like it
must've been an unprecedented

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.390
three-day meeting.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:31.040
Among her other activities
and honors Toni is the author

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.750
of the Jemima Code,
two centuries

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.550
of African-American
cookbooks published last year

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.190
by the University
of Texas Press.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.620
It's an award-winning
bibliography and too late

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.660
for this listing,
but with the cards

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.490
from the winter here
are a couple

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.940
of other acknowledgments
of this book.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.700
Here's one of the reviews, the
New York Times book review,

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.620
Jemima code is no ordinary
book, it's a heaping helping,

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.180
a long-overdue acknowledgment.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.790
From NPR's Best Books of 2005,
it is a rare coffee table book

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.480
that serves up important
history and compelling imagery

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.540
and digestible bite-size chunks.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.680
You can see there's a big
opportunity there for similes

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.080
and many other things.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:24.370
I'm not going to talk
about her collection,

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.260
she's going to talk a
little bit about it I think

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.180
in relation with the book.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.010
But the Jemima Code is
also the title of her blog

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.650
and a traveling exhibit which
features larger-than-life images

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:40.090
of black cooks at work taken
from Toni's gallery of authors

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.950
which she will tell us about.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.050
In 1991, she was the first
African-American woman

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.190
to hold the position
of food editor

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.210
at a major daily
American newspaper,

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.010
the Cleveland Plain Dealer.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.830
She's been a guest instructor
at Whole Foods Culinary Center

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.640
and appeared on cooking
channels, Foodography

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.930
and the PBS feature Juneteenth
There it is Again Jamboree.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.250
Toni, I'm exhausted, help
get me out of this jam.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.510
Here is Toni Tipton-Martin.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:14.480
[ Applause ]

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.560
&gt;&gt; Toni Tipton-Martin: Thank
you so much, thank you.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.490
Hi. So ordinarily speakers you
know we begin with what an honor

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.210
and a privilege it is
to be here but really,

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.930
I have to say I am a
little silly giddy,

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.920
I'm so excited to be here.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.920
This is the place where
my work in some ways began

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.920
and so the ability to read the
winning essays as a journalist

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.920
and a reporter, as
an amateur collector

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:54.790
and to read your passion
and to see some of myself

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:58.110
in your writing it
makes me emotional,

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.910
it was just really a privilege

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.210
and it is a privilege
to be here.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:06.830
So, thank you so
much for having me.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.610
I've passed around a copy of the
card, not because I'm so vain

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.000
that I want you to see the
back with all of the awards,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.590
my publisher did that.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:19.110
But I'd like to begin really
the way that I begin everywhere.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.570
This is the first opportunity
that I've had to speak

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.040
in a new family, a
family of collectors,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:29.700
a family that is making me
feel a bit of confidence

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.860
about what I've just
experienced.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.080
I speak to so many groups,
food people primarily,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.780
but I will be speaking at
Duke for example next week

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.560
and so there are always people
that have a different kind

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.950
of an interest in my
material than people

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:50.390
who are not necessarily focused
on African-American history

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.570
or Foodways studies,
but as collectors.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.570
And so, what I've given is
the card that I'm traveling

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.520
around with and I ask everybody

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.070
to take a minute to
look at the cover.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.370
This is the cover of the book.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.620
This is the book, but it doesn't
have the dust jacket on it.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.770
So, this is the dust jacket that
would be there, how about that?

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:20.490
Take a peek and now
just for a moment notice

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.930
that you're having a
reaction to the cover.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.640
It's a little easier when it's
a slide or when it's bigger,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.060
but each of us individually
is having a reaction

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.640
to this picture.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:37.460
Whether you recognize
the image as a woman

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.500
who might've been a caretaker in
your community, in your family.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.270
There might be a sense
of pride connected

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.090
to memories associated
with this woman.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.460
There might even be a sense
of shame for some people

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.810
that I speak to regarding
this image.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.730
Whether that is
African-Americans

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:02.390
or white people we
all have a reaction.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.670
And there's even a
reaction by young people

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.110
who don't have any idea who
she is and what I'm talking

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:13.030
about because you see packages
with faces on them all the time.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.440
But the reason I ask
everyone to take a moment is

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.580
that in our daily busy lives we
go through life having reactions

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.800
to things and we're not
always aware of them.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.040
We're being spoken to a lot
now about mindfulness right,

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.280
everybody's talking about being
mindful and paying attention.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.980
And so, my work centers
on using food as a tool

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:42.200
for racial reconciliation,
that's my primary purpose.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.020
It's why I won the Egerton prize

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:49.320
and other great things
that have happened.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:57.510
And prejudice occurs one
affront at a time and so my goal

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.120
with writing the
Jemima Code was the hope

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.950
that we could restore an
image that has been used

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.750
in multiple ways to
distract us, to divide us,

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:14.870
to degrade one population
and use that image in a way

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.070
that by the time
you get to the end

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.100
of my work we're all
in the same place.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.870
So even though we might start
somewhere differently we will

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.940
all wind up in the same place.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.710
So, I won't even ask how many of
you have seen the Jemima Code.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.090
But the Jemima Code
is a bibliography,

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.140
an annotated bibliography
and it is the story

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.860
of my rare black
book collection.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.740
I'm an amateur accidental
collector,

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:51.830
I collected these books
as a reporter on a story.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.780
My goal in writing this
book as I've said was

00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:00.540
to describe each one of
these authors in a unique

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:05.390
and unbiased way so that by
the time we get to the end

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.920
of the book we're all
in the same place.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.920
If you can't see it in the back,
there's a little black girl

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.220
and a little white girl

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.710
and they're going
off into the sunset.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:21.330
And this is an image taken from
one of the books from 1978.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.350
Two authors got together, a
white woman and a black woman

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.230
in Louisiana and
they published a book

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.440
with the same motive
that I have.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.890
I just love that.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:36.800
So, I'm going to save one of
these pages because when I look

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.940
for it when speaking
I always lose it.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:46.070
So, as I said, I
was a journalist

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.070
in pursuit of a story.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.080
I was the nutrition writer

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.010
for the Los Angeles Times many
years ago, some 30 years ago

00:23:55.010 --> 00:24:00.530
and I was busy organizing
the cookbooks and working

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.010
with the recipes in the
collections, in the archives

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.130
in the department and I noticed

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.770
that there were no
African-American

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.380
cookbooks there.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.630
But not only did I notice
there were no cookbooks there I

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.620
noticed that those references

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.680
to African-Americans were
usually very disparaging.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.570
They made reference to
this Aunt Jemima character,

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:28.840
a mythological figure that has
lingered in American history,

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.000
southern history, in
literature, in film.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.380
You will recognize her as the
nanny figure in many of the --

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.360
in everywhere right
in Southern history.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.340
And I was looking for my
grandmother on the pages

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.560
of Southern history and I
wasn't able to find her there

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.220
and certainly not in the way
that I would recognize her.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.760
And so, I had this idea

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.780
that I would interview
elderly African-American women

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.730
about their true-life
experiences

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.470
and hopefully be able to share
with the rest of the world,

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:12.130
the passion and the intelligence
and the knowledge and the wisdom

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.860
that I experienced in my own
community through these women.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.950
And I told a couple of
people that I had that idea

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.770
and other books came out.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.110
I'm not from the South I'm from
Los Angeles, so I told people

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.090
for example that I was
going to do this book

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.760
by traveling the South and
going to black churches

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.860
and that's how I would
find these women.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.950
And lo and behold somebody came
out with a book on black recipes

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.310
from black churches
in the South.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.400
So, I learned to keep my
idea about my next book very,

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.540
very close to the best.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.650
As a matter fact, so many of
my friends who are scholars

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:48.050
who once this book finally came
out I received so many e-mails

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.410
from people saying we had
no idea what you were doing.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.750
They knew I was working on
something, but not something

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.710
at this level of beauty.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.600
So anyway, I was
there at the Times

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.360
and I thought I would
interview all these women

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.620
and then I realized I didn't
have really any access

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.560
to women in the South.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:13.660
And one day there was a little
book, it's the one on the bottom

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.470
if you can see in the back, it's
called the New Orleans Cookbook

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.130
by Lena Richard, it
was published in 1985

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.610
and this is a paperback
edition of this book.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.570
It appeared in a book
giveaway, at the Times

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.250
as reporters we weren't allowed
to take anything for free

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.860
and so we would give away books
that came in as review copies

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.320
so that others could
share in those readings.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.620
And so, this book,

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.760
Lena Richard's book
showed up in this pile.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.970
And so, I didn't quite know
what I was going to do with it,

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.900
there was no photograph
of the woman in there,

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.370
but it was called New Orleans

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.510
and even though I know Southern
food and Creole food are very,

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.290
very different I thought well
it might help me in some way.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.390
So, I took this book home, I
put it on my shelf with all

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:03.160
of my other cookbooks and it
sat there for quite a number

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.740
of years, probably
about 10 years.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.680
And then I was attending
an event in Atlanta

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.420
and John Egerton whose name,
in whose name the award

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.430
that I received was given was
a Southern sage civil rights

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:25.750
writer, a very important man
in the writings of the South.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:31.660
And he had just returned from a
visit to the Library of Congress

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.220
and I heard him speak
and he spoke eloquently

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.290
about the women in my community.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.070
He spoke about African-American
women and their contributions

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.280
to American society in
particular through food.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.900
And I was astounded, I hadn't
heard anyone speak that way.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.490
And so, I ran over to the
groupie gaggle that was hanging

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.460
around him, I had
no idea who he was,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.020
but obviously everyone else did.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.980
And I had shared that with
him that I had no idea,

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.060
I'd never heard anyone
speak that way.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.560
And he said I've just returned
from the Library of Congress

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.210
and I have something in
my briefcase for you,

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.400
meet me in the press room.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.560
And so, I waited for him in
the lobby of the press room

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.100
of the hotel and he went
through his briefcase

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:19.430
and he had this disheveled stack
of wrinkled pages from a book

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:26.570
from 1912 called the Kentucky
Cookbook by a colored woman.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:30.920
He said he didn't know what
he was supposed to do with it,

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.010
but obviously it was intended
for me and so he gave me

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.220
that copy of the book.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:44.230
I have to go by year to find it.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:49.140
So, I had this stack of papers

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.010
and again I wasn't entirely sure
what I wanted to do with it.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:57.030
But gradually I started thinking
more and more about cookbooks

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.690
as a mechanism for
telling a story.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.200
I still didn't realize
that they could be a tool

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.280
that would change social
history and improve the status

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.910
and the perception of an
entire group of people.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:14.560
I really was still just in
pursuit of my own story.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:21.080
So, another couple of
years go by and now Egerton

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.700
and I are talking
about other content

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:28.020
and I encounter a book
called the Bluegrass Cookbook

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.810
and it was published in 1904 by
a white woman named Minnie Fox

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:37.920
and her brother John C. Fox
was a writer for the Atlantic.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.160
And they published this book and
again as John Egerton had done,

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.040
they gave credit to these
African-American women

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.090
and they did that with images.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.610
So not only did they attribute
recipes to these people in a way

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:54.140
that was not a caricature
or a disparaging image

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.900
like that plantation era mammy

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:01.030
that I was seeing
throughout history all

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:05.140
of a sudden here was a group
of white people from Kentucky

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:10.400
who had the same kind of passion
that Egerton and I both had

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.500
for these historic women.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.270
And so, we approached the
University of Kentucky Press

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:23.290
and they agreed to republish
that book and facsimile

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.320
with a new introduction by me.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.530
And that brought me to my second
time and visit here at the --

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.900
that brought me to my
visit here, my first visit

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.580
to the Library of Congress
in the late 1990's.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.740
I came here and dug
into the archives

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.830
to explore African-American
writings to try to understand

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:47.180
who in their right mind the
turn-of-the-century would've

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.090
written a book with a
title by a colored woman,

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.510
it didn't make much sense to me.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:58.090
And so, I set out to understand
more about black cookbooks.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.050
And while I was here
I encountered several

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.060
of the rare books, rare
African-American books

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.310
that are here in the collection
and then I was hooked,

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.960
like I mean like as
they say mainline,

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.430
I don't know should I say that.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:17.740
I started telling people my
passion and people who traveled

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.910
around the country would
bring books back to me

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.350
when they were on vacation.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.590
They would bring back little $2
pamphlets that they encountered

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:32.030
in secondhand stores and
books just started sort

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.710
of coming to me.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:43.610
And I didn't really know how to
become a collector in earnest,

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:48.910
but the internet
changed my life.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:55.660
The University of Alabama has
I think what is the largest

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.070
collection of African-American
cookbooks,

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.640
the William Lupton collection.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.970
And this book, this collection
has some 450 books in it

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:11.970
and that number is comprised of
duplicates, multiple editions,

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.920
there are some in facsimile,
and there is a large number

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.550
of books there that are
community cookbooks right,

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:23.480
that I would never be able to
get in my local, in my area.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.560
And so, I used that
book as a shop,

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.100
that list as a shopping list
and I started entering titles

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:37.540
of books into the
browser at bookfinder.com

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.200
and I just would wait
every now and then

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.440
for something to pop up.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:48.550
One of the first books
that I was just determined

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:57.660
to have was a book from 1936,
it was called Eliza's Cookbook.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.360
It's the yellow one, I was
desperate to have this book

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.820
because it was -- it's
called Eliza's Cookbook,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.220
Favorite Recipes Compiled

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.020
by the Negro Culinary
Art Club of Los Angeles.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:20.780
So, I'm from Los Angeles and
there I started to have an idea

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.850
of who my grandmother
was in print on the page.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:27.160
She was a lovely woman
and she was talented

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.860
and she was intelligent
and she wasn't

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.800
at all this disparaging thing
that I had seen so often

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.140
on the pages of history and
I had to have this book.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.710
Now keep in mind, I was a
stay-at-home mother taking my

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.570
kids back and forth to swimming
and I was doing this in secret.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.790
My husband until I started this
tour had no idea how much I had

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.380
really been investing
in these books.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.900
And so, I entered the
title on an eBay auction,

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.800
the book popped up for $1.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.680
And I was exhilarated, but I
didn't know anything about eBay,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.570
so I went next-door to talk to
my neighbor who was a fanatic

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:06.640
about eBay and she taught
me all of the secrets.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.490
She taught me how to set
my clock to make sure

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:11.820
that the tick-tock timing

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.800
on my watch matched
their countdown clock.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.990
She told me not to enter the
title, not to enter my interest

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.280
or my bid because then others
would know there was a value

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.390
to this book that
had shown up for $1.

00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:28.630
And so, I waited until
the two-minute warning

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.390
that she gave me and then

00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:32.850
and I had been watching
the number sort of tick up

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:36.450
and it was somewhere you know
in the couple hundred dollars.

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:39.340
I thought I can live with that
I'll call my mom something

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.640
like that.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.610
And so, I typed in my bid
and then I closed my eyes

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:49.370
and pushed the button, you know
like he's going to kill me.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:55.170
So, I entered $400 and
then you wait and it seems

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.860
like you're waiting forever.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:01.260
But the note, the little
blinking notice came back

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.890
and said you've won
and I was so excited,

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:10.300
but I was also terrified
like I'm going to send $400

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.630
to a stranger that I don't
know and I have no way to know

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.950
if this book is authentic,
I don't know what condition,

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.570
you know I don't know anything.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.990
But I was determined
to have a book

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:24.460
that put my grandmother
in this category.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.540
I called the woman in
San Diego and apparently,

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.690
she had been cleaning out
her grandmother's attic

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.460
and found this book,
had no idea the value

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.960
and she was you know just
astounded at what she was

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.160
about to earn for this book.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.810
And so, my life went
on like that for years.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.150
I just kept entering
more and more titles

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.160
and every time something popped
up, it didn't matter they were

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.940
at that point not
very expensive,

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.380
so I was still paying very
small amounts for the books

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.190
and really no amount
of money mattered I had

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.560
to have these books.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.250
And the longer that I collected
them the more that they started

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.320
to organize themselves as
one of the essayists wrote

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.210
into a social history that I was
able to tell a whole new story

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:12.450
for the women who had cooked in
America's kitchens, who had been

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.890
so badly disparaged in
history and all of a sudden,

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:19.390
I had the ability to break
what I started calling the

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:20.860
Jemima Code.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:26.290
So, I went to publishers, I had
a literary agent, I had 25 years

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:29.220
in the food industry, so
I was pretty well known,

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.130
nobody would buy this book.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.160
I proposed it as a
beautiful coffee table book

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.150
that would have photographs
of all of the women inside.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:43.970
I wanted everyone to fall in
love with them just in the way

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.340
that I did and nobody cared.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.360
So, I found myself in
the same predicament

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.570
that my ancestors
had been in and many

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.650
of these books were
self-published.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:58.960
Some of them are pamphlets,
some of them were even published

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.550
by manufacturers who
were trying to get people

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.880
to buy more of their products.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.710
Some of them were books
published by universities

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:14.310
on behalf of the cook who had
been feeding the athletic team.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.860
There was a food editor who
worked for Ebony Magazine

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:26.040
and she was asked by Carnation
to produce a recipe collection

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:32.050
on their behalf using recipes,
Carnation recipes in the 1940's.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.350
And so, as I went along I just
kept collecting and trying

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:40.300
to convince a literary agent or
a publisher to buy this book.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.780
And in my frustration even
though I am a journalist I

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:49.000
decided to just take the
project to the internet,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.910
the place where I had really --
that had saved the collection,

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:55.890
I wanted to take the
books back there.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:01.100
And so, I started a blog
reluctantly and I was going

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.600
to tell the story of every one
of these authors and so I wrote

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.410
that this would be
a one-year project

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:07.940
and if people received
them the way

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.450
that I did then I'd
keep going with it.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:13.640
And I really just abandoned the
idea of publishing this book.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:20.100
And then the University of
Texas encountered the website

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.370
and they came to me and
said we want to publish

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.610
that book under one condition.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:29.520
And I said sure what
and they said we want it

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.120
to be a beautiful
coffee table book.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.300
I thought I was going to die.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.890
Really, this is what
they envisioned,

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:42.130
they wanted a book about books.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.370
They wanted, they understood
my passion and my desire

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.630
to really change
the representation,

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.360
to change the written history
of African-American women

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.070
who had worked in this country.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.530
And we knew that if we started

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.540
with recipes people
wouldn't get it yet,

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.220
people would think
all kinds of things.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.340
So, we knew that we
just had to validate

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.260
that the women even
existed first.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.160
And there are books in this
collection that are co-authored

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:14.060
by black-and-white women as
you can see here, this book is

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:19.470
from the 80's, Viola's
Favorite Recipes.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:24.310
There are books that have
incredible illustrations inside

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.610
of them.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.760
If you can see Ma Chance's book
on Caribbean French cooking.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.900
There are others like her

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.670
who give us very detailed
illustration of how

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:41.310
to chop a certain dish
or how this guy in 1970,

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:47.320
1972 this is a diet book
published for African-American,

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:54.750
for people in general and he
gives four weeks' worth of menus

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.200
and does things that
we think about already,

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.740
like telling you how much
is a serving size of pasta

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.140
for example on this page.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.250
And so, what this book started

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:06.660
to do was really
reveal an intelligence

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.550
that hadn't ever been associated

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:09.990
with African-American
cooks before.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:14.040
We had previously been either
acknowledged as great cooks

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.980
because we came by that
knowledge naturally

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.470
with some kind of
a natural instinct.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.450
Some authors in the 20's
even described as having sort

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:28.660
of a voodoo magic that we
cooked with, it's very insulting

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.940
and complimentary at
the same time right.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.530
Again, that's the messaging
of a code that it speaks

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.740
to us all very differently.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:40.300
And so, it became evident that
there was an intelligence here

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.010
and there was also a social arc.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.940
So, I've been able to divide
my content now by generations

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:51.740
of women and I've been able
to extract characteristics

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.840
and values that have not
been identified before.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:00.060
For example, in 1827 the
oldest book in the collection,

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.120
I won't go through them all,
but I do like to just wrap

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.240
up with the 19th
century authors.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:14.320
In 1827, Robert Roberts wrote
The House Servant's Directory.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:18.360
He was the butler in
the governor's mansion

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:23.580
in Massachusetts
and he writes a book

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.110
that is essentially
a training manual

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.190
for future generations
of workers.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:33.540
History would have portrayed
this book as just another way

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.330
to create more servants.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.360
It would have continued
to disparage the idea

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.160
that African-Americans
had any knowledge,

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.870
but this is a love letter.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:47.070
The way that he has written to
his charges about their work is

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:50.270
so profoundly intimate
and smart.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.170
He speaks to them about
punctuality and proper dress

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.670
and decorum on the job.

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:01.530
He even talks to them about
keeping your feet clean,

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.660
which I thought was
really interesting.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.660
I have a really great story
about collecting right.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:11.420
So, this book, this was a book
about women as the title implies

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.400
because there is a history
associated with men,

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.690
Thomas Jefferson had a black
chef that he had trained

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.930
in France as did George
Washington, so there are stories

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.210
about black men, but there are
no stories about black women.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:31.910
And so, I wasn't really
looking for Robert Roberts,

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.300
but I was in New York City
and I called a book dealer

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.580
and I said hey, I'm here do
you have anything you know

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.920
that maybe I don't have and she
said everybody knows you have

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.480
everything already.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.920
And I said well there's a couple
of first editions I'm looking

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.160
for and so she said
well okay what

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.350
and so I told her
I wanted this one

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:59.020
and she said call me
back in 10 minutes.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.360
So, I called her
back in 10 minutes

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.630
and she said can
you come over here

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:06.060
in the village they're
bringing you the book.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.900
Like what do you mean
they're bringing me the book

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:11.200
and so she said just come

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.730
over here they're
bringing you the book.

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:17.220
So, a disheveled guy who
was like obviously working

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.390
in this man's home
came in the store

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:25.670
with a crumpled grocery bag
in his hand and he handed it

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:30.460
to Bonnie and Bonnie handed
it to me and we opened it

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:34.730
and this book in first
edition from 1827 was inside

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.330
of that bag and I collapsed.

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:44.600
I had an immediate connection
to these people in a way

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.900
that I haven't been
able to explain

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.740
to any other audience right.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.430
Everyone else just
thinks oh yeah,

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.150
you did a great job,
you changed history.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.790
You know there's something
very unique and special

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:57.100
about the intimate relationship
between a collector who is

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.900
in pursuit of their passion
for whatever that reason,

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.200
whether it's a social history
that you want to change

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.470
or whether it's just for your
own incredible knowledge.

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:13.130
So, I will tell you about
two more, maybe three,

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.230
I have four minutes, I can
do it in three minutes.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:20.140
So, this one, this is my
first holding of this one

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:24.070
and I'm shivering up here if
you can't see it and I have been

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:28.370
for the last hour since
Mark gave it to me.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:33.210
This lovely little book is
from 1848 and was published

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:38.280
by this man Tunis Campbell
and among his accolades,

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:43.140
he's responsible for the drill
that you have experienced

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.480
at hotels and banquet service

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.260
when the waitstaff is all
located kind of around the room

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.420
and then they wait until
the exact right moment

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:56.720
and they march out and they
remove the cover of the dish.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:01.340
He's part of why we do that, it
was actually a military drill

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:03.540
that he incorporated
in his hotel service.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.110
And so, I use little
stories like that to try

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:09.800
to encourage the next generation
of young people that there are

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.040
so many incredible
opportunities in the food world

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.960
that don't have to do with
food service or cooking

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.850
or being a chef, that
there is lots of other ways

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.010
that we can uplift young people

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:27.390
from poverty using
the food industry.

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:31.150
This is a really wonderful
book, the only copy of this book

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:34.370
that we know of is
in the archives

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.150
at the University of Michigan.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.680
This is the first
known cookbook,

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.480
the other two were
hotel manager books,

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.920
but this is the first
recipe collection from 1866.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.820
And what is compelling
about this book

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:54.720
and what I tell young people
is that this was a free woman

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.840
of color who had to, she
had a handicapped child,

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:03.040
she had been robbed twice
and she was using food

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.630
as a tool for her own uplift.

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:14.000
She started a catering company,
she had a boarding house.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.480
And so, what I like to
tell people about her

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:23.250
and about the next women Abby
Fisher is that they were women

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:26.350
who were entrepreneurs
and we don't tend to think

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:29.180
of African-American women in
the kitchen as entrepreneurs,

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.530
but these are women
who used food

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.020
to achieve economic
independence right.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:41.050
Abby Fisher was a woman who had
been enslaved in North Carolina

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:44.920
and she and her husband
relocated to San Francisco

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.530
where she operated,
they operated a pickles

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.610
and preserves company.

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:54.210
And that she won multiple
awards for her pickles

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.090
and so the white women in her
community, both of these women,

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:58.680
they rallied around these women

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.530
and they helped them get
their books published.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:06.420
The first time I
actually saw this book was

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:11.480
at the Schlesinger Library and
I guess that's as good a place

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:14.270
as any to wrap up to say

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:22.650
that along the way I was using
my reporter skills to aggregate,

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:26.440
to understand, to
represent these people,

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:30.370
but I didn't quite
know about collecting.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:36.190
And I attended a seminar at
Radcliffe that taught me how

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:43.220
to read a cookbook without the
bias of race or gender and how

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:48.130
to look at the nuances of print
and paper and ink and choice

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.000
of color, and those
cute little squiggles

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.160
that I'm certain you guys know
exactly what the name of it is

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.500
that are on every page.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:02.700
And I learned a lot about
collecting from that session.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:06.400
So, I'll leave you
with where we started.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.280
Lena Richard remember
her, the book that I took

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.490
out of the collection?

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:17.150
It turns out, I guess I should
memorize the page these books

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.820
are on, it turns out that

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.600
that little paperback
had been reproduced three

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.550
or four different times by Lena.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:31.490
And the first time was 1939
and she published the book

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.540
by herself, it was a
self-published book,

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.980
she was an entrepreneur and
a restaurateur in New Orleans

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:41.850
and she had her own television
show before Julia Child did

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:43.740
in 1941.

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:51.760
So, Miss Lena published her
book in 1939 and James Beard,

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.830
the great father of American
cooking learned of her book

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:59.330
and he approached his
publisher and asked them

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:04.690
to reissue the book for
her, which they did in 1940.

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:07.060
And so, the book -- oh, that's
right it's not in 80's it's

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:12.540
in 30's, they did that for her,
only they changed the title.

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:19.030
So, the top book is the blue
book Lena Richard's book,

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:23.330
she calls it Lena Richard's
New Orleans Cookbook.

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:28.080
One year later the book
appears as New Orleans Cookbook

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.200
by Lena Richard and this
beautiful self-portrait

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.480
of her has been removed and
what appears on the backside

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:43.750
of this is the same mammy
disparaging image despite her

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.730
efforts to include a photograph
of herself in the view

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:48.160
that she thought she had.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.970
So, I just want to
wrap up and say

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:56.200
that as collectors you have an
incredible opportunity not just

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.770
for all of your own interests,

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:01.720
but to really make a
difference socially.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.510
So, thank you so
much for inviting me.

that was wonderful,

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:21.520
I had not heard her
speak about this before

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.020
and I think I could hard to
imagine a better introduction

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:29.450
to hearing other
stories from collectors.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:32.930
When we first met tonight I
said I wanted to introduce her

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:37.490
as a collector, she said oh no,
no I'm an accidental collector

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.910
and I just kind of
backed off a little bit,

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:44.150
not knowing I said okay you tell
us about your collecting career

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:46.900
in the way that you
would like to and she did

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.210
and she did a terrific job.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:50.510

round of applause.

we're going to have Micaela
Beigel come up first,

our third prize winner

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.110
and she is going to talk

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:15.520
for just a few minutes
about her collection.

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:21.120
It's one that was mentioned
earlier, Once We Were Dreamers,

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.750
a Collection of Jewish
Resistance During the Holocaust.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:28.590
Let's give her a hand
and we will hear from her

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:34.620
and then we will take a picture
with people from Goucher College

heard from our winner.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.020
Thank you.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.550
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:44.450
Hi, I'm Micaela, I'm a
sophomore at Goucher College,

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:45.750
which is about an
hour from here.

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.460
I didn't know I'd be speaking,
so I didn't prepare anything

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.290
so this is off-the-cuff,
but it's fine.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:58.180
So, I grew up in a Zionist
Jewish youth movement called

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.780
Habonim Dror, which is one

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:04.210
of the first Zionist youth
movements that emerged

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:06.880
after the Jewish
enlightenment in Europe

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.680
which is called the Haskalah and
it was the move from orthodoxy

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.080
to secularism that occurred.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.170
When Jews realized that
they didn't need to stay

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:21.690
in the shtetl and that they
could be something more

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:23.290
than that.

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:29.370
And famously Habonim Dror was
the movement that produced two

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:34.510
of the leaders of the
Warsaw ghetto uprising.

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:39.300
And two years ago, I went to
Poland with my youth movement

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:43.320
and we visited the site of
the Warsaw ghetto uprising,

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:46.760
one of the sites, the final
resting place so to say

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:53.250
and I felt very connected
with it.

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:58.800
So, all my life I felt like I'm
a Jewish person who's not very

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.040
observant but is very
connected spiritually

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.280
to Jewish history
and Jewish culture.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.330
And you know that distinction
was hard for me to accept

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.410
because you know when you go
to Jewish day school they sort

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:15.110
of tell you that the way into
Judaism is through the Torah

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.540
and didn't I feel
that and this was it

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.920
and more specifically
it was Jewish women.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:25.630
And Jewish women who were
artists and poets and thinkers

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:29.370
and who are more than
just Jewish women.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:33.270
And you know that's where the
collection really started,

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.770
it started with some really
important Jewish women

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:37.690
and their names are
Hannah Szenes

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:41.780
who is an Israeli paratrooper
and poet and Zivia Lubetkin

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:46.130
who was the leader of the Warsaw
ghetto uprising and so many more

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:51.340
who tell these amazing stories
about Jewish resistance,

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:55.200
which is the idea that there
will be life after this.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.140
And that is really what I wanted
to bring to the collection,

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.030
that there will be life for
Jewish people after this.

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.960
First of all, thank you, this
is a really awesome opportunity

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.300
and I never would've thought

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.760
that I would be here
for this so thanks.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.280
My collection is on Sacco and
Vanzetti and I got started

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.400
with this because -- well I
guess it really started for me

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.850
in high school because I saw a
picture of them in the corner

00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:02.120
of my history textbook and I
asked my teacher in Oklahoma

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.830
who are they and he said,

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:06.290
oh they're not really
important don't worry about it.

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:10.720
And so, I didn't look them up,
but I remembered their name

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:16.310
and then a couple years later
I was at Indiana University

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:19.700
in Bloomington and I took a
class at the Lilly Library

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.550
on working with modern literary
archives and I saw their name

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:25.680
in the finding aid so I
requested the material.

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:28.870
And I was reading through their
letters and I was like these are

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:31.680
so cool, I wonder if
they've been published.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.040
So, I found the 1928 edition
of the letters and said whoa,

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:39.070
these are not accurate at all.

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:41.340
And there were a
lot of omissions

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:46.060
and things were changed
and so I started trying

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:48.860
to learn everything
I could about them

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:53.830
and started buying
books about them.

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:57.320
So that's how that started
and then one book would lead

00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.140
to another book which
would lead to another book.

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:07.070
But the most recent thing I've
got was John Dos Passos Facing

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:10.360
the Chair, which is
about both of them

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:14.370
from a professor emeritus
at the University of Kansas

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:17.680
where I attend now
who had passed away.

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:23.800
The executor of his estate
was giving away his books

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.750
and he had an entire
garage full of books

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:32.200
and they were just trying to get
rid of them and so I asked her

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:38.290
if she had this book and she
said no, it's not in here.

00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:42.200
And then I got a phone call
two months later and she's

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.080
like oh here we have
it do you want it?

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.520
So, I met her at a coffee
shop and she gave it to me

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.090
and it was signed by the son

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:56.160
of the Sacco Vanzetti defense
committee to the professor.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.880
So, it's kind of exciting
how these things happen and I

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.350
like hearing other
people's stories

00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:03.680
so excited to hear what's next.

about our first prize winner
in the extraordinary collection

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:32.660
of an extraordinary individual
that's presented to us

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.320
in an essay that's
called the Collection

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:39.150
of Eugene Walter,
King of the Monkeys.

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:40.780
Luke Kelly is from
Harvard University.

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:43.870
The inspiration behind this
collection as we're told

00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:48.360
in the essay was walking down
the streets of Mobile, Alabama.

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:51.030
This is a Minnesota
boy it is Mobile right.

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:52.330
&gt;&gt; Luke Kelly: Mobile.

00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:53.720
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
Mobile, see there you go.

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:58.870
Alabama in 2015 where he
passed a sign that reads

00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:02.700
down in Mobile they're all
crazy with Eugene Walter

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.840
as the author of this phrase.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.560
It prompts young Mr. Kelly
to begin to investigate

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.630
who exactly this Eugene
Walter is and I have

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:17.850
to say it's a rather crazy
ride from that point on.

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:21.120
This is a very spirited essay
in a very spirited collection

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.500
in part because the untidy
pilgrim that we read about seems

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.030
to be one of those zeligs that
pops up in moments in history

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:31.810
and then disappears and
suddenly, is in the movie 8 1/2

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:33.250
and then suddenly
is in Hollywood

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.440
and suddenly is writing
southern cookbooks,

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.740
suddenly is in New Orleans,

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.580
suddenly is with
Peggy Guggenheim.

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:43.350

amazing variety of materials

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:45.390

person's life.

spot first to congratulate you.

impression from you of what it's

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.790
from that experience
while collecting.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.180
&gt;&gt; Luke Kelly: So, first of all,
thank you so much for being here

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:10.330
and thank you so much for the
prize, it really is wonderful.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:13.400
Eugene is not somebody that
I even knew about growing

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.760
up next-door to Mobile, Alabama
in Pascagoula, Mississippi,

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.870
I lived my whole life there
and I never heard about him.

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:23.020
But as I read his Untidy Pilgrim
it's kind of autobiographical

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:26.880
in some ways and collecting his
books, going through his poetry

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.560
and discovering more about
him and reading about people

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.310
who knew him and his life
there's many layers to it.

01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:35.100
And one thing that's constant
through all of them is he liked

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.500
to have a good time and have
a party wherever he was.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.470
And so, that's how he was
mainly known by people

01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:41.610
like Andy Warhol lived
down the hall from him

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:44.070
and he called him Baby
Andrew wand they staged

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:46.240
like the first happening
at NOMA.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.550
And one of the things
I discovered

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:50.730
about him along the way
is that sometimes he liked

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:55.020
to include jokes and little
hidden messages throughout his

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.610
work so he wrote under a
pseudonym called Sebastian

01:01:57.610 --> 01:02:00.040
Willoughby and so that
was a challenge in itself

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.790
because no one really had gone
through and done a collection

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:04.630
or looked and tried
to find every work

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:06.040
where that was included.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.170
And so, I went and I
tried to find every book

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:10.400
that was illustrated by some
random person named Sebastian

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.970
Willoughby and I would buy
the book and it would come

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:14.020
in the mail and it would
be him or it wouldn't be.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.700
And so, I came across
some really great finds

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.630
of his along the way.

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:19.930
And it's still growing,

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:21.230
I'm still discovering
different things,

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:22.820
but I thoroughly enjoyed it

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.670
and I really wish I could
have met him in person.

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:26.170
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: He
seems like a great mystery

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.520
and a great deal of fun

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.590
and I love the Andy Warhol
story I have to confess.

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:33.200
What do you think is the
most unusual object you have

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.780
in this collection or perhaps
one that was hardest to come by?

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:41.040
&gt;&gt; Luke Kelly: So, the hardest
to come by I didn't quite know

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.520
that I was going to come by it.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.710
Like I said about the Sebastian
Willoughby there was this book

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:49.150
of these German, it's really
arcane and I don't have --

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:51.050
I confess I don't have a
clue as to how the history

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:52.350
of these poems came to be.

01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:54.270
But there's this
translation of them

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:57.870
and Eugene did the
illustrations for them

01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:59.190
under the name Sebastian
Willoughby.

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:02.320
So, I ordered the book online,
it came in and next to one

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.720
of the characters
on the cover of it

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.190
to his foot is a little
EW, it's like I have it

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:10.680
and then I opened it up and
it's signed from Eugene Walter,

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.850
but he doesn't sign it
Eugene Walter he signs it

01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:14.170
Sebastian Willoughby.

01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:18.090
And it's to his roommate when
he lived in Rome, he lived right

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:20.240
above Cleopatra where her
kitchen would have been

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.010
and his name was William Weaver

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:27.520
and he translated Thomas
Wolfe's poetry into prose,

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.890
no he did excuse me, the
Rose, I'm blanking the title.

01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:34.190
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
The Tennessee Williams,

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:36.030
The Rose of Tennessee.

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:37.330
&gt;&gt; Luke Kelly: [Inaudible]
Echoes.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:38.630
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Echoes
[inaudible] the Rose.

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:39.930
&gt;&gt; Luke Kelly: And so, it was
just a great, I didn't buy it

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:43.260
because of the inscription,
I actually had no idea

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.660
that it was there,
but when it came

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.750
in it was just a
terrific discovering

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:49.910
and it's probably my favorite
item in the collection I think.

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:51.920
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: And so,
we'll close just if you could

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.170
to the audience because
I really do have

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:56.310
to confess it was a
cold read at the title

01:03:56.310 --> 01:04:02.820
and I thought oh we're going to
be reading about some chronicler

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.760
of apes and chimpanzees
and I'm sure it's a very

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.060
good collection.

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.470
Could you tell us what the king
of the monkeys actually means?

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:13.070
&gt;&gt; Luke Kelly: So, Eugene his
favorite animal was the monkey.

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.780
When he went to the
natural history museum

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:19.740
in York he encountered
this monkey that looked

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.120
like he was wearing a tuxedo

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.710
and he just thought it
was the funniest thing.

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:24.880
And so, he would go
all the way and say --

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.480
all the time and when
he was in Paris and say,

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.460
oh darling you're the
queen of the monkeys.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.150
And so, he was kind
of their king and kind

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:32.970
of just shepherded them
around and enjoyed life.

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:36.890
And so, it kind of embodies
his philosophy of life.

01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:39.920
Monkeys do what they want,
they're very kind of boastful

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.090
and arrogant, but like
to have a good time

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:45.710
and that's the way he thought,
he was larger-than-life

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:48.520
in many ways and it
was just a joy to be

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.360
around for everyone
that knew him.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.660
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Right.

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.960
Well thank you for a great read.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.000
Congratulations, John is going
to give your certificate.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.800
Let's give him a
round of applause.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:05.860
[ Applause ]

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.390
&gt;&gt; Luke Kelly: Mr.
Goodman please.

01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:08.690
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We're
going to move

01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:10.990
to the right spot [inaudible].

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.340
Let's get everybody in front.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.980
I'm going to be, well
I'll just be [inaudible].

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.430
Let's try -- just one more
I'm going to hide my papers

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:41.730
and I'm going to [inaudible].

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.850

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.200

it's been a wonderful
evening full of surprises

01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:59.120
and I think we have
accomplished our purpose

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.870
of hearing the stories
that come out of books,

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:05.260
the joys of book collecting and
I invite you to keep your eye

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:09.230
on this contest, on the program
and to join us next year.

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:12.090
I'd like to conclude by once
again thanking the people who've

01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:15.670
made it possible and mentioning
the Kislak Foundation,

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:17.220
which I forgot to
mention earlier.

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:20.150
Thank you and thank all of
you, please join us next-door

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:24.190

book collecting, thank you all
