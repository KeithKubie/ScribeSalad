And advance pay for performance system rewards providers who are able to

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.090
provide higher quality care, at a lower cost. There's evidence that

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.520
these programs can work. Here are the results of the physician group practice or

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.410
PGP demo. A well known medicare pilot, conducted in ten medical practices.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.900
All of the groups achieved improvements in 25 of 27 quality metrics, for

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.520
the key diseases shown here. And you, you see the percentage of improvement,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.910
as well. Four practices earned a bonus, for outstanding performance.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.250
Marshfield Clinic earned half of the total bonus. And in explaining how

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.780
they did it, their CEO cited a well developed electronic health record. And

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.730
went on to describe how it reduced unnecessary duplication of services by making

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.200
information available, to all providers caring for each patient.
