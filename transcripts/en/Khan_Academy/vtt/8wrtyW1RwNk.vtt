00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:02.335
- [Instructor] Let's
see if we can calculate

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.085
the fifth root of 32.

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.412
So, like always, pause the
video and see if you can

00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:12.690
figure this out on your own.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.316
So, let's just remind
ourselves what a fifth root is.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:20.066
So, if x is equal to the fifth root of 32,

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.551
that's the same thing as saying

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:25.551
x to the fifth power is equal to 32.

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:29.242
So, we have to find some number where,

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:31.445
if you take five of them
and multiply them together,

00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:33.198
you'd get 32.

00:00:33.198 --> 00:00:35.400
So, there is a couple of
ways to approach this.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.749
Especially when you're dealing with these

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:39.358
really high order roots here.

00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:43.108
So, let me rewrite the
fifth root of 32 here.

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:47.805
One way is you could try to factor 32

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:51.761
and see are there factors
that show up five times?

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:54.655
So, 32 you might immediately
recognize is an even number.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:56.857
So, it's gonna be divisible by two.

00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:58.572
It's two times 16.

00:00:58.572 --> 00:01:00.405
16 is two times eight.

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:03.793
Eight is two times four.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.300
Four is two times two.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.174
So, in this case, doing the

00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:10.881
factoring technique worked out well.

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:12.310
'Cause we see that this is

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.654
two times two times
two times two times two

00:01:14.654 --> 00:01:16.764
or two to the fifth power.

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:19.257
You could rewrite this as the fifth root

00:01:19.257 --> 00:01:21.180
of two to the fifth power,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.198
which is, of course,
going to be equal to two.

00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:26.615
Two to the fifth power is 32.

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:31.254
Now, let's do another one.

00:01:31.254 --> 00:01:34.763
It's gonna be a little bit harder.

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:38.596
Let's say we wanna take
the fifth root of 243.

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:43.747
So, now, a much, much larger number.

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:45.261
So, there's a couple of ways to do this.

00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:47.262
One, you could try the factoring.

00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:48.363
Although, that's gonna be harder

00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:49.546
now that it's a larger number.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:52.034
Or you could do a little
bit of trial and error.

00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:54.969
Doing higher roots without the aid

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.438
of some type of calculator or something

00:01:56.438 --> 00:01:59.536
is a little bit more complicated.

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.921
So, here, if we wanted to
do the factoring technique.

00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:06.306
We could say, alright,
it's not divisible by two.

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:08.557
I like to start with the
smallest possible factor.

00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:10.429
So, it's not divisible by two.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.466
Is it divisible by three?

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.178
And you might be familiar with the test

00:02:14.178 --> 00:02:16.378
to see if something is divisible by three.

00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:18.253
You add up the digits and see if that

00:02:18.253 --> 00:02:20.822
sum of the digits is divisible by three.

00:02:20.822 --> 00:02:25.300
So, if I were to take
two plus four plus three,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.892
that is equal to nine.

00:02:26.892 --> 00:02:29.504
And so it is divisible by three.

00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:32.478
So, this is going to be
equal to three times...

00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:36.434
Let's see three goes into
240 80 times and then one.

00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:37.517
So, 81 times.

00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:42.392
And so, 81 is also divisible by three.

00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:45.123
I have a sense of where this is going now.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:49.810
It's three times 27,
which is three times nine.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.053
Which is three times three.

00:02:52.053 --> 00:02:53.403
So, using the factoring method,

00:02:53.403 --> 00:02:56.832
we're able to see that three
to the fifth power is 243.

00:02:56.832 --> 00:03:00.499
So, the fifth root of
243 is equal to three.

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:04.335
Now, another way that
you could have done it

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:06.213
is a little bit of trial and error.

00:03:06.213 --> 00:03:08.288
We already know..

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.432
Well, we know that one to the fifth power

00:03:09.432 --> 00:03:10.938
is just going to be one.

00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:12.364
We know that two to the fifth power...

00:03:12.364 --> 00:03:13.382
We just calculated that.

00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:14.215
That's 32.

00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:17.254
Well, we now know what
three to the fifth is.

00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:18.191
Let's say we're just trying to

00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:20.068
zoom in on it a little bit.

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:21.252
So, let's say, if you wanted to see

00:03:21.252 --> 00:03:23.496
what four to the fifth is.

00:03:23.496 --> 00:03:26.147
Well, that would be four times four

00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:28.583
times four times four times four.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:32.381
So, let's see, this is going to be 16.

00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:34.048
16 times four is 64.

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.529
Times four is 256.

00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:42.585
And then, that times four...

00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:44.178
And I just happen to know this.

00:03:44.178 --> 00:03:46.460
But you might wanna do it by hand.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.543
This is 1024.

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.682
So, if you're taking the cube root of 243,

00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:55.682
you're saying what to the fifth power...

00:03:55.682 --> 00:03:58.983
Something to the fifth
power is equal to 243.

00:03:58.983 --> 00:03:59.881
And, if you have a sense that

00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:02.043
it's going to be an integer solution,

00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:02.900
if you think it's going to be

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.979
something like a two or a three,

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.281
well, then, three is probably
going to be a good guess here.

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.400
If the possible answers
are gonna be decimals,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.722
then it's going to be
a lot more complicated.

00:04:12.722 --> 00:04:13.621
But that's another way.

00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:15.007
Say, hey, maybe I'll try a three.

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.757
And, if you try out
three, you would get 243.
