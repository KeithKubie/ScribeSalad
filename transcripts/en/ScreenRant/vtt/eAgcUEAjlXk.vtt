00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.019
In order to fully get in to character, and
sometimes to work up some nerve, performers

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.870
will occasionally make decisions at work that
the rest of us would get fired for even thinking

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.870
about.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.410
Drinking, drugs, having an annoying voice
— in cubicle life, that’s a recipe for

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.410
disaster.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.199
But living life on the big screen can be daunting,
and sometimes it’s not as glamorous as it

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.199
looks.

And stick around, because we saved the best
entry for last.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:40.550
These are 10 Popular Actors Who Made Shocking
Decisions For Their Movies.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.220
Jennifer Lawrence, Passengers
We can’t blame Jennifer Lawrence for being

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.789
apprehensive to do a sex scene with a married
man— even if that man is Chris Pratt and

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.360
the sex is 100% fake.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.200
Plus, Pratt’s wife Anna Faris is in the
biz too, so she gets it.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.000
We can’t think of three more down-to-earth
people.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.460
Nevertheless, Lawrence was still a bundle
of nerves at the thought of being a potential

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.150
homewrecker that she got a little boozed-up
before shooting the scene.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.150
It worked.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.150
Nobody got divorced.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.580
And the sky hasn’t caved in.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.110
At least, not yet anyway.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.750
Daniel Radcliffe, The Harry Potter Franchise
Let’s go all the way back to 2001.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.540
A time when Daniel Radcliffe was young, innocent,
and hadn’t yet appeared naked in front of

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.410
hundreds of London theatergoers.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.530
Maturing in the spotlight ain’t easy.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.380
And while kids used to have the luxury of
growing up and making mistakes in front of

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.490
a relatively small number of people, Radcliffe
did not.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.470
The actor started to do what all teenagers
do and discovered the joys of partying.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.110
And when his habit got out of hand, it resulted
in him sometimes coming in to work still tipsy

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.290
from the night before.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.399
Radcliffe has since spoken publicly about
his struggle and successful journey to recovery.

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.500
Anna Kendrick and Olivia Wilde, Drinking Buddies
Some actors are really good at feigning drunkenness,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.770
and others?

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.770
Not so much.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.939
But then there’s a third category of people—
those who don’t see the point in pretending.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.890
While filming Drinking Buddies, Anna Kendrick
and Olivia Wilde lived in that third category.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.990
Every beer on screen is real, and so is the
consumption.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.090
Writer and director Joe Swanberg set the movie
in a brewery, and figured it would be downright

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.340
wrong to let that much beer go to waste.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.169
While they weren’t the only cast members
to crush brewskis on set, they arguably had

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:15.880
the most fun.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.630
Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, Fight Club
Filming a movie involves long hours, hard

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.320
work, and lots of manpower.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.850
Every production needs the opportunity to
blow off steam.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.980
But one night while everyone was relaxing,
Fight Club director David Fincher kept the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.250
camera rolling.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.630
Fans of the movie will recognize a scene where
Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are hitting a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.740
couple of golf balls into the distance.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.450
But what’s interesting is this part of the
movie was never in the screenplay.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.630
It was filmed by the director as the two actors
were blowing off steam and having some drinks

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.699
to end the day.

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:50.190
They were drunk for real, and repeating the
lines Fincher was whispering to them off camera.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.870
Kevin Spacey, American Beauty
American Beauty is a movie about figuring

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.100
out who you want to be.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.010
It follows the stories of one family, and
explores how our connections to each other

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.370
can dissolve slowly.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.470
Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a man at a crossroads.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.750
And while his performance is powerful, it
didn’t start out that way.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.510
Director Sam Mendes said in an interview that
the key ingredient in getting Spacey to embody

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.540
Lester was to get him a little high.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.310
The director says that such a methodical and
calculated approach toward the character just

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.420
didn’t work.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.630
And since Spacey is a details man, the only
way to bridge the gap was with a joint.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.220
The joint he and Wes Bentley share is a real
one, and since it slowed Spacey’s brain

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.870
down, Mendes argues the movie is better because
of it.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.850
Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, Star Wars
The seventies were a time where you could

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.820
throw a party and all different kinds of people
would show up.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.720
The stars partied hard.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.699
And when Carrie Fisher was shooting Star Wars,
so did she.

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.340
The actress has talked about doing a full
day of shooting only to turn around and party

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.340
the night away.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.290
On one fateful evening she found herself at
the same party as The Rolling Stones.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.220
As she told it, Fisher called co-star Harrison
Ford to get his ass to the party, so he did.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.900
The two actors spent the night drinking and
stumbled into work the next day.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.100
They hadn’t gotten any sleep the night before
so they were not in an ideal state.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.130
But somehow, they did it.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.440
Jesse Eisenberg, Batman v. Superman: Dawn
of Justice

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.870
Regardless of how you feel about the finished
product, you can’t deny that Batman v. Superman:

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.519
Dawn of Justice is a full-blown media sensation.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.620
The movie incited some of the most intense
nerdy bickering the world has ever seen.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.930
And if you look at them closely, some of the
complaints actually have nothing to do with

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.930
the movie.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.530
While audiences have been divided about almost
every element, there does seem to be a consensus

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.430
when it comes to Jesse Eisenberg’s portrayal
of Lex Luthor.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.550
On the conservative side, fans could say the
performance was… a surprise.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.840
But more vocal opponents have called it “over
the top” and “shrill”.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.600
In a movie like BvS, obviously Luthor isn’t
the one to cheer for.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.440
So in that way, maybe he’s perfect.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.130
Christian Bale, The Machinist
Christian Bale is a devoted guy.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.650
When he signs on to a movie, the filmmakers
know he’s going to be all in.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.610
And for his role in The Machinist, the actor
wanted to drop a couple of LB’s.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.740
As it turns out, modifying his diet to only
include canned tuna and apples resulted in

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.120
him losing more than a few inches off his
waistline.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.830
Bale wanted to get himself down to a hundred
pounds, but since that could have killed him,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.130
the producers were having none of it and stopped
him before it got to that point.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.340
The actor’s next role after The Machinist
was in Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.220
He had to beef up quite a bit.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.410
And even though we know better, we like to
imagine he did it by adhering to a strict

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.250
diet of donuts and milkshakes.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.250
Mmmm.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.250
Donuts.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.480
Charlize Theron, Monster
Charlize Theron has had a long Hollywood career

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.210
full of interesting roles.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.710
The talented actress also happens to be one
of the most beautiful humans on earth.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.280
So imagine everyone’s surprise when she
gained 30 pounds, bleached her eyebrows, and

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.220
fried her hair to play serial killer Aileen
Wuornos in 2003’s Monster.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.100
Thereon is unrecognizable in the movie, and
gave a performance that earned her both the

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.230
Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actress in
a Lead Role in 2004.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.590
Director Patty Jenkins has said that she needed
someone who wasn’t afraid to get gritty

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.590
and emotional.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.030
And Theron definitely delivered.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.350
Margot Robbie, The Wolf of Wall Street
Margot Robbie is everywhere these days, but

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.340
it wasn’t so long ago that the actress was
a total unknown.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.870
Hoping to be cast in the next Scorsese flick,
her agents told her not to get too excited,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.590
saying she probably wouldn’t get the part.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.920
Very supportive, guys.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.250
Robbie knew that if she was awarded the part
there was a chance she’d have to appear

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.250
nude.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.740
But because her agents were so doubtful, she
wasn’t too worried.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.270
But then she got the call that changed everything.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.200
When it came time to disrobe, the actress
pounded a few shots of tequila to ease her

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200
anxiety.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.890
The director offered to change the scene to
something less revealing.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.760
But, ever the trooper, Robbie insisted on
playing it how it was written.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.550
Thanks for watching our video.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.550
