SPEAKER 1: Hi everyone.

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.230
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.110
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.310
Ah, OK.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.080
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.520
Hispanic Heritage
Month [SPANISH].

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.840
You guys are our kick-off act.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.590
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.470
Without further ado, [SPANISH].

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.330
Kick it off.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.214
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.319
SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.610
FHER OLVERA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.180
ALEX GONZALEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.550
SPEAKER 2: So I'm going to
ask questions in English.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.480
And then we can
translate if needed.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.690
ALEX GONZALEZ: OK, cool.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.120
SPEAKER 2: You guys are between
two shows in the Bay Area

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.750
now for your Latino Power tour.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.390
Can you talk about
how you came up

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.660
with the concept for
this tour, and what

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.320
Latino Power means to you?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.070
ALEX GONZALEZ: Me?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.320
Well, first of all, we're
just so excited to be on tour.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.400
We love playing.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.004
We've been doing this
for almost 30 years.

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:30.170
I know it's hard to believe.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.500
But yeah.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.030
It's been an amazing
ride, this band Mana.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.060
We came for the first time
in 1983 to the United States

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.690
to play.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.480
Just because we
thought it was logical

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.159
that there's a huge
Latino community,

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.200
and there would be people
interested in listening

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.930
to our music.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.850
And thank god,
things really took

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.110
off, and from playing
small clubs now

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.450
to playing huge arenas
throughout the United States.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.690
So when we kicked off this tour,
it started actually last year.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.700
And it was called
"Cama Incendiada,"

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.950
which is our last
record that we released.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.690
So we're promoting this record
throughout the United States,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.815
Mexico, [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.380
And then when we were
going to come back again

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.130
for the second leg--
you know, right now

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.430
the elections are just
right around the corner.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.090
And so Fernando came up
with the concept and says,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.779
you know what?

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:22.320
When we go back to
the United States,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.890
we should do a tour that has,
first of all, that we should

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.850
celebrate the Latino community.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.670
Because the Latino
community has given so much

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.520
to the economy of
the United States.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.500
And we have people in politics.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.210
And we have people in
Google doing amazing things.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.470
And we have people in sports
and arts, et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.730
So we said on one hand, let's
celebrate the Latino community.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.060
But on the other hand,
it's very important

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.000
that we tell the Latino
community to go out and vote.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.090
And get registered.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.190
Because your vote can
make a difference.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.599
It doesn't matter what party.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.640
But you can decide who's
going to be representing

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.940
your district, or who's
going to be representing

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.640
your county, or your
state in Washington,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.090
or even pick the president
of the United States.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.750
So it's so important
to go out and vote.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.690
Register.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.560
And we're doing
that specifically

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.100
for the Latino community.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.661
Their voice is very powerful
here in the United States.

00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:19.660
FHER OLVERA: Well, yeah.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.050
The thing is we are a little
bit living in a history moment.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.916
The Latin community has
more than [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.310
They were slaves 150 years ago.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.160
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.840
Show me your papers.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.680
No?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.510
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:54.010
SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:01.330
FHER OLVERA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
I got to talk about that,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.430
you know?

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.345
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.680
Just a few hours to
go and vote so you

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.320
can get many years of bonanza
or good things, you know?

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.190
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.472
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.670
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.444
SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.300
On your recent album, on the
one that you're touring now,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.940
I really liked the
song that you guys

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.100
perform of [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.770
FHER OLVERA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.060
SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:29.350
FHER OLVERA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.800
SPEAKER 2: Can you speak
to those issues now?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.020
The way Mexico lost
this ground historically

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:50.950
and then perhaps is now
either regaining it or not?

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.212
ALEX GONZALEZ: Well, what we've
said is that borders exist.

00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:55.170
What can you do, right?

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.503
We don't have control over that.

00:07:56.503 --> 00:07:58.720
But I think the great thing
about the United States

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.220
is that it's such
an amazing melting

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.720
pot of different cultures
and people coming

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.917
from all over the world.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.500
And you look at a
company like Google.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.291
You see so many people
from different parts

00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:11.020
of the world working here,
everybody brainstorming

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.172
and bringing amazing
ideas to the table.

00:08:13.172 --> 00:08:14.880
And what Fher has said
is very important.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.510
More than ever,
this country needs

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.670
unity and to not be divided.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.260
So with this song in
particular-- and what

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.060
we've been doing as
a band is that we've

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.970
been pushing for an immigration
reform for many, many years.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:27.910
FHER OLVERA: 20 years.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.659
ALEX GONZALEZ: And you
know, before, there

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:32.190
used to be like a
working program visa

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.309
that you can come to the
United States and work.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.970
And it was a lot more easier
in the '60s and those days.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.179
Because a lot of people
like to come and work here.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.220
But they missed their
culture in another country.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.570
So there has to be a way
that this can work out.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.880
We've talked about also people
that have come into the country

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.380
illegally.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:49.880
Well, yeah.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.900
They did break a law.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.441
You cannot enter a
country illegally.

00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:54.190
But I would say
99% of the people

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.050
that come in here to the
United States are working.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.160
And they're contributing
to the economy.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.390
So what we've said is that
definitely there needs

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.260
to be an immigration reform.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.339
They should get in line.

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:07.880
They should pay a fine-- or if
they're working for a company,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.920
that company should pay a fine.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.100
Because at least their
employees are working for them.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.140
But that way, these
people are registered.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.269
They pay a fine.

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:17.060
They get into line.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.590
And they become
American citizens.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.090
And you know, it's also a
national security issue.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.690
We need to know who
these people are.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:31.920
But you know, like Fher said,
there's all this commotion,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.530
like all these people that are
here illegally are bad people.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.184
You know?

00:09:35.184 --> 00:09:37.350
And like I say, the majority
of people that are here

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.766
are working--
hard-working people,

00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:41.960
having two or three jobs,
supporting a family--

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.960
two families.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.950
You know?

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.666
So that's a little
bit the way we

00:09:45.666 --> 00:09:47.290
feel about the whole
immigration thing.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.980
FHER OLVERA: And we hear
so many sad histories.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.300
When you go to a restaurant, for
example, and the Latin guys--

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.760
the head chef or
the waiters-- came.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.620
And you say, where are you from?

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.150
Oh, I'm from
Zacatecas or Jalisco

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.028
or, I don't know,
Colombia or Guatemala.

00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:06.550
And do you have kids?

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.681
Yeah.

00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:08.180
How many?

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:08.880
Three.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.870
Where they at?

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.560
They are in Guatemala.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.010
So you didn't see often?

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:13.670
No.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.990
No in 10 years.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.620
So can you believe that story?

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.420
It's something where
we travel as a band,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.230
and we leave our kids just
for three weeks or four weeks,

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.080
your heart [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.580
You know?

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.750
Sad.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.250
Can you imagine all
those histories?

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.750
So what we were saying--
Alex and me and the band--

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.050
why not do a reform like they
used to do in the last century,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.550
in the '40s?

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.880
ALEX GONZALEZ: Yeah.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.210
FHER OLVERA: The people came
here, worked for several months

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.320
or whatever.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.390
And go back.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:55.470
And as a Mexican citizen,
just temporary jobs.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.710
So there are a lot
of things that people

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.620
can do in the reform, no?

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.680
I think it's going to be
perfect for the United States

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.280
to do that.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.700
I don't know.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.070
It's taking too long.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.230
It's taking a lot
of sad hearts, a lot

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.100
of tears in many,
many Latin cases,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.830
and many histories-- many.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:16.800
Millions.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.210
So what we're trying to tell
these guys who got the papers,

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.690
American papers--
choose the right people.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.630
You know?

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:30.280
Now, another reflection that
I was talking with someone

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.590
in Google-- the moment
that you guys are doing,

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.800
and the moment that
we are leaving,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.890
is also a break in the history.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:48.320
500 years ago, in the century--
in the 1500s, in the year 15--

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.770
I think 40.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.020
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.520
Remember?

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.210
The print?

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.780
It was the last technology.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.560
So people started to get
books and read books.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.080
Before that, it was so expensive
to buy a book and write hand,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.350
because it would take so long.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.850
So only the rich people,
the privileged people,

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.490
can have all this information.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:23.710
And when the print came in
those days, the world changed.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.590
In everyting-- in science, in
medicine, in art-- everything.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.170
After that, everything
goes well-- television

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.760
and other things.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.870
But then comes the Internet.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.740
It was another break
in the history.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:48.760
Because all people can get
the information fast, free,

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.550
most of the times, and
all over the world.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:58.370
And they can work also
for change-- governments,

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.450
if the people want.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.740
It's a tool.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.317
It's a tool.

00:13:02.317 --> 00:13:03.650
Sometimes it's a dangerous tool.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.090
But it's a tool, a great tool.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.410
So what are you doing?

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:13.129
You are changing this part
of the history of this era

00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:13.920
that we are living.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.070

FHER OLVERA: Yeah.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.520
It's scary.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:35.910
ALEX GONZALEZ: Yeah,
we've got like--

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.480
FHER OLVERA: There
isn't Facetime.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:37.560
ALEX GONZALEZ: I don't know.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.210
It's insane.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.690
SPEAKER 5: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.970
FHER OLVERA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:56.164 --> 00:13:58.200
SPEAKER 5: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:14:18.047 --> 00:14:18.880
ALEX GONZALEZ: Yeah.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.090
It's really interesting.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.000
Because we were
talking about how

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.780
in the '50s, the '60s and
'70s-- even early '80s--

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:32.590
to be a Latino, you would see
people that are almost ashamed.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.387
They would talk in English.

00:14:34.387 --> 00:14:35.970
And you would say
something in Spanish

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.720
and they wouldn't
answer you in Spanish.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.289
It's like, it's great to
be an American citizen.

00:14:40.289 --> 00:14:42.580
But it's so important also
to know where you come from.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.840
It's so beautiful, you know?

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.660
Your heritage-- you know,
what part of the world you

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.200
come from.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.682
So to be a Latino, or to be
from any part of the world,

00:14:49.682 --> 00:14:51.140
you have to be
proud of your roots.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.850
Be of course proud to
be an American citizen.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.190
But you have to also
celebrate your roots.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.440
That's such a beautiful thing.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.481
I don't know why some
people freak out with that.

00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:02.060
But it's great to
see, like we say,

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.460
the Latino community
in this case I

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.639
think throughout the years
has become more unified.

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:09.930
And that's important, you know?

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.810
Speak our voice and
also get the things

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.480
that we need as a community,
and work hard together.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.480
And you know, I
think we'll continue

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.030
to grow and do positive things.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.238
SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:23.446 --> 00:15:26.840
I think this story
of being afraid--

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.410
of on the one hand losing your
identity with immigration,

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.140
or on the other hand of losing
your identity as an immigrant.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.990
This is not new
in the US, either.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.620
I just heard a
story the other day

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.170
that apparently the
prohibition partly came

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:47.360
about because the Germans
and their beer gardens

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.840
and the Irish and
their saloons were

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.740
public display of culture that
was unacceptable at the time.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.297
And that sort of caused
the whole prohibition.

00:15:58.297 --> 00:15:59.130
ALEX GONZALEZ: Yeah.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:15:59.629
Alcohol.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.360
SPEAKER 2: You know, kids,
families all together

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:04.980
in the saloon?

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.400
You know, it's unacceptable.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.870
And it seems like
the taco trucks now

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.470
are like the echo of that.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:20.900
But do you see a tension
between identity on the one hand

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.070
and preserving some
kind of authenticity

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.350
and having a more
plural culture?

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.180
Do you think those two
things are opposed?

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.013
Or they can coexist?

00:16:29.013 --> 00:16:29.840
Or what?

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.600
ALEX GONZALEZ: I mean, we've
seen both sides of the coin,

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.610
you know?

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.400
I think there's people
that provoke that tension.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.660
And there's people
that celebrate culture.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.310
So like I say, it's
kind of ridiculous

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.260
that in the 21st century we
have all this technology,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.220
but on the other
hand, as human beings

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.910
we're still lacking
in so many things.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.510
And I'm not generalizing.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.420
But there are people
that are still racist.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.110
There's people that
don't want other people

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.510
to come to this country.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.820
You know, that does exist.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.320
You know?

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.410
And that's the scary
thing-- why they don't want

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.869
to embrace different cultures.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.599
But I think that the
majority of people

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.869
have a positive attitude.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:13.829
The majority of
people want unity.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:16.470
And the majority of people
want to work together

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:20.550
to construct this country,
to build it, make it better.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.510
But it all depends on
people coming together.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.790
And I mean, as a band,
this is a good example.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.690
We've been together
for 30 years.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.430
And we have our differences.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.050
But at the same time,
we're very together.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.090
And we work out things.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.990
And we sit down and
we have communication.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.907
And if one guy wants to
do one thing musically

00:17:35.907 --> 00:17:37.739
and the other guy wants
to do another thing,

00:17:37.739 --> 00:17:39.200
we try to find common ground.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.710
But we work together as a unit.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.500
And we have a mission
and we have a target.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.120
I think people need
to once in awhile just

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.220
settle down and be a
little bit more neutral.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.510
Yeah.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.310
Coexist.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.100

ALEX GONZALEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:21:19.286 --> 00:21:21.590
You got that?

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.930
Can I say that in English?

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.600
OK.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.124
What I was saying is that
it's really important

00:21:26.124 --> 00:21:28.290
having Google that you can
search anything you want.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:32.600
And now with the elections,
we're telling the voters, go.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.790
Search.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.760
Educate yourself.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.360
Find out.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.250
And even though it's a tool, it
can be also a dangerous tool.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.720
Because sometimes people write
things that are not true.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.310
So the more you investigate,
the more you know.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.310
Knowledge is everything.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.660
Knowledge is power.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.500
And so we're telling
people to really,

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.060
really be hands on
and investigate.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.460
And then you decide
for yourself.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.470
But you know, it's just amazing.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.770
Yesterday I was with my
daughters and my wife.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.360
And we went to take a
really nice trip on the Bay.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.380
We went to the
Golden Gate Bridge.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.460
And we saw it on top and we
saw it underneath and stuff.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.009
And one of my daughters asked
me, hey, when was it built,

00:22:08.009 --> 00:22:08.550
and all this.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:09.300
And you know what?

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.973
I told her, go to our
friend Google and search it.

one of the things that Google

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.300
can do is go out to
the streets, you know?

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.180
And see for yourselves.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:32.920

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.460
And ask questions.

good to be curious

00:23:36.205 --> 00:23:37.080
and to ask questions.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.660

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:44.690
Because everybody has their own
issues and their own problems,

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.330
and also their positive things.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:51.270
But it's so important to go
out there and investigate.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.270
And when you're hands on like
that, you know what people want

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:58.679
or what people need or
what their thoughts are.

00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:00.220
And then I think
that will definitely

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.030
help you guys to
build better platforms

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.720
or to build better
communications.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.470
You know?

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.810
There's just so much
that needs to be done.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.991
But I think everything has
to start with one's self.

00:24:14.991 --> 00:24:15.490
You know?

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.290
You can be a better
person if you want.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.680
You can take care of the
environment if you want.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.980
But it all depends on yourself.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.450
You start first, and then
obviously with the community.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.530
So I think that would be
an interesting thing--

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.610
to go out and just
ask questions.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.770
And go all over the area.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:37.710
And see what ticks people
off or what they like

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.032
or what they would
like to see changed.

00:24:40.032 --> 00:24:41.490
SPEAKER 2: So I'm
hearing more user

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.615
research, more ethnography.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.750
