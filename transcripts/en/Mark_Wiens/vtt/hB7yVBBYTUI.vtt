00:00:01.054 --> 00:00:04.971
(metal spatulas striking pans)

00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:16.170
(pans sizzling)

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.810
- This sound is quite a music to our ears.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.770
- We just stepped out of
the car, you can hear,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.570
There's like, literally,
from this street corner,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.540
an entire like cloud of
smoke rising into the air.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.090
You can her the clanking
of the metal spatulas.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.000
We are here to eat taka tak.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.193
And this what an atmosphere,
what an environment.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.083
Oh man, this is just smoke therapy.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.563
- The sound is music
to our ears literally.

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:52.818
(car horn)

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:55.068
- And the smoke is
aromatherapy to our noses.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.113
This is amazing.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.010
You would definitely think
there is a fire happening

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.310
in the neighborhood from
this amount of smoke.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.890
Look at that.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.807
(metal spatulas striking pans)

00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:22.665
- Oh man.

00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:27.050
- I don't even know if you can hear me,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.150
but this is unbelievable.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.370
The steam, the smoke is
just pouring out of that...

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.170
Oh wow, smoke in the eyes, some chillis.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.480
But the clanking, I can barely...

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.410
yeah, this is absolutely incredible.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.686
They are mashing up the spices,
they're mashing up the...

00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:47.763
Whoa, it feels like I am in a volcano.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.113
- Mark, are you crying from happiness?

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.980
Are these tears of happiness?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.085
- Tears of happiness
and chillis to the eyes

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.196
- Tears of happiness, exactly.

00:02:01.196 --> 00:02:03.270
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.187
(metal spatulas striking pans)

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.560
- That is for sure the most
musical food, and the loudest,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.927
and the steamiest, some of the
most amazing food environment

00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:22.642
I have ever seen, and
what you have to do is,

00:03:22.642 --> 00:03:23.550
you have to choose our organs.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.722
Self service organs.

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:28.088
- Not our organs, those organs.

00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:30.118
(laughter)

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:32.290
- Okay, yes, you're right about that.

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:37.360
You just grab it with your fingers?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.700
- [Guide] Yeah, whatever you want.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.973
- [Mark] So, you got some
kidneys, you got some testicles.

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:46.383
This one looks enticing.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.513
- [Guide] We also have brain here.

00:03:48.513 --> 00:03:50.030
- [Mark] Brain testicles.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.804
These are kidneys right.

00:03:51.804 --> 00:03:52.637
- [Guide] Yes.

00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:53.483
- [Mark] How many kidneys?

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.460
One more testicle.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.295
- [Guide] Let's make a pair.

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:06.340
(laughter)

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.630
- [Mark] Lets make a pair.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.077
Then we got some brains here.

00:04:09.077 --> 00:04:10.327
- [Guide] Yeah.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.670
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.880
Okay, we got brains,
kidneys, and testicles.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.750
I love how you just grab your organs

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.250
and then stick it into a bowl.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.793
(laughs) This is amazing.

00:04:29.422 --> 00:04:32.422
(upbeat rock music)

00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:42.528
So, we chose our organs,
you bring it to one

00:04:42.528 --> 00:04:45.400
of the stations, one of
the clanking stations.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.990
Wow, my ears are starting to ring.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.883
There he is about to make our order.

00:05:15.235 --> 00:05:17.652
(pan hisses)

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:53.015
(upbeat rock music)

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.510
Woo, this is without
a doubt of of the most

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.390
intense restaurants, intense
cooking, intense dishes,

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.290
I have ever seen anywhere in the world.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.450
The production here is just mind blowing.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.650
And it literally feels
like you are in the middle

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.050
of a volcano when you are standing here.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.040
It is...my ears are ringing,
my eyes are burning.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.953
This is food on the next level.

00:06:38.032 --> 00:06:43.032
(stall operator talking
in foreign language)

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.332
Roll it? How should I?

00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:57.587
Okay, take a piece.

00:06:57.587 --> 00:06:59.717
This is tandoori roti.

00:06:59.717 --> 00:07:01.531
Pick up a piece of the
roti itself and then...

00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:02.486
- [Stall Operator] Naan.

00:07:02.486 --> 00:07:03.496
- [Mark] It's naan?

00:07:03.496 --> 00:07:04.329
- [Stall Operator] Naan.

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:05.281
- [Mark] Oh, it's naan, okay.

00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:06.520
- [Stall Operator]
Tandoori Pakistani naan.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.710
- [Mark] Oh, it's so hot.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.167
Oh, it's like padi chilli.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.403
Wow.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.183
It's so good.

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:23.583
All of those organs
just melt in your mouth.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.403
It's so hot.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.430
The way it is all mashed up perfectly,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.600
the chillis, the tomatoes,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.130
everything is mashed up perfectly.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.760
The spices, you can
taste the cumin in there.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.283
Oh man, it's salty, it's slightly organy.

00:07:40.214 --> 00:07:41.047
- More.

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:00.032
- Wow, that is so good, it's so...

00:08:03.503 --> 00:08:07.442
You can taste the grainy
pieces of the brain in there,

00:08:07.442 --> 00:08:10.633
and the like, irony pieces of the kidney.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.203
Oh man, that is just
like, an organ to like.

00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:20.008
An organ to like, and
orchestra of organ to like.

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:30.982
(talking in foreign language)

00:08:58.736 --> 00:08:59.569
- Amazing.

00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:01.330
- I don't know if you could
hear anything I explained

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.190
on camera describing, all I
wana say is that was amazing.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.700
Everything is so perfectly mashed up

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.620
and the way they mash it
up they're such artists.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.083
They are so skillful.

00:09:13.074 --> 00:09:14.650
The chefs are just doing amazing things.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.460
Yeah, that style, that
skill, that experience,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.528
that taka tak.

00:09:20.528 --> 00:09:22.678
(talking in foreign language)

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:23.999
Thank you.

00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:26.999
(upbeat rock music)

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:29.883
That's possibly the most intense.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.370
I think I've inhaled some serious smoke.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.370
Back in the car, that taka
tak brains and testicles

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.880
and kidney experience was
one of the most intense foods

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.670
and cooking techniques
that I've ever seen.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.540
They are so skillful, they're
so good at what they do,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.003
and that is an incredibly delicious dish.

00:09:56.003 --> 00:10:01.003
Like, every single piece of
pepper, tomato, spice, testicle,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.040
kidney, everything is
like micro little pieces,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.570
and everything is mixed
completely finely thorough.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.400
Every bite taste exactly the same because

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.863
it's mixed so fine.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.530
Yeah, incredibly delicious,
my ears are slightly ringing,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.853
my eyes are burning, very very happy.
