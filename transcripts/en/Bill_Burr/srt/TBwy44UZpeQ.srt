1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,920
Eh, what's going on? It's Bill Burr

2
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:09,000

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,363
[inaudible]

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,600
ah, just checking in on you. I got
bogged down in the mud on that one.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,780
I didn't think I was going to
pull myself up, but you know what?

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,640
I reach down deep. Showed
what? I had it on me in on me.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,020
She'll write head in me. Um,
anyways. Yeah. You know what?

8
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:33,860
It's nice to be here.

9
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:37,520
It's nice to be back out here in
sunny la after going back to New York.

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,850
It was chilly fall Billy back there in
the New York City getting soft out here.

11
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,540
And you know what? I love
it. I fucking love it.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,330
That's a big thing that east coast
people always say when you go out west,

13
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:52,600
hey dog,
don't lose your edge brow dope.

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,000
Don't be getting all Hollywood on me.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,110
It's like dope.
Um,

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,420
you basically telling me don't become
happy. That's what you're saying,

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,660
doped up and getting to happy.
What are you going to go do it?

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,210
You can walk around,
you're going to get some sandals.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,910
Rarely you fucking toes
hanging out or whatever.

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,320
Do wearing some fucking clam diggers.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,993
MMM,

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,130
no, it's just nice to like, I went
back there and I uh, you know,

23
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:26,070
I'm one of these fucking La people now.
I don't really have a winter coat coat.

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,610
Yep. Pea Coat. Um, it was funny,
this woman was breaking my balls.

25
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:33,940
Tell me it wasn't a real one because I
didn't get it at the army navy store.

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,540
It's like those fucking things
that's like wearing thick pajamas.

27
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,370
Pico doesn't work the second it's
below like, you know, 40 degrees.

28
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,030
It's one of those meds that, you know
what, it's got a mid range jumper that's,

29
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,750
that's all that fucking coat has.
You know what I mean? It can't run.

30
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:53,530
The court doesn't play any fucking day.
It's too fucking hot.

31
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,500
You know, once you get to like 58 degrees,
it's too fucking hot to wear that coat.

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,250
Way Too hot.

33
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,250
55 write that code basically exists
from about 39 degrees to maybe 51.

34
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,390
You know what I mean? If you get
a decent one, forget a decent one.

35
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:16,210
Like I bought a TCO,
actually Nia bought me a decent one,

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,530
but she used my money to do it. So, you
know what I mean? Technically I made,

37
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,310
you know, chief fucking use my money,
so I guess I bought it, you know,

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,180
I guess I do have an assistant.
It's my wife

39
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,280
who has access to all my funds.
You got to do that with your wife,

40
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,680
you know what I mean?
Just give her access to all your funds.

41
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,680
It just gives you so much
leverage in an argument.

42
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,610
Yeah.

43
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,380
Just use that next time, you
know? But [inaudible] you
were to a, you was snoring.

44
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:51,670
Just honey, honey, you have
access to all of my funds.

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,770
You understand that you have access to
all my funds. I go to an airport in leave,

46
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,660
leave you with access to,
I don't, I don't want,

47
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,840
I don't even know what
I'm going to come back to.

48
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,380
Is there even going to be anything here
now?

49
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,560
What is the problem with the
fucking glass that I didn't wash?

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,940
I always make me out. Like she's a Nag.
She really isn't. She really isn't,

51
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:13,990
but it's just,
um,

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:15,970
yeah,

53
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,010
I guess it's just the
fear of, of, you know,

54
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,100
being with somebody that they
can take you for everything.

55
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,540
You've got prenup doesn't mean shit out
here in California. You know what I mean?

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,090
You don't have a prenup is in California.

57
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:32,940
That's like when there's a blitz in the
fullback, misses the assignment. That's,

58
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,810
that's what the Prenup is. You'd think
that fucker's going to pick up that,

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,500
that fucking Lawrence Taylor want to
be coming right around the outside. Ah,

60
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,280
he missed he sitting there
with happy feet. Where is he?

61
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,670
He's bind you and then you get the
old right there, Fred. Right. Well,

62
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,880
you fucking Bacchae a helmet.
It's the middle of your spine.

63
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,920
As you head snaps back. That's what
a fucking prenup is out here. So,

64
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,750
um, anyways, I didn't want,
I'm talking about here. Um,

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,550
I just get back from New York City.

66
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:08,551
I had such a fucking great time going
back there doing the fifth annual Patrice

67
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,210
O'Neal benefit right out of the gate.

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,600
Thank you to everyone that
came down to the show.

69
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,060
The show was unbelievable.
I mean,

70
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,660
I wasn't there last year because
of the snow I got snowed in.

71
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:23,380
But of the four that I've
seen that might've been the
strongest show that we've

72
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,690
had,
we've always had strong shows.

73
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:30,250
But there was something about that
show is like the perfect level of, um,

74
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,370
of his friends of new guys that were
influenced by him and just the ball break.

75
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,080
And that was going on during the
fucking show. Uh, Jesus Christ,

76
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,400
Rich Vos making fun of
Keith Robinson fucking

77
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,940
what's his face? I think Norton of
course, no one had the best line.

78
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,370
He was talking about how funny Keith was.
He goes,

79
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:56,360
you should have had a stroke 15 years ago.
He goes,

80
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,520
I don't understand how Keith had a stroke.
And he still talks. You still eat well,

81
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:03,620
easier to understand than rich vos.

82
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,240
Those are probably two of the best ones
in a Voss. Had like this stupid fucking,

83
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,880
they had like this Paisley shirt from
like the early nineties like every drum

84
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,850
instructional video that I bought from
the early nineties where they didn't have

85
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:20,600
those jazz guys who are such
good musicians, you know,

86
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:24,680
you get so good that your music sucks.
After a while they were playing like that.

87
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:28,430
I'm 94 seven the way,
hey,

88
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,430
that smooth jazz shit.
You know,

89
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,240
he had one of those shirts and then he
had like a fucking Justin Timberlake does

90
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:39,020
fucking bing Crosby,

91
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:42,800
one of those fucking hipster hats that
even hipster stop wearing those things

92
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,770
like 10 years ago and it was blue on blue.

93
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,730
So we will backstage and you know,

94
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:53,090
all of us fucking jaded people are
going though rich. It looks good. No,

95
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,530
you should wear it because he wasn't sure
about it. And Pete Davidson, the kid,

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,710
right? New kitties already on fucking
SNL. That's how old I am. He's,

97
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,880
he was actually telling rich going,
you rich, you can't wear that.

98
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,630
It looks terrible. And I
was finally like, Pete,

99
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:11,590
shut up the whole game is that we
know it looks. Don't tell him that.

100
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:12,550
And he just started laughing.

101
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:16,700
Then he went along with it and I believe
he took it off his head at the end,

102
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,340
at the end of his set. We had such a
great time and everybody fucking killed,

103
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,290
um,

104
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,290
right out of the gate we had Dan
soda went up first after Voss and um,

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,600
he went up there and absolutely just
fucking murdered. It was like he'd,

106
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,530
he'd been doing it theaters
his whole life. Keith Killed
Pete Davidson destroyed,

107
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,830
even though he did this whole bit
about there's no excuse to go bald.

108
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,800
That kind of bugged me.
Um, in this day and age

109
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,700
saying there was enough medicine out
there as something like that, uh,

110
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,940
that Jim Norton crushed.

111
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,970
Then it was Dave Attell and
then Leslie Jones and um,

112
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,150
and then I had to mop up in the end
after all those guys fucking killing man.

113
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,430
It was awesome. And thank you.
Of course, to Maureen Taren,

114
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,820
who's the real force behind the whole
thing. She puts the whole thing together.

115
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,500
She gets all as add comics somehow to
show up at the same place at the right

116
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:12,460
time every year.

117
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,673
MMM.

118
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,590
She deals with all the finances of,
of renting out the place.

119
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:22,440
She deals with the whole fucking thing.
I'm so special thanks to her and let,

120
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:27,340
once again everybody that that came
out, everybody at the stand, you know,

121
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,710
uh,

122
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,870
Dave and Chris down at the stand for
always hooking us up with the after party

123
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:36,070
and all that shit. I'm just had a great
fucking time and that's it. All right.

124
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,860
Um,
until we do it again next year.

125
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,513
MMM.

126
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,420
It really is my, I gotta be honest. It's
my favorite fucking Gig of the year.

127
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,210
It's so much fucking fun cause I get
none of these guys ever get to work with

128
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:50,090
them now because they all headline
now if I get to see him again,

129
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,210
it's just such a fucking great time.
Jim Florentine just came down to hang out.

130
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,390
I'm trying to make sure I remember
everybody, but it was, uh,

131
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,160
it was great and I was in New
York for a couple of days and um,

132
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,980
had a great time. Like the
first night, Monday night,

133
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,950
I just went out and I started hitting
all these clubs that I used to. Uh,

134
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,780
you know, I used to work out in back
in the day when I lived in New York.

135
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,030
I went to Caroline's first

136
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,570
yeah.

137
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,530
And uh, jumped on this
show and um, you know,

138
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:21,150
I was waiting to go on and as always,
you know,

139
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,510
he was always ended up seeing
somebody funny comedian Carmen Lynch,

140
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:26,970
who I've seen a bunch of times before,
but I hadn't seen her in awhile.

141
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,310
I'm not gonna tell you the bit, but she
did some bit that was fucking hilarious.

142
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,810
And I believe she's going to be on
Stephen Colbert this Friday night and she

143
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:36,750
told me she was going to be doing the
bit, the bit's basically about, um,

144
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,700
people that can sleep through
anything. Um, so anyways,

145
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:42,900
I went up and I have,

146
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,960
I just go on stage and I do the shit
that I'm working on and some older shit

147
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:49,860
that I'm bringing back.

148
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:54,780
Then I'm putting a new spin on and it was
just wire to wire this perfect fucking,

149
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,600
I was taping it. You know, I,

150
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,330
I have a 0.2% chance that we'll
actually go back and listen to it,

151
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,510
but the fact that I'm recording
it makes me feel good. Right.

152
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,750
And I was actually going to listen to
it because I got these gigs coming up in

153
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:10,351
Phoenix.
Right.

154
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:15,351
I gotta get my shit together and this
set ads and for whatever fucking reason,

155
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,680
I never touched the phone. It just shut
off after like two minutes. I'm like,

156
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:25,600
he gotta be fucking kidding me.
So then I go up to the company.

157
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,890
I still felt great, you know, and
um, I was like, I'll remember,

158
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,140
I'll remember this shit. So
I got to the comic Strip, um,

159
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:37,290
which was my home club when
I first got to New York,

160
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,170
way back in the day with Lucian,
the, the late great Lucian hold.

161
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,110
We would sit there and go sit there.
You'd walk in and be like, Hey,

162
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,380
ya'll Aleutian Elmo. But comedian,
I just moved down from Boston and

163
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,350
yeah,
I already have enough white guys.

164
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,130
He would literally say that

165
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,500
I already have enough white guys,

166
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,020
and I remember all these white guy
comics would get so fucking mad.

167
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,090
You'd be like, you see, you see, it's the
same thing, just fucking reverse space.

168
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,410
To me it's like, no, it isn't. It
isn't. You know what the fuck he saying?

169
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,840
He has a million of you.

170
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:14,240
And if you're just going to be another
fucking white guy that grew up in a

171
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:19,010
fucking Culdesac, he already has it. It's
like it's a grocery store. All right?

172
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,210
And he's got, he's got fucking ears of
corn stacked up to the fucking, you know,

173
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,650
sealant and you come and you want
to buy a Bushel. Now I don't,

174
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,500
you gotta eat chickpeas.
They're freckles. Right.

175
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,420
So I knew what he meant when he said it.
It's like,

176
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:36,260
don't come in here and just be doing
the, uh, what's the deal with shit.

177
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,850
So I remember what he said that to me,
I just was a little frustrated,

178
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:45,050
but I just said to myself,
I'll get in here. I'll get
in here eventually. But, um,

179
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,551
oh man,

180
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:51,230
I remember there so many fucking white
dude comics would get so mad at that. Um,

181
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,700
you could never say that to another
fucking group of people. It's like, yeah,

182
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,370
but it's white on white so he can get
away with it. You know what I mean?

183
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,240
Like black people can say fucked up shit
to each other. He can keep it in house.

184
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,930
It's like your family.
You can say whatever the fuck you want.

185
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,760
You're still going to sit down
for Thanksgiving together.

186
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:10,610
You have to your family. You know what
I mean? It's the same fucking thing.

187
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,890
I remember exactly where I was.

188
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,880
I just remember him smiling and nodding
and he closed his eyes and I was like,

189
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:20,180
oh my God, this guy is actually
an open person. You know,

190
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:23,420
I'd love to get a spot here and he's
smiling, nodding. I'm like, here comes,

191
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,460
maybe he's going to give me
a phone number or something.

192
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,160
I already have an old white guys.

193
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,540
I was sitting there with my
stupid backpack just walking away.

194
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,630
We used to always use the reference
of bill Bixby at the end of the hulk.

195
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:40,960
You know, when he would just be walking
down the road. That's sad. Piano music.

196
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,240
That's how I left the club. But, um,

197
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,370
I had my little positive fucking things
that I would say to myself to, uh,

198
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,580
to get me to, you know, to
go over to the next club.

199
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:56,440
Who the fuck was over at stand up New
York back in the day. He was a good dude.

200
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:59,140
And I remember he had a dead tooth,
that's all I remember and I would,

201
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:00,160
I would go in there

202
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,390
and um,

203
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,980
he didn't sugar coat it at
all when I walked up to him.

204
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:08,990
I remember telling him that
I was a new comic and the,

205
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:10,960
the look of fucking pain on his,

206
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,710
he just sort of looked up
like I was talking to the
side of his head and he just

207
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:17,870
looked up and he just made this,

208
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:21,380
this face literally like he had
a major operation than they were.

209
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,570
This is the first time they
were removing the bandages.

210
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,550
That was the look on his
face when I talked to them.

211
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,630
I think I actually petered out through
the sentence. I was like, Hey, uh,

212
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,470
what is the name of hey, so and so,
uh, my name is Bill Berber community,

213
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:38,340
just moved down from New
York and I just want it. Yup.

214
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,190
And then I just fucking walked away.

215
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,473
So

216
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,000
all these years later to still be able
to go back to New York and walking into

217
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:54,230
these clubs and they still know who I
am and they'll actually put me on stage.

218
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,380
The thrill of that and the privilege
of that is never fucking gone away.

219
00:12:57,381 --> 00:13:02,000
So anyway, so I go to, I
go to, uh, the comic strip,

220
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,440
you know, and now I'm feeling all cocky
because I just had a great set. So I mean,

221
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:09,470
all the years that I've done this,
I never see the bomb coming after that,

222
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,850
you know, I'm feeling all fucking good,
but myself, I'm like, I'm going to go up,

223
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:16,820
I'm going to do it.
Just like I did it at Caroline's.

224
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,970
It's going to come out perfectly.
It's going to be fucking, you know,

225
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,260
mint it into my brain and this is going
to be a nice cornerstone to start this

226
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,510
next fucking hour. Right. And of course
I go in there, nobody's paying attention,

227
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,000
small crowds, somebody ordering and,
and, and I don't know what was going on.

228
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,460
There was this giant group of
people right in the front. And the,

229
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,240
I think they just,

230
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I basically deduced that they all just
had the ideal childhood and they couldn't

231
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:46,700
relate to anything I was saying.

232
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,600
And I basically had to start
over after every single joke.

233
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,520
And of course that was the, the show. One
of my friends came out to see me and um,

234
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,000
I didn't bomb, but it was like, I
just, it was, you know, you know,

235
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,530
those days were, and just nothing's
going right. That's like what it was,

236
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:08,330
except it was in a 15 minute
set. You know, I tell a joke,

237
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:12,170
it would work and then I try to build on
that momentum and then someone would be

238
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:15,620
ordering really loud and then I'd
have to stop and then it start over.

239
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,550
It was just a, it was just one thing after
another. So I was like, Jesus Christ.

240
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:22,430
So then I get in a cab,
and this is a great thing about New York.

241
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:27,431
You can do like a zillion spots jumped
in a cab and I went down to the New New

242
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,300
York comedy club.

243
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,020
MMM.

244
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,680
You used to be run by Al Martin and
they redid the whole fucking thing.

245
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,780
And um,

246
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,790
that was a place that I did not have any
good memories of for the first fucking

247
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,820
three years that I went there.
Not Three years, but that,

248
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:50,230
that place of all the places I went to,
his hard as the Boston Comedy Club,

249
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,440
the New York comedy club was the one that
made me contemplate packing up my shit

250
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:57,914
and going home.

251
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,790
That fucking place was the land of
the misfit toys fucking comedians.

252
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,780
And that was one of those comedy clubs
where you walked in and there was like a

253
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,700
hundred head shots on the wall and none
of not one picture was of anybody that

254
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:18,680
made it.
I just remember thinking shit like that.

255
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,210
The punchline in Atlanta used to be
like the Jamie Bendel runs it, right?

256
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:25,580
I used to say Jamie,
for the love of fucking God,

257
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,310
at least near when you walk on the stage,

258
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:32,300
can you have some head shots here of
people that actually were successful?

259
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,850
They had like the head shot at every
fucking comedian who ever tried to fucking

260
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:40,040
make it and they left it up on the wall.
I mean,

261
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,620
some of them came turn out to be
big time writers and producers,

262
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:46,390
but you don't know that. You
only know the performers. Um,

263
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,310
to the New York Comedy Club was like
that times like fucking 30. And I'm,

264
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,320
Oh my God, that I have some brutal
fucking sets in their brutal sets.

265
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:00,740
That's the first place I saw Mike Machete.
Um,

266
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,120
and I, oh man, that
that place. But anyway,

267
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:06,860
so they did a whole face lift on
that place. And like, it was funny,

268
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:11,420
like psychologically I went back
to where I was when I first, um,

269
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,660
was coming down in New York and I went
in and I sort of recognize the place.

270
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,820
It was still sort of the same floor
plan and uh, it was a great club.

271
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,130
They had, it was the lobby
had happy, hopeful colors,

272
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:26,690
painted on the walls and shit.

273
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,830
And I went up and ended up
having a great set there. Um,

274
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,730
and then after that I went over to
the stand and then after that I, I,

275
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,190
I met up with [inaudible] and de Rosa and
some other people. We hung out and uh,

276
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,660
it was just, it was perfect. It
was just like, I remember this,

277
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:48,620
this is what fucking live in, in New
York was aside from me being Chile, um,

278
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,241
it was perfect.

279
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:53,540
And then early in the day I found a
place where I could play drums at some

280
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,450
rehearsal spots. So it was like, it
was like the perfect fucking day.

281
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,490
And then like an Asshole,
I stayed out til like three,

282
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:05,600
three 30 in the fucking morning
drink and like an idiot,

283
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,710
like a fucking idiot woke up the next day.

284
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:14,510
I felt like shit I didn't eat for
like the first 12 hours of the day.

285
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,350
And then what do I have to start?
I have a fucking burger and fries.

286
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,030
I was trying to go my whole time,

287
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:23,690
not getting a slice of pizza in New York
cause I always do that because all the

288
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,250
pits out here fucking sucks.

289
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,930
Even the shit that's good sucks
compared to a pizza on the east coast.

290
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,520
And I finally gave in after the Patrice
benefit and went to this place right

291
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,740
next to the stand and I was like,
I'm just going to get one slice.

292
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,530
And then I walked in and I was like,
oh that one looks good too.

293
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,460
And then I got to burn the shit out
of the fucking roof of my mouth.

294
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,110
I remember sitting there just going
to bill, just let them cool off.

295
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,340
Just let them cool off. I'm
like, well maybe I'll just,

296
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,000
maybe I'll just take a little,
you know when you try to go in like,

297
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:57,030
you know you'd ever see like the runt
of the litter trying to nurse off.

298
00:17:57,031 --> 00:18:00,180
The mom just Kinda Kinda Kinda go into,
I was going in like that.

299
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,450
I still burn the shit out of my mouth
and kept fucking shoving it down my pile.

300
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,040
So anyways, I could not have had
a better fucking time. And um,

301
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,210
I gotta tell you man that,
that Patrice benefit,

302
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,580
like we definitely have
our work cut out for us.

303
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,740
MMM.
[inaudible]

304
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:20,971
for next year.

305
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:23,850
We already have a couple of people in
mind that we're going to try to get to it,

306
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,130
um, to get on the show next year.
So there you go. So that's it.

307
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:31,410
Can you tell him to type in my password?
Cause the whole fuck,

308
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,200
I just started talking like half a mile
an hour and of course I didn't type it

309
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:37,980
in right on. Sorry.

310
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:42,330
The Mike sliding down my chest here. There
we go. All right, let's move on here.

311
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,570
Um,
let me see here.

312
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,560
Yeah.

313
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,500
Oh, for God's sakes, I already lost. I
was going to try to hide my youtube page.

314
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:53,980
I mean know where the fucking
link is anymore. Um, all right.

315
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,900
Can I read a little bit
of advertising here?

316
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,380
Now that we're halfway through and after
the advertising, I'm going to tell you,

317
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:04,180
I called in a certain person's,
um, radio. Should it today,

318
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,740
radio show today or
should a radio show today?

319
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,820
I called him coach k and Dave
syms basketball and beyond
show that's going to be

320
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:15,790
airing tonight.

321
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,450
MMM.

322
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:22,450
February 23rd at 6:00 PM
on a Sirius XM channel.

323
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:27,110
84, uh, the Sirius Xm college channel.

324
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,870
MMM.

325
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,590
But you know what's funny,

326
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,590
I can't even fucking listen to it because
I was driving my Jaguar Jackie as I

327
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:41,780
call it, drives my wife
nuts. The Beautiful Jackie
driving her down the street.

328
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,930
I did a spot at the store.
This is before I went to New York.

329
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,810
It's been raining like crazy out here.
And I was driving,

330
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,970
turned down lassie and ago, and I'm
cruising along. And then I just had,

331
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,020
boom,

332
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,970
out of nowhere it felt like I drove
over something metal and immediately the

333
00:19:58,971 --> 00:19:59,960
dashboard lights up,

334
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:04,430
check air pressure in the car and the
front right tire and ended up pulling into

335
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:07,790
the gas station down there. And I had
a blown out the front fucking tire.

336
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,870
I swear to got my Prius, could
have taken that hit, you know,

337
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:15,860
but now I got the fucking sexy tires
on the fucking Jaguar and Oh my God.

338
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:18,890
Adversity, right? Totally.
Just fucking implodes.

339
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,593
MMM.

340
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,470
So then I was like, all right, you know,
I had the locking lugs on it and shit,

341
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,060
and I'm like, off fuck did, did please
tell me I got that thing in the glove box,

342
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,150
which I did. I called AAA, you know,

343
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:35,240
I got the spare out and everything and
I was looking at the Jack and all that

344
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:38,540
type of shit. And it's
just, I was too afraid to,

345
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,230
things I paid for AAA, so I'm going
to have someone change the tire.

346
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,330
MMM [inaudible]

347
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,670
and then secondly, I was too afraid
to, cause the car's low to the ground.

348
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:53,410
I didn't want to stick it underneath the
fucking car and God forbid if I fucking

349
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,050
miss the a frame, you know,
which I did a long time ago.

350
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,460
Granted I was absolutely shit faced.
I was with a friend of mine was the 80s,

351
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,640
you know, we were drinking and
driving and um, broad daylight.

352
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:11,530
He gets a fucking flat and I went to
Jack it up and I put the Jack underneath

353
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:15,710
basically the floorboards and
just put it right through.

354
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,840
Um, so anyways, they ended up
changing the tire and everything.

355
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:26,170
So I had that awful spare tire
and now my car is getting fixed.

356
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:28,230
I took it over that cause I want to
make sure I didn't fuck up this spit

357
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:32,320
suspension cause I ran over the crater
with my back right tire too. So,

358
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,800
um, long story short,
he came home that night.

359
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,980
My wife fucking gave me the little
emasculating shot. She's like,

360
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,850
I can't believe you didn't do it yourself.
And I was like, oh well, you know,

361
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:46,910
I mean, I mean I could if I wanted to.
I mean I have, you know, I got, I just,

362
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:51,050
you know, I got AAA. So I mean, you
know, back in the day I used to, uh,

363
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:53,840
I used to change tires. You know,
I, I, I'll never forget this.

364
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:56,660
I started telling this story about I
would change the tire on my fucking Ford

365
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,800
Ranger on the driver's side,

366
00:21:57,801 --> 00:22:01,670
on the side of route one 28 at three in
the morning and how I fucking jacked it

367
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:03,050
up and I forgot to loosen the lug.

368
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:06,530
So I had to bring it back down
again to take it off. And, uh,

369
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,310
and I realized the entire time I was
telling her that it was because I was

370
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:13,520
embarrassed that I felt like she
questioned my man who had like,

371
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:18,380
I was some pussy that I called Aaa. But
I do have to tell you this, I actually,

372
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,390
um, even if I knew exactly
what the fuck I was doing,

373
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,140
all I had was that little
right angle fucking, you know,

374
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,550
thing to take the lugs off.

375
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:32,870
And I just assumed that they had over
torqued the fucking thing and then there

376
00:22:32,871 --> 00:22:35,720
was no way I was going to get that off
unless I had another piece of pipe to get

377
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,554
the leverage,

378
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,790
which is what I learned back in the day
with the old lady three Ford Range. Yeah.

379
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,110
But the guy showed up, he goes, no, he
goes, they tighten these by hand now,

380
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,170
or at least to do with Jaguar.
And he just took it off like butter.

381
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:51,200
And I was just like, oh Jesus,
maybe I could have done this.

382
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,130
So now I'm obsessed with the fucking weird
as Jack that's in the trunk of my car.

383
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,480
I should probably know how to do
that. You know, hey, you know what?

384
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:03,170
Maybe my wife was right. Maybe I am
a pussy. I Dunno. Let's fucking a,

385
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:08,940

00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:20,130
than the cost of a cab.

423
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,670
Please include all of the following
points during your read. Well,

424
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:26,070
of course I'm going to
you fucking put them here.

425
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,020
Like is this saint don't skip any. Um,
if you tried Lyft, you know what I mean?

426
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:31,883
With Lyft,

427
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,700
you can just download the APP request to
driving and they show up in three and a

428
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:40,620
half minutes on average. That's really
fast. You just fucking said two minutes.

429
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,480
They have to get you right. Oh, he said
in minutes. Not two minutes. Sorry.

430
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,110
My apologies to everybody who lived.

431
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:55,030
Every Lyft driver is fully vetted
through their 10 point safety standard,

432
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:57,520
including criminal and
DMV background checks.

433
00:25:57,521 --> 00:26:00,940
You'll know you'll get around
quickly and safely, safely,

434
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:06,220
unlike at that other one
that rhymes with boober.

435
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,170
They don't give a shit as long as you
have a face in a fucking car. Right.

436
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,900
We need hands and feet basically,

437
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:16,060
that if you have the basics
of being a human being,

438
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:19,630
they don't give a shit stand there
with a bloody ax. He got a hatchback.

439
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,110
All right?
Lift drivers are rated after every ride.

440
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,860
It's the only the best stick around.
It's hilarious.

441
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:30,520
I just picture people getting cut in
August before the football season.

442
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,200
I'm sorry man. I'm sure. I'm
sure you'll catch up. You'll
catch on over at Uber. Uh,

443
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,890
you don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy car with some creepy dude

444
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:44,070
with Lyft. You can tip in the APP,
which is obviously leads to drivers.

445
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,581
I mean,

446
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:48,720
nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect
five star rating from the passengers.

447
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,850
It's just a better all around experience.

448
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,170
Plus there's a lot of people that
are just too mean to not do that.

449
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:59,370
You know what I mean?
I think four is more legit than a five.

450
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,630
You know what? I mean five is just like,
hey, you know what I mean? You got me,

451
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,710
they're good for you. I'll do your solid.
Give you a five. You know what I mean?

452
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,910
Five would you get a fucking hand job?
Then he must've had the bucket seats,

453
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:12,744
right?

454
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,460
It can reach back and give you a
little fucking a little helper.

455
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,210
What's with you tonight?
You're so relaxed. I'll tell
you I'm loving less. Um,

456
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,090
bigger isn't always better.
Lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

457
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,270
but it's the fastest growing
in highest rating. One,

458
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,780
I'm talking quality over quantity.
Thanks to lift.

459
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,470
You got an easy way to avoid drunk
driving. You never have to bum a ride.

460
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:38,970
You never have to worry about parking.

461
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,010
A lot of people are actually getting
ride ARIDE getting rid of their car.

462
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:48,990
Sorry. And relying on Lyft to get
around. Are a lot of people doing that?

463
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:51,120
What exactly is that number or percentage?

464
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,420
That's a word I use in a fucking
argument. Who said that? A lot of people,

465
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,450
and you know what?
I don't blame them.

466
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,200
Evidentaly right now Lyft is offering
our listeners a special deal.

471
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,020
up to $10 each sets up to a $30 value.
If you can't do basic math,

472
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,760
that's Promo Code Bill Burr.
Enter Promo Code Bill Bar.

473
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,770
By the way, you know,
in the middle of that,

474
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:32,250
I know I did suggest a man reaching back,
giving another man a hand job.

475
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,150
That's not a gay act when
you're paying for a ride, okay?

476
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:38,370
If that's just a friend who is,
even if you're in the back seat,

477
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:41,640
that would be a homosexual act,
but it's, you know, look it up.

478
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,580
If you look it up on a taxi
drive back slash hand jobs,

479
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,870
um, dot com you'll see that I'm
actually telling the truth. All right?

480
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,570
What do we get next to you?
When are we going next?

481
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:59,040
Uh Oh eight I found my youtube channel.
Beautiful. Okay. Blue Apron, everybody.

482
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,460
I you hungry? You want to fill
up your fucking pie hole? Well,

483
00:29:03,461 --> 00:29:05,280
you got to go to blue apron.
Blue Apron.

484
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,050
Talk about how good it feels to
cook for yourself. I love it. Oh,

485
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:13,350
I love cooking for myself.
I feel it down in my loins.

486
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,670
Every time I pour myself a bowl of
grape nuts or corn checks or we checks.

487
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,880
I'm a big fan.
I'm a big fan of the check cereal.

488
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,390
Doesn't it mean it feels good
that you may just sell something?

489
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:29,010
It feels better to cook for somebody
else, right? Then you get the praise.

490
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,820
Oh my God, you made it. It made it for me.

491
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:38,160
You know, my dad walked out on me when he
was trying to make me supper. One night,

492
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,920
I'll never forget it is so much.

493
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,090
Not all ingredients are created equal,
fresh,

494
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,460
high quality ingredients
make a real difference,

495
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:50,710
so it's important to know
where your food comes from.

496
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,780
Talk about your personal experience
with Blue Apron, the meal you cooked,

497
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:58,720
the ingredients overall, how it tasted,
how it felt, cooking it, et cetera.

498
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,020
This is my bed. In my experience.
They sent me a fucking card.

499
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,160
The $30 fucking worth of free
food or whatever the fuck it is,

500
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:09,670
and I haven't used it yet, so that's been
my experience. But I'm going to try it.

501
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,910
I'm going to, that's a threat. I'm
going to try it. And when I try it on,

502
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:15,820
I'm going to tell you
guys about my experience.

503
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,800
I want to talk to you about the white
apron that I put it on when I cook the

504
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,850
Blue Apron, you know, and right there
you have blue. And then my pubes are red,

505
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,620
right? Red, white, and blue.
That's America right there.
You want some lentil soup?

506
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,480
Choose from a variety of new recipes each
week, each week, each week, each week,

507
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,220
or let blue apron culinary team
surprise you. Hey, big boy.

508
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:41,500
What do you do? Oh,
I'm on a culinary team.

509
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,040
Is that rugby recipes are not repeated
with any years, so you'll never get bored.

510
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:52,630
What if you like a meal? Can you fucking
order it again that you got away?

511
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,930
It's like Haley's comet,
but with food and it's every year.

512
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,420
Blue Apron has several delivery options.

513
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,460
Seek and choose for what fits your needs.

514
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,480
And there's no weekly commitment so you
don't get deliveries when you want them

515
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,470
to only get deliveries when you want them.
Hey, what if you're just a fat fucking,

516
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:12,280
you contend with that? Can you just order
like a different Sunday every night?

517
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,480
They'll tell you, you know you're fat.
We need a Sunday on a Monday. You know,

518
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:21,070
sorry. Each meal comes with a step. What's
a step by step? Easy to follow recipe,

519
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:25,990
cad, and three portion ingredients and
can be prepared in 40 minutes or less.

520
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,270
This is like when your parents
help you with your homework.

521
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,630
The next day he got the star on your
forehead and you felt a little queasy.

522
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,230
You know, like I didn't really earn
it. Did I? Blue aprons, freshness.

523
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:38,890
Guaranteed promises that every ingredient
in your delivery arrives ready to cook

524
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,570
or they'll make it right. I like that.
That's very vague. They'll make it right.

525
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:47,020
They send a fucking hooker over.
Check out this week's menu.

A better way to cook.

530
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,130
All right. And lastly, but
not leastly. Here we go.

531
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,010
Simply Thay earlier this month,
ces,

532
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:17,040
the consumer electronics show wrapped
up ces is this incredible trade show.

533
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,820
The fuck are we talking about
here? Okay, so this is placed,

534
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,500
this is trade show called
consumer electronics show show.

535
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,020
And evidently it's an
incredible trade show.

536
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:34,120
All the big tech companies unveiled
their newest innovations. Oh my God.

537
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,910
Can you imagine the fucking
nerds at that thing?

538
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,770
It's like seeing the future
in front of your eyes. Um,

539
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,650
the ends. Yes. Seeing the
future while smelling blue balls

540
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,420
are sponsors simply safe.

541
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:54,320
Home security was there and they had
one of the most talked about products on

542
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:57,290
the show.
The new simply safe security camera.

543
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,410
I already liked the sound of this
bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

544
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,310
The camera connects to the sensors.
In your alarm system,

545
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,360
walk, walk, walk, walk. Or

546
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,370
if an intruder tries to break in, the
camera will automatically start recording.

547
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,870
Then not only will simply save,
call the police band Ben,

548
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,670
and you'll have the actual
evidence due to do [inaudible].

549
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,710
So when the police arrive, you can say,
here's the guy. It's truly incredible.

550
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,930
Here's the guy, he'd be that one with the
gun to my head. I got it all on video,

551
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,390
not this part. The part where he
walked in a plus was simply fidsafe.

552
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:42,110
You can check, you can check in and

00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,120
I just thought of a good scene in a
fucking movie that I'm never gonna write.

561
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,140
All right,
so you get the fucking simply safe system,

562
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,910
simply faith system,

563
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,590
and you're on the road and you check in
to your fucking home to see what's going

564
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:22,670
on. And not only do you see somebody's
sneaking up to walk the walk to break into

565
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:26,640
it, it's actually you and
you're like, what the fuck?

566
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:31,860
How can I be there breaking into my shit?
Why would I not be me,

567
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,500
but be someone else stealing my own shit?

568
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,920
And then you realize it's
the robot version of you.

569
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,490
BOMP bomp bomp bomp bomp right?

570
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,050
You could sell that to Tom Cruise
as he was walking to his jet

571
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,390
does yelling through the chain link fence,

572
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,500
Da. Simply say you're rocking. Wow.

573
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,130
You see itself breaking into your
own house cause you're a robot.

574
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:01,860
And he would just stop halfway up the
fucking stairs and he'd look over his

575
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:05,670
shoulder like Bruce Lee and fucking, I
mean, sorry Bruce Willis in die hard.

576
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:11,400
And he'd be, he'd be like, what did you
say? I said, the, it's a fucking robot.

577
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,350
But it's you.
So you play both of them.

578
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:17,720
So there's a chance you
could win a fucking Oscar.

579
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,360
Alright, then he'd be right up
fucking against the chain link fence,

580
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:26,910
right his nose poking through one of the
holes and you go to hand him the script

581
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:29,400
and then he'd be like, I'm sorry you
gotta go through the proper channels.

582
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,700
It's just the way it works.
Okay,

583
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:36,420
so now you're on your way
over to Scientology won't go
and Cook Donk, Donk, Donk,

584
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:40,830
donk, donk, donk, reg, you
fucking polling a day, right?

585
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,070
Show me with the fucking big smile, but
just a weird look in their eye. Greet you,

586
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,131
the lake.

587
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:51,340
Mr. Cruz said you were going to come
over with your fucking robot movie about

588
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:55,450
him. I'd be like, yeah, yeah it was. And
they be like, would you like some tea?

589
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:58,720
And I'd be like, I'm not drinking fucking
anything in this building. All right.

590
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,920
Okay. I just, just take the
fucking script, you know,

591
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:06,750
with some big fucking place
cause they got all that money.

592
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:10,950
Be Echo and take the fucking scraps. Go.
Great. You know, something like that.

593
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:14,100
Look at that. I gave you a fucking idea
for a movie. I told you who to sell it to.

594
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,900
Oh, Shit. Calling into the
podcast. Hey Paul Versey,

595
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,930
you're on the Monday morning podcast.
I got you on speaker.

596
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,850
It's Thursday. Was it Thursday
afternoon? Just before Friday.

597
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,580
Monday morning podcast. Monday
morning podcast listeners. And yet,

598
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:35,610
guess what Paula, just
checking in on you. Oh Nice.

599
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:38,310
Nice. How's it going out
there? It's going great. Paul.

600
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:40,200
I got to talk to coach k today.

601
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,060
I do. I felt fucking nuts, dude. Did you,

602
00:36:44,061 --> 00:36:46,250
did he say anything about
that loss last night?

603
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:52,450
Uh, I asked him really quickly, I
said, what's it like as a coach to,

604
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,700
to lose a game on a last second
bank in three point shot,

605
00:36:57,701 --> 00:37:02,320
like fucking 10 feet behind the arc.
I go, does that kill you as a coach?

606
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,990
And he said No. He said, no.

607
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:09,991
You know what kills me is having six
fast breaks in the first half and not,

608
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:15,070
not getting any points on those. And it's
classic. Afterwards I thought about it.

609
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:18,280
It's just like, yeah, he doesn't
sweat this stuff. He can't control,

610
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:21,670
but it's the stuff that you can control
that you should follow through on.

611
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:22,630
So that they got people,

612
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,140
there's a little teaser if you
want to listen tonight on x,

613
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,660
Sirius Xm channel 84 6:00 PM.

614
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,280
That's fucking awesome. Jelly. She
didn't ask us something stupid.

615
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:35,220
I would ask them something stupid.
I would've been like,

616
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:39,530
what was your like coaches acting like?
The kids are bigger than him. I was like,

617
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,060
you like coaching Christian later. Uh,
that's so cool. Was He cool though?

618
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,520
Like was he like talk?

619
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,250
He was totally cool. I am an idea
of if I ever get him on the podcast,

620
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:53,400
I know how I'm going to interview him,
but that, that I'm not going to give away.

621
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,510
I'm,
I'll tell you afterwards,

622
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:58,960
I got a great idea on how to interview
him because I figured he's been asked the

623
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:03,961
same thousand basketball questions
a million times over and I,

624
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,720
but my goal would be to do an
interview and try to see, you know,

625
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,090
ask you I know it. Yeah, I
know you're going to be like,

626
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:14,170
so what do you think of
cars start making no, right.

627
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,970
It'd be a little more involved in that.
I wouldn't have a name.

628
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:18,440
What do you think of cars?
You'd be like, I don't know.

629
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:22,150
I take one to the fucking
venue. You idiot. I drive one.

630
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,500
I drive one drive on all the time.
Hey Dude,

631
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:27,860
I gotta I gotta I gotta call you right
back because I need to wrap this podcast

632
00:38:27,861 --> 00:38:32,150
up and then I got to go a be daddy
daycare. All right. Hey Paul.

633
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:35,070
That's exactly what I'm going
to dope. Okay. It's a pleasure.

634
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,730
It's always a pleasure,
Paul,

635
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,880
especially since we're across the
country built know God bless you.

636
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:44,910
God bless you and everything that is
that you do. And Mr Bill, I'll see ya.

637
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,300
Um, anyways, so there you
go. Hey, look at that.

638
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:51,370
The first fucking call and
see I had the technology.

639
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,180
Everybody tries to get these fucking
DSL lines or whatever the fuck they are.

640
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:58,990
Ups. Shit. All you do is you
just put your iPhone on speaker.

641
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,100
You hold it up to the mic. I think
it gives it more of a quality sound.

642
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,040
You know,
all these fucking shows.

643
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,160
They try to make it sound
like the person's in the
room. They're not in the room.

644
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,530
It calling me on his cell
phone and God damn it,

645
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:16,300
that's what it's going to sound like.
Ball Ball, ball ball, golf. Um, all right,

646
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,950
so there you go.
Somebody fucking right.

647
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:23,030
Then somebody write that movie and go
make a bunch of, go make a bunch of money.

648
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,090
Go loiter around an airport ceiling.
You can fucking do that. Um, all right,

649
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,870
I think that's it, right? Oh, so
this is what I learned the second,

650
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,930
third, third time I was on stage
at the New York comedy club.

651
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,760
I forgot to tell you. I'm fucking
doing my set and now it's going great.

652
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,170
I'm having a great set.
By the way,

653
00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:46,140
I didn't have a good set at the comic
strip and of course the recorded didn't

654
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:46,974
shut off.

655
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,600
I'm having a great fucking set in New
York and I looked down and Paul versus

656
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,140
calling me, I'm like, oh, what the
fuck? Then I go, wait a minute. I go,

657
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,280
does the fucking recorder shut off?
If somebody calls millennials,

658
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:02,550
can you help me out? And they
were all like, yes, it shuts off.

659
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,150
And I go, does it come back on after
the call? And somebody said, yes. Well,

660
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:10,960
guess what? It doesn't, it shuts
off. So all you comedians out there,

661
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:14,290
if you tape in a set, if
you fail in it, you know,

662
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,140
you might want to reach over and fucking
put it in airplane mode in case your

663
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:21,790
mother calls, you know, then you've got
to give a shit. You know? Thanks a lot.

664
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,110
[inaudible] you ruined my
new Dick joke. Um, all right,

665
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:30,270
that's the podcast for this week,
not the podcast.

666
00:40:30,271 --> 00:40:33,810
Just me checking in on you. Enjoy the
music. Now you've got another half hour.

667
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,530
Has Shit coming your way.
That's a, I dunno, it's, it's,

668
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:42,300
it's some greatest hits
stuff from a podcast from a,
I don't know, time gone by.

669
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,400
So when I say, and here's my
youtube channel, by the way. Um,

670
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,091
let's see here.

671
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:53,091
It's youtube.com/user/monday
morning podcast.

672
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,390
And guess what?

673
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:58,220
I'm going to start making fucking videos
and I'm going to upload it. I finally,

674
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,330
you know,
I never videotaped the fucking podcast.

675
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:02,850
I'm going to start making videos,
putting in up there,

676
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,860
starting when I go to Phoenix,

677
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,910
I'm going to start doing the
tours of the cities again. Um,

678
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,550
I've got some other ideas
of some shit that I can do,

679
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,040
mmm.

680
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,700
To add to the channel and finally trying
to build that stuff up. Um, so that's it.

681
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:21,540
Once again, thank you to everybody who
did the Patrice benefit, rich foss,

682
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:24,330
Dan soder, Keith Robinson, Pete
Davidson, Jim Norton, David,

683
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:28,320
Tell Leslie Jones and Maureen Taren for
putting the whole fucking thing together

684
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,210
and, uh, thank you to
everybody who came out.

685
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,710
We will do it again next year and
I think I already, who I'm gonna

686
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,010
reach out to to try to get on the
show. That's it. Go fuck yourselves.

687
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,470
That'd be great.
And I'll talk to you on Monday.

688
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:31,900
[inaudible] [inaudible]

689
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,580
hey, what's up man? It's built.

690
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:39,440
It is the Monday morning podcast and
I'm going to be multitasking this week.

691
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,590
All right.
And fucking heating up some pizza.

692
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,960
And that's what I'm having for breakfast.

693
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:50,920
And he's supposed to have it called
like those douchebags on ESPN. Um,

694
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,093
but I'm not gonna

695
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,630
I'll for now I'm fucking hungry,
so I'm going to have some pizza.

696
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,720
Isn't that interesting?

697
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,400
That website that you guys are all
going on a fucking pity fuck.com.

698
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:09,140
What's the name of that thing
where you were, you, uh,

699
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,760
celebrities go on there and they,
uh, what the hell they do? You know,

700
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:18,530
they type in a, you know, 1:48
PM just tied my left sneaker,

701
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,180
isn't it? What the fuck is that? It
begins with a t somebody sent me a, uh,

702
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,910
an email the other day about
that type of shit, you know,

703
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,570
seeing it by wanting to join.
They're raw.

704
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,240
They're their website about
whatever that stuff is, you know,

705
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,090
it would really help if I actually had
the name of the website, which I don't,

706
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:42,620
of course, which I don't. Um, but anyways,

707
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,350
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Does that make any sense?

708
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,630
Does it ever make any sense?
You know,

709
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:49,910
I love about this podcast
is it's fucking free,

710
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,820
so you can never complain about it.
Although people don't,

711
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,040
people do bitch about the podcast and,
uh,

712
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,410
people take it seriously sometimes.
It's amazing.

713
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,730
I'll do like 50 minutes of shit say,

714
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,320
and some of the most ignorant stuff
you're probably gonna hear all day,

715
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,270
if not the whole week.
You know,

716
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:12,050
if you hang out with really smart
people and people, they send me emails,

717
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:13,940
like really taking me.

718
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:18,620
I got a lot of like condescending
emails this week, uh,

719
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,830
that were really just, I
dunno, people aren't dumb.

720
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,120
I guess I'm really coming
off like a moron, you know,

721
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,850
which I openly admit that I
am. And also that, you know,

722
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:31,520
I'm just fucking joking around.
Some people they day they,

723
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,620
they take it real seriously. I'm really
trying to fucking scroll down to this.

724
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,770
I actually have, you know, which, uh,

725
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:42,520
actually because of it
has made me create a, a,

726
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:46,800
a new part of the podcast. You know, at
this point, if you're new to my podcast,

727
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:49,350
what I do is I, uh, people
send me questions every week.

728
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:53,340
I try to answer them to the best of
my ability. We have the overrated,

729
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:58,290
underrated lists, people's lists of
things in life. Either, I don't know,

730
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:01,350
entertainers or a can, openers,
whatever the fuck you want.

731
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:06,000
Anything that you think is
overrated, underrated, and
a, I've got no movie reviews.

732
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,640
That's something else. Somebody's got
something else. Here's the new thing.

733
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,850
Douche bag of the week.
All right.

734
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,290
This guy sent me a,
uh, an email last week.

735
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:20,820
I was talking about nature out here and
the seasons and the fires and all that

736
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:25,380
type of shit. Just bullshitting, just
trying to fill up 50 minutes, you know,

737
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,540
trying to help somebody out,

738
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:30,570
sitting in a cubicle or some
fucking job that they don't want,

739
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,340
that they're on their way out.

740
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,150
And this fucking asshole decides
to take me seriously, right?

741
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,180
I says what? He writes, dear farmer bill,

742
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,290
listening to you talk about
nature soil in Los Angeles,

743
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,870
Los Angeles is seasonal fires made me
put your intelligence on the overrated

744
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,390
list.
Fires don't just happen.

745
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,220
Are you banking your whole argument on
the theory of spontaneous combustion?

746
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,840
Some Douche flicks a lit cigarette
out the window and there you go. Yeah,

747
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:05,130
the trees and the foliage gets brown and
dry out, but they don't just explode.

748
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,250
Do you actually think we
should just let the fire burn?

749
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,450
Can you believe this fucking guy?
Like,

750
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:14,280
I think trees just explode.

751
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:18,360
Like I really think that they should
just let the fucking hills burn and have

752
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,680
people's houses burned down and that
the, you know, they're rich people.

753
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:23,880
So who gives a fuck?
I mean,

754
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:28,290
does the guy have any sort
of concept that in comedy,

755
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:32,250
if you just say something that's really
fucking ridiculous and over the top of

756
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:33,084
the shock of it,

757
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,050
what the valley's bring a
smile to somebody's face
unless you take his fucking

758
00:46:37,051 --> 00:46:41,850
seriously. Jesus Christ. That's
one of my favorite lines ever.

759
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:45,120
Fires don't just happen.
Really.

760
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,130
I just thought they just happened.

761
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,330
Trees don't just spontaneously combust.

762
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:56,430
You know when it comes in and I'm saying,
oh look at my piece has done.

763
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,940
Oh that was fucking quick. You know
what? I didn't stick it in the microwave.

764
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:05,490
I don't like the microwave because it's
something Keith Richards said a fucking

765
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:09,990
funny is that one time I read a quote
where Keith Richards says, I don't use,

766
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,020
I don't use cell phones cause you,
you know,

767
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:15,960
you might as well stick your head
in a microphone, a microwave.

768
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,470
And that kind of killed two
pieces of technology for me,

769
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:21,600
but I need my cell phone
so I still use that.

770
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:25,140
So I try not to use the fucking microwave.
When you think about it,

771
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:29,720
there's something just not right
about it, you know? So I'm,

772
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:33,940
I'm using the old thing. I use the fire
in the stove that just happened, you know,

773
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:37,780
it just so happened that when I put my
pizza in there, that my stove, you know,

774
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:39,550
spontaneously combusted

775
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,920
Jesus fucking Christ people when
you listen to these podcasts, no,

776
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,330
that I don't read and know that when I
really say something stupid that I'm just

777
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:51,280
joking.
I'm just fucking around.

778
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:55,330
You don't need to waste 10 minutes of
your day trying to show me how fucking

779
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:59,380
intelligent you are about how you
understand how fires are started.

780
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,510
I liked how he went with the hacky lit
cigarette out the window or maybe he's

781
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:07,300
just making fun of my intelligence there.
No wait.

782
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,270
He thought I thought things spontaneously
combust. I don't fucking know.

783
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,540
But he gets douche bag of
the week. Okay. Alright.

784
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,040
I don't mind when I do stand up
on TV. If somebody, you know,

785
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:20,410
sends me an email and says,
you know,

786
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:24,160
I just thought your comments about
rescue dogs, but completely ridiculous.

787
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,880
I wish abortion was retroactive.
You know,

788
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,010
this kind of shit up emails I've gotten.

789
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,470
I understand that because
those people are fans of mine.

790
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,150
They don't know what it is that I do, but
I figured if he listened to my podcast,

791
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:41,080
you realize, did I say a lot
of over the top stupid shit?

792
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,330
And I don't mean any of it.
All right?

793
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:47,950
So you don't really need to fucking
send me emails. Just, you know,

794
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,490
what I'm really trying to do is save your
time. I'm actually thinking about you.

795
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,600
Look at me being in the modern,
Huh? Just like Mother Teresa

796
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,920
was actually talking to this comedian
yesterday, this Guy Doug Davidoff,

797
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,370
who's fucking hilarious. If you
ever get a chance to see him. Uh,

798
00:49:03,371 --> 00:49:06,670
he was talking some hell would keep came
around and we talk about Mother Teresa

799
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:11,500
and he said to me that evidently one of
the times she was talking about poverty

800
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:16,010
in the world and she said
something to the effect of, uh,

801
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,150
the worst poverty she's ever
seen was I think in India.

802
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,440
And the second worst was actually right
here in America and was basically saying

803
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:27,034
that,
um,

804
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,080
the poverty of the spirit
in America is staggering.

805
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:33,430
And you know,

806
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:38,430
which really made me wish she was still
alive so I could just slap that fucking

807
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:42,370
none head right?
Let non hat right off her fucking head.

808
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,340
I am so sick of fucking
people trashing America,

809
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:54,250
you know, acting like where they
live is this fucking great place.

810
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,150
Okay, now I haven't hit all
the countries. All right,

811
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,910
but I've been to Australia. I've been
to Canada. This is pathetic. I've,

812
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:11,260
I went to Ireland, did the same
fucking people. They, they,

813
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:14,620
they haven't figured out what life is
all about. I went into fucking Ireland.

814
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:19,630
It's a Wednesday night in the pub is
packed with fucking people. Okay. Those,

815
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:24,010
that's people's dads in there who should
be at home tossing a machete lately or

816
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:27,500
whatever the fuck they're supposed to do
as a dad over there and they're fucking

817
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:31,550
there. So if they really understood,
you know, what makes you happy in life?

818
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,800
Oh my God.
Did my computer just fucking crash?

819
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:40,220
Oh fuck.
This is the day that I've been dreading.

820
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:45,230
This is the day that I, I kept putting
off. I buy a laptop next month.

821
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:49,610
I buy one next month. Don't
do this to me baby. Come on.

822
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:54,080
We've been through too much. Wow. Does
anybody out there go to computers?

823
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,020
My screen just went,

824
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:03,530
it's sort of a blue black and
all the typing is now in yellow.

825
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,060
I can still read it. Oh, what do I
do? I hold the power button down.

826
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,800
We try to reboot it like
fucking pizzas getting cold.

827
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:18,440
This is just a cluster fuck whatever.
I don't need the fucking questions.

828
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,690
I'll just keep going.
You know what I mean?

829
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,220
Cause sometimes in life that's what you
go home and get back to. Mother Theresa,

830
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:27,320
you know what? I want to fucking
cunt. You know what I mean?

831
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,620
And I know that sacrilegious
to say that shit, but you know,

832
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,930
she did too much shit when everyone
else was looking. You know what I mean?

833
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:37,190
That's why I never liked about her

834
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,060
seven then don't they have
that saying in the Bible?

835
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,830
There's another book I never read. I
tried to, it's just fucking, you know,

836
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:49,010
it's like update the language already,
you know?

837
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:53,080
And these set it to thou.
Alright.

838
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,020
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about. I just, it's just really,

839
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,320
I'm sick of fucking people

840
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:03,410
acting like people in Canada are happier
than people in America or people in

841
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,440
England.
Those miserable motherfuckers.

842
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,080
They came to go to a soccer
game without killing each other.

843
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,300
Fucking Mother Teresa.
And she just, you know,

844
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,080
did you sue big live spiritually

845
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,080
Jesus Christ, just like take a fucking
pie and throw it right in her face.

846
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,800
I wish I was the one that interviewing her
when she said that, you, you know what?

847
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:30,620
Why don't you go fucking hang out with
a leper so we can see how fucking great

848
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:32,990
you are.
Fucking

849
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:35,930
what a downer.

850
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,930
You mentioned she showed up at your
party and just sitting there looking at

851
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:42,140
everybody. Just judging everyone.
How fucking holy she is.

852
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,200
I went to where she ended up
in the afterlife, you know,

853
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,010
just holding herself out or what
a great fucking person she was.

854
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,560
I gotta tell you, man, I don't buy it.

855
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,490
I don't fucking buy it.
Everybody's got something

856
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,940
hanging out with lepers and I'm certain
you can fucking trash America you and

857
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:12,770
jump on that fucking bandwagon.
Huh? What'd you go make somebody?

858
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:17,060
Some cookies? Do what old women are
supposed to be doing. All right.

859
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,330
Took them making cookies with bill,

860
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:23,420
with his grandma's hands playing in
the background. Okay, and until then,

861
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,540
shut in your face.
This is what I like to do on my podcast.

862
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:32,520
I like to trash dead saints. Is she a
saint? She'll, she'll become a saint.

863
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:34,470
That's what the fuck she was trying to do.
You know what it really was?

864
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,390
She was a psycho who couldn't fucking,
she couldn't sustain a relationship.

865
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,480
That's what it was. And she basically,
you know, just being famous,

866
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,510
which is what most Americans want,
wasn't enough for her.

867
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:51,930
She wanted to be fucking world famous.
So she traveled all around the world.

868
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:56,520
Who Look at me, look at me. Oh, there's
some kids stuck in a mud puddle.

869
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:59,640
I'm pulling them out. I don't even
care if my none gown gets dirty.

870
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,390
That's how fucking holy I am.
Wait, did you run out of tape?

871
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,830
Did you run out of tape in the camera?
Let me,

872
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:08,340
let me pause and wait for you to film
that. Put the kid back in the puddle

873
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,630
spiritually fucking bankrupt.
You know,

874
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:15,060
for till I don't need you to
fucking tell me that Mother Teresa.

875
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,550
I know how fucked in the head I am.
Okay.

876
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,050
Sitting here acting like you're tapped
into some sort of higher fucking power.

877
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:27,150
He got a lot of fucking balls. A
lot of fucking balls. All right.

878
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:32,230
Now that I'm down to the crust
on my pizza, let me see, um,

879
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,770
see if I can reboot this fucking thing.
You know what sucks?

880
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,770
Is there so many fucking
great eat questions this week.

881
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,180
So many great fucking emails while
this thing is not even responding.

882
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,340
This is just flat lining.

883
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:53,130
You fucking cunt. Don't do this
to me. Don't do this to me.

884
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,490
Mayor comes,
it's coming back up.

885
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,390
I know there's a lot of religious people
listening to this shit go while you

886
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,940
just trashed mother Theresa. The
fuck was that. Okay. Oh, here we go.

887
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,440
See that now by the trees were so
fucking holy. The way I just trashed her.

888
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,850
My,
my computer wouldn't rebooted

889
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,330
or maybe she's just being the model again.
She's up in heaven and she's going, no,

890
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,720
it's okay. It's okay.
Let us computer work.

891
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,380
I don't need,
I don't need you to fucking help Terry.

892
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,930
All right. I know I'm eating. This
is fucking really rude, but you know,

893
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:35,190
I have to carve up before
I do. These podcasts are so
fucking long at this point.

894
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,320
Um, all right, whatever. Oh,

895
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,760
here's one that someone actually
sent me that I remember. You know,

896
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:48,360
you know every week when I go on and on
about how you should shop at mom and pop

897
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:51,600
store, this girl brought this great
fucking poem. She's like, you know what?

898
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:56,150
I've tried to go into those mom and pop
places and a lot of times I, you know,

899
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,390
I can't,
I can't even do this.

900
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,500
I'm not going to paraphrase it because
it's such a fucking great slam on what

901
00:56:01,501 --> 00:56:05,880
the hell. I said I don't want to ruin,
I don't want to ruin it. All right?

902
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,900
What can I talk to you guys about it?

903
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:12,480
I wait for my fucking ancient computer
to boot up. Oh, here we go. Oh,

904
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:17,280
this is getting exciting.
Mac Os 10 that's my operating system.

905
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,850
You're still using that man. I hit
that and like the fourth grade. Yeah,

906
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,810
you're still a loser. All right.
What do you think about that?

907
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,440
What do you fucking base
your entire existence on your
fucking operating system?

908
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:34,650
You don't even have a camera on
your computer now. I don't. Yeah,

909
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,420
you jerk off on the Internet. Okay.
And someone in the Pentagon watched it.

910
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,120
So now you can never be president.
What do you think about that?

911
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,090
Because they have that clip
and if you do become president,

912
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:44,500
you got to do everything that they say,
oh,

913
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,280
we're going to take out a fucking video.
Are you snapping at at 23 years of age?

914
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,450
All right, come on. I really, you know,

915
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:55,870
I don't how long I can sustain this
false anger as I wait for this shit.

916
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:03,280
Have I seen any good movies? Oh,
I was in Ogden, Utah, this, uh,

917
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:08,610
this weekend and I want to thank everybody
who came out to wise guys in Ogden,

918
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:11,290
Utah.
Um,

919
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,830
I had a great time and it was
one of the most beautiful,

920
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:19,120
a beautiful cities I've ever been
to in my life. Just unbelieve.

921
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:23,800
I got up in the morning to go down and
go do the radio and I'm literally driving

922
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:28,801
down the highway on the entire left hand
side as I guess the rocky mountains,

923
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:34,690
but they're like, they're like right
there and the sun is just coming up.

924
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:36,050
It's on the other side of the mountain.

925
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:39,610
So there's this orange glow
outlining the top of the mountains,

926
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:40,900
which have snow on them.

927
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:45,250
And then below at the foot
of the mountains is the
city with the lights of the

928
00:57:45,251 --> 00:57:48,460
city.
I look like a fucking postcard was unreal.

929
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:55,210
Um, you know, see that. I
appreciate it that Mother Teresa,

930
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,860
how are you going to criticize that?

931
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,400
You shouldn't have been brought up in
light of this city. The city is humans.

932
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:07,900
It's dirty. It should've just talked about
nature. Is that what she sounded like?

933
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,950
Did she ever even talk or did you sit
there looking sad and judging the fucking

934
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,510
media who were filming her?
She laid next to somebody with Lupus.

935
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,140
Um, all right, here we
go. Podcast questions.

936
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:25,150
They can trashed Mother Teresa Long
enough. I'm glad it did that. You know,

937
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:30,040
I think it was long overdue.
Okay. Um, all right.

938
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:31,840
Eventually I'll get to that
lady. I'll move. You know what?

939
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:35,890
Why don't I just do the fucking questions
here. All right. Oh, you know what?

940
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:39,400
Here's one for you. I was fucking coming
out at the airport in Ogden, Utah,

941
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,790
which is brutal this time
of year, by the way. Okay.

942
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,390
And I want to show you guys that I,
that I am not afraid of technology,

943
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:47,530
which people start,

944
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,400
I've really started to suggest because
I'm so against those automated machines

945
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:55,720
at the, uh, at the supermarkets. But, um,

946
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,950
I don't mind him at the airport. I'm
not going to lie to you. I really don't.

947
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:04,120
Especially when you're in ski season
in Ogden fucking Utah and everybody in

948
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:09,121
front of you is standing there with
their fucking skis and an overnight bag.

949
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:13,210
So, you know, when I saw
him when I was there,

950
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:17,860
as I take another bite of
pizza rudely, hey, you know,

951
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:21,680
why don't you go pay for a podcast?
All right. Do you like about that?

952
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:24,140
Go pay for a fucking podcast.
I'm sure the host won't be eating.

953
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,300
Don't get indignant with me.
All right.

954
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:32,360
I'm fucking hang up on you right now.
I'll leave you alone in your cubicle then.

955
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:35,450
What are you going to do? Huh? That's
right. Back to the spreadsheet, isn't it?

956
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,680
All right then you think
about that anyways, sorry.

957
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,320
Just had to give a shit
as I finish that bite. Um,

958
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:47,060
so I'm going through the airport in
Ogden, Utah, big, long fucking line.

959
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,950
All these ain't me personal. I cannot
even begin to tell you how fucking white

960
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,050
Utah is. It's, it's unreal. Like I was,
you know, here like my black friends with,

961
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,770
you know, telling Shit, you know,
a couple times I've gone, you know,

962
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,910
fuel them going back to APP. You
know what? They've never said that.

963
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:06,080
And I'm actually thinking of a
Richard Pryor bit. Anybody do that?

964
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:07,220
Your dad was when a friend of mine,

965
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,070
oh wait a minute with someone famous
who said that Richard Pryor did that bit

966
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:11,840
about like, you know,
going back to Africa,

967
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,050
how all of a sudden was all black people
and it was beautiful and all this type

968
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:17,500
of stuff. Like, you know, I was always
going, I wonder what that thinks. Like,

969
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,900
you know what? If you're white, go
to Utah, you'll get that experience.

970
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,290
It's fucking unbelievable.
It's just, it's, it's awesome.

971
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,890
It's just fucking wall the
wall. Yet it just, you know,

972
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,790
and you feel real safe. And then
you realize half of them, her name,

973
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:35,750
Luke and mark and John, all those biblical
names, and then you're like, okay,

974
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:37,120
I'm out of here.
You don't.

975
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,860
Then you guys give 10% of your
income to the Mormon church.

976
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,310
You don't ask those people like, who's
the most famous Mormon? Who's the most,

977
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:46,790
you know, the top Mormon out there
and somebody yells out to Steve Young,

978
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:51,500
I thought that was fucking hilarious
and entire relationship, relationship,

979
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:54,020
entire religion.
You know what I mean?

980
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:57,770
You'd think that they would
pick somebody who, I dunno,

981
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,520
did some Mother Teresa Shit. And
when they pick the fucking, uh,

982
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,800
the stand in for Joe Montana

983
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,660
got fucking annoys me.
I don't like Steve Young eater.

984
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,360
He went on and on about the
Patriots fucking cheating.

985
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,970
I love how they keep quiet. You
know, people questioned the Patriots.

986
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:16,280
Super Bowl victories because
of that video tape thing,

987
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:19,490
which I totally understand, but nobody's
questioning the New York Yankees,

988
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,250
they last two fucking world
series victories. You know,

989
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:25,700
when like three guys were on fucking
roids remember Roger Clemens?

990
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,550
How fucking roided up with that guy?

991
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:31,790
He threw a ball through
Mike Piazza is bat,

992
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:36,710
the fucking bat end of it comes
flying at him like 80 miles an hour.

993
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:41,710
He catches it bare handed and then throws
it and he was like the hulk and people

994
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,500
are these amped up for the game.
He was wasted out of his fucking tree

995
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:52,010
telling you one of these days I'm going
to climb up on new Yankee stadium.

996
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:55,430
I'm going to fucking erase those last
two championships and then they'll only

997
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:59,600
have 24. It'd be still 200 and ahead
of the red sox. All right. Sorry,

998
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:01,770
I'm just killing time here.
All right. Uh Oh. Anyways,

999
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,650
I'm going to the fucking airport.
This is what they ended up.

1000
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:07,850
So there's this big long line of a bunch
of Lawrence Welk looking white people.

1001
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:11,690
Everybody looks like they played like
the trombone or some shit. Right? Um,

1002
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:17,000
and uh,
so they got this thing on the side.

1003
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:20,250
If you want to bypass, this is the new
thing that they have in airports. Okay.

1004
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,240
If you want to bypass the long
lines and security, you know,

1005
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,620
if you're not flying first class,

1006
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:30,621
if you just some regular Joe who can't
afford a first class fucking ticket and

1007
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,040
you don't want to stand in line,

1008
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,910
they got this great new
piece of technology where
all you gotta do is just get

1009
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:40,770
fingerprinted and have your retina
scan and you can go right by everybody.

1010
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,990
You know what I love about that and see
this one lady in front of me is like,

1011
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,860
wow, is that how that's got? If
that how I like that's great.

1012
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:54,510
That's great. You fucking
idiot. Yeah, that's great. Yeah.

1013
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,190
And then everybody does it right?

1014
01:02:56,370 --> 01:03:00,000
And then you stand in the fucking
line again and what's it going to be?

1015
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:02,770
How it's going to be a little bit quicker
and now they have your fucking finger

1016
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,160
prick your finger pointed
like you've committed a felon,

1017
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,930
whatever. I, what are you
gonna do are people people,

1018
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,710
they're just going to give into it and
then I'll be the last guy not to give

1019
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:15,180
into it.
And then you know what?

1020
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:18,510
I'll be standing in the
old school line by myself.

1021
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:23,070
You know, then I'll be going quicker.
Nah, that's not gonna work out.

1022
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:24,090
It's kind of like the easy pass.

1023
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,730
Everybody eventually got the
fucking easy pass and then,

1024
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,460
and then like nine out of 10
lines and now all easy pass.

1025
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,210
And now I'm fucking sitting there with
like nine guys and people don't get your

1026
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:37,290
fucking fingerprints taken to get on a
Goddamn plane and get you fucking retina

1027
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:38,550
scan.
Okay.

1028
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,940
Jesus fucking Christ. Well, if
you're not doing anything wrong,

1029
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:49,620
I don't understand what the problem is.
I'll see you in the FEMA camp.

1030
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,200
All right, question bill. Hey Bill.

1031
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:55,620
How difficult was it to tell people you
wanted to become a comedian when you

1032
01:03:55,621 --> 01:04:00,210
first started? Um, what
were some of the reactions?

1033
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,510
For me it was like telling them you
want it, you want it to be a superhero.

1034
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:07,800
Was it the same for you? I got to
tell you something. I did not even a,

1035
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:12,380
I never told anybody anybody that
I was going to be a comedian. Uh,

1036
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,400
I didn't tell anybody I was even doing
it and I didn't let anybody even come and

1037
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:21,270
see me until I'd been doing
it for well over a year.

1038
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,220
Like it's always amazed me,

1039
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:27,810
the people who have the fucking balls
the first time they go on stage to do

1040
01:04:27,811 --> 01:04:32,811
stand up setting yourself up for quite
possibly one of the most humiliating

1041
01:04:33,571 --> 01:04:37,530
things that could ever happen to you
other than a fucking prison rape,

1042
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,430
which is basically to stand in front
of a bunch of people and get booed off

1043
01:04:41,431 --> 01:04:44,560
stage like their first time on stage.
Like they,

1044
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:49,570
they would bring the entire office that
the people that they work with to come

1045
01:04:49,621 --> 01:04:54,390
down and see him. It's like how you, you,
you, you can't see the possibilities.

1046
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:56,190
It's like dude,
no,

1047
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:00,540
they didn't ever think like what if I
fucking bomb and then I have to go back to

1048
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:04,080
work on Monday and look and no
one's going to look me in the eye.

1049
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,400
You actually gonna ruin all their
weekends cause they're going to be sitting

1050
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:11,040
there worrying what the fuck they going
to say to you on Monday when they come

1051
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:15,570
in. But to answer your
question, um, yeah, it's,

1052
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:19,360
it's a very, uh, it's a very hard
thing to do in a weird way. You know,

1053
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,620
it's sort of like a sort of like coming
out telling the people you're gay I guess

1054
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:28,360
can be fucking sense.
I'm just know you just kind of like,

1055
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:33,040
how am I going to tell my
parents that, uh, you know,

1056
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:38,800
all that money was spent on college
education and now I'm going to go on stage

1057
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:43,480
and talk about my Dick. Um, yeah,

1058
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,600
it was very difficult, but I was, my
parents were unbelievably supportive,

1059
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:49,420
thank God. And then maybe I think
I in them within the first year,

1060
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:54,000
I told one of my close friends that
I was doing it and I, but I did not,

1061
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:56,200
I didn't tell anybody else
because I knew what they were.

1062
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:59,560
Were you going to come on the
CEO? No, you're not doing that.

1063
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:04,690
You're not doing that because
I bomb horrifically, you know,

1064
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:07,990
one out of every four times at this point
and I, that's just too high a ratio.

1065
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:10,900
So yeah, I waited a good year. Um,

1066
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:18,040
and even then it was just
a couple of people. So,

1067
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:21,730
oh, is that a good bite of pizza?
This is really annoying. I'm sorry.

1068
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:28,330
I on with the quattro fromage mushy
so I can have a,

1069
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:29,981
that'd be great.

1070
01:06:29,981 --> 01:06:32,320
If I had a fucking heart attack right
there in the middle of this podcast,

1071
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:34,480
would you guys even know who to call?

1072
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,730
Would you help me out?
You probably wouldn't.

1073
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,420
You'd probably save it and trying to put
it on your website to be the first one

1074
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,270
comedian dies during free podcast.

1075
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,940
Wow. That'd be hilarious. And I die in
the first person I see his mother Teresa.

1076
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:56,680
Just looking at me. I'm all
right. Bill. Next question. Um,

1077
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,650
this is such a great question.
Phil is my ex-girlfriend.

1078
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,070
The only that assumes a breakup is an
opportunity to make a fucking pen pal.

1079
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,190
She writes once a month to let me know
what's going on and ask how I'm doing.

1080
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,083
It's garbage.

1081
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:17,590
Who told this bitch that small talk
via email starts when the fucking ends?

1082
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,150
The only note I wanted to see
from this Twat is a suicide note.

1083
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,980
Ah, God damn. At that fucking email
me made me laugh when I read that.

1084
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,790
Read it late last night. You
guys, I'm telling you everything,

1085
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,970
everybody stepping up their game here,
the questions are getting better.

1086
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:41,740
You guys are learning how to write.
It'll be out of a fucking job here. Um,

1087
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,930
oh dude, you, you don't have
to answer the emails. Um,

1088
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,300
you sound like you're
almost as angry as I am.

1089
01:07:49,301 --> 01:07:53,410
So I'm going to try and go easy
here and talk you off the ledge. Um,

1090
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,440
it's not a bad thing. I mean, that's kind
of, seems like you had a good breakup.

1091
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:01,000
If she still wants to be friends with
you and if you can kind of still be

1092
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:04,540
friends with them.
Um,

1093
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,680
and you always got to
watch out with women.

1094
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,470
Now you've always got to
watch out because you know,

1095
01:08:08,471 --> 01:08:13,210
she might just be staying in contact
with you so she can, you know,

1096
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:17,030
as she's asking how you're doing subtly,
you know,

1097
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:20,870
push those buttons in your head that
she still remembers the combination too.

1098
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:21,981
And you know,

1099
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:26,810
subtly let you know how good her life is
going with the airline pilot that she's

1100
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,030
fucking now dating or something.
You've got to watch out for that shit.

1101
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:30,080
But if she's just being cool,

1102
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:35,000
she sounds like a cool person who maybe
every once in a while you could, uh,

1103
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:39,290
you know, maybe get a fucking hand
job out of. All right, underrated. Um,

1104
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:43,700
van Halen is running with the
devil. This is the same guy. Uh,

1105
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:47,780
he says underrated van Halen running
with the devil. When I get my born again,

1106
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,710
brothers answering machine, I always
screamed, Jesus fucking Christ.

1107
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:55,910
Ansia goddamn phone. Then I sing
running with the devil and laugh.

1108
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:58,790
Ah, Jesus. You know,

1109
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:03,050
there's not enough people like this guy
in the world that's really fucking funny

1110
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:06,110
and I can't even read is overrated
because he's trashing a comedian.

1111
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:10,340
I don't do that on here, but
it was fucking hilarious. Um,

1112
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,310
see what I did there.
I probably shouldn't even said that.

1113
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:15,920
Now you look and read it and I go
fuck yourself. I'm not doing that.

1114
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,640
Might get involved in that biggie.
Tupac Shit. All right. Uh, Bill,

1115
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:23,330
what's your best relationship? What,
what was your best relationship?

1116
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:27,890
What was your worst? Jesus Christ.
It was my best relationship.

1117
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:35,540
Um, probably the one I'm in now
because we can have knock down,

1118
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:38,690
drag out fights and then the end
will end up laughing occasionally.

1119
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,500
I would say that is the best
one because when you're younger,

1120
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:44,720
you don't know how to be in a fucking
relationship. You know what I'm saying?

1121
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:49,430
You just sit there and yeah,
yeah. You know, for me anyways,

1122
01:09:49,431 --> 01:09:52,070
you let the other person walk all
over you and in your head you're like,

1123
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,930
I don't want to fucking do
that. But then you're like, oh,

1124
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:58,220
keep it happy or it won't fuck me.
And then you just continue to lose ground.

1125
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,220
And um,
I got mad.

1126
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:04,430
I had an argument the other day that
it should have been recorded and

1127
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:07,280
transcribed and put into
every men's magazine out.

1128
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:10,010
There was just one of those
fucking arguments. You know,

1129
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:15,020
where your girlfriend is in a
bad fucking mood and or whatever,

1130
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:18,710
thinks you did some shit and she's not
thinking about the situation you're in.

1131
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,580
So she starts giving you shit.
And you know,

1132
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:25,610
for the first few minutes I took it like,
what do I do?

1133
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:29,810
[inaudible] typical moron guy
before I finally flipped out.

1134
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:35,480
I seem distant. Yeah, I'm in the middle
of fucking nowhere. I mean you talk,

1135
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:39,770
perform for a fucking God
damn rednecks out here. Okay.

1136
01:10:39,771 --> 01:10:42,950
I got up at eight in the fucking morning
driving along these fucking mountains.

1137
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,630
Yeah, I'm a little distance.
Okay. Fuck is wrong with you.

1138
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:51,500
The fuck is wrong with you. Get
leave me alone. Leave me alone.

1139
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,230
You're being a jerk.
I'm watching the bill Maher show.

1140
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:57,920
Talk to you tomorrow and hung
up on that was it and was it,

1141
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:02,910
um,
you know what?

1142
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,930
I actually started to tell that argument
and I just sort of fucking bailed on it

1143
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:11,060
cause that's still too
personal. Um, all right Phil.

1144
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:16,240
I recently moved from Michigan
to go to Grad school at Ucla.

1145
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,600
I like to see male, this is another
fucking quiet one. Here we go. Um,

1146
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:26,280
so I recently moved from Michigan
to go to Grad school at Ucla.

1147
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,580
I haven't met one person
that is worth my time in la.

1148
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,680
Everyone is so fucking fake.

1149
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:34,860
And thinks that I give a shit about how
many calories they've eaten this week.

1150
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:39,360
I can't enjoy myself in the nice
weather cause I carry these wonderful

1151
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:43,410
Midwestern man boobs around with me
while even the people that work at

1152
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:46,260
Mcdonald's have their shirts
off showing off their abs.

1153
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:49,440
Are there any cool places to go around La?

1154
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:55,670
This is such a great email because this
is what it feels like when you first

1155
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:58,350
move out to la.
Okay?

1156
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:03,000
You go with the usual criticism.
Oh my god, everybody still plastic.

1157
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:05,040
Everybody's so fight.
Everybody's so fake.

1158
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:08,970
But the reality is if you really
read between the fucking lines,

1159
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,020
I didn't think you have to do with
this email is when you move out here,

1160
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:16,590
you realize everybody is,
you know, not everybody,

1161
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:21,530
but there's a lot of people who are in
great fucking shape and you know you can

1162
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:24,960
be a fat fucking Michigan and not
even realize it. You know what I mean?

1163
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:26,490
Cause you just did the hurt.

1164
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,790
You're just a bunch of buffaloes
walking across the plane.

1165
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:33,360
You don't know everybody's name, but
then you get out there, you know,

1166
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,570
you get so fucking freaked
when you first get there.

1167
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:40,680
You actually invent shit
that didn't happen. You know,

1168
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,070
everyone thinks like give a shit about
how many calories they've eaten this week.

1169
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,680
I love that line because
obviously no one came up and said,

1170
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,930
do you know I've had only
1200 calories this week?

1171
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,680
It's just you start creating
shit in your head. You know,

1172
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:57,180
and like the people in Mcdonald's are
in such good shape that, you know,

1173
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:00,510
to make the point, you actually have
to act like they took their shirts off,

1174
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,330
which I know obviously you're
exaggerating for effect,

1175
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,900
unlike that Douche bag who sent me the
fucking thing about the fires out here.

1176
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:11,940
Um, relax dude. What's going to happen
is you're going to join a gym. Okay?

1177
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,770
You're going to let go of that. You know,
it's not minus 3000 degrees out. So,

1178
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:20,700
um,
actually somehow not living a full life,

1179
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,510
relax. You join a gym,
you get in better shape,

1180
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:27,240
you learn about nutrition and all of
a sudden you start feeling better.

1181
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:32,100
And then one day it's January and
it's fucking 70 degrees out and you,

1182
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:34,860
when your buddies calls from
fucking back east and you dislike,

1183
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,380
you want to be like, dude, you know
you don't have to live like that.

1184
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:38,940
You really don't.

1185
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:42,620
So there's plenty of cool places to go
around Hollywood now if you want to,

1186
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:47,070
don't go. You know, if you're
in Hollywood on fucking sunset,

1187
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,310
you might as well be in time
square in New York City.

1188
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:55,050
So there's plenty of cool
places to go to la in La,

1189
01:13:55,051 --> 01:13:59,850
a lot of outdoor stuff.
You could literally take up
surfing the fucking beaches.

1190
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:02,760
This shit, they got all these mountains
around here where you can go hiking.

1191
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,570
You got all that outdoor stuff, we'll,
we'll just melt away those man boobs.

1192
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,380
Not to mention they got a bunch
of hot broads out here. Yeah,

1193
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,570
they're a little plastic fake down,
but go down to like Hermosa beach.

1194
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:17,980
Then they're just gorgeous and they're
not trying to be an actress and they got

1195
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:21,120
fucking tell me, just just
go in and go down that. Okay.

1196
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,320
And you got out of the usual
fucking Moron riff Raff.

1197
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,850
When you go down there on the beach.

1198
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:28,360
That's definitely the pitbull guys and
the Douche bags with their motorcycles

1199
01:14:28,361 --> 01:14:30,340
and stuff. But believe me, you know,

1200
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:33,490
I've seen Detroit so you really
shouldn't be bitching. Um,

1201
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:36,430
I guess you wanted literally
a list of cool places. Um,

1202
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,640
I don't know if you've noticed the way I
dressed, I'm not exactly a trendsetter.

1203
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,000
Um,
and I know where there's some cool bars,

1204
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:46,120
but I'm not going to say them
over my podcast because um,

1205
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:51,180
I don't need 11 of my 14 listeners showing
up ruining me drowning my sorrows in

1206
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:56,540
my whiskey. Okay. All right,
next one. Bill loved the
podcast. Love you. Stand up.

1207
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:59,680
I decided to follow your lead
in the self checkout crusade.

1208
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:03,340
I no longer use them anymore because you
said because what you said makes sense

1209
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:05,620
to me. Jesus. Thank God I
only got to some person.

1210
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,570
I'd like to offer you a deal though,

1211
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:10,410
since I've given up self checkout
lanes that grocery stores,

1212
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:13,630
all I ask is that you look
deeper into paying bills online.

1213
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:16,480
I've done it for years with no problems.
I love it.

1214
01:15:16,481 --> 01:15:20,830
I understand your concerns about it.
So that's why I merely look,

1215
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,180
I say, merely look into
what into it with your bank.

1216
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:28,750
It's okay to be skeptical of technology,

1217
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:32,860
but don't be skeptical because it's
technology. Have a great day. All right,

1218
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:36,220
well that was my point
earlier. I'm not, you know,

1219
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,040
I'm not a hundred percent
against technology. Obviously.

1220
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,530
I'm a big fan of penicillin

1221
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,110
loving the airplane.
I'm not, I'm just like,

1222
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:51,910
my thing is I don't like technology where,
you know,

1223
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,970
they're acting like it's making it
easier and what they're really doing is

1224
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:59,320
getting a ridiculous amount of personal
information on me that they can then use

1225
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:00,520
for God knows what,

1226
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:05,800
like fingerprinting me and scanning my
retina at the fucking airport so I can

1227
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:08,440
get on a Goddamn plane,
I think goes above and beyond.

1228
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:13,360
It goes above and beyond and I know
it can easily be explained away by the

1229
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:16,720
fucking tour to emails. Then
I'm going to get, you know,

1230
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:21,721
and they're all going to be of the same
ilk of trusting the psychopaths at the

1231
01:16:22,631 --> 01:16:27,280
top of the heap. And I just don't,
that's it. And as far as, uh,

1232
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:31,000
you know, paying your
bills online. I mean,

1233
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:34,170
the only safety you have is that you,

1234
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:37,290
that a bunch of people do it and you're,
you're stuck in you,

1235
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:39,580
you're in the middle of the herd,
you know,

1236
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,350
but if you get to the
outside of the hernia,

1237
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:45,760
that little fucking deer Olympian
or that baby deer, okay, these,

1238
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,960
you know, I don't know. You can
do it, do it if you want to do it.

1239
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:52,240
I'm just saying I don't fucking trust it.

1240
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,560
I'm not going to put my
bank account numbers on.

1241
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,430
I was mainly talking about banking.

1242
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:00,760
I wasn't necessarily talking about
paying bills, but even that shit,

1243
01:17:00,761 --> 01:17:04,480
I just don't like doing it. You know?
I don't like doing it. You can do it.

1244
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:10,310
Go for it. It's all for you. I don't
know. I like the old school, you know,

1245
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,660
I take out my checkbook. Nobody sees my
account numbers. I put it in an envelope,

1246
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:19,460
some guy at the post office fucking
when no one's looking and opens it up.

1247
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:22,540
Then he looks at it. Then he's got to do
a whole bunch, you know? You know what?

1248
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:25,980
I'm saying I got to worry about, it's
the people at the post office. I,

1249
01:17:25,981 --> 01:17:26,361
you know something,

1250
01:17:26,361 --> 01:17:29,210
I actually did a little research on this
after buddy of mine who was a lawyer

1251
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:33,410
and I asked him, what is the number one
way people get their identity stolen?

1252
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,190
And he said, uh, people
stealing your mail.

1253
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:41,810
And uh, what did he move?
Why did he put it Miss Miss,

1254
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:45,110
miss guided trust or something like
that. Basically you try, you know,

1255
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:49,570
you're dating some chick and
she fucking, you know, you know,

1256
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:52,640
you think that she's enjoying you as
much as you're enjoying her and she's

1257
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:54,860
really just say, oh, whatever. You
know what I mean? Somebody at work,

1258
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,250
they leave your purse
there or your Wallet Bill.

1259
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:02,810
We know what misguided trust means. You
don't need to explain it. I'm sorry. So I,

1260
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:05,690
I, you know, I get worried about that
type of stuff. And I also, you know,

1261
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,820
the thing about doing banking online is
I realized that every account is insured

1262
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:14,180
up to 100 grand. And I've heard rumors
that they're going to bump it up.

1263
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:18,390
Somebody sent me an email that they're
going to push it up to two 50. But uh,

1264
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,340
I don't know about you guys,

1265
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,110
but the last five years looking at how
insurance companies handle claims and

1266
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:27,050
bankers, those are like two of the
most corrupt fucking people out there.

1267
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:29,660
Insurance companies and bankers.
And I'm not putting my, uh,

1268
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:33,650
I'm not putting my faith in them,
you know,

1269
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,400
I don't understand why people are
still doing that. Like I said before,

1270
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,190
I don't know. I'm a paranoid psychopaths
and sometimes it hurts me in life,

1271
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,790
but a lot of times it helps me and
I think this is going to help me.

1272
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,940
I'm not fucking banking online.
You guys can do it.

1273
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,730
You want to pay your bills online, you
can do it. I'm not doing that either.

1274
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,590
And I'm not getting my fucking,

1275
01:18:54,591 --> 01:18:57,980
I'm not getting fingerprinted and my
retina scan to get on a fucking airplane.

1276
01:18:57,981 --> 01:18:58,880
I'm not doing that either.

1277
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:03,170
And I'm not going to the grocery store
scan in my own fucking food and bag my

1278
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:07,040
own groceries under the guise that
it's quicker and easier. It isn't.

1279
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:10,460
It's a lot easier for me to just stand
there with my hands in my fucking pocket

1280
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:14,840
and have someone else do it for free.
All right.

1281
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,630
That's all I'm saying.
So I'm sick of arguing this point.

1282
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,870
If you want to use the automated
fucking grocery store thing,

1283
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:25,100
by all means go ahead and do it. If you
want to back online, pay your bills,

1284
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:28,940
by all means, go ahead and do it. And if
you want to get your fucking retina scan,

1285
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:32,450
it'd be fingerprinted. I'm not saying
don't do this shit. I'm saying,

1286
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:37,700
I guess I do say don't do it, but
I think I say, please don't, I,

1287
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:41,690
I don't know. Whatever you want to do
it, go ahead and fucking do it. You know,

1288
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:45,260
just know that I'll be sitting there
thinking that you're a moron. Okay?

1289
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,230
And if you can handle that, then that's
a, that's a great, that's, you know,

1290
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:51,290
you'd be building yourself up spiritually.
Why should you care what I think?

1291
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:56,270
All right. A long time ago I, uh, talked
about what was the sweet spot in history?

1292
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:01,520
You know what I mean? Like living in this
country, like what was perfect, you know,

1293
01:20:01,521 --> 01:20:04,910
I'm looking at, you know, some
people who are really old, you know,

1294
01:20:04,911 --> 01:20:08,220
if you're in your 80s or 90s, you still
had to live the fucking depression,

1295
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:12,330
the dust bowl, all the wars.
And I was trying to think what,

1296
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,790
what the sweet spot was. And I dunno,

1297
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:19,980
I was trying to think, you know,
maybe if you just Miss World War II,

1298
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:21,960
so he had flat feet,

1299
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:24,660
you didn't have to go to Korea and
then you were too old to Vietnam.

1300
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:30,690
I don't know. I look at a lot of it
like, uh, like a cars and sports.

1301
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:31,981
So I want to be,

1302
01:20:31,981 --> 01:20:36,810
I would want to be alive when
sports weren't segregated,

1303
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:42,000
you know, so I could see the
Lebrons and that type of shit.

1304
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:46,680
But I also want to live when the
fucking cars with a shit. And for me,

1305
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:51,140
that's the forties, 50s, and
sixties. So, uh, I guess the,

1306
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:56,370
the first year I would have
to sit through, you know,

1307
01:20:56,371 --> 01:20:58,410
all white people playing all sports.

1308
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:02,280
But as long as I didn't know what
black people look like playing sports,

1309
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:04,140
what I know that it sucked.
You know what I mean?

1310
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:07,830
It's Kinda like when I first was a kid,
I used to listen to Mitch Miller records.

1311
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,410
I didn't know any better.
I didn't know led Zeppelin existed.

1312
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:13,800
And then I find out they stole
their first two albums. Okay,

1313
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:15,960
we're going to get into that again.
Built to shut the fuck up. All right,

1314
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:16,321
so this is,

1315
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:20,220
this person is basically weighing in
what they think is the best period. Uh,

1316
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:24,270
the sweet spot where you could come
up, come of age, live a good life,

1317
01:21:24,271 --> 01:21:25,170
have a nice car,

1318
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,740
and not have to deal with these scary
fucking times that we're living in right

1319
01:21:28,741 --> 01:21:29,670
now. Uh, hey bill,

1320
01:21:29,671 --> 01:21:32,250
about six months ago you
were talking about the sweet
spot in America, blah, blah,

1321
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:36,150
blah, blah. I couldn't decide on when,
um, or you couldn't, um, you said,

1322
01:21:36,151 --> 01:21:38,550
well today I was watching
dazed and confused.

1323
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,220
You know that movie
there and I think it's,

1324
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:46,460
I think the sweet spot is a senior
in high school in the 1970s when the

1325
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:50,311
meatball,

1326
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:55,260
Mike Lowell over the green monster
sweet spot on the bat of American. Oh,

1327
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:59,850
I'm read that wrong of course, because
I suck at reading. He said, I think, um,

1328
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:04,650
I think it's senior in the 1970s was
the meatball Mike Lowell over the green

1329
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:07,110
monster sweet spot on the
bat of American history.

1330
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:11,970
You're out of wars and all, all
that, but all that bullshit.

1331
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:16,020
But it's before global warming,
population crisis, crystal Meth,

1332
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:19,920
hyperinflation, steroids, and
George Bush. Sure we don't,

1333
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:21,930
we wouldn't have toys like
the Internet in the Ipod,

1334
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:26,430
but I'm 20 now and I'll gladly give
up all the achievements to go back.

1335
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:32,710
Uh, I just fucking lost where I was in
this. I'm such a bad out loud reader. Uh,

1336
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:36,750
all the achievements to go back to the
seventies rock and a mullet speeding

1337
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:37,860
around in a caprice,

1338
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:42,630
not giving a fuck unaware that fossil
fuels are exhaustible smoking weed out of

1339
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:47,631
those Cheech and Chong Polak poorly
rolled joints back when we'd wasn't laced

1340
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:52,620
with amphetamines and, and
habit forming. Uh, well,

1341
01:22:52,621 --> 01:22:56,100
I mean they did have a gas crisis in
the early seventies, but uh, yeah,

1342
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,160
I know what you mean. That is a great
fucking time. Yeah. Not wearing a condom.

1343
01:22:59,161 --> 01:23:00,180
That's another great point.

1344
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,970
The morning after pills and penicillin
have a nice day. [inaudible] guys,

1345
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:08,290
you guys, you guys are all making great
points. This week is really well written.

1346
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:11,620
If I could just fucking read it.
Um,

1347
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,670
I'd have to agree with that
because then,

1348
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:18,440
you know what's else is great is if
you came with New York in the 70s,

1349
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:19,810
if you were a senior in the 70s,

1350
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:24,250
you could also pick up a muscle car at
that point, you know, be 10 years old.

1351
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,950
You could probably get it for nothing.
You know,

1352
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:30,340
because people didn't realize that
fucking all these Goddamn nerds,

1353
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:35,180
we're gonna come around and ruin it.
Bloody do restoration.

1354
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:38,570
Our original, it's got the
original radio. Yeah. John,

1355
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:41,970
how you $70,000 and he, I say
Hemi in there. You realize

1356
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,330
you haven't seen those fucking pillows.
You know,

1357
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:49,030
I think those are bailing when to
go for those as a bankrupt. Right.

1358
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:54,370
Doctor was some shit who can afford to
fucking pay $150,000 for Goddamn Mustang.

1359
01:23:55,870 --> 01:24:00,610
Well Megan, my guess anymore. Um,
alright. Douche bag of the week.

1360
01:24:00,611 --> 01:24:05,560
I already did this. Would you like to
hear my snarky email back to him? Why?

1361
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:08,860
Yes. I actually do believe that
trees just explode in fires.

1362
01:24:08,861 --> 01:24:10,180
Only burned brown shit.

1363
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:14,260
I've never heard of this cigarette lit
cigarette phenomenon that you speak of.

1364
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:18,730
Could you elaborate? That's what a,
that was a tone I took with them.

1365
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:21,850
God, I'm so stupid. Thank you
for putting me in my place.

1366
01:24:21,851 --> 01:24:23,290
It's amazing that you caught that.

1367
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:26,140
I recorded 50 minutes of
ridiculous statements last week,

1368
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:29,380
none of which were meant to be taken
seriously except for the part about the

1369
01:24:29,381 --> 01:24:30,214
fires.

1370
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:34,030
I was by no means deliberately saying
ignorant things in order to give someone a

1371
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:38,170
laugh. I truly believed every word of
the fire state of the Union address.

1372
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:41,400
Thank God you let me know
both the serious, serious,

1373
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:45,280
serious nature and the cause of fire.
Fire's just don't happen.

1374
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:46,990
I've got to commit that to memory.

1375
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,500
I will make sure to detract my
statements next week, which I didn't.

1376
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,960
I actually just created
Douche bag or the week before.

1377
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:56,980
I know that person was just trying to be
sarcastic back to me and I misread it.

1378
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:02,650
Maybe that's what it was. Um, all right
and here's some information. Um, you know,

1379
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,020
I say a lot of shit that,
you know,

1380
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:07,300
evidently I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

1381
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:09,340
I was just bitching about
muscle cars being overpriced.

1382
01:25:09,341 --> 01:25:12,130
I was talking about vintage guitars.
You know,

1383
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:17,230
they have some fender strat
with the Johnny Rotten snot
on the fucking fretboard

1384
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:21,940
and it gets 50 grand now and this guy
is saying your complained about the cost

1385
01:25:21,941 --> 01:25:24,730
of ventures.
Guitar guitars is largely unfounded.

1386
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,170
I'm going to stop right there sir,

1387
01:25:26,171 --> 01:25:29,200
and let you know that most of my
opinions are largely unfounded.

1388
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:36,670
That should be the name of my next,
next special, largely unfounded,

1389
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:41,200
especially specifically in the
case of both uh, fender and Gibson,

1390
01:25:41,201 --> 01:25:44,770
the two companies you cited in your rent,
um,

1391
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,470
where the quality of the,

1392
01:25:47,471 --> 01:25:51,400
their production line took a huge nosedive
from the mid eighties up until the

1393
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:52,450
last two years or so.

1394
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:56,290
Switching to oversee workers for the bulk
of their production using cheaper wood

1395
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:00,400
paint, electronics, overall craftsman,
craftsman shifts, et Cetera,

1396
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,160
have all added to the
embarrassingly low quality,

1397
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,300
most insured instruments
on the market today.

1398
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:08,600
I'm definitely with you on
muscle cars being overrated,

1399
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:13,601
but any Gibson and or fender model made
before 1978 as well worth a decent chunk

1400
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:18,470
of change. Alright, great fucking
points putting me in my place.

1401
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:22,460
Yeah,
it's lot like it might,

1402
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:25,370
my thoughts on that away
beyond largely unfounded.

1403
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:27,310
I really don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. The,

1404
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:31,130
I'm just equating it to like the housing
market where if you bought a house 10

1405
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:32,930
years ago,
that was a great thing to do.

1406
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:36,620
But if you bought one fucking three
years ago or an apartment like I did,

1407
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:37,850
you're a fucking moron.

1408
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:43,090
And when I'm saying right now is I think
once everybody is aware that how much

1409
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:48,770
something is worth and that
it's going to be, you know,

1410
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,840
worth a lot of money in the future,

1411
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:55,870
I really feel like nine times out of 10
once it's exposed like you want to be

1412
01:26:56,871 --> 01:27:01,871
buying those guitars 2010 20 years
ago when nobody realized no one really

1413
01:27:02,241 --> 01:27:03,970
thought about how much they
were going to be worth.

1414
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,620
Cause then you could get them for nothing.
You know what I mean?

1415
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:08,750
But now you're paying top dollar.

1416
01:27:08,751 --> 01:27:13,340
I mean you're paying 50 grand for
offended fucking strat. I mean

1417
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:19,020
is it going to be what, 103 years? I
mean I don't, I don't know. I don't,

1418
01:27:19,021 --> 01:27:22,670
I don't understand that. And
it's kind of like houses, right?

1419
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,060
I bought mine, I bought an
apartment at the peak of this shift.

1420
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:31,090
I bet it's not even worth two thirds of
what the fuck I paid for it and now it's

1421
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:35,780
all coming down. That's all I'm
saying. I think that's what I'm saying.

1422
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:38,750
Maybe I'm trying to wear him out of
it because you told so totally fucking

1423
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,080
nailed me to the floor on that
one. All right. You know what?

1424
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:44,780
I can't argue while you guys,
at some point I have to admit,

1425
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:45,890
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking.

1426
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:48,110
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about. I'm goddamn comedian.

1427
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:52,280
I just look at at a guitar and I'm like,
yeah, it sounds good, but you know,

1428
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:55,880
it's fucking kind of scuffed up.
You know,

1429
01:27:55,881 --> 01:28:00,680
you'd think for fucking 50 grand it
wouldn't be so scuffy it's all I'm saying.

1430
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:03,590
I'm speaking of which,
this is the last thing I'm going to say.

1431
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:08,300
And then I got to wrap up this podcast
at 45 minutes is, uh, I went to a,

1432
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:11,300
I took a drive down the street the
other day and I swear to God yesterday,

1433
01:28:11,301 --> 01:28:15,080
Sunday out here in la,
any three miles stretch,

1434
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:19,850
driving over to the highway,
um, I saw 14 open houses.

1435
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:26,330
Um, I've never seen anything like
this in my fucking life. And,

1436
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:30,980
uh, I don't know. And if for
some reason you can also get,

1437
01:28:30,981 --> 01:28:34,730
can somebody explain this to me?
Why there's all these houses for sale.

1438
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:38,390
I understand why all the houses
for sale, I get that. Okay.

1439
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,190
But what I don't understand is why you
can also get a great deal on rent out

1440
01:28:43,191 --> 01:28:47,000
here.
I would think that all those people,

1441
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:49,850
obviously they're leaving their
houses that would cause the rental,

1442
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:54,170
the amount of rental units to go down
because people who are living in houses

1443
01:28:54,171 --> 01:28:59,171
that they air quote owned would then be
now looking to rent and then rents would

1444
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:01,890
be going up.
But it's the reverse out here.

1445
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:06,510
So the only thing I can guess is
that people are leaving Los Angeles.

1446
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:11,820
They just saying fuck it. You know,
I don't know. I don't fucking know.

1447
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,570
Is that, is it like that where you guys
are at? Are there a bunch of open houses?

1448
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:18,240
I mean it did. So this guy told me, uh,

1449
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,880
yesterday was trying to
say that they're out here.

1450
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,400
They're giving you first he fell,
he found a place.

1451
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:27,570
They've given the first month for free.
And you get in a fucking iPod.

1452
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:32,280
And I actually thought like, man, it's
a great deal. I'm going to go do that.

1453
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:33,180
And I'm like,
wait a minute,

1454
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:37,830
it's going to cost me twice that to
fucking pack all my shit up and move.

1455
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:40,680
Why don't I just go buy an
iPod and stay where I'm at?

1456
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:45,900
See that I'm not always a
moron. Right. All right.

1457
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:50,010
This was a really weird podcast.
I understand that. But um,

1458
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:51,840
Oh,
before I,

1459
01:29:51,841 --> 01:29:56,190
before I a step away here from the phone
and get on with my God damn day. Um,

1460
01:29:56,310 --> 01:30:00,300
I want to let you guys know
that the contest winners,
the, uh, the birds are away.

1461
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,660
I send out the DVDs so I don't have to
worry about being called at eight weeks.

1462
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:06,420
I've sent two out of three of them.
One person,

1463
01:30:06,421 --> 01:30:11,010
I'm still waiting for you to email
me back and you know who you are.

1464
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:13,230
You're the guy who drove up
to me when I was in Houston,

1465
01:30:13,231 --> 01:30:18,210
Texas outside the bar freaked me out and
handed your prostate exam manuscript.

1466
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:23,340
I still need your, uh, your address so
I can send you a DVD. All right. And,

1467
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:28,000
uh, and that's basically it. And, uh, what
am I going on this week, this week, uh,

1468
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:30,170
for all you people in Loc Hong delays.

1469
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,900
I am going to be doing a benefit down
at the comedy store tomorrow night,

1470
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:38,910
Tuesday, February, uh, 24th,

1471
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:42,060
I think.
I got the flyer right here on my desk

1472
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:47,490
and when I got here, wait,
no, wait, it's on the 26th.

1473
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,430
See that?
Almost typed the wrong date.

1474
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:53,760
I'm a fuck wait a minute
then I canceled that.

1475
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:57,870
Another gig I could have done
the other gig. All right.

1476
01:30:58,410 --> 01:30:59,670
February 26th,

1477
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,910
I'm going to be at the comedy store
and it's a benefit for world hunger.

1478
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,370
It's going to be me, Kevin
Nealon, Jeff Richards,

1479
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:07,940
and a bunch of other hilarious
fucking people. They're like,

1480
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:10,440
I build myself first there,
the EGOMANIAC than I am.

1481
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:14,070
But when I say Kevin Nealon first, he's
actually famous in his own. That great,

1482
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,520
great. Show the weeds. I just fucking
Bang my head on this. Goddamn,

1483
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:22,410
I got this room in my fucking apartment
where you're supposed to have like,

1484
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:26,550
they have this, this, this
goddamn iron chandelier.

1485
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:31,230
All right. That's hanging from the
ceiling and I don't know what it is.

1486
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:34,920
I'm about five pen and this thing hits
me right in the center of my forehead.

1487
01:31:34,921 --> 01:31:38,700
So it's probably hanging
about five foot eight. I,

1488
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,020
I'm supposed to have a table underneath
it and I'm supposed to sit at either end

1489
01:31:43,021 --> 01:31:47,040
of it, you know, I guess can you
please pass the peas? But I don't,

1490
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:50,910
I use this as a fucking room.
I got my desk up against the wall.

1491
01:31:50,911 --> 01:31:53,310
So now I have this fucking light

1492
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,280
fucking three days.

1493
01:31:56,281 --> 01:32:00,690
I Bang my forehead on it and
have a like super fly snooker.

1494
01:32:01,370 --> 01:32:03,070
Alright. Um, that really hurt.

1495
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:04,990
And it's one of those ones
where you hit your head so high,

1496
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:09,130
hard that like only one of you have
your eyes starts tearing up your teeth.

1497
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:13,660
Fucking slammed together.
Okay. Regrouping. Anyways,

1498
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:16,570
I want to thank everybody for coming
out to my show out in Ogden, Utah.

1499
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:18,250
I know I called you a bunch
of rednecks or whatever,

1500
01:32:18,251 --> 01:32:21,460
but I had a great time out there and I
will definitely be back cause it's an

1501
01:32:21,461 --> 01:32:22,294
awesome club.

1502
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:26,770
Wise guys is a great club and the fans
were great out there and it's only a

1503
01:32:26,771 --> 01:32:30,700
fucking two hour flight.
So that is just game set and match.

1504
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:33,810
I will definitely be there and uh,

1505
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,560
for all you people who don't live
in these areas, um, let's see,

1506
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,970
where the fuck am I going to be coming up?

1507
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,040
The next Gig I have is the end of March.

1508
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:44,650
I'm actually taking a little bit of
time off out here as I'm working on some

1509
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,650
stuff on the La stuff. Um,
I'm going to be at, um,

1511
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:58,840
at the lake shore theater in
Chicago the first Friday in April.

1512
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:02,500
I don't have my laptop
in front of me and um,

1513
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:06,880
I think on April 4th I'm going to
be at the in, in the Trump marina.

1514
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:09,130
It's all on my website.
Okay.

1515
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,590
You probably looking at the dates right
now and I'm fucking everything up.

1516
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:14,320
Columbus, Ohio. I have
coming up Tempe, Arizona.

1517
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,030
Um, and I'm working on a couple of other
things, possibly a San Francisco date, uh,

1518
01:33:20,031 --> 01:33:24,830
one night or on a Monday night I'm working
on doing something like that and uh,

1519
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:27,400
and that's the deal. But I really,
you know, blown away. Seriously.

1520
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:29,650
No more box podcasts.
This is serious bill.
