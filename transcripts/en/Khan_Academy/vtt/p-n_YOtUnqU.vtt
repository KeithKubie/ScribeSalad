00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:02.444
- Vote for me.

00:00:02.444 --> 00:00:05.079
Vote for cute and adorable Grover.

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:06.701
I am pro-ABCs

00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:08.845
and for one, two, threes.

00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:13.151
Plus I promise I have no
skeletons in my closet.

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:15.009
I do not even have one in my body.

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.259
- Hey, Grover, what are you doing?

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.225
- Oh, hello there, Sal Khan.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.153
I am just running for president

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.021
of the United States of America.

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.327
I heard there was an upcoming election,

00:00:23.327 --> 00:00:24.289
so I figured,

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.818
ah, why not?

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:27.056
- Well, that's great, Grover.

00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:27.889
- Yeah!

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:30.083
- Maybe we can help more people vote.

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:31.995
- Oh, that would be terrific.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:36.055
So exactly how many
votes do I need to win?

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.263
- Well, you know about the
electoral college, right?

00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:40.399
- Of course, Sal, baby.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.253
- I know exactly what the electrical--

00:00:43.253 --> 00:00:44.365
- Electoral.

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:46.430
- Electoral college is.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.571
- Great, so why don't
we explain it together

00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:50.140
for those who don't know?

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.249
- Oh, why certainly.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.082
What a brilliant idea.

00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:54.840
- Umm.

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.800
Why don't you start us off?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.043
- Sure.

00:00:59.043 --> 00:01:01.360
In a direct democracy, I as a citizen

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.061
will vote for a candidate.

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:07.331
And whichever candidate
has the most popular votes

00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:11.425
in the country, they
will become president.

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:14.977
But we do not have a direct democracy.

00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:17.645
We have an indirect democracy.

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:20.686
So what happens is, is I vote in my state.

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:22.811
I live in California.

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:26.328
And whichever candidate gets
the most votes in California

00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:30.328
will get all of California's
55 electoral votes.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:33.561
And that's true in most states.

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:36.014
Whoever gets the most votes in that state

00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:38.517
gets all of the votes for that state.

00:01:38.517 --> 00:01:41.402
And that number comes from
the number of Congresspeople

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:42.652
California has.

00:01:43.783 --> 00:01:46.264
- Um, dah, I am not following you.

00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:47.212
- So how can I explain it in a way

00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:48.615
that you might understand?

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:49.540
- Chickens.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.465
(chickens clucking)

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:51.730
I know chickens.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.176
Chickens, they are my biggest demo.

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:55.100
(chickens clucking)

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.125
- OK, chickens.

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.569
So instead of electors,
we'll say chickens.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.729
Instead of the electoral college,
I'll say chicken college.

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.382
- OK, that I can follow.

00:02:03.382 --> 00:02:04.308
- OK.

00:02:04.308 --> 00:02:07.396
The number of chicken votes for each state

00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:10.478
is equal to the number of
Congresspeople for that state.

00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:11.678
- [Grover] In every state?

00:02:11.678 --> 00:02:12.511
(chicken clucks)

00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:13.344
- [Sal] Yes, Grover.

00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:15.974
- From California to the New York island?

00:02:15.974 --> 00:02:19.677
From the redwood forest
to the Gulf Stream waters.

00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:20.602
- Yes.

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:21.954
The 50 states.

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:22.900
(Grover laughs)

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.051
And so there are a total
of 538 chicken votes

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:28.731
in the chicken college.

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.781
For example, Florida has 29 chicken votes.

00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:33.614
(chicken clucks)

00:02:33.614 --> 00:02:36.735
And that's the same as the 29
Congresspeople that they have,

00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:38.937
two senators and 27 representatives.

00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:41.156
- [Grover] Oh, hello there, chickens.

00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:42.081
(chickens clucking)

00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:45.761
OK, then, so how do I, candidate Grover,

00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:47.229
win the presidency?

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:51.178
- Well, since there are
538 chicken votes in total,

00:02:51.178 --> 00:02:53.344
you just have to get
more than half of those.

00:02:53.344 --> 00:02:54.561
- More than half.

00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:55.870
Hmm, let me see here.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.523
(trumpets play line from
"Stars and Stripes Forever")

00:02:57.523 --> 00:02:59.517
One, carry the two, divided by eight.

00:02:59.517 --> 00:03:01.363
- Grover, we, we know the actual number.

00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:04.528
You just have to get at
least 270 chicken votes

00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:05.635
in the chicken college.

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:07.302
- Just 270 chickens?

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:10.867
I could do that.

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:12.849
300 chickens just crossed
the road to hear me

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:13.882
speak at the rally.

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:14.715
(chickens clucking)
- Oh, great,

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:15.585
do you have your speech?

00:03:15.585 --> 00:03:18.169
- Oh, yeah, it's just right here, yeah.

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:19.678
Where did I put it, it?

00:03:19.678 --> 00:03:22.237
Ah, I'll just wing it.

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:23.284
Bye, Sal.

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:24.451
- Bye, Grover.

00:03:25.563 --> 00:03:27.253
Now get out there and vote.

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:28.870
(chickens cluck)

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.037
(violins play "Hail to the Chief")
