00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.814
Blood transfusions have been
around since the 1700s.

00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:25.940
But for the first 200 years or
so, they were pretty risky,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.210
and more often than not,
ended up killing

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.300
rather curing the patient.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.110
That all changed in
1901 with the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.880
discovery of blood groups--

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.326
an inherent, inherited
characteristic of blood.

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:42.190
Nicole Thornton from the NHS
Blood and Transplant is here

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.083
to tell me more, while
I do my bit

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:45.740
donating my half an armful.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:54.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.610
So where does my blood
group come from?

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.790
So your blood group is
determined by the genes that

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.760
you inherit from your
mother and father.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.510
And when we're talking about
the ABO blood group system,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.250
there are four main blood types,
which is what most

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.980
people call them.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.000
We call them phenotypes.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.500
And we have group A, group
B, group O, and group AB.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.090
The genetic basis of the ABO
blood group system is the ABO

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.780
gene, which is located
on chromosome 9.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.700
And you will inherit a copy from
both your mum, and one

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.720
from your dad.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.630
And depending on the version of
that gene that you inherit

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.190
from your parents, this will
then determine what

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.440
your blood type is.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.180
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.190
So what is a blood group?

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.970
Essentially, a blood group is
determined by the antigens

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.890
that are present on our red
cells, and the ability to be

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.160
able to detect those antigens.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.590
And an antigen is basically a
structure on your red cells,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.860
and it can be a protein
or a carbohydrate.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.400
A group A person has A antigen
on their cells.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.350
A group B person has B antigen
on their cells.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.300
An AB person has both antigens,
and a group O person

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.220
doesn't have any.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.100
When somebody has the antigen,
they don't have the antibody

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.320
to that antigen.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.710
So if they are lacking the
antigen, their body has

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.290
naturally-occurring antibodies
that are against the antigen

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.360
that they lack.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.610
So if you were to receive blood
of the wrong type, your

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.264
body would attack the
foreign antigen.

00:02:37.264 --> 00:02:39.510
And so I'm group O. What
does that mean?

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.350
So, because you're group O, that
means that you're a very,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.400
very useful donor because you
don't have any A or B antigen

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.470
on your cells, which means your
cells can go to anyone

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.826
else of any blood type.

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:57.080
So lots of people can
have my blood.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.460
And what about me?

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.770
What can I have if I needed
a blood transfusion?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.450
Unfortunately, it means that you
can only receive group O,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.480
because you have anti-A and
anti-B in your plasma.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.260
So if you were to receive any
cells that had that antigen on

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.210
them, your body would
attack them.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:21.860
 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.250
In the laboratory that I work
in-- it's the International

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.380
Blood Group Reference
Laboratory--

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.360
we investigate rare
blood groups.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.220
So not just the ABO system,
because there are many other

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.420
blood group systems.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.960
There's actually currently
34 blood group systems.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.790
And that encompasses around
about 300 antigens.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.670
We're discovering new
ones all the time.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.410
And also, there are some
antigens that aren't assigned

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.750
to a gene yet.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.400
We call them the orphans.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.900
And we're always researching and
trying to find the genetic

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.910
background to some of
these antigens.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:07.070
So we investigate rare mutations
that then give rise

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.580
to the lack of antigens that
most people may have.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.390
And once again, if you don't
have the antigen, you can then

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.925
possibly make the antibody
to that antigen.

00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:20.360
It can make transfusion very
difficult, or finding

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.610
compatible blood
very difficult.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.286
 

00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:28.178
So, as you've heard, there are
loads of different types of

00:04:28.178 --> 00:04:28.620
blood groups.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.170
Not just ABO, but many
more besides.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.485
That's why it's so important
that we get as many people

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:37.050
donating as possible, from a
wide variety of backgrounds.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.670
I've done my bit.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.170
I'm off to get my cup of tea.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:05:19.761
