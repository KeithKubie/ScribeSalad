00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.840
In this video I will prove
to you that the limit as

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:15.290
x approaches 0 of sine of
x over x is equal to 1.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.530
But before I do that, before I
break into trigonometry, I'm

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.650
going to go over another
aspect of limits.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.140
And that's the squeeze theorem.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.200
Because once you understand
what the squeeze theorem is,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.150
we can use the squeeze
theorem to prove this.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.510
It's actually a pretty involved
explanation, but I think you'll

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.160
find it pretty neat and
satisfying if you get it.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.220
If you don't get it, maybe you
just want to memorize this.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.580
Because that's a very useful
limit to know later on when

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.680
we take the derivatives
of trig functions.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.240
So what's the squeeze theorem?

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.040
The squeeze theorem is
my favorite theorem in

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.790
mathematics, possibly because
it has the word squeeze in it.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.560
Squeeze theorem.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.310
And when you read it in a
calculus book it looks

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.740
all complicated.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.580
I don't know when you read
it, in a calculus book or

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.500
in a precalculus book.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.080
It looks all complicated,
but what it's saying is

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.440
frankly pretty obvious.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.410
Let me give you an example.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:16.710
If I told you that I
always-- so Sal always

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.150
eats more than Umama.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.650
Umama is my wife.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.670
If I told you that this
is true, Sal always

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.370
eats more than Umama.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:42.990
And I were also to say that Sal
always eats less than-- I don't

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.190
know, let me make up a
fictional character--

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.835
than Bill.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.020
So on any given day-- let's
say this is in a given day.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.120
Sal always eats more than Umama
in any given day, and Sal

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.600
always eats less than
Bill on any given day.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:15.360
Now if I were tell you that on
Tuesday Umama ate 300 calories

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.840
and on Tuesday Bill
ate 300 calories.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.820
So my question to you is, how
many calories did Sal eat,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.150
or did I eat, on Tuesday?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.380
Well I always eat more than
Umama-- well, more than or

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.300
equal to Umama-- and I always
eat less than or equal to Bill.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.350
So then on Tuesday, I must
have eaten 300 calories.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.950
So this is the gist of the
squeeze theorem, and I'll do

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.940
a little bit more formally.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.710
But it's essentially saying, if
I'm always greater than one

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.190
thing and I'm always less than
another thing and at some point

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.560
those two things are equal,
well then I must be equal

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.120
to whatever those two
things are equal to.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.080
I've kind of been squeezed
in between them.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.600
I'm always in between Umama and
Bill, and if they're at the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.220
exact same point on
Tuesday, then I must be at

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.000
that point as well.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.360
Or at least I must approach it.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.290
So let me write it
in math terms.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.730
So all it says is that, over
some domain, if I say that,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.300
let's say that g of x is less
than or equal to f of x, which

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.310
is less than or equal to
h of x over some domain.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:38.720
And we also know that the limit
of g of x as x approaches a is

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.070
equal to some limit, capital L,
and we also know that the limit

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.140
as x approaches a of h of x
also equals L, then the squeeze

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.200
theorem tells us-- and I'm not
going to prove that right

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.540
here, but it's good to just
understand what the squeeze

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.700
theorem is-- the squeeze
theorem tells us then the limit

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.770
as x approaches a of f of x
must also be equal to L.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.230
And this is the same thing.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.090
This is example where f of x,
this could be how much Sal eats

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.410
in a day, this could be how
much Umama eats in a

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.330
day, this is Bill.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.980
So I always eat more than
Umama or less than Bill.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.190
And then on Tuesday, you could
say a is Tuesday, if Umama had

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.650
300 calories and Bill had 300
calories, then I also had

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.480
to eat 300 calories.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.350
Let me let me graph
that for you.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.470
Let me graph that, and I'll
do it in a different color.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.790
Squeeze theorem.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.050
Squeeze theorem.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.942
OK, so let's draw the
point a comma L.

00:04:51.942 --> 00:04:53.980
The point a comma L.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.840
Let's say this is a, that's
the point that we care

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.900
about. a, and this is L.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.770
And we know, g of x, that's
the lower function, right?

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.540
So let's say that this
green thing right

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.540
here, this is g of x.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.030
So this is my g of x.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.110
And we know that as g of x
approaches-- so the g of x

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.120
could look something
like that, right?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.910
And we know that the limit
as x approaches a of

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.510
g of x is equal to L.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.590
So that's right there.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.860
So this is g of x.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.510
That's g of x.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.590
Let me do h of x in
a different color.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.570
So now h of x could look
something like this.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.740
Like that.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.870
So that's h of x.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.970
And we also know that the limit
as x approaches a of h of x --

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.610
let's see, this is the
function of x axis.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.630
So you can call it h of
x, g of x, or f of x.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.350
That's just the dependent
access, and this is the x-axis.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.790
So once again, the limit as x
approaches a of h of x, well

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.570
at that point right there,
h of a is equal to L.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.965
Or at least the limit
is equal to that.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.530
And none of these functions
actually have to even be

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.210
defined at a, as long as these
limits, this limit exists

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.110
and this limit exists.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.790
And that's also an important
thing to keep in mind.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.730
So what does this tell us?
f of x is always greater

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:24.860
than this green function.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.350
It's always less
than h of x, right?

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.910
So any f of x I draw,
it would have to be in

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.080
between those two, right?

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.800
So no matter how I draw it, if
I were to draw a function,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.600
it's bounded by those two
functions just by definition.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.500
So it has to go
through that point.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.910
Or at least it has to
approach that point.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.060
Maybe it's not defined at that
point, but the limit as we

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.950
approach a of f of x also
has to be at point L.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.580
And maybe f of x doesn't have
to be defined right there, but

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.940
the limit as we approach
it is going to be L.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.920
And hopefully that makes a
little bit of sense, and

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.250
hopefully my calories
example made a little

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.820
bit of sense to you.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.970
So let's keep that in
the back of our mind,

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.860
the squeeze theorem.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:11.970
And now we will use that to
prove that the limit as x

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.310
approaches 0 of sine of
x over x is equal to 1.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.940
And I want to do that,
one, because this is

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:18.990
a super useful limit.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.600
And then the other thing is,
sometimes you learn the squeeze

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.770
theorem, you're like, oh, well
that's obvious but

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.890
when is it useful?

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.090
And we'll see.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.520
Actually I'm going to do it in
the next video, since we're

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.590
already pushing 8 minutes.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.340
But we'll see in the next video
that the squeeze theorem is

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.500
tremendously useful when
we're trying to prove this.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.080
I will see you in
the next video.
