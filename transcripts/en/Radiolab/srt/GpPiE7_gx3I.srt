1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,180
You're listening to radio [inaudible].

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,310
This is radiolab and I am Robert Krulwich
and let's begin today with something

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:12,780
deceptively familiar. Fireflies are
something that we have all of those kids,

4
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:14,130
right? Catching them in the backyard,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,550
putting them in in a jar and watching
them glow so we don't tend to think of

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,870
them as anything. All that mysterious.
Well, they do one thing very nicely,

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:26,370
which is flash on and off.
That's how fireflies do flash,

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,440
but what interests Steve Strogatz,

9
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:32,070
a mathematician at Cornell University is
that there are places in the world and

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,490
not here, but in in Southeast
Asia, in Malaysia or Thailand,

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,730
where fireflies don't just flash
randomly like we're used to.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,040
They somehow flashed together.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,120
There are enormous congregations of
fireflies along riverbanks. How many,

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,070
it could be tens of thousands of tree
after tree extending for literally miles

15
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:50,970
along the rivers,

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,470
all flashing in sync like a Christmas
tree rows and rows of Christmas trees all

17
00:00:55,471 --> 00:01:00,360
wired together going off and it's one of
the most hypnotic and and spellbinding

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,740
spectacles in nature because you have to
keep in mind, it is absolutely silent.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,100
We picture it. There's
a riverbank in Thailand,

20
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:12,390
in the remote part of the jungle. You're
in a canoe slipping down the river.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,770
There's no sound of anything,
maybe the occasional, you know,

22
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:20,000
exotic jungle bird or something and
you're looking and you just see route

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,510
with thousands of lights on
and then off, all in sync.

24
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:36,890
[inaudible]

25
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,890
imagine all the cheese as far as you
can see are all brilliantly lit and then

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,750
totally dark, brilliantly
lit, total darkness,

27
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,770
all of them in sync. Yeah, and no
Wessler had ever seen this site.

28
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:53,960
There was folklore,
there's stories about it,

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,430
but nobody had gone in and photographed
and captured samples. Well,

30
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,720
not until 1965 and this was
done by John Bark. John Bark,

31
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,160
the you guy, one of the great
researchers on his other records.

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,340
I'm 92 buck and his wife Elizabeth mass
went to Thailand and captured bags full

33
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:19,500
of mail. Firefly catched them,
shaking them for anxious,

34
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,750
fight-flight shouldn't rain down and
brought them back to their hotel room and

35
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:25,250
we turned off the lights.

36
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,710
We turned them loose and saw that the
fireflies flittered around on the walls

37
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:35,711
and ceiling flew back and forth flashing
random Elizabeth layer on the floor of

38
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,150
the room. I was just tired.

39
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,750
John stayed away and he was the one who
saw within a few minutes little groups

40
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:50,471
do o's and trios formed and after a while
fourth one would join in a closer and

41
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,520
closer together and then
finally they were synchronized.

42
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,950
The whole room was blinking in perfect
harmony. He was excited. The next they

43
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,500
told me outlet.

44
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,440
20 years later John Buck is still asking
this question, oh, what is going on?

45
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,110
Because no one knows. There
are literally 10 theories.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,890
What seems to be clear says Steve is
there is no one firefly that makes it all

47
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:18,220
happen. It just happens on its own order,

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
materializes out of nothing.

49
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,090
And that hasn't puzzled how can order
come out of out of disorder and this is

50
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,420
what the creation has loved to talk about
and it's because they don't understand

51
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,510
and neither do we this, this is
the big, big mystery of science.

52
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,660
I think bigger than black holes are
bigger than superstrings. I mean,

53
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,200
science has had hundreds of years of
success since the time of Galileo and

54
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:41,140
Newton from reductionism, from
looking at the smallest parts,

55
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,990
whether they're jeans or
Adam's, whatever. That's great.

56
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:47,140
We need to understand the
individuals, but that's not enough.

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,130
Obviously we're not just talking about
fireflies anymore. Today on radio lab,

58
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:56,131
we will do as Steve Urges and step away
from the individual to find mystery,

59
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,840
beauty and order in the
group, not fireflies.

60
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,070
They are groups of city dwellers, groups
of Internet, surfers, stock traders,

61
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,650
even the group of neurons
that are inside your head.

62
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,910
This is a science called
emergence. So let's begin.

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,120
In the beginning, God created [inaudible],

64
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,170
heaven and earth. That's the King
James Bible. That's how it starts.

65
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,930
The ultimate expression of the boss,

66
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:26,620
God telling everything
else what to be, how to be.

67
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,020
It's a top down kind board.

68
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,770
What about midway through the
Bible contains another passage,

69
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,050
more of a bottom up
thing from King Solomon,

70
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,990
the wisest of the kings where
he says, look to the ants,

71
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,010
consider her ways and be wise. Nice.

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,100
So we start in California, they're good.

73
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,850
The office of an ant expert.
Hi, I'm Deborah Gordon,

74
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,580
professor of biology at Stanford.

75
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,250
Deborah Gordon has been studying
ants for over two decades.

76
00:04:56,251 --> 00:05:00,360
It's because such mindless individuals
collectively can do so much that I'm

77
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:03,450
interested in is, you might say
she's the reigning aunt queen,

78
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,670
but as long as you bring up the raining
part. When we went there, I thought,

79
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,050
well, let's what's, she
has a lot of answers,

80
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,950
but I wanted to see what the boss and
so she led us to our lab and going into

81
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:15,000
the secret and place

82
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,600
where we found to our disappointment that
she keeps the ants and big Tupperware

83
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:22,410
container.

84
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,410
This is the foraging area of a colony
that's stuck living in the lab instead of

85
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:33,321
out in the desert where it would probably
rather be in a big plastic box with

86
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:36,930
plastic around it and build bits
of sand on it. That's right.

87
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:40,980
And so I'm going to take off the top.
Maybe we can see the queen better,

88
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,120
but I'm like this. I never seen it
before. When I'm looking for the clean,

89
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,460
when I'm,

90
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,580
am I looking for the ant in the center
of the biggest crunch of other hand?

91
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,030
Well, usually there are a
lot of other ants around her.

92
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:52,950
She doesn't look much
different, but she's bigger.

93
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,470
Does the ants know that she's special?

94
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,920
I think the ants know that she's the queen

95
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,560
and does it. What does that well, the
Queen and the way we think about quicks.

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,910
Yeah. I mean they do they know that as
mommy or not even? I don't think so. No.

97
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,720
Uh,

98
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,540
I don't think they know anybody. Has
Anybody. And remember she's not in charge.

99
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,020
He's not telling anybody what to do.
Wait a second, wait a second. Yeah.

100
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,700
This is different than
I had actually imagined.

101
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,470
I thought that Queens gave commit,
like, you know, an Alice in wonderland,

102
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,700
what bare hand kind of thing.

103
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,180
Ah, she says no, she's just a big hand
that lays the eggs. That's it. That's it.

104
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,410
Every year there's a meeting flight
and all of the colonies send out their

105
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:48,700
virgin queens who have wings and males
who also have wings and they all go to

106
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:53,380
one place and they gather and they mate
and the newly made it queens fly off and

107
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:57,030
start new colonies. That's how it
starts. Queen scatter make babies,

108
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,720
but that's all they do. They're
just the colonies, ovaries.

109
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,520
They don't sit on a throne and decree
anything nor are their generals or even

110
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:08,430
bosses. The colony somehow
gets by without any of that,

111
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,380
which is especially hard to believe when
you watch these ants who tell us what's

112
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:16,530
happening here. This is, that's
an anchoring, a dead ant.

113
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,650
I remember there was this one little EDBD
and carrying a big fat dead and on her

114
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,510
back and look at this.
She seems to be gradually,

115
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:28,680
although with some difficulty
moving towards my elbow.

116
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,930
Then she dropped it. Then
she picked it up again.

117
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,120
Then she dropped it maybe then up again.

118
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,710
Now she's training in the other direction.

119
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,810
All the while carrying this heavy corpse.

120
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,880
She may like it back and forth like
that for hours sometimes can lead some

121
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,020
objects we'll get in there that they
can't all carry and they can spend months

122
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,240
tagging it one way and
taking it the other way.

123
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,350
Month tugging back and forth on either
side of one seed. It wasn't a seed,

124
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:56,460
it was a little twig. One of them is
thinking this way and I was thinking,

125
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,120
oh this way, like this way, this
way. And that's all that's going on.

126
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,790
Well I don't know what they're
thinking. Right. I know,

127
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,791
I know one of them is pulling one way and
because the stick feels like something

128
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:11,570
that needs to be pulled and the other
also feels the stick needs to be pulled

129
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:15,410
and they just pull. It
must be frustrating.

130
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,100
Watching these mindless exchanges
is, it can be very frustrating.

131
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,230
I don't have very much
empathy for ads there. So, um,

132
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,070
the more you watch the ads,
the more weird it seems,

133
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:29,750
the way they never get discouraged.

134
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,830
They don't care if they do something well.

135
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,130
Um, it's very alien. I
think she hates them.

136
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,760
Not really. Cause here's the thing,
you can make an argument that

137
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,290
so the most successful
species on the planet,

138
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,030
they thrive in places that are
too hot for us, too dry for us,

139
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,250
even too cold for us. They outnumber
us by a factor, many thousand

140
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,090
in pure evolutionary math
terms. They're winning,

141
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,350
which intrigues her and also forces
her to think about them differently.

142
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,950
I think about what the colony is doing
and then I tried to think how it would

143
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:13,790
work. If you do it like that,
she says answer actually amazing,

144
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,920
but you have to ignore the
individual individually.

145
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:19,550
They're totally incompetent and
keep your focus big as colonies.

146
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:22,190
They do great things. It's
kind of a constant whiplash.

147
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,120
You Zoom in stupid to ansible, a
twig back and forth for months.

148
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,840
You zoom out smart. I'm
impressed that it works at all.

149
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,000
It's somewhere between the
zooming in and zooming out.

150
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,910
Bizarre intelligence appears
almost like a phantom.

151
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,810
I think the most intelligent thing I've
ever seen harvester ants do is to build

152
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:42,440
a little turret around
the opening of the nest,

153
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,480
just as the summer months tunes
are gathering. And then when it,

154
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,390
it rains and floods, it's raised
up so that the water doesn't go in.

155
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,500
So when I see the first few ants coming
out with their little twigs and I look

156
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:59,010
up in the sky and I see a few clouds in
the distance and I realized that there's

157
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:02,580
some link between the change in the
barometric pressure or something and it

158
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,900
really is a very tidy,
um, and effective little

159
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,560
construction. And what else do aunts
do? Let me just count them for you.

160
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,170
Shall I? [inaudible] farm.

161
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,970
They have livestock ants make
garden, ants organize wars,

162
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,540
generals and soldiers and things
take slaves. There's young,

163
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,700
it's tunnel involved. Incredibly good
and sophisticated climate controls.

164
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,550
You can start from two opposite directions
and meet precisely midway answer

165
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,500
engineer, hence orchestrate massive public
work projects that put FDRs new deal.

166
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,290
I'm talking about Tennessee Valley
Authority from your home state.

167
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,780
That's nothing compared
to what ants could.

168
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,230
Hello, which raises the question
at the center of this program,

169
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:55,231
which is how do so many very stupid
creatures with no boss add up to be so

170
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,374
smart.

171
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,580
The scientist who first really tackled
this idea with some success in the mid

172
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:05,540
1950s was e o Wilson from Harvard
University cause he made one of the great

173
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,030
discoveries in all of the
science of communication.

174
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,940
Certainly we know that creatures
make noises to each other,

175
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,520
sometimes touch each other,
but he figured out pheromones.

176
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,710
Pheromones are the key to

177
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,920
understand that communication of the
vast majority of animals species.

178
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,680
We didn't know it then. It's a neat story.

179
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,650
He told me that a few years back up
at 92nd street y in New York City.

180
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,150
One day I shut out,

181
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,630
I was culturing fire ranch then in
the laboratory at Harvard and I said,

182
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,920
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

183
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,210
And the way I did it was to, uh,

184
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,010
dissect these tiny, tiny ass. Very
difficult to do. But I just selected them.

185
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,020
And under magnification I can
see that it's sticking out,

186
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,050
sting and dragging the Stinger.
Something's coming out of that sting,

187
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,670
kind of like a fountain pen or somethings
through. Bit like that. Yeah. Yeah.

188
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,960
So, uh, I proceed to,
um, believe me, folks,

189
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,170
this was the way science goes. I
mean, it really is simple minded.

190
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,310
It's only later when you're doing
the technical paper, you know,

191
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,640
when you're producing the mathematical
models and that it looks tough.

192
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,970
It's really, this is the way
you're thinking when you're
doing shots. So I said,

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm going to find out what
the organs are inside this.

194
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:21,001
And so what I did was
to do anatomy and then,

195
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:21,671
uh, you know,

196
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:25,390
just the sect that I knew approximately
what the different glands were in

197
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:30,370
showing you snipped off the part where
the glands, where you suited or well,

198
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,320
you just distract open. Oh, you opened
it. Right. You know, and, and, uh, and,

199
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:39,321
and just the way you would any animal
alerts exceedingly difficult when it's

200
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:43,690
about the size of a great assault.
That's the tough part. But anyway,

201
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,480
I took out the various
organs one after the other,

202
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:50,350
and I made a preparation and
I made an artificial trail,

203
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,320
smeared out one organ after
another. No effect. Oh,

204
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,710
so they're ants over here and
you're drawing lines. Oh, gut stuff.

205
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,340
I guess basically what it is,
Yo Justin or different origins.

206
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:08,341
I've watched each one in churn and then
smeared it out and finally I came to a

207
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:12,160
little finger shaped organ,
which we didn't know.

208
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:14,950
The function of it is just the tiny
little thing tucked down there and I

209
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,180
mirrored that out and
incredible. It wasn't,

210
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:21,490
I didn't have to tell
them to follow that trail.

211
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:24,100
They exploded out of the nest
running along that thing.

212
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,870
I started playing around with this. It
was so effective for demonstrations.

213
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:30,040
I would write my name.

214
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,670
That's probably a column of 102 hundred
three a hundred answers would come

215
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:39,970
pouring out back and forth and they'd
actually write my name and I am

216
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,860
so that was the first clues smell.

217
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,170
[inaudible] ants may not
take orders from above,

218
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,710
but they can exchange information. See
this one with the abdomen bend under?

219
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,810
Yeah. That one is somehow reacted to us.

220
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,080
Oh really strange smells that we're
making back a debit. Go into lab.

221
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:06,450
As we watched the colony, one
of the aunts even stopped.

222
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:10,560
What it was doing to smell us when
they waved their antennae in the air.

223
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:15,561
They're looking around because their
antennae or their periscopes sounds simple

224
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:21,090
enough. Ants follow scent
trails sorta like dogs.

225
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,180
But if you stare at them long enough,

226
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,540
you will see that when these
ants get together, lots of them.

227
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,140
The simple sniffing talents they have
add up to solve pretty amazing problems.

228
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,280
Here's a forage or coming back. What's
it in her mouth? It's a seed like this.

229
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:41,340
Suppose there are a bunch of forage or
ans in one part of town and something

230
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:44,070
good to eat and another part of
town, like if there's a picnic,

231
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,980
how does the colony get
more ants to your picnic?

232
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,100
They're blind and virtually
brainless. So how do they do it?

233
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,340
That's the question. How
do they do it? Hello,

234
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,430
I'm ABCDF t with that question in mind.

235
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:58,720
We visited up Princeton biologists
in Kusan. This one here? Yeah.

236
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,640
What is this note?

237
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,290
You pops open his laptop to show
us a beautiful map he's made.

238
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,550
So here on the on the screen you can see
the individual paths coded by color and

239
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:08,384
ant map.

240
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,870
It's as if you gave a few hundred ants
a paintbrush and then let them wander

241
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,380
over on canvas on the
computer has software which
tracks the motion of each of

242
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,830
these individuals. The resulting
picture is vintage Jackson Pollock,

243
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,060
lots and lots and lots of
layers of squiggly lines so
you can put the food down

244
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,050
in here. For example,

245
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,380
I've got droplets of sugar water here
that the ants love for the feed on the end

246
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,900
points to a splotch it white
in the upper right hand corner,

247
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,040
then flips in the next image. Jumping
forward in time and what what?

248
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,690
What I've actually shown with this
is that the ants have begun forming a

249
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:43,691
chemical trail and you can actually
show how they've laid a trail to this,

250
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:44,930
this, this good food source.

251
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,160
This is the type of image that makes
you want to stare at static on your TV

252
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:53,180
screen and look for patterns.
It's downright eerie. One Minute,

253
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:57,830
the screen is a mass chaos of squiggles
overlapping no patterns at all.

254
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,170
The next is this by magic,

255
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:04,370
the squiggles of snapped together to form
a vein leading directly to the sugar.

256
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,290
It happens every time. And what's weirder
says Ian is every time it happens,

257
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,660
it happens by accident error. Really.

258
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:14,570
I mean this is really what we're talking
about is these ants probably just made

259
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:19,180
a mistake. Error is
architecture. Imagine 500 answer,

260
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,190
exploring a space number 411 finds the
sugar completely by accident except it's

261
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:31,280
not an accident because the ant has left
a scent trail and there their 500 other

262
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,730
and so surely one other will come
along and make the same mistake.

263
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,450
Suddenly you've got two chemical trails
on top of each other, doubly hot,

264
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,380
attracting a third, which makes the
trail AAA hot, attracting five more,

265
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:46,310
which makes it octopussy hot and soon
what you've got as a blazing pheromone

266
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:48,010
highway of bumper to bumper and

267
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,120
[inaudible]

268
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,040
not unlike mid town during rush hour.

269
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,950
Cool. [inaudible]

270
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,810
when I first saw the ants, uh, in person,

271
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,710
one of the first thoughts I had was
this looks like a small little city.

272
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,690
Steven Johnson noticed this connection
and wrote about it in a book called

273
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:12,100
emergence, the connected lives of
ants, brains, cities and software.

274
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,470
A lot of what the ants do is positive
feedback loops where they lay down a kind

275
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,980
of fair amount of chemical signal to
recruit other ants to do something that

276
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:24,510
they're working on and those ants
lay down more of the same signal can.

277
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,790
So very quickly you can get a whole bunch
of ants working on a single problem.

278
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,270
That's the similar effect that you get
in a way that city neighborhoods warrant

279
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,430
accidents that always happen.

280
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,600
That is how ants find food and he
says how cities find their shape.

281
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,130
It gets to what I sent
was called the swirl

282
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,820
that comes with this

283
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,170
gun.

284
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,740
When you're walking down the sidewalk
going from point x to point why you're

285
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,860
gone from subway back to your house
and you pass by completely accidentally

286
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,050
point Z, which is a new
boutique or new restaurant,

287
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,030
something that catches
your eye and you swerve.

288
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,370
You see this thing you've never
seen before and you're like, hey,

289
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,204
I want to check that out.

290
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,980
The whole business in a sense of sidewalks
and thriving urban centers revolves

291
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:09,981
around the idea that somebody's coming
to see boutique a is going to be swerving

292
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:13,740
into Boutique B or Boutique c just because
they're near each other and because

293
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:14,640
they're kind of window shopping.

294
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,340
What a neat idea. Yeah. Right?
You wake up thinking, well,

295
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:23,460
here's what I'm going to do in a city.
I'm going to walk my daughter to school.

296
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,730
I'm going to go to the news stand and
buy a paper, and then on your way,

297
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,930
something that you didn't expect
something new catches your eye,

298
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,830
but goannas I will always want that in
Sally. That's the Bagonia she wants,

299
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,770
right, so you swerve, which
begins as an accident,

300
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,940
but all these kind of local unplanned
decisions all add up into this larger

301
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,720
macro unit that does have
a distinct personality and
that crucially can last for

302
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,680
hundreds of years,

303
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,110
which does make you wonder because
the personalities of cities,

304
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:52,710
we know about that. How come there are
distinct neighborhoods for rich people?

305
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,830
There are neighborhoods in
some cities for artists, slums.

306
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,110
Consider a 28th street in [inaudible]

307
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,940
today in the flower market
we have hydrangeas and uh,

308
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,660
some flowers from Florida. How many
flowers? Doors are on this block?

309
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,840
If I had to guess, I'd
probably say about 25.

310
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,290
There are flower stores all around. It's
like a Walmart for flowers in a week.

311
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,460
Okay. How did this begin?

312
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,020
Let's propose that someone for some
reason came here and set up a flower shop,

313
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,030
which picked up a few customers.

314
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,530
So then a second flower merchant
and she's getting the traffic.

315
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:31,470
Maybe if I open a store like
a heady is on the block,

316
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,620
maybe I'll be able to pull
some people away from him,

317
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,830
had him swerve into my store.
Location, location, location,

318
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,110
and let's say that gets more traffic.
You gotta be with the traffic,

319
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,270
so then you get third
store. Matt works too.

320
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,670
You could sell pencils that look
like ducks and nothing else.

321
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:46,200
And if you're writing them all
time square, you know what?

322
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,040
You'll probably make money. That's
the key. Traffic is everything.

323
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,600
Once a neighborhood becomes the place
for duck shaped pencils or the place for

324
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:59,070
flowers, what began as an accident
then becomes a neighborhood. So much.

325
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:02,850
So if I blindfolded a flower salesman
and dropped him onto a hundred blocks,

326
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:06,870
would he know which one was 28th
street? Oh absolutely. Yeah. Shit. Yeah,

327
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:11,520
of course. Why I just, I now
my street man, I this smell,

328
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:14,130
the flower highest says you smell the
highest as soon as you walk in there.

329
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,660
I mean of course I would sound at
the hen shrugs reef was screaming,

330
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:19,860
yelling at me, please.

331
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,430
It's okay. Cause I'm mystical concept.

332
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:29,310
I really do think of it when you think
about a neighborhood in a great city,

333
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,270
whether it's in New York and the West
village or Paris in the Latin quarter of

334
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:37,650
America, right? You know, ask the question
like who created this neighborhood,

335
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,420
right? Who created things we
love about this neighborhood?

336
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,890
Who creates that kind of life force?

337
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,560
And the answer is everybody
and nobody at the same time.

338
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,973
[inaudible]

339
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,650
so that brings us again to the
central mystery of this hour.

340
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,840
We're studying here the
science of emergence,

341
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:57,290
which asks where does the
organization come from?

342
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,680
How do you get a neighborhood,
a district or a city?

343
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,220
How do you get the complexity of an ant
colony if there's no leader and everyone

344
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,200
in town is stupid? Steve,

345
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,320
Steve Johnson proposes that a city is
the emergent quality of the swerve to

346
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,520
series of accidents, you know
is always going to happen.

347
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:17,010
You multiply the swerves
and you get a neighborhood.

348
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,470
Deborah Gordon is arguing that if you
look very closely at the aunts and you

349
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:24,260
watch them smelling and
you multiply their smells,

350
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,580
then you get to the complexity of any
ad colony but buried in the system.

351
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:33,500
Both of them say is a rule, a sense of
direction, but how do you see that rule?

352
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,860
That's the wrong thing. Question,
and that's what's so uncomfortable.

353
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,170
The instructions aren't anywhere.

354
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,410
The instructions come out of the way
that the colony lives and behaves.

355
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,690
It is hard. If you had
one aunt on its own,

356
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:55,691
you couldn't take it apart and find the
substance that would make it behave in a

357
00:21:56,661 --> 00:22:01,500
certain way. But you see how hard
that is? Yes, I want to know.

358
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:04,860
So when you asked her where
we're gonna find the rule. Yeah.

359
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,080
So when that added any
individually as you see it,

360
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:10,140
when all the ants get together,
but where is it? Well,

361
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,830
where is the thought in your
brain? Is it in a neuron?

362
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,430
Does each neuron have a
little piece of the thought?

363
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,280
If you took your neuron out
and lay it on the table,

364
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:24,600
could you see the little tiny bit of
the thought that's in that neuron? No,

365
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,720
it's not in the neuron. It's in the way
the neurons interact with each other.

366
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,150
[inaudible]

367
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,620
think about a syrup painting.

368
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,980
That one where they're all on the banks
of the Cen River. Yep. You're the one,

369
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,340
if you look at it up close,
all you see is dots, right?

370
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,120
You pulled back and the picture emerges
with all the ladies in their parents'

371
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,220
sols. But the question with these systems,

372
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:49,900
the big question is whether there is
a syrup to make the dots to paint the

373
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,440
picture, or if somehow the painting
just materializes on its own.

374
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,090
Uh, well, you know that I have an
opinion about this. It's not a,

375
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,910
it's not a sciencey opinion. Ah,

376
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,670
I think it's not just fascinating that
there are these hidden patterns and

377
00:23:08,211 --> 00:23:09,230
hidden rules.

378
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,710
I think it's just gonna
change the whole tone.

379
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,730
I think it's kind of
holy and I don't have,

380
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,380
there's no scientific evidence because
there's no science behind this.

381
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,280
It's just an instinct.

382
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,940
I think when you look at the way ants
work or the way it's SRAP painting emerges

383
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:27,860
before your eyes, you're
looking at an author.

384
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,370
When you say that, all the air just
gets let out of the balloon. For me,

385
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,010
it's like the magic is gone.

386
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,990
Really? Can I think so?

387
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,650
Let's see what you're left
with then everything that
you see when you wake up in

388
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:45,530
the morning as beautiful and you all
agree that it's beautiful is empty of

389
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:46,364
purpose.

390
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,020
Is that okay with you? Yeah.

391
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,800
In a way it makes it even more
mysterious to be alive in any case,

392
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,550
author or not.

393
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,000
There's really good reason why
these systems would not centralize,

394
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,350
put all their eggs into one basket,
one supreme being, because if they did,

395
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,370
they'd be vulnerable. Case in point,

396
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:09,620
this story from producer
Laura Star Chesky.

397
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,260
I'll walk you over toward
the beehives, not about ants.

398
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,340
So we're sort of in their flight zone,

399
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:20,341
but don't worry bees and we'll
just see if we have any luck here.

400
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,560
She met up recently with a
beekeeper named John Clayton.

401
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,110
It's always hit and miss trying
to find a queen, that's for sure.

402
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,060
She's right there. Get off me. Thank you.

403
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,320
One of the things that beekeepers really
like to do is raise their own queens.

404
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,240
All you need to do is take a frame out
of an existing hive that has egg cells on

405
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:50,241
it and a bunch of worker bees and put it
in its very own box and they'll realize

406
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:55,200
that they don't have a queen and they'll
pull an egg or pull larva and start

407
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:55,621
feeding it.

408
00:24:55,621 --> 00:25:00,300
The Royal Jelly make the peanut shape
Queen Cell and 16 days later you got a

409
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:05,080
brand new queen. Well, one time I uh,

410
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,910
I made a brand new.
Kwame was my first queen.

411
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:11,911
I was probably 17 years old at the time
and I had it out on my back porch and I

412
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:14,350
knew to come. Day three,
she goes out to mate.

413
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,760
So I'm sitting there and here it sure
enough comes to queen out the entrance and

414
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:20,820
she flies off and she takes off and,

415
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,550
and I'm watching and I'm watching the
whole mating process take place and it

416
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:29,190
takes place in flight. She made a in
flight with about 10 drones and uh,

417
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,820
the drones die after mating.

418
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,630
They come crashing to the ground dying
and the queen goes back to the hive.

419
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,220
And while she started coming back to the
hive and then I realized I had a piece

420
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:43,480
of sticky fly tape hanging up on the
back porch and she flew right into it and

421
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:45,850
there's my queen all stuck to the
flight tape like this, you know,

422
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,930
I said there's my first queen and I
killed the poor thing cause there was

423
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,960
nothing I could do to save it, you
know, it was just a horrible story.

424
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:56,200
So it's one of those things, it's
you learn from experience, you know.

425
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,290
But it was a sad moment
because they a a special thing.

426
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,940
Ouch. Just got a chap there.

427
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,300
Thanks to producer Laura Starecheski
and beekeeper, John Clayton

428
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,020
coming up the science of how a trillion
leaderless neurons in your head come

429
