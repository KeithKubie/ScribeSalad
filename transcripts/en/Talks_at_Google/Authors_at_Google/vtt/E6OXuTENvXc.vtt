00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:04.090
ADAM KUCHARSKI: OK.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.673
Thank you.

00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:05.970
It's great to be here.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.080
Thank your for the invitation.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.220
My name's Adam Kucharski.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm a searcher specializing
in the mathematical modeling

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.800
of infectious diseases
and, as well as that,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.682
a writer most recently of this
book about the relationship

00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:19.890
between science and gambling.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.160
Now, on the face
of it, my day job

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.151
couldn't really be further
from casinos and plastic chips

00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:25.900
and playing cards.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.156
But actually, the relationship
between science and gambling

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:30.030
is quite a close one.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.540
The two subjects are
actually very intertwined.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.980
And that's what I want to talk a
bit about today-- a few stories

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.400
and examples of how lonely
people have taken ideas

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.060
from science and math and
used that to take on games

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.940
of chance, also how many
gambling games and betting

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.380
situations have inspired
a lot of the concepts

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.512
and are fundamental
to modern science.

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:55.430
What I want to do is
start with lotteries,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.390
because for me it was
lotteries-- a story

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.980
about lottery,
actually-- that first

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.270
got me interested in the math
of betting several years ago.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.910
Now, I'm sure any of you who've
looked at the lottery or play

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.870
lottery will know it's
incredibly hard to win.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.690
But the way in which we
measure how hard it is to win

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.210
is a fairly recent development.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.140
Although mathematics
goes back millennia,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.369
the ideas behind measuring
probabilities of event

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.410
is something that only
really started to take off

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.340
in the 16th century.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.800
And it was actually a person
called Gerolamo Cardano, who

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.200
was during the Renaissance
in Italy, he was a physician.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.140
He was the first person to
describe the clinical symptoms

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.100
of typhoid, for example.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.950
He was also one the first
to describe games of chance

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.040
mathematically.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.260
And what he did is outline what
we now know as a sample space.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.784
So this possible
space of events.

00:01:41.784 --> 00:01:43.200
And obviously, if
you want to know

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.107
the probability of
an event, you just

00:01:45.107 --> 00:01:46.940
hone down on the
particular one of interest.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.480
So for a lottery, the
UK National Lottery,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.580
you pick six numbers
from a possible 59.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.390
There's just over 45
million possibilities

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.425
there, which obviously gives
you pretty poor odds of winning.

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:00.800
But there's a way
of guaranteeing

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.760
that you can have
a winning ticket,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.840
and that's simply to take
a brute force approach

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.670
and buy out every
single combination.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.450
Now, that might sound
a little bit absurd,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.680
but let's just stick
with it for a moment.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.639
For the UK lottery, each
ticket cost 2 pounds.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.100
That's an outlay of
about 90 million pounds,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.840
if you're desperate
to guarantee that you

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.530
have the winning ticket.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.000
Clearly that's not realistic.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.990
However, not all
lotteries are the same.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.270
And in the 1990s,
the Irish lottery

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.650
had a much smaller sample space.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.640
And in fact, there were about
1.94 combinations of numbers

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.680
that you could pick.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.910
Each ticket was 50 piece.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.480
So actually, it would cost
you under a million pounds

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.430
to buy out every
single combination.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.970
And this is what a
syndicate spotted.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.070
And they thought, well,
this is plausible now.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.150
This is something we could do.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.320
So they got a hold of tons
and tons of blank tickets

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.050
and, by hand, filled
out every single one

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.730
of those possible combinations.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.870
Now, if you're going to spend
a million pounds to essentially

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.720
buy the jackpots, in
most weeks, the jackpot

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.397
is going to be maybe
a few thousand.

00:02:56.397 --> 00:02:57.730
That's a pretty poor investment.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.570
You're spending a million
to buy maybe 400,000 pounds.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.870
But if there's a
rollover, potentially you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.100
come to a situation where you've
got a positive expected value.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.150
You would actually, if you
have all these tickets,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.980
gain a profit.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.440
And that happened in the
May bank holiday in 1992.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.220
The rollover reached
about 2.2 million pounds.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.660
The syndicate put their
lottery strategy into action.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.990
They went around with all
these tickets from location

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.550
to location, going to shops
that maybe would normally

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.600
sell 1,000 tickets and going
in and asking to buy 15,000.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.830
Lottery obviously twigged
what they were doing,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.250
and despite the fact that
it was completely legal,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.060
somewhat frowned upon it
and tried to stop them.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.930
So in the end,
unfortunately, they only

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.160
managed to buy up about 80% of
the combinations of tickets.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.552
Luckily for them, that still
included the winning ticket.

00:03:50.552 --> 00:03:53.010
Unluckily, that week, there
were two other jackpot winners.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.980
So they had to
split this jackpot.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.130
But when you added up all
the lower-tier prizes,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.670
they actually walked away with
a profit of 300,000 pounds.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.211
Now, for me, that
was a great example

00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:04.902
of how you take a pretty
simple mathematical insight,

00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:07.580
a good dose of
audacity and hard work,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.405
and convert it into something
that can be profitable.

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:12.780
Now, in this situation, it
was just a brute force attack.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.071
Essentially they just went
for every single combination

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.970
to get the jackpots.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.560
That's pretty simple
mathematically.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.060
That's not particularly
interesting.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.390
But if you delve down
into lower-tier prizes,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.200
things get a little
more intriguing

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.694
from a mathematical
point of view.

00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:27.110
At the other end
of the scale, say

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.901
you want to guarantee
a lottery that you're

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.162
going to match one number
in a particular draw.

00:04:32.162 --> 00:04:33.870
Obviously all you have
to do in that case

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.400
is just buy out tickets with
all the numbers in sequence.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.770
You don't have to buy many
tickets to make that work.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.910
How about two numbers?

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.640
Well, for the old National
Lottery in the UK,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.541
where you pick six numbers from
a possible combination of 49,

00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:48.040
people working in
combinatorics have

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.370
showed that the
minimal set of tickets

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.555
you need to guarantee
matching two numbers is 19.

00:04:52.555 --> 00:04:56.350
So this is known as lotto
designing in combinatorics.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.860
If you want to
match three numbers,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.090
however, that's
an open question.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.150
Actually, nobody's
worked out what

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.530
the minimal set of
tickets you need

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.920
to guarantee matching three is.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.490
Some people attacked
it numerically.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.830
So they just run through
and crunch through and learn

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.760
possible combinations.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.020
And the lowest of
what I could find,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.200
at least, was somebody who
came up with 163 tickets

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.812
to guarantee matching
three numbers.

00:05:18.812 --> 00:05:20.270
But actually, it's
an open question

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.270
as to whether there's
a lower set out there.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.750
So there's a lot of interesting
math even in lottery,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.390
which on the face of it seems
like a pretty trivial problem

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.330
to work on.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.199
But it's not just
modern mathematicians

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.490
working these kind of problems.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.650
As I said, people like
Cardano, throughout history,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.140
have been interested in it.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.240
And many of the big
figures in maths

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.822
have also worked on
games and gambling.

00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:42.030
This gentleman, for instance.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.180
This is Henri
Poincare, really one

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.140
of the great figures
in around 1900, one

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.265
of the few mathematicians that
the last mathematicians really

00:05:51.265 --> 00:05:52.990
to work in every
field of the subject

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.157
as it was when he was alive.

00:05:54.157 --> 00:05:56.448
And one of the things he was
particularly interested in

00:05:56.448 --> 00:05:57.345
was predictability.

00:05:57.345 --> 00:05:59.680
So this notion of
unexpected events.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.950
And he categorized it by what
he called degrees of ignorance.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.200
For him, unexpected
outcomes were the result

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.450
of ignorance about the causes.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.231
And he classed this three
levels of ignorance.

00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:12.730
He said the first
one is a situation

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.939
where what the rules are.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:14.980
You have the information.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.975
You just need to use elementary
calculation to get the answer.

00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:18.600
So if you do a high
school physics exam,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.266
this is kind of the
situation you're in.

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:21.449
You know what the laws are.

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:22.490
You have the information.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.031
You just need to do
some calculations

00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:26.617
and ideally get
the correct answer.

00:06:26.617 --> 00:06:28.200
The second level of
ignorance Poincare

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.366
said is something where you
know what the rules are,

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:32.460
but you don't have
enough information

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.422
to make an accurate prediction.

00:06:35.422 --> 00:06:36.880
And he used roulette
as an example.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.300
He said, in this situation,
because you got a roulette

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.310
ball going around a
table, a very small change

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.570
in the initial speed of the ball
can have a very large effect

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.260
on the outcome.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.842
Now, this idea
subsequently developed

00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:49.550
into what's known as
sensitive dependence

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.470
on initial conditions.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.030
In the '60s and '70s, became
one of the central components

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.000
of chaos theory, popularly
known as the butterfly effect,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.622
the sense of dependence, the
idea that a very small change

00:07:00.622 --> 00:07:02.080
in a weather system
in one location

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.390
can have a very large
effect somewhere else.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.690
So it's not necessarily
a random system.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.892
It's just that these very small
imperceivable changes early on

00:07:09.892 --> 00:07:10.850
can have large effects.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.700
And then we say,
according to Poincare,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.536
that those are due to chance.

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:16.910
But that wasn't
where he stopped.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.240
There was also this third level
of ignorance he focused on,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.660
and this was a situation where
you don't know the rules.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.480
The rules are so complex
you can't pick them apart.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.160
And in this, all
you can hope to do

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.640
is watch enough
realizations of the system

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.040
and try and gain some insights
into what might be happening.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.620
Now, when mathematicians
and scientists initially

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.170
start tackling roulettes,
they focused on this level.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.050
They didn't treat it
as a physics problem.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.830
They treated it as
one of observation.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.970
Let's look at a lot of
roulette spins and try and look

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.020
for something unusual.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.895
See if there's a bias
in the table, something

00:07:48.895 --> 00:07:51.176
that we can exploit.

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:52.550
This raises the
question, though,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.000
of what do we mean by odd,
what do we mean by a bias.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.290
And actually, while Poincare
was in France thinking

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.050
about roulette
tables, in the UK,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.840
Karl Pearson, the
statistician, was also

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.430
thinking about roulette.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.960
And to him, we can never
really have any sense

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.180
of the true process in nature.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.810
We can only analyze
what we can observe.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.950
And because he wanted to
understand randomness,

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.229
he needed to generate a
phenomenal amount of data,

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:19.520
because this was what he
wanted to hone his methods on.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.430
In fact, he once spent
his summer holiday

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.960
tossing a coin 25,000
times to generate

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.431
a random data set to analyze.

00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:29.930
He was also interested
in roulettes.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.625
Unfortunately for
him, at the time,

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:34.250
the "La Monaco" newspaper would
publish the results of roulette

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.219
spins in Monte Carlo Casinos.

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:38.010
And for Pearson, this
is a perfect data set

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.609
which you can analyze in
terms of what's going on.

00:08:41.609 --> 00:08:43.150
And the first thing
he looked at-- so

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.191
we take a roulette table.

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:47.881
You've obviously got these
black and red outcomes, and then

00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:48.380
this zero.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.860
And if you remove
the zero, you'd

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.505
expect black and red
to be about 50-50.

00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:56.140
And in his data, I think
red came up about 50.15%

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.640
of the time.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.590
So based on what he had, he
said, this isn't implausible,

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.510
that this difference
is kind of acceptable.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.830
But then he started looking
at pairs of numbers.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.000
And obviously, if you're
doing a lot of roulette spins,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.550
you'd expect sometimes
by chance to get a string

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.330
of the same color appearing.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.590
But in the data,
Poincare noticed

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.170
that the two switch too often.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.950
You didn't get these strings
of the same color appearing.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.283
What was happening was you'd
get black and red switching

00:09:22.283 --> 00:09:23.540
more than you'd expect.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.240
In fact, he said that, had
he been watching these tables

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.420
since the start of
geological time on Earth,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.310
he wouldn't have expected to
see a result that extreme.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.900
Pearson actually, in the end,
was quite angry about this.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.380
He thought that Monte Carlo
were rigging all their tables,

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.740
wrote a lot of angry
letters, in fact,

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.400
suggested they
should be closed down

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.045
and the proceeds
donated to science.

00:09:48.127 --> 00:09:49.710
But there was something
else going on.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.177
As it happened, those
journalists at "La Monaco"

00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:53.760
weren't actually
sitting by the tables

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.840
and recording all the numbers.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.340
They were instead
sitting in the bar

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.090
and making them up, which
explains what was going on.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.964
But these ideas that
Pearson honed and have

00:10:03.964 --> 00:10:05.380
become an important
part science--

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.546
think back to that sentence.

00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:08.610
The probability of
observing an event as

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.436
extreme as the one
we observed, given

00:10:10.436 --> 00:10:11.560
that he said it was random.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.800
That's the early
foundations of a p-value.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.440
This is a statistical test.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.570
And so whether in
my line of work,

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.720
where we do things
in clinical trials

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.590
or you're testing any kind of
hypothesis, all of this theory

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.880
originated with Pearson
throwing coins and looking

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.702
at roulette tables.

00:10:29.702 --> 00:10:31.160
And as well, these
kind of theories

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.460
have been applied by gamblers
to understand roulette tables.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.850
In the first half
of the 20th century,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.790
many gamblers would actually
watch the tables and instead

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.110
of sitting in the bar
and collect the data

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.290
and look for biases.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.720
And when you had tables
that were worn down

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.010
or certain areas of numbers
were appearing more often

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.070
than others, they used
this to capitalize and have

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.957
an advantage over the table.

00:10:52.957 --> 00:10:55.040
Over time, casinos worked
out what they were doing

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.870
and made sure that the
tables were incredibly well

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.751
maintained and shouldn't exhibit
any noticeable bias over time.

00:11:01.751 --> 00:11:04.000
But in the '60s and '70s, a
number of physics students

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.166
realized that this puts you
back in the second level

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.680
of ignorance, that if you have
an incredibly well maintained

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.492
table, you can essentially
treat it like a physics problem.

00:11:11.492 --> 00:11:13.700
One of them compared it to
a planet orbiting a point.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.180
You should be able to write
down the system of equations

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.129
governing that process and solve
it given enough information.

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:21.670
And the '70s in
particular, one group

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.241
at the University of
California, Santa Cruz--

00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:25.490
it's quite a well-known story.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.130
But what they did was divide
up the spin into what happens.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.575
Initially, it starts with the
ball going around the rim.

00:11:31.575 --> 00:11:33.200
Often it would go
around a couple times

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.850
before the croupier
calls no more bets.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.100
You've got a window where
you can obtain information

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.950
and capitalize on it.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.000
Then it would drop
down onto the track,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.500
spin freely, and then eventually
hit one of these deflectors

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.290
and end up in one of the slots.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.410
And what they realized is
that actually, in this system,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.570
if you collect enough
information over time

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.360
and calibrate your model
to the particular table,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.520
that initial period of the
ball going around the rim

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.360
gives you enough
information to be

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.290
able to make not perfect
predictions but certainly

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.030
enough to get an
edge over the casino

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.026
in terms of where
the ball will land.

00:12:06.026 --> 00:12:08.150
That's all well and good
doing that in a classroom.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.640
But if you want to
do it in a casino,

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.200
these aren't calculations
you can do in your head.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.810
You need a way of
computing them.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.500
So they designed
wearable computers,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.210
wearable hidden
computers to carry out

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.050
these calculations in a casino.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.220
And as it happens, the
first ever wearable computer

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.367
was designed for this purpose.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:23.950
So a huge amount of
wearable tech now.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.030
This is where it all originated.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.940
Obviously, they had
some teething problems.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.440
They quite often
get electric shocks

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.460
from their computer,
which is not ideal

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.490
when you're trying to keep
a low profile in a casino.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.182
In other situations,
this sensitivity

00:12:36.182 --> 00:12:37.640
to initial conditions
came to play.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.640
Like if the weather change,
for instance, they'd

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.500
need to recalibrate their model.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.854
Another occasion, the
team started losing money

00:12:43.854 --> 00:12:46.020
and couldn't really work
out why until they realized

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.228
that further down there was
an overweight guy leaning

00:12:48.228 --> 00:12:52.650
on the table and screwing
up all of their predictions.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.080
But in many cases,
these ideas stimulated

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.164
a lot of thinking about
these kind of process.

00:12:58.164 --> 00:13:00.330
And the research didn't
become gamblers necessarily.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.440
Many of them went into
technology or finance

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.602
or academia.

00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:05.810
But they treated it as almost
a playground for ideas.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.550
It was a way of just testing out
this problem-solving ability.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.560
And interest in
games and gambling

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.310
has continued from an
academic point of view.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.721
One example is poker and games.

00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:18.220
Obviously, there's
a lot of interest

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.200
in AI around game-playing
algorithms now.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.004
Poker, as it happened, was
one of the first inspirations

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:25.670
for game theory.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.460
Back in the 1920s,
John von Neumann

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.810
was a brilliant mathematician.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.643
He was the youngest
professor in the history

00:13:31.643 --> 00:13:33.250
of the University of Berlin.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.734
Wasn't so good at poker, though.

00:13:34.734 --> 00:13:36.650
And on the face of it,
poker is a perfect game

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.530
for mathematicians, right?

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.730
You've got a probability.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.319
You get dealt a certain hand.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.110
You've got a probability
your opponent gets

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.079
dealt a different one.

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:45.370
But of course, reality is a
bit more complex than that.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.210
And as von Neumann
said, real life

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.500
consists of bluffing, of
little tactics of deception,

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.250
of asking yourself, what
does the other man suppose

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.700
I'm going to do?

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.690
And trying to
understand this push

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.350
and pull between
different strategies,

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.330
he looks at some very
simplified versions of poker.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.250
And he started off, for
example, with two players.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.919
Each of them dealt
a single card.

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:06.960
They both put some money
in the pot at the start.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.543
And then the first player has a
choice of either just sticking

00:14:09.543 --> 00:14:11.400
with their existing
money in the pot,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.270
and then they
compare their cards.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.440
Or this first player
can raise the stakes

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.190
and see if the
other player reacts.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.246
It's a very simple game.

00:14:19.246 --> 00:14:20.996
Von Neumann observed
there's essentially

00:14:20.996 --> 00:14:23.120
a tug of war going on
between these two strategies,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.780
because each player
is simultaneously

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.454
trying to maximize what they get
and minimize their opponent's

00:14:29.454 --> 00:14:31.370
payoff, because in a
game like poker, anything

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.203
your opponent wins comes
out of your pocket.

00:14:33.203 --> 00:14:35.780
So you're trying to
really push and pull

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.520
between these two approaches.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.090
And in the middle, there's
an equilibrium point

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.660
where neither player
will have anything

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.076
to gain by unilaterally
changing the strategy.

00:14:45.076 --> 00:14:46.700
So if you're familiar
with game theory,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.950
this is kind of the early
ideas of a Nash equilibrium,

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.760
the situation where
neither player over time

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.300
would expect to gain anything
by changing what they do.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.780
When he analyzed this very
simple version of poker,

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.370
he found that if the
first player gets

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.500
dealt with a high card,
it makes sense for them

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.550
to raise the stakes.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.310
Intuitively that's
pretty obvious.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.500
If you have a good card,
good chance of winning.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.171
If you've got a middling
card on that draw,

00:15:10.171 --> 00:15:11.920
you haven't got a great
chance of winning,

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.750
so you don't want
to up the stakes.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.650
In this case, it makes
sense to stick with what's

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.030
already in the pots.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.710
Interestingly, though, when the
player was dealt a low card,

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.900
this equilibrium
strategy said that they

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.590
should raise the stakes.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.090
And if you think
that through again,

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.860
it kind of makes
sense that, if you've

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.074
got a low card, if you
stick with what's in there

00:15:30.074 --> 00:15:31.490
and just turn over
your cards, you

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.610
haven't got a great chance of
converting it into a victory.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.009
The only way you
can profit is to try

00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:39.550
and scare your opponent out of
the pot by raising the stakes.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.160
Now, at the time, poker players
had obviously implemented

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.049
things like bluffing.

00:15:44.049 --> 00:15:45.840
This was a common
tactic, but it had always

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.550
been seen as one
that was more a quirk

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.980
of human psychology
than something

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.990
that was a mathematical feature.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.880
But this was
essentially von Neumann

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.550
proving that bluffing
is a necessary part

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.560
of these kind of games.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.560
Essentially, he constructed
a mathematical proof

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.460
that bluffing is a necessity in
these kind of games of chance.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.942
The strategy in this very
simple version of poker

00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:06.400
is what's known as
a pure strategy.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.144
There's a set of fixed rules
of, if this happens, do this.

00:16:09.144 --> 00:16:11.310
If you get a high or low
card, you raise the stakes.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.160
If you get a middle card,
you stick with your bet.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.670
And many games have similar pure
strategies that you can follow.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.724
So anything that has
perfect information--

00:16:19.724 --> 00:16:21.140
something like
noughts and crosses

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.244
or checkers or chess--
in theory has a strategy,

00:16:24.244 --> 00:16:26.160
a fixed set of rules,
that if you follow them,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.951
you will get the optimal
result every time.

00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:29.900
The challenge, particular
things like go,

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.960
is obviously finding
those kind of strategies.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.626
And sometimes they
might be intractable.

00:16:33.626 --> 00:16:35.834
But in theory,
there's one there.

00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:38.250
There's a whole class of games
that that doesn't work for.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.870
So one obvious example
is rock-paper-scissors.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.620
It might be admirably
consistent of you

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.349
to always pick the same one.

00:16:44.349 --> 00:16:46.390
But if your opponent works
out what you're doing,

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.460
you're clearly not going to
gain much in the long run.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.480
Really what you want to
do is alter the choices

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.180
you make to make your
opponent's decisions as

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.130
difficult as possible.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.713
So for rock-paper-scissors,
it doesn't

00:16:56.713 --> 00:16:59.180
take much to spot that the
way to make your opponent's

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.360
decisions as hard as possible
is to simply pick randomly

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.704
between these three options.

00:17:05.704 --> 00:17:07.079
And so over time,
if you do that,

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.702
you wouldn't expect
to lose on average.

00:17:10.702 --> 00:17:12.410
For a simple game of
rock-paper-scissors,

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.170
that's pretty trivial to spot
that that's the strategy.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.442
Obviously, for poker,
there's a vast number

00:17:17.442 --> 00:17:19.150
of different combinations
you could have,

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.099
and the situation
becomes far more complex.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:25.200
It's not something you can just
write down a neat solution for.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.730
And actually, one of John
von Neumann's colleagues,

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.770
called Stanislaw Ulam, was
interested in these kind

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.020
of questions.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.530
He wasn't a typical
mathematician

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.260
in that he didn't
really enjoy trudging

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.680
through lots of equations.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.390
On one occasion, his colleague
found him solving a quadratic

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.090
on a blackboard.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:40.990
And when he got
to the end, he was

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.198
so exhausted and bored that
he went home for the day.

00:17:43.198 --> 00:17:44.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:44.184 --> 00:17:45.850
So really that wasn't
his kind of thing.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.450
He was once playing solitaire.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.430
He was playing Canfield, which
is originated in casinos.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.224
And he wanted to work
out the probability

00:17:52.224 --> 00:17:53.890
that, if you lay out
the cards, you have

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.477
a situation where you can win.

00:17:56.477 --> 00:17:58.310
And he quickly realized
that actually trying

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.460
to write down all the
combinations that that would

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.470
involve is just a bit arduous
and what would be better

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.340
is instead just to simulate a
few times-- lay out some cards,

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.890
see what happens.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.599
At the time, with
von Neumann, he

00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:11.640
was working at Los Alamos
on the nuclear projects

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.098
and looking at
neutron interactions

00:18:13.098 --> 00:18:15.410
inside the early developments
of hydrogen bombs.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:16.910
And again, it was
a similar problem,

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.435
where you had a lot of random
interactions of something

00:18:19.435 --> 00:18:21.060
that's very hard to
solve analytically,

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.127
and it made more
sense to simulate.

00:18:23.127 --> 00:18:25.210
Because they were working
on a government project,

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.820
they needed a code name for
this new kind of method.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.750
So as Ulam had a
heavy gambling uncle,

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.710
they nicknamed it the
Monte Carlo method.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.970
And this has now become a really
important part of science.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.710
We use it in disease analysis
for things like Ebola and Zika.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.250
The transmission dynamics
are incredibly complex.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.990
It's not necessarily something
you can solve mathematically.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.590
And it makes its way into
a number of other fields

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.510
as well, including
analysis of games.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.040
Many of the top
game-playing algorithms

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.550
now use these kind of
simulation-based approaches

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.630
to refine their strategies.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.760
And in poker as well, one team
at the University of Alberta

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.440
adopted this kind of approach
and refined their strategy

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.800
so much over time
that, last year,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.490
they announced that
poker is solved.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:15.720
So for two-player poker, in
which the potential stakes are

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.760
limited-- so known
as limit poker--

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.940
they had essentially,
through this kind

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.600
of iterative approach,
found a situation

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.260
or a set of strategies which
are such a good approximation

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.360
to the equilibrium that it
wouldn't expect to lose money

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.320
over a kind of human lifespan.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.987
So they hadn't found
this exact solution

00:19:34.987 --> 00:19:36.945
like we can write down
for rock-paper-scissors,

00:19:36.945 --> 00:19:39.270
but they found one which was
such a good approximation

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.490
that they wouldn't expect
to lose money over time.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.684
It's obviously a
tremendous achievement.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.850
But it does have the
limitation that you're assuming

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.767
that your opponent is perfect.

00:19:48.767 --> 00:19:50.350
If you design an
equilibrium strategy,

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:54.120
you're assuming you're facing
the optimal potential opponent.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.830
And that makes it
quite defensive,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.399
because essentially you might
be facing someone with flaws.

00:19:58.399 --> 00:20:00.440
And if you're following
the equilibrium strategy,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.110
you're essentially
deciding that you're

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.010
trying to minimize your losses.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.650
You're trying to make sure that,
no matter who you're facing,

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.317
you're not going to
lose money over time.

00:20:09.317 --> 00:20:10.650
Of course, people do have flaws.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.087
And just to illustrate what
happens when people play

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:14.670
games, what I'd like
you to do is just

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.128
pair with the person next to
you and play a couple of games

00:20:17.128 --> 00:20:18.440
of rock-paper-scissors.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.262
So I'm sure you all know how
this works-- one, two, and then

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:21.970
show what you do.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.928
So just a couple of games
and see what happens.

00:20:23.928 --> 00:20:26.678
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:49.070
ADAM KUCHARSKI: OK.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.100
So I think everybody's
had a go at it.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.370
OK.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:57.980
OK, great.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.230
So there were a few
of you, I think,

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.146
who were playing a best
of seven or something.

00:21:01.146 --> 00:21:03.680
But what I'd to
do-- OK, so can you

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.140
just raise your hand if, on
your first go, you picked rock.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:07.640
OK.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.410
Who picked scissors?

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.257
OK, and who picked paper?

00:21:13.257 --> 00:21:14.840
A lot of people
didn't play, it seems.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.832
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:17.744 --> 00:21:19.160
So generally-- I
don't know if you

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.780
can see that-- but the
split there was most

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.321
people were picking
rock or scissors.

00:21:22.321 --> 00:21:24.775
And actually, in many
large-scale games

00:21:24.775 --> 00:21:27.150
where people played a lot of
times, that tends to happen.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.650
Papers isn't a very
popular opening option.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.014
And often what will
happen is novices

00:21:33.014 --> 00:21:34.555
and particularly
men will pick rocks.

00:21:34.555 --> 00:21:36.420
So it's not that a
hard and fast rule.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.000
But that's generally
what happens

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.650
is scissors comes out as
the most popular option

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.770
amongst experienced players.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.257
So I told you about
five minutes ago

00:21:47.257 --> 00:21:49.090
what the optimal strategy
was for this game.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.072
And yet, you kind of still
fell into certain patterns.

00:21:52.072 --> 00:21:54.530
I think as well between what
happened between your first go

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.370
and your second go.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.440
So in one large
study done about two,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.237
three years ago,
what tended to happen

00:21:59.237 --> 00:22:00.820
was the person who
won on the first go

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.550
would stick with the same
one on the second go.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.272
And the person
who lost initially

00:22:05.272 --> 00:22:07.480
would switch to the move
that would have beaten them.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.287
So if you lost to rock, you'd
switch to papers afterwards.

00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:11.620
So again, doesn't always happen.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.550
But people often will
fall into these kind

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.650
of predictable patterns.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.660
There's actually a
story about 10 years ago

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.266
where the head of an
electronics firm in Japan

00:22:20.266 --> 00:22:21.640
wanted to sell an
art collection.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.070
And Christie's
and Sotheby's were

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.040
interested in
holding the auction.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.540
And the head of the
electronics firm

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.914
decided the fairest
way to settle

00:22:28.914 --> 00:22:31.280
it was with a game of
rock-paper-scissors.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.310
Now, Sotheby's were like, great,
that's random, that's fine.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.200
Christie's, however,
he had a daughter--

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.500
the CEO of the company--
who played it relentlessly

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.240
at school.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.170
So he got his
daughter to teach him

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.780
the basics of
rock-paper-scissors strategy.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.862
And sure enough, they
walked in to play this game

00:22:45.862 --> 00:22:46.820
of rock-paper-scissors.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.111
Sotheby's treating it randomly.

00:22:48.111 --> 00:22:49.830
Christie's with a strategy.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.130
Christie's walked
out the winner.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.640
Because in these
kind of situations,

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.000
if you're viewing it as
a completely random game

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.875
and you're playing this
[INAUDIBLE] opponent,

00:22:57.875 --> 00:23:00.270
it makes sense potentially
to deviate from your strategy

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.370
and take advantage of that.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.040
But there's a
downside in these kind

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.040
of games if you try and
adapt what you're doing.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.210
If you move away from
this equilibrium strategy

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.460
to try to exploit an opponent.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.915
And that's what's
known as the get

00:23:10.915 --> 00:23:12.831
toward an exploited
problem, because if you've

00:23:12.831 --> 00:23:15.670
got a very smart opponent,
they could teach you

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.820
a false appearance of
what their strategy is.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.560
So in poker, they
could initially

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.030
pretend to be quite
passive, maybe indecisive.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.644
And you would adjust your
model of your opponent to that.

00:23:26.644 --> 00:23:28.310
And then they would
adapt their strategy

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.060
and take advantage of
the fact that you've

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.490
learned an incorrect
version of themselves.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.189
And there was actually an
example not just with poker.

00:23:36.189 --> 00:23:37.980
In other industries,
you have this problem.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.165
So finance is another
situation where

00:23:40.165 --> 00:23:41.790
big increase in the
role of algorithms,

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.430
unlike poker, where you have
these very detailed strategies.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.530
In finance, obviously if
the aim is to be quick,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.050
you want as little
code as possible.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.240
You want to execute
it as fast as you can.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.500
And a couple of years
ago, there was a situation

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.310
where two Norwegian
traders had noticed

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:57.240
that a US stockbroker had an
algorithm which would always

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.780
react to a trade
in the same way.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.900
So no matter how
big the trade was,

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.460
the algorithm would
change the price

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.020
by exactly the same amount.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.670
So what they did
is they trained it.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.250
They got it, made lots of small
trades to nudge up the price,

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.450
and then made a huge one and
profited from the difference.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.880
Now, that went to
court, obviously.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.952
And they were charged
with market manipulation.

00:24:19.952 --> 00:24:21.660
And they were handed
suspended sentences.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.140
But on appeal, their
lawyer made the point of,

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.664
if they'd been trading
against a stupid human,

00:24:27.664 --> 00:24:29.330
there wouldn't have
been anything wrong.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.880
The issue that apparently
was the problem was they

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.190
were trading against a
stupid algorithm, who

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.520
presumably was
designed by a human who

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.420
was lacking in a few skills.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.900
And that appeal was seen
as justified, actually.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.690
It didn't make sense that if
you're trading against a human

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.130
there should be different
rules for if you were

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.370
trading against an algorithm.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.160
How can one be skillful
and yet the other not?

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.380
And similar arguments have
developed in other fields.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.740
For example, a few
years ago-- and

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.270
is continuing to happen--
that the US are cracking down

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.370
on poker, particularly online
poker but also real games.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:09.280
And in 2011, a person who was
offering a poker room in New

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.550
York was actually taken to
court for operating a gambling

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.080
operation.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.062
Now, in federal law,
many casino games

00:25:16.062 --> 00:25:17.520
are explicitly
defined as gambling.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.710
But poker isn't
actually one of them.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.422
So poker is kind of
open to debate a bit

00:25:22.422 --> 00:25:23.630
as to whether it is gambling.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.380
And in federal law,
gambling is defined

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.342
as a game that is
predominantly down to chance,

00:25:28.342 --> 00:25:29.800
predominantly the
result of chance.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.970
So this whole legal
case rested on,

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.960
is poker predominantly
a game of chance

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.637
or predominantly
a game of skill.

00:25:35.637 --> 00:25:37.220
A lot of economists
and mathematicians

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.942
weighed in, obviously making
the point that in a single hand

00:25:40.942 --> 00:25:42.150
you got this element of luck.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:46.320
But over a realistic course of
a poker game, skill can prevail.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.931
And this is actually the first
time that a judge in the US

00:25:48.931 --> 00:25:51.430
has ruled on whether poker is
predominantly a game of chance

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.240
or a game of skill and ruled
that it was a game of skill.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.660
It was not gambling
under federal law.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.290
But there's a footnote to this
case, because under state law,

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.956
gambling is defined
as anything that has

00:26:01.956 --> 00:26:04.020
a material element of chance.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.410
Now, it's very hard to deny that
poker has an element of chance.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.810
And so in this case, it
was defined as gambling

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.874
under state law, and this
decision was overturned.

00:26:13.874 --> 00:26:15.540
And then you were
seeing it increasingly

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.210
with things like fantasy
sports as well in the US.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.800
Where do we draw this
line between something

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.591
that's a chance and
something that's skill?

00:26:20.591 --> 00:26:23.070
And I think there's
often this temptation

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.444
to almost put things in boxes.

00:26:24.444 --> 00:26:26.235
We like to say, this
is a box full of luck,

00:26:26.235 --> 00:26:27.410
this is box full of skill.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.340
And I think this also tends
to, if we're good at something,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.090
we tend to put it in
the box on the right.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.650
And if we're bad at something,
we put it on the box

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:34.779
on the left.

00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:37.070
But really, I think, history
and looking at these games

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.611
and gambling has
shown that it's much

00:26:38.611 --> 00:26:40.395
more of a spectrum than that.

00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:42.020
Some of the stories
that I've shown you

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.311
and many other situations
and things like card counting

00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:47.050
as well have shown that a
lot of games that maybe we

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.890
think of luck actually with
sufficient skill and efforts

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:55.330
can be overtaken with
mathematical and scientific

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:56.552
thinking as well.

00:26:56.552 --> 00:26:58.760
And actually, games that we
think of purely dependent

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.200
on skill perhaps may have
an element of luck as well.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.610
So back in the '90s, when
Garry Kasparov was playing Deep

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.690
Blue, IBM's chess computer.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.100
There was a point in the
game where Deep Blue made

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.740
a move that was by all accounts
so ingenious and so subtle

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.400
that it threw Kasparov a bit.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.360
And actually, a lot
of the commentators

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.985
said it changed the
course of the game,

00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:21.486
because it was so unusual what
he had done that it convinced

00:27:21.486 --> 00:27:23.735
Kasparov that he was playing
something that was simply

00:27:23.735 --> 00:27:25.520
beyond what he had
encountered before.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.660
He was playing an entirely
new class of player.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.354
As it happened though, Deep
Blue hadn't chosen that move

00:27:32.354 --> 00:27:33.270
because it was clever.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.870
It had run into
a situation where

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:38.130
it couldn't make a decision
about which move was best.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.050
And in that situation,
to avoid a dead end,

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.290
it had been programmed
just to pick randomly.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.230
So this game, which
is really held up

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.590
as one of the landmarks
of artificial intelligence

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.290
versus humans, one of the
most significant moves

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.870
was actually made
purely by chance.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.650
So again, games of
skill potentially

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.860
might be closer to
luck than we think.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.360
And I think that's why gambling
is a really interesting field

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.920
of study, even if you never
visit casinos or bookmakers.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.450
I think whatever
industry you're in,

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.283
gambling and betting
and chance play a role.

00:28:09.283 --> 00:28:12.062
I mean, I work in health,
in business, and finance.

00:28:12.062 --> 00:28:14.270
The situations where we have
to try to make decisions

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.660
with hidden information.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.480
We have to try and
deal with uncertainty.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.390
We have to try to balance risk
against potential payoffs.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.330
I think historically
that's what has

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.450
been so interesting
to a lot of people

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:28.810
who are quantitatively minded
and continues to do so today.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.147
But I think there's
another reason as well,

00:28:31.147 --> 00:28:32.980
which is why these games
are so interesting.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.771
And I think Alan Turing
put it well when he

00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:36.799
was working on
games to understand

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:38.090
thinking machines a bit better.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.470
As he said, it would
be disingenuous of us

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.240
to try and disguise the fact
that the principal motive

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.430
for the work was
the sheer fun of it.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:46.595
So thank you.

00:28:46.595 --> 00:28:49.046
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:54.004 --> 00:28:55.420
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.980
We're now opening
up to questions.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.020
I have the first
and obvious one.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.910
Do you gamble?

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.420
And how many casinos
are you banned from?

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.704
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:04.704 --> 00:29:06.620
ADAM KUCHARSKI: Actually,
I mainly play poker.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.390
And I think one of the things
this book has kind of taught

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.870
you is how many games-- just
the sheer amount of effort

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:12.464
required.

00:29:12.464 --> 00:29:14.130
So there are syndicates
out there taking

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.370
on a huge amount of sports.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.850
But essentially, that would
just be doing my full-time job

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:18.940
on a different data set.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.120
So I think poker's a nice one,
where a relatively small edge

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.985
can play quite a big role.

00:29:23.985 --> 00:29:25.360
Unfortunately,
most of my friends

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.900
refuse to play with me now.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.560
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
Kasparov and Deep Blue.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.980
And we've just had-- or
we-- DeepMind and AlphaGo.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.960
What's your opinion
on the work that you

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.550
see DeepMind doing in terms of
changing games from-- rather

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.160
far more to the scale element
and kind of the way computers

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.122
are working on games?

00:29:47.122 --> 00:29:48.830
ADAM KUCHARSKI: I
think one of the things

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:49.910
with Go that stands
out, and it's

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.520
similar with poker,
is just the speed

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.269
at which these
developments are happening.

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:54.820
So I think Go for
a lot of people

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.020
was safe from computers
for a few more years

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.900
and, similarly, with a lot
of the more complex forms

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:00.400
of poker.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.080
So no-limit, hold 'em,
and these kind of things.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.050
I think people had this
idea that humans would

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.190
be dominant for a lot longer.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.250
So I think that's quite
interesting in the time scale.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.083
Also with Go, just the
way it's tackling it,

00:30:09.083 --> 00:30:10.920
because obviously it's
a game that you can't

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.450
find this optimal solution.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.670
So from what I
understand, it's much more

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.880
about understanding
the shape of the board.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.537
So adopting almost
more human approaches

00:30:20.537 --> 00:30:23.120
to learn these games rather than
simply crunching the numbers,

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.480
as you might do for
a very simple game.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.520
So I think that's quite
interesting of having

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.145
to reproduce human
learning techniques.

00:30:28.145 --> 00:30:30.930
And actually, for poker,
a lot of the algorithms

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.550
they use to try
and solve these are

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.900
based on regret minimizations.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.580
So they have a kind of regret
function within their learning

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.190
component.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:41.300
So I think that's actually quite
interesting, just coming out

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.810
as a side issue, of what the
efficient ways of learning

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.409
these kind of games are.

00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:46.950
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.410
Can you tell us a
little bit about how

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.970
this works in the
disease spreading part,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.210
and if you tried that
with any diseases,

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.537
like maybe Zika or something?

00:30:56.537 --> 00:30:57.370
ADAM KUCHARSKI: Yes.

00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.640
So as I mentioned,
many of the ideas that

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.200
came out of games and
gambling we use in our work.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.900
So an obvious example is things
like Monte Carlo simulations,

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.240
that generally if you try
to infer what disease does,

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.130
you need some way of
combining a simulation

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.279
process with inference of data.

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:17.070
And so actually, in
this kind of situation,

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.350
it's much more efficient to
just do lots of simulations

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.757
and then kind of refine
them to what the data is.

00:31:22.757 --> 00:31:24.590
But there's a number
of other ideas as well.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.670
So in some situations,
people using game theory.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.602
Again, these kind of strategies
that came out of betting to

00:31:29.602 --> 00:31:31.810
understand how different
countries may be interacting

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.780
to make vaccine decisions.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.530
Because in many
situations, you have

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.100
almost like a tragedy of
the commons, from something

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.220
where you've potentially got a
vaccine that has a side effect

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.620
or has a problem.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.070
From an individual
point of view,

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.660
your priorities and
your risk profile

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.074
is very different to
what a population does.

00:31:48.074 --> 00:31:50.240
So if you have a whole
population making a decision,

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.250
you might have some
effective herd immunity.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.000
But if enough
individuals ignore that,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.740
you can end up with
a different outcome.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.590
So it's the push and
pull between what's

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.715
good for a population and
what's good at individual

00:32:00.715 --> 00:32:02.750
and how those things interact.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.160
So I think that's where a
lot of the ideas come into.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.020
I think it's also just
good sometimes when

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.811
you're working with
these ideas day in, day

00:32:08.811 --> 00:32:11.220
out, to understand
where they come from.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.040
And I think as well just the
fact that these kind of games

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.050
are very nice situations.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:19.430
If you work in disease
data, it's pretty murky.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.590
There's a lot of unknowns,
a lot of uncertainty,

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:25.000
whereas for something like a
simplified version of poker,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.964
it's a sort of well-defined
problem to work on.

00:32:27.964 --> 00:32:29.380
So I think you do
in any industry,

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.000
you work on kind of
cartoon problems,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.070
because they're
simple to analyze.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.780
I think it's just
interesting to see

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.399
how the history has developed
in these kind of things.

00:32:37.399 --> 00:32:39.440
AUDIENCE: The disease
data, I'm quite interested.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.270
And we hear a lot about
immunization-- sorry,

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.390
the way that antibiotics
will affect us

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.200
on a global population and
that we might not globally

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.410
be prepared for outbreak
of a pandemic or similar.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.199
And that often feels like
it's a governmental problem--

00:32:54.199 --> 00:32:56.490
governments communicating
with each other and so forth.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.370
So as a mathematician,
as a scientist,

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:02.220
how do you look to
communicate your findings

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.440
onto a kind of political
and to a human level

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:09.370
and try to impact the system
that is often quite messy?

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:11.490
ADAM KUCHARSKI: That's
a good question.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.759
Doing Ebola, we did
quite a lot of work

00:33:13.759 --> 00:33:14.800
with government agencies.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.258
And I think one of the things
they say is it's better to be

00:33:17.258 --> 00:33:19.520
80% right today than 90%
right in two years' time.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.780
And it's really kind of
working on-- there's never

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.979
a single piece of research
that defines a policy.

00:33:23.979 --> 00:33:25.520
It's always that
kind of aggregation.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.770
But I think there's
often situations

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.410
that there's a lot of options.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.240
It's not clear what's
even reasonable.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.310
I think modeling and a
mathematical approach

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:35.643
is a good way of essentially
taking things off the table

00:33:35.643 --> 00:33:37.710
and refining it down.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:40.356
I think, especially doing these
kind of real-time outbreaks,

00:33:40.356 --> 00:33:41.480
the Zika's another example.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.410
There's a huge amount
of uncertainty.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.915
And ideally, you'll get in and
do all kind of field studies

00:33:45.915 --> 00:33:47.040
and do everything properly.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.970
But in the absence of that,
we need to make decisions now.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.420
I think these kind
of analysis are

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.711
quite a useful way of doing it.

00:33:52.711 --> 00:33:55.290
I think policymakers
appreciate having things

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.060
there very quickly as an
evidence base to make decisions

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.730
on.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.170
AUDIENCE: I was just thinking
about your [INAUDIBLE] a bit

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.692
like roulette moving from
more into a skill mode

00:34:05.692 --> 00:34:06.400
than a luck mode.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.090
Do you think the insurance
industry is actually

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.590
going to be-- because
at the moment,

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.290
it's just down on
this huge population,

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.040
and you're roughly
going to die or roughly

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.530
going to have a car crash.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.830
But actually, as you have
increasing levels of data

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.050
about everything you do in a
car or every bit of genetics,

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.459
then it becomes
calculable potentially.

00:34:24.459 --> 00:34:27.205
Do you see that shift in
the insurance industry?

00:34:27.205 --> 00:34:28.080
ADAM KUCHARSKI: Yeah.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.330
I mean, it's already happening.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.830
I don't know the
details, but I know

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.350
there's been a few test
cases in recent years of that

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.510
trying to refine it
into certain parts.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.120
So the split between males
and females, for example.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.920
And I think there's
been some legal disputes

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.690
as to whether you
can actually do that.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.440
And you're right.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.761
It makes sense if you had
that large set of data,

00:34:45.761 --> 00:34:47.600
because you can really
refine the risk based

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.725
on a particular individual.

00:34:48.725 --> 00:34:51.710
But there's that kind of
conflict between people

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.944
wanting a uniform policy.

00:34:53.944 --> 00:34:55.860
So again, that's the
kind of interesting thing

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.120
of where what the model says
is best conflicts with what's

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.590
actually acceptable.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.120
AUDIENCE: So if
you've got an opponent

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.430
that you know is playing
a perfect strategy,

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.580
is there any way to use
that information to game

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.500
that opponent?

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.161
And are there some games
which are, because of this,

00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:12.660
intractable?

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.420
ADAM KUCHARSKI: So if you're
playing a perfect opponent,

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.330
then I suppose by the
definition of that strategy,

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.660
your best response is to play
an equilibrium strategy as well.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.790
One of the things that's
interesting, actually,

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.915
talking to people who are
working these poker games

00:35:27.915 --> 00:35:29.651
is, in two-player
situations, it's

00:35:29.651 --> 00:35:32.150
pretty obvious that, if they're
playing an optimal strategy,

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.740
you need to do the same.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.190
But the definition of an
[INAUDIBLE] equilibrium

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.850
is on unilateral behavior.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:41.350
So it's no player has anything
to gain by individually

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.370
changing that strategy.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.869
But when you have
multiplayer games,

00:35:43.869 --> 00:35:47.346
you have the potential for
collaboration and coalitions.

00:35:47.346 --> 00:35:49.970
And actually, some of the people
working on poker, particularly

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:53.311
on the versions of the
game that are intractable,

00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:55.560
have found that you can have
these kind of equilibrium

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.060
strategies.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.639
And when people
put them together,

00:35:57.639 --> 00:35:59.680
potentially two players
could gang up on a third.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.770
And the third can't do
anything about that.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.890
So in that situation,
where they all

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:05.640
are playing pretty
good strategies but not

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.139
perfect ones, it
doesn't necessarily

00:36:07.139 --> 00:36:09.530
make sense for that person
who's being picked on

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.200
to rely on that as a defense.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.290
And it might make
sense to look for flaws

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.564
in what they're doing instead.

00:36:14.564 --> 00:36:15.980
So I think there's
just a lot more

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.310
to be seen for when you
have these multiplayer

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.360
games, that it's not so clear
that these kind of equilibrium

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.470
strategies are useful.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.826
Hopefully that answered your--

00:36:22.826 --> 00:36:24.650
AUDIENCE: It did, thanks.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.330
AUDIENCE: I'm very
curious as to what

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:27.760
brought you down that path.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.206
Why did you write this book?

00:36:30.206 --> 00:36:32.330
ADAM KUCHARSKI: So I've
said, these kind of stories

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:34.280
have always been hovering
in the background for me.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.071
And it was actually,
it was during my PhD--

00:36:36.071 --> 00:36:37.160
so I did PhD in maths.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.162
And we'd often get emails from
usually the standard crowd,

00:36:40.162 --> 00:36:41.870
just tons of investment
banks, generally.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.410
But you'd often get a few
different ones appearing.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.800
And it was actually
firms who are essentially

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:52.390
betting hedge funds got in touch
about possible recruitment.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.740
And for me, that was
something that I just

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.880
wasn't aware of as an
industry that had developed.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.671
And actually, as you
start to look into it,

00:36:58.671 --> 00:37:00.360
it was only in the
last decade or two

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.140
that in the UK on, say,
football that people

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.850
have been able to
make consistently

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.147
good enough predictions to make
that a viable business model.

00:37:08.147 --> 00:37:09.480
And that kind of started for me.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.370
That was quite interesting.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.000
That was something
I was completely

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.240
unaware of as an industry.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.448
And then when you start to
dig down into the history,

00:37:14.448 --> 00:37:16.020
you realize that
not only there are

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.395
a lot of other people doing
these things that potentially

00:37:18.395 --> 00:37:19.590
aren't reported a lot.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.252
Actually, you've got a lot
of quite major developments

00:37:22.252 --> 00:37:23.960
in science that-- I
don't know about you,

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.430
but I was just
completely unaware

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.750
that a lot of these ideas
had originated with games

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.402
like roulette and gambling.

00:37:29.402 --> 00:37:31.610
I thought it would just be
really interesting to have

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:34.450
a book that explores not only
the history but also some

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:36.966
of the modern efforts and,
again, with some developments

00:37:36.966 --> 00:37:37.465
in AI.

00:37:37.465 --> 00:37:39.810
I think that's coming
on frustratingly almost

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.196
when you write a book, that
it's coming on so quickly,

00:37:42.196 --> 00:37:43.320
because it kind of updates.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.224
But I think that's
fascinating looking at what's

00:37:46.224 --> 00:37:47.390
happening in the modern day.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.410
And it's just the
fundamental question of,

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.950
if you're going to put money
on the line, what evidence

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:52.910
do you need to make a decision?

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.030
And it's the same of whether
you're deploying a vaccine

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.260
or whether you're making
a business choice.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.219
It's what evidence convinces you
that that risk is worth taking.

00:37:59.219 --> 00:38:01.260
I think gambling is a
really interesting industry

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.450
to look at in that context.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.310
AUDIENCE: So we work
at Google, and we love

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.670
data sets and big data sets.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.270
We had a speaker
recently who spoke

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.590
of understanding whale
noises and that it's

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.100
a problem where, if we
had a larger data set,

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.640
we could actually make some
progress trying to understand

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.710
how they speak to each other.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:24.410
So in terms of your industry
and what you're dealing with,

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:25.900
what would be your
fictional ideal

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.130
big data set that currently
you can't collect or is

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.960
too expensive to collect
and you would love to play,

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.101
be it a game or
health or similar?

00:38:35.101 --> 00:38:36.850
ADAM KUCHARSKI: So in
terms of my day job,

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:40.712
I think one of the big questions
that we don't know-- generally,

00:38:40.712 --> 00:38:42.420
we focus on things we
can measure easily.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.642
You know, a disease
case is been diagnosed.

00:38:44.642 --> 00:38:45.350
That's the thing.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.984
If we for Ebola put
in a treatment center,

00:38:47.984 --> 00:38:49.400
that's something
you can quantify.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.899
I think the thing
that's really hard

00:38:50.899 --> 00:38:52.519
to measure is
behavior and attitude

00:38:52.519 --> 00:38:54.060
and how they change
during outbreaks.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.400
And I think they change a
lot, particularly for Ebola.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.130
We see it in some areas,
the epidemic would tail off.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:04.670
And anything you could shove in
a model would not explain that.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.286
There was clearly some
feedback process happening,

00:39:07.286 --> 00:39:09.660
and people were seeing what
was going around and changing

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.110
their behavior accordingly,
and I think just in reaction

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.310
to a lot of other
of these outbreaks.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.820
And that's something
that's quite hard to--

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.960
I think often we try to
measure stuff as proxies.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.990
You can do surveys of
people and their behavior.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.840
But if I ask you what
you're doing today

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.970
and there's a huge
outbreak next year,

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:26.690
can't guarantee you're going
to behave in the same way.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.080
And I think that's
something that

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.720
would be really interesting
to try and understand actually

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.420
what people really do versus
maybe what they say they do

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.480
or what they think they do
and how that has an effect,

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.740
because I think that's a
big gap in our understanding

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.081
of outbreaks certainly.

00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:42.580
AUDIENCE: In the
beginning, you were

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.820
talking about the group that
found the hole in the lottery

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.882
system.

00:39:48.882 --> 00:39:51.090
Did you, while doing your
research for the book, also

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.820
find some fault, some flaw
in a system that you could

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.023
have potentially exploited?

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.640
ADAM KUCHARSKI:
So one example is,

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.540
if you remember back in January,
the UK National Lottery.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.602
So they introduced this rule.

00:40:05.602 --> 00:40:07.310
So they upped the
number of combinations.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.821
So I think it was
previously about 9

00:40:08.821 --> 00:40:10.820
million possible combinations,
and they upped it

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.490
to 45 million.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.040
And unsurprisingly,
this meant they

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.124
didn't have any
winners for ages, which

00:40:16.124 --> 00:40:18.040
is incredibly bad
publicity, because actually,

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.170
for lotteries,
they like winners.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.878
It gives them people
smiling with checks.

00:40:20.878 --> 00:40:22.040
It's good.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.190
An interesting rule-- if it
hit 50 million as a rollover,

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.473
they would redistribute
the prizes to lower tiers.

00:40:27.473 --> 00:40:29.473
So that was one thing
actually I sort of chatted

00:40:29.473 --> 00:40:32.330
with a few people about,
of in that situation,

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.670
if you don't necessary have
to win the jackpot to net 50

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.480
million, that gives you
a positive expectation

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.270
on the lottery.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.620
So actually, the value
of a ticket on average

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.280
is worth more.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.810
But then there's
the issue of, is

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:47.070
expectation of good way
of judging an investment?

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.730
Because you've got a tiny,
tiny chance of winning a lot.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.030
And then again, from
ideas from the book,

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.700
if you actually looked at
that kind of investment,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.640
if you looked it from
a utility point of view

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.940
rather than, if I played
this game an infinite number

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:03.390
of times, I might make a
profit, think of it of,

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:04.810
how much is this worth to me?

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.920
How big a bankroll do
I need to make it worth

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.940
buying a 2-pound ticket.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.640
And actually, in that case,
with these kind of lottery

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.334
rollovers, buying
a single ticket

00:41:12.334 --> 00:41:14.500
is only worth it if you're
a billionaire, basically,

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.100
from a utility point of view,
which is not a great message.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.350
But I think there was a lot
of focus on people saying,

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.390
well, you know,
it's expected value.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.473
It's a great week to play.

00:41:21.473 --> 00:41:24.400
But the nuance of actually how
do you make those decisions,

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.100
I think, was a quite interesting
thing to think about.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.310
MALE SPEAKER: You're talking
about obviously the strategies

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.450
for playing games
and stuff but also

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:36.700
in relationship to banking,
investments, and stuff.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:40.477
Obviously, that's an area where
different people are competing

00:41:40.477 --> 00:41:41.560
with different strategies.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.180
But as soon as one strategy
starts to take hold,

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.000
then that changes the
environment in which

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.166
the strategies are behaving.

00:41:47.166 --> 00:41:50.430
So are there any
interesting things

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.447
happening in trying to predict
not only when you introduce

00:41:53.447 --> 00:41:55.030
a strategy and how
it will do, but how

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:56.830
it will change the environment?

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:57.730
ADAM KUCHARSKI: Yeah,
that's a very good point.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.146
And that's one thing that
people are starting to work more

00:42:00.146 --> 00:42:01.835
actively actually
is-- I think there's

00:42:01.835 --> 00:42:04.180
a lot of focus on finance from
an individual point of view.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.650
You've got a single
investor, a single strategy.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.441
But of course, it's
basically an ecosystem.

00:42:07.441 --> 00:42:10.442
And a few people compare it
to an evolutionary dynamic,

00:42:10.442 --> 00:42:12.150
that if you come up
with a good strategy,

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.100
other people adopt it.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.021
And then it becomes
less successful,

00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:17.020
and then you have to kind
of evolve what you do.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:21.120
And they're saying the
bigger the advantage,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.299
the quicker it's going to decay
in terms of effectiveness,

00:42:24.299 --> 00:42:26.090
because it'll be easier
for people to spot.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:29.480
And I think for these
high-speed things in particular,

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.890
that time scale is quite
short, because if you speed up

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.830
what you're doing, you have such
a big edge over other people

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:38.170
that there's a big incentive
for them to come in.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:41.190
And in one case, for
example, the people

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.794
are building a
hardwire from-- I don't

00:42:42.794 --> 00:42:44.670
know if you heard about this--
from London to New York,

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.100
underneath the flight path,
because it would give them

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.730
a fraction of a second quicker
information on the market.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:55.110
And building that cable
is sufficiently valuable

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.210
to actually get that edge.

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.880
So I think in
particular, as the speed

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.310
increases, that evolutionary
process is increasing a lot.

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:02.570
And I think there's a
lot we don't understand.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:03.840
I mean, you can take
some of the basic ideas

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.340
from ecology, about what happens
when you put lots of people

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:06.870
together.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.860
And one of the classical results
actually from chaos theory

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.856
in the '70s was, if
you have something

00:43:11.856 --> 00:43:13.230
following simple
rules, it can do

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.522
very weird, complicated things.

00:43:14.522 --> 00:43:16.855
I think we're seeing similar
things in finance, that you

00:43:16.855 --> 00:43:19.280
have a load of algorithms
written with 10 lines of code

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.113
sitting together, and
they don't necessarily

00:43:21.113 --> 00:43:22.420
do what you think they'd do.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.024
So I think that's quite an
interesting, important field,

00:43:25.024 --> 00:43:26.690
but one that hasn't
been fully explored.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.560
So it'll be nice to see
what happens in the future.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.370
AUDIENCE: Going back a bit
to the disease outbreaks,

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:34.960
you mentioned that that data
is sometimes not complete.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.830
So I was wondering, where do
you usually get that data?

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.380
And once you get
the results, how

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.100
does that data turn into action?

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.620
Do you just give it
back to the government?

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.299
How does that work?

00:43:45.299 --> 00:43:47.590
ADAM KUCHARSKI: So it varies
depending on the outbreak.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.620
I mean, so with Ebola
and these kind of things,

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.600
ideally you have
data on the cases

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.580
as they're being
collected at the time.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.160
We're working directly with
agencies as well as WHO.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.159
You had Medecins Sans
Frontieres, and these kind

00:44:01.159 --> 00:44:04.710
of groups and actually kind
of converting the data back

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:07.510
into a potential
forecast for them.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:09.060
So I think with
all these things,

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.040
it kind of works best if
you work with the people who

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.581
created the data, because they
understand how it's collected,

00:44:13.581 --> 00:44:15.380
and it's potentially useful.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.796
But I think one
of the things that

00:44:16.796 --> 00:44:19.500
was surprising with Ebola, for
example, is that in many cases,

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.164
people collecting
data in one district

00:44:21.164 --> 00:44:23.330
didn't actually have the
data for the next district.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.460
So we had a situation
where we were synthesizing

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.350
it and visualizing it
and giving it back,

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.790
so they kind of knew what
the border picture was.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.769
And it's quite a
basic data analysis,

00:44:32.769 --> 00:44:35.310
because it's essentially just
cleaning it and visualizing it.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.280
But I think in some of
these situations, that's

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.780
almost the most important
thing-- that you

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.570
can do fancy modeling
in the long term.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:43.390
But really the fundamental
thing on the day

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.910
is, what's the situation?

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:47.291
Is this the kind of idea of
nowcasting for a disease?

00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:48.790
You're always looking
into the past,

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:50.850
because you have
these delays in terms

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:54.320
of how the data come
through and under-reporting

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.320
and those sort of stuff.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.750
So the data that comes
in today might actually

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.690
be representing what
happened a few weeks ago.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.632
So even just making
those adjustments

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:03.590
and giving them back to
the people in the field

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.340
can be quite a useful exercise.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:10.064
AUDIENCE: You've discussed how
in chess, Go, poker, roulette--

00:45:10.064 --> 00:45:11.480
these kind of
games-- there's been

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.780
sound kind of breakthrough
in which someone could

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.770
be pretty much all the others.

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:21.090
What kind of game do you see
next, where this could happen,

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.000
where somebody could
develop a new strategy

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.020
or get more data than anyone
else and beat the system?

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.360
ADAM KUCHARSKI: So which
game might fall next?

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.054
I think poker,
certainly no limits.

00:45:34.054 --> 00:45:35.220
We're kind of at that point.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.630
So there's a
tournament last year,

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:39.350
where bots kind
of played humans.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:41.266
And they played a vast
amount number of hands.

00:45:41.266 --> 00:45:43.600
The humans came out with a
very slightly smaller pot

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.280
on average.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.970
So naturally the
researcher said that

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:48.140
wasn't statistically
significant and the human

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.534
said that they had won.

00:45:49.534 --> 00:45:50.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:53.140
So I think we're reaching
that point where,

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.390
if you talk to professionals,
these games are still safe.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.770
If you talk to the guys
working the algorithms,

00:45:58.770 --> 00:45:59.990
it's only a matter of time.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.900
And I think it's
particularly interesting we

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.540
have these strong feelings about
games that are seen as an art.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.220
So a lot of these
poker kind of games

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.250
are scene as very
experienced players

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:14.150
with intuition and instinct.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.380
I think that's their realm.

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.879
So it's quite interesting as
computers start to come into it

00:46:17.879 --> 00:46:19.630
and challenge those notions.

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:21.796
So yeah, I think that's
going to be the one to watch

00:46:21.796 --> 00:46:23.690
in the next couple years.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:24.690
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:27.880
If there are no more questions,
I think we'll wrap it up here.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.260
Thank you all for coming.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.860
Thank you, Dr. Adam
Kucharski, for being here.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.010
It was a pleasure.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:33.790
Thank you so much.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.840
