00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
How does a family become a family?

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.180
Well, when two people love each other very
much…

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.600
I’m joking, I’m joking – kind of.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.260
As we discussed last week, American families
often form around marriages.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.120
So, romantic relationships can be a first
step in the stages of family life.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.600
It might seem strange to think of dating as
a part of family formation.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.460
After all, when you’re swiping right on
Tinder you’re probably not thinking about
adding that person to your family.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.420
But families are a dynamic social institution,
changing over the course of your life.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.180
What the word “family” conjures in your
mind is going to be very different when you’re
16 versus when you’re 60.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.059
Sociologists say that every family has a life
cycle.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.900
They form, they change, and they sometimes
break apart.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:49.700

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.760
When we talk about the stages of life, we’re
usually talking about organisms – the life cycle
of a mayfly, or something like that.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.480
But just as you pass through developmental
stages from childhood to adulthood to old
age, a family evolves as well.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.060
Sociologists describe this process as the
family life cycle – the developmental stages
that a family passes through over time.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.320
Of course, individual families are different.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.980
Some people might move through the
stages of family in a different order, or skip
some stages all together.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.119
But these stages are meant to describe the
typical life cycle of a modern American family.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.260
The first stage of family life is very cute.
It’s courtship!

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.340
I’m sure you know what courtship means,
but in case it’s on your final:

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.860
It’s the period of developing a relationship with an
eye toward marriage or long term partnership.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.620
So, how do people pair off in different societies?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.420
Well, some cultures – including the US –
put a heavy emphasis on romantic love as the
foundation of a partnership.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.740
Finding the “one” is wrapped up in an idea
that a relationship should be based on affection,
attraction, and passion for your partner.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.540
Other cultures practice arranged marriage, in
which a marriage is negotiated between two families
in order to create stronger bonds between them.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.560
Love isn’t considered a prerequisite for
marriage – though parents may consult the
children’s feelings when picking a spouse.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.640
If the married couple’s shared life eventually
creates bonds of affection, that’s a bonus!

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.740
For those in cultures that celebrate romantic
love, the idea of an arranged marriage often
seems completely unthinkable.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.400
It’s important to recognize, though, that even in
the US, sex and romance typically aren’t the only
foundation of a long-lasting relationship.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.600
Passion is often a less stable basis for a
relationship than marital arrangements based
on social and cultural compatibility.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.540
When the passion fades, if there aren’t other
foundations for the relationship, it may fall apart.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.820
And in fact, even in countries that emphasize romantic
love, societal forces often “arrange” marriages based on
who is socially, economically, and morally compatible.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.640
Societies often encourage homogamy, or marriage
between people with similar social backgrounds, like
educational achievement or class standing.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.180
Another common factor in romantic love is propinquity,
or a physical proximity to another person.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.400
Doesn’t sound very romantic, but we tend
up with people who are just...around, because
we often live near people like ourselves.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.600
Now, of course, courtship doesn’t always
lead to marriage.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.440
In fact, in recent years, marriage rates have
been declining in many high income countries,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.620
partially due to people waiting longer to
marry and partially due to people forgoing
marriage altogether.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.940
Among women who between 35 and 44 in 2010,
around 20% had never been married.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.340
In comparison, for the previous generation at that
age, only 10% of women had never been married.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.360
Even with declining marriage rates, most Americans
will marry at least once.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.120
Marriage – and particularly weddings – are
often seen as a life goal, something to aspire to.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.540
Weddings are not marriages, of course, and for many this stage of settling into a new family comes with changes in expectations of what married life will look like.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.100
How a couple handles the transition from courtship into
marriage is an important predictor of family stability.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.520
Some find that once the honeymoon phase ends –

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.820
that is, the first couple years of marriage when
everything is new and exciting – they are no longer
satisfied in their marriage.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.020
To find passion, some turn to infidelity,
which occurs more often than you might think.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.580
In an anonymous survey of approximately 900 Americans, researchers from the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction at Indiana University

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.980
found that 19% of women and 23% of men
report cheating on their partners at least once.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.300
One outcome of infidelity that may NOT surprise
you is divorce.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.820
You might have heard that half of all marriages
end in divorce.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.410
But that’s not quite accurate.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.200
For one thing, it’s not that every couple
has a 50/50 chance of divorce.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.440
The 50% stat comes from looking at the likelihood
that marriages reach a certain anniversary.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.140
How likely are you to still be together 5
years after marriage?

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.600
What about 20 years?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.640
For couples who married 40 years ago,
we know what percent of those marriages
have ended in divorce –

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.220
and that’s a decent proxy for how many
will ever end in divorce.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.740
For Americans who married in the
1970s and 1980s, about 40 to 45 percent of
those marriages have ended in divorce.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.400
There was a huge surge of divorce in the 1970s,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.100
in part due to many states loosening their restrictions
on who can divorce through No Fault divorce laws,
which allow couples to divorce for any reason.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.480
Prior to No Fault laws, divorce was only allowed if one
spouse could prove abuse, abandonment, or adultery.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.280
Along with the removal of legal barriers,
social norms also changed, with divorce becoming
more socially acceptable.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.520
Plus, increased opportunities for women in
the workforce made it more feasible for women
to leave bad marriages,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.980
because they were better able to support
themselves and their children without a husband.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.660
But the divorce rate in the US has been on
the decline since the 1990s.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.560
Some estimates suggest that the percent of
marriages ending in divorce for more recent
generations will be closer to 1/3 than 1/2

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.840
Why has it declined?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.400
Well, for one thing, fewer people are marrying,
and fewer people are marrying young.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.720
With more people waiting to find a partner until
they’re more settled, marriages have become much
more stable than they were in previous decades.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.800
Plus, the type of people who get married – and
their likelihood of divorce – has changed, too.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.980
Divorce rates are higher for low income
and less educated Americans –

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.660
who are also the socioeconomic group
with the greatest declines in marriage
rates in the last 40 years.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.360
So the fewer who get married, the fewer who
get divorced.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.460
Changing marriage patterns has also meant
changing patterns in the family lifecycle...like
when people have kids.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.080
While childbearing is typically thought
of as the stage of the family life cycle that
follows marriage,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.040
the percent of children born outside of
marriage has been increasing, with about
40% of all births to unmarried mothers.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.920
There are also increasing social class divides
in who has kids before or after marriage:

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:16.700
While only 9% of births to college educated moms take
place outside marriage, 58% of births outside marriage
are to women with only a high school diploma.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.980
But regardless of whether having kids comes
before or after marriage, this stage in the
family life cycle is an important one.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.040
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to talk about
our next family life stage: childrearing.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.360
What a family looks like has changed a lot
in the last couple centuries.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.620
In pre-industrial America, large families
were much more common –

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.120
partially because of a lack of effective birth control,
partially because having more children meant more
hands to help with the work on a farm,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.560
and partially because high rates of child mortality
meant that many kids didn’t live to adulthood.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:55.060
But as child mortality rates declined, and the US
industrialized, the average family size declined from
7 children in 1800 to 3.5 children by 1900.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.120
Nowadays, birth rates are even lower.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.080
The old adage about the American dream being
a house with picket fence, a dog, and 2.5 children
isn’t too far off –

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.860
the average American mom has 2.4 children and
this rate has been pretty stable for the last 30 years.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.820
But when women have children has been changing.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.480
In addition to delaying marriage, women are
also postponing having kids.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.880
The average age at first birth is 26, up from
21 in 1970.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.520
Some of this is due to increased access to
birth control, which allows people to better control
the timing of when they have a child.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.540
And some of it is because raising a kid is
expensive!

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:34.140
Many people want to wait until they’re older
and in a more financially secure position before
they add a third mouth to feed.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:44.080
The US Department of Agriculture estimates that for kids born in 2015, the typical middle class family will spend $233,000 dollars on that kid over the course of their childhood.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:51.020
Clothes, food, toys, transportation, basic education,
medical care – it all adds up pretty fast.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.680
And that figure isn’t even accounting for
the cost of college!

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.840
But even if the cost is high, being a parent
is highly valued in American society.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.280
A 2010 survey found that the majority of
Millenials say that being a good parent is “one
of the most important things” in life –

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.820
ranking it higher than having
a successful marriage.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.940
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.760
The next stage of family life is the launch stage
in which kids grow up and leave their parents’ house,
usually in their early twenties.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.640
Though Mom and Dad might suffer from some
empty nest syndrome when kids first leave,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:24.180
many remain involved in their kids’ lives,
often providing childcare for their grandchildren
once their kids start families of their own.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.380
This post-children stage of family life is
the final part of the family life cycle.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:34.430
Additionally, as life spans increase, many
adult children find themselves in caregiver
roles for their aging parents.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:41.880
The sandwich generation refers to people who care
for their aging parents at the same time that they
provide care for children living in their household.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.180
This is particularly common for women, who are
more likely to take on caregiving roles in a family.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.960
As I said at the beginning, these stages of
the family life cycle are just one path that
a family can follow.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:57.180
There are all types of families and not all
of them will be nuclear families with a mom,
a dad, and a bunch biological offspring.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.540
For one thing, a married couple doesn’t
need to be a man and a woman.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:07.580
In 2015, the US Supreme Court made marriage equality
the law of the land and ruled that all states must
recognize marriages between same-sex couples.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.910
For another, not all married couples have,
or want, children.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.680
Plus, not all families with kids have two
parents.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.420
Single parent families make up about one-third
of all families with children.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.920
Single parent families are most often headed
by a single mother, rather than a single father.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.300
There are also large racial differences in
family structure,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:30.020
with 66% of Black children being raised
in a single parent home compared to only
25% of non-Hispanic white children.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.380
Some of these kids are still growing up in
households with two parents, though –

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.160
58% of unmarried births were to cohabiting couples,
or couples who live together without being married.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.380
Unmarried or divorced parents may also
marry someone new,

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.360
creating a blended family with one parent
in a household who is unrelated to some or
all of the children.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.280
So there’s a lot of diversity in what a
family can look like.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.380
But they often tend to follow similar paths.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.060
But no matter what a family looks like, the
family life cycle helps us understand how
families evolve over time.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:04.300
Today, we looked at one way of thinking about
the different stages of family life: courtship, marriage,
child-rearing, and family life in your later years.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:11.100
We also discussed changing patterns of
marriage and childbearing in the US, highlighting
some of the varied family types that exist.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:17.780
