00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:02.190
GEOFF SCHULLER: One of the
most challenging things

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.660
about designing an
application for Android Auto

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.860
is providing access
to the content

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.080
and the features apps provide
in a simple and usable way,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.970
so drivers can focus
on what they really

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.460
need to be doing in the car.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.470
And that's driving it.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.570
I'm Geoff, and I'm a designer
on the Android Auto team.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.000
We understand these challenges.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.750
And we've created some very
important design patterns

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.590
and guidelines that you can
use when you create or adapt

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.440
your app to work
on Android Auto.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.180
Now it might seem obvious,
but it really must be said.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.680
The most important
thing a driver

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.120
needs to do while they're in the
car is drive, with their eyes

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.130
on the road and their
hands on the wheel.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.570
When designing for drivers,
it's important to remember

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.550
that driving is
their primary task,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.610
and using Android Auto
is a secondary task.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.580
When we designed
Android Auto, our goal

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.100
was to simplify all interactions
and minimize distraction.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.960
Every part of the interface
has been carefully considered.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.410
And sometimes, this
requires tough decisions

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.390
to be made to ensure simplicity.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.040
As an example, we've set
a goal that all tasks

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.850
should be completed in six
button presses or less.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.530
This is a very
important guideline.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.630
And it's enforced
via our platform

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.910
when drivers interact
with items in the drawer.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.210
If you want to provide a
great Android Auto experience

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.502
for your users, keep watching.

00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:24.210
We're about to tell
you how we accomplish

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.210
this in the applications
we designed for drivers.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.870
Now as an interaction designer
on the Android Auto team,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.050
I'm responsible for taking
apps like Google Play

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.081
Music and the Dialer and making
them ready for use in the car.

00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:38.580
And that could be
pretty challenging

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.140
when you consider
how many contacts

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.080
and how much music we
all have in our phones.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.960
Typical Android users have
anywhere between 100 and 1,000

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.110
contacts on their phones, and
up to 18 days' worth of music.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.990
Even more if you use a
music subscription service.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.400
How can you possibly
browse through the list

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.430
of who you want to
call or what you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.000
want to listen to when you've
got that much content to choose

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.870
from?

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.670
The truth is, you can't.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.780
While designing Google
Play Music and Dialer

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.820
for Android Auto,
we had to find a way

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.680
to provide access
to the features

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.260
and content in those apps while
staying within the six step

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.570
limit.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.000
It was challenging.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.460
And it is possible.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.120
Here's how we did it.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.740
First, we took a good hard
look at each application

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.800
and thought about the
things that drivers really

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.960
needed while driving.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.410
In Dialer, we focused
on speed dial,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.400
because it already
provides a nice way

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.870
to call the people that
we talk to the most.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.840
We kept the list
short, so drivers

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.460
wouldn't have to scroll through
very many items while driving.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.220
Four pages is the most.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.640
No more than that.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.230
And we used voice commands
for complex interactions

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.480
like calling a contact
that doesn't already

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.460
appear in speed dial.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.580
It's much easier to tap
the mic and say something

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.270
like, call Benmont Tench,
rather than scrolling

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.720
through a long list of
contacts to find him.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.170
We put other functionality
like voicemail,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.720
dial a number, missed calls,
and call history in the drawer,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.910
so drivers could access
those if they needed them.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.560
And again, we kept
the list short,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.220
only displaying four pages of
missed calls and call history.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.950
You really don't need more
than that while you're driving.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.660
All of these design
choices helped

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.910
us to keep interactions
simple and achievable

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.300
and six taps or less.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.871
Now let's look at
Google Play Music.

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.370
When you look at
the mobile version,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.960
you'll see many things that
are useful for drivers--

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.670
things like listen now,
playlists, and radio.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.270
Those are great, and we included
them in the Android Auto

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.950
version, but shortened the list
length to four pages' worth

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.875
of items, so the driver could
find what they want and select

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:47.810
it in six taps or less.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.120
Now let's look at
Explorer and My Library.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.170
These have many categories
and long lists of content.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.710
It really isn't possible
to browse all the content

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.170
in these categories
effectively while driving.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.880
So what did we do?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.030
Well, we chose to
use voice commands

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.520
to say things like,
play Tom Petty,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.400
or play "Full Moon Fever," or
play "Runnin' Down a Dream."

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.350
This is a much faster
way to play something

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.890
by an artist, or an
album, or a song.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.279
Let's listen to something else.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.030
Play "Stop Stalling."

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.130
COMPUTER VOICE: Playing
"Stop Stalling."

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.963
[MUSIC - DERBY, "STOP STALLING"]

00:04:33.282 --> 00:04:34.740
GEOFF SCHULLER: If
you want drivers

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.380
to be able to use voice
commands in your app,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.010
implement the play this
item on this app command.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.450
There's a whole DevByte
on that right here.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.230
We realized that
designing for drivers

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.730
requires you to consider things
that you wouldn't normally

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.000
have to do when you're
designing a mobile app.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.830
And we know this
can be a challenge.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.970
But we're here to help.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.900
We published some very helpful
design patterns and guidelines,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.910
which you can use to adapt
your app for Android Auto.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.470
You can check them
out right here.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.870
And I'll cover a few of the
important ones right now.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.030
First, take a good
hard look at your app

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.880
and think about the
things drivers really

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.770
need while driving.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.970
Next, think about
the voice commands

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.350
you can add to make it
easier for drivers to do

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.480
the things they need to do.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.120
Last, and most importantly,
keep your lists short

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.330
and the depth of your
content hierarchy shallow,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.420
and understand that
Android Auto's drawer

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.930
code keeps track of the taps.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.430
Every tap the driver
uses to open the drawer

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.470
and scroll forward through
the content is counted.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.650
And the driver can only
tap five more times

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.450
once the drawer's open to find
and tap the item they want.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.700
If your content
hierarchy is too deep,

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.310
the driver will run out of
taps and will be stopped

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.320
from browsing any further.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.280
You can avoid this by
doing the following.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.490
Only include the content and
categories the driver really

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.440
needs while driving.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.770
Next, limit the first level of
the drawer to one or two pages.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.080
And last, know that any
forward scrolls or taps

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.740
the driver performs
in level one reduces

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.280
the amount of content
and categories

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.380
they can see on
subsequent levels.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.360
If you follow the two
and three level drawer

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.180
patterns that we provided
at the developer website

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.380
and keep your nav
hierarchy shallow,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.460
drivers will be able to
access the content they

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.130
care about the
most while driving

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.080
and will have a great
experience while using

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.450
your app in Android.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.600
Thanks for watching, and
we wish you all the best

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.760
as you design your app for
the Android Auto driver.
