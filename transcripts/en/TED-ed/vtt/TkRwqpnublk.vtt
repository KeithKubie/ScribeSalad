00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:04.004
What's the worst job you've ever had?

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.950
I have not had very many bad jobs in my life.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.850
I've always done things that I was interested in.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.428
All the jobs have had awful moments.

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:17.887
The key thing is to just keep moving.
