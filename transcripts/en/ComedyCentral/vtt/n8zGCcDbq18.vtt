00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.191
THEY'RE DYING.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:25.292
THEY'RE STARVING.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.428
THEY HAVE NO AMMUNITION,
NO LOVE.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.631

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:31.698
GEORGE WASHINGTON SAYS,

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:33.967
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.068

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.879
HE'S STRETCHING THEM
THROUGH THE STRETCHERS.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.047
HE'S YELLING AT THEM

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.549
AND THEY GO,
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.485
WASHINGTON IS LIKE, OH, BOY.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:52.953
THE GUY DOESN'T
EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH,

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.588
SO HE SAYS,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:55.622
BLAH, BLAH.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.057
AND THEY HEAR,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.225

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.360

VON STEUBEN TURNS OVER

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.682
STEUBEN'S INTO BLONDES

THEY HAVE THIS--THIS--

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.865

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:39.466
[Survivor's <i>Eye of the Tiger]</i>

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:43.203
SO BENJAMIN WALKER ENDS UP
BEING EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.705
HE HELPS THEM WITH THE TROOPS.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.640
VON STEUBEN
STARTS TEACHING THEM THINGS.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.742
HE'S LIKE, THESE ARE KNIVES.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.410
YOU CAN USE THEM
TO STAB PEOPLE.

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:52.946
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
OH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.282
HE TEACHES THEM
HOW TO CLEAN THEIR TEETH.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:56.917
TEACHES THEM
HOW TO CLEAN THEIR BODIES

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.385
SO THEY DON'T GET DISEASE.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.487
PEOPLE WERE LIKE, WE'RE JUST
TRYING TO WIN A WAR, MAN.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.990
AND HE WAS LIKE,
THIS IS HOW YOU WIN A WAR.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.892
- ♪ IT'S THE EYE
OF THE TIGER ♪

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:06.894
- THEY START TRAINING HARDER,
AND THEN HE SAYS,

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:09.062
BEN WALKER, YELL AT THEM
IN ENGLISH,

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.431
AND THAT GUY SAYS,
MORE SQUATS.

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.066
