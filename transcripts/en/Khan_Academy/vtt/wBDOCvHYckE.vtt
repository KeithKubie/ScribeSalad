00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.420
Let's keep doing some problems.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.630
So in the last time I said,
what are the chances of not

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.480
getting any heads if I flip the
coin-- I was going to say dice,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.890
but I realized we're
dealing with a coin.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.580
If we flip the coin seven
times, if you said, well,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.200
that's the same thing as
getting 7 tails in a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.950
row, and that's 1/2
to the seventh power.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.980
Because each trial there's a
1/2 chance of getting the exact

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.140
thing that we want, which
in this case is tails.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.210
And you multiply it times
itself seven times

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330
and you get 1/128.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.790
It actually turns out that
there are actually 1/128

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.530
possible results that we can
get, equally probable results.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.680
And why do I say that?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.460
Well, what's the probability of
getting-- I don't know-- all

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.600
heads and then the last
flip I get is tails?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.770
So heads, heads, heads,
heads-- so I'm doing it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.540
seven times, rights?

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.630
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then
the last time I get a tails.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.820
If you can think of it, this is
exactly 1 particular result out

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.140
of the total results
that we can get.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.270
And what's the
probably of this?

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.600
Well, there's a 1/2 chance of
getting a heads, 1/2 chance of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.760
a heads, 1/2 chance of heads--
let me switch colors-- 1/2

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.720
chance of a heads, 1/2 chance
of a heads, 1/2 chance of a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.750
heads, and then 1/2
chance of a tails.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.650
Once again, this is just 1/2
times 1/2 times 1/2 times

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.580
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2,
which is equal to 1/128.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.690
So any particular-- I don't
want to say combination because

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.910
we'll learn a little bit about
permutations and combinations

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.080
in future videos.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.620
But any particular set of
circumstances we want is 1

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.110
out of 128 of the total
number of outcomes.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.600
That what I should use.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.280
Instead of circumstances,
outcomes.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.490
If I have any particular
outcome-- so this is a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.090
particular outcome, the way to
view it is there are 128

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.480
particular outcomes, so if I
choose one of them my odds of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060
getting it is 1 out of 128.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.310
So let me ask you a question.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.470
What's the probability of
getting exactly 1 heads?

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.230
So what does this mean?

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.790
This means I could get-- oh, I
could get tails, tails, tails

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.490
and-- let's say we're doing it
five times just so I don't

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.610
waste too much time.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.655
Out of 5 rolls, out of 5 flips.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.130
So that could be
tails, tails, heads.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.290
That could be-- as you
can tell, I switched

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.460
colors arbitrarily.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.320
That could be tails, tails,
tails, head, tails.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.210
I think you get the pattern.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.350
Tails, tails, heads,
tails, tails.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.120
That could be tails, heads,
tails, tails, tails.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.620
That could be tail-- oh sorry.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.270
That could be heads,
tails, tails, tails.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.160
So if we look at this way
there's this probability.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.280
There's actually how many
events, how many outcomes,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.730
would satisfy this
statement, exactly 1 heads?

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.320
Well, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.070
And the way you could think
of it is we're going to do

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.840
5 flips, exactly 1 of the
flips is going to be heads.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.860
It could be any 1
of those 5 flips.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.050
There are 5 situations
in which that happens.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.860
And notice, I said
exactly one heads.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.750
Because if I said at least 1
heads then we would have to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.060
take into circumstances where
we have 2 heads and then it

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.070
becomes more complicated.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.910
We'll learn more about that
when we do combinations.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.720
So what are the chances of any
one of these possible outcomes?

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.890
Well, if we just
look at this one.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.830
There's a chance of 1/2,
1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, so it's

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.610
1/2 to the fifth power.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.960
Which is equal to 1/32.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.770
And you use the same
logic each to these.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:12.500
This is 1/32, 1/32,
1/32, 1 out of 32.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.480
And in general, when I'm
flipping a fair coin five times

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.510
in a row there are going to
be 32 possible outcomes.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.720
And each of these is just 1
of the particular outcome.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.980
And we're essentially saying,
out of the 32 outcomes, 5

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.780
satisfy the event that we're
looking for-- exactly 1

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.690
heads out of 5 flips.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.710
So there are 5 that satisfy it
out of a total of 32 outcomes.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.060
And so using that definition
only if we can say that all

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.580
of the outcomes are
equally probable.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.200
The probability is 5/32.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.900
And then you could say, well,
let me make it a little

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.820
bit more complicated.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:07.180
What is the probability of not
getting exactly one head?

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.500
So here there is a lot more
circumstances that satisfy it.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.410
So for example, let me
throw out a couple

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.285
that would satisfy it.

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:15.090
Well, you could get all tails.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.865
But also, if you got 2 heads
that would satisfy it because

00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:25.780
you didn't get exactly 1 head,
So this would also satisfy it.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.300
And so you might say, well,
if we do it like this

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.320
it's really complicated.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:36.440
Or you could say, well, these
5/32 are the only outcomes that

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.580
don't satisfy-- that do not
satisfy this condition.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.590
So the rest of the what?

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.800
32 minus 5 is what?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.660
27.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.390
The other 27 outcomes
will satisfy this.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.710
So you could say that this
is equal to-- and this is

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.760
a common trick in a lot
of probability problems.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:02.130
This is equal to 1 minus the
probability of getting exactly

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.325
one heads out of 5 flips.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.620
And that is equal to-- 1 is
the same thing as 32/32.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.220
Minus-- what's the
probability of this?

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.960
We figured it out.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.120
It's 5/32.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.220
And that equals 27/32.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.090
So that's just always
something to keep in mind.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.820
Sometimes when you get a
probability problem it seems

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.970
difficult to solve that
problem, but it's actually

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.780
not that difficult to solve
the opposite problem.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.060
So you say, well, it's hard for
me to directly figure out the

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.650
probability of not getting
exactly one heads; I'd have to

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.170
know combinations
and all of this.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.430
But this is the opposite of
getting exactly one heads,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.860
and that's an easier thing
for me to figure out.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.230
So if I can figure out that
probability, all of the other

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.930
outcomes would satisfy
the opposite one.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.830
Hope I didn't confuse you.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.160
So anyway, everything we've
done so far, it's been dealing

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.530
with coins and fair coins and
that's interesting to a certain

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.660
degree, but let's make it so
that the different outcomes

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.380
have different probabilities.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.680
Let's do free throw percentages
because I think this is

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.990
something that we all-- if we
watch basketball or play

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.220
any basketball, we're
familiar with the idea.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.010
So let's say that I, and this
is not true, I only could

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.720
wish-- let's say that I have
an 80% free throw percentage.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.940
So that means every time I go
to take a free throw there's an

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:37.260
80% chance there's a basket and
that there's a 20% chance

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.210
there's no basket.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.390
How does this come up with?

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.780
Well, we'll do more on
statistics later and they're

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.730
really-- probability and
statistics are opposite

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.850
sides of the same I guess
coin, you could say.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.690
But someone says OK, out of the
last hundred times Sal took

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.010
free throws he's made 80.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.420
So in general, he has an 80%
chance of making a particular

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.720
free throw, but it might
not have been a hundred.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.840
I might have taken a thousand
free throws and I made 800.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.850
But that's where you come
up with the 80% from.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.270
So that's fair enough.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:12.745
So the 80% is p, and then
a common notation is

00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:16.080
the 20% is 1 minus p.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.020
If I have an 80% chance of
making the shot, I have a 20%

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.990
chance of missing the shot.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.210
So my question to you, let's
do kind of the same examples

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.620
we did with the coins.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:34.140
What's the probability of me
making-- I don't know-- 3 shots

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:40.710
in a row, 3 baskets in a row,
or 3 free throws in a row?

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.045
I'm going to say free throws
because this is my free

00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:45.130
throw percentage, not my
overall shot percentage.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.430
Well, by the same logic
it's going to be equal.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.910
The first one I would have to
get right, then the second one

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.780
I would have to get-- I would
have to get a basket and

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.460
there's a 20% I have no basket.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.240
And then the third one I
would have an 80% chance

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.570
of getting a basket.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.060
So this is-- I didn't draw
the rest of the tree.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.430
It gets pretty broad.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.940
But in general, just from the
coin example you can just

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.046
multiply these probabilities.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.460
So 80% is the same thing
as 0.8, so you get 0.8

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.080
to the third power.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.780
I don't know, what is that?

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.820
Let me see.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:30.940
It is 0.8 times 0.8 times
0.8 is equal to 51.2

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:40.340
or 0.512-- 51.2%.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.880
So I have slightly better than
even odds of making 3 free

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.790
throws in a row, which
is pretty good.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.030
And as you can see, I don't
have an exponent on this

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.380
cheapo Windows provided
calculator I use.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.380
I have to apologize for that.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.465
So we might to limit
our exponent size.

00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:57.230
But anyway, that should
hopefully-- well, that's

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.910
a little bit of a taste.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.830
In the next video I'll do a lot
more examples with the free

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.420
throws and the basket, and
we'll even learn a little bit

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.620
