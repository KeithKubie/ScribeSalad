[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.400
APRAJITA JAIN: Good
morning, everyone.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.040
And good evening to everyone
who's joining us over

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.770
live stream from
Europe and India.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.400
My name is Aprajita Jain.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.540
I'm an Executive Summits
Evangelist at Google.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.450
But more importantly, I live,
breathe, and sleep Bollywood.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.090
When I found out a few weeks
ago that Arjun Rampal is going

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.090
to be joining us here at
Google and sitting right here

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.890
next to me in this very chair
I started hyperventilating.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.790
All good now.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.700
I meditated last night.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.920
Arjun Rampal, a National
Film Award winner, a model,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.740
an actor, a producer, and the
breaker of many a girl's heart,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.200
is here today at
Google to talk to us

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.710
about his career, his movies,
his social engagements,

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.290
his businesses, and
most importantly

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.370
about the upcoming movie that he
produced and acted in, "Daddy."

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.456
Let's play a teaser
clip of that movie.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:03.682
APRAJITA JAIN: Let's play a
teaser clip of the movie again.

00:06:22.942 --> 00:06:23.650
That's all right.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.630
Technical issues,
Google-- synonyms.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.760
Should we queue it up later?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.300
Fantastic.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.600
No problem.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.320
So in the meanwhile,
everyone please join me

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.096
in welcoming none other
than Arjun Rampal.

00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:47.008
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:48.920
ARJUN RAMPAL: Hello.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.590
Hello, hello.

00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:53.820
Hi.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.320
Thank you.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.230
APRAJITA JAIN: Welcome, Arjun.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.490
ARJUN RAMPAL: Thank you.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.280
Hello.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.565
How's everybody doing?

00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:00.190
Do I sit there?

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.981
APRAJITA JAIN: Yes.

00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:02.650
ARJUN RAMPAL: OK, cool.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.030
OK, I can see all of you now.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.570
APRAJITA JAIN: See, you have
both your sides are pretty.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.730
For me, it's only one side.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.270
So I had to pick this.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.660
ARJUN RAMPAL: Pretty?

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.569
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:09.110
Good looking.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.818
ARJUN RAMPAL: Oh.

00:07:09.818 --> 00:07:12.730
That's not a nice thing
to say to a guy-- pretty.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.540
OK.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.790
Oh, it's wonderful to be here.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.760
So thank you.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.990
Thank you for coming
early in the morning.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.210
Google was insisting
that I have a nice round

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.200
tour of all the headquarters,
so I went to the wrong campus

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.417
and to the wrong campas
and now finally I'm here.

00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:29.500
But it's great to be here.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.600
APRAJITA JAIN: Well,
finally, welcome to Google.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.370
We are thrilled
to have you here.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.660
ARJUN RAMPAL: No, it's
wonderful to be here.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.243
APRAJITA JAIN: As
you can see, there's

00:07:36.243 --> 00:07:37.780
many Googlers in
the audience live.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.650
But we also have many of
your fans watching you

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.020
from around the globe on
YouTube live right now.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.145
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah, I know.

00:07:45.145 --> 00:07:47.219
So hello to all
of them watching.

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:48.760
APRAJITA JAIN: And
I know they're all

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.820
eager to hear from you,
so we'll jump right in.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.740
And my first question
for you, Arjun,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.530
is you had been in the
Bay Area a few weeks ago.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.630
You came to promote
something which we'll

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.864
talk about in just a minute.

00:07:59.864 --> 00:08:01.780
But what are your
impressions of the Bay Area?

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.900
And what does this place
tell you about-- do you ever

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.250
want to make a movie out here?

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.666
ARJUN RAMPAL: You know, actually
I was just thinking that,

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:11.710
because I was in this
small, little hotel.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.570
And it was so lonely.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.670
And I was just sitting there.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.840
And there were all these people
with backpacks and, you know,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.660
young kids just moving
around that place.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.890
And I'm thinking,
OK, who's that guy?

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.310
I wonder what app he's making.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.860
And I wonder what
app he's making.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.775
And I wonder what
he's coming up with.

00:08:30.775 --> 00:08:33.150
So you know, you don't know
what's really going on there,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.880
because it is--

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.429
it's got a nice, calm energy.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.120
And I think it
kind of brings you

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.250
a certain amount of solutude,
where you can really

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.900
sit and think.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.210
And I've got a lot to
think actually yesterday,

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.800
so I'm glad I was here.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.410
And I would love to come
back and visit and explore.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.590
And if I could make a
movie here, it'd be great.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.310
Yeah.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.710
But if any of you have a
nice app I can invest in,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.140
please let me know
before I leave.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.060
APRAJITA JAIN: I'm sure there
will be plenty of ideas here.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.176
OK, so all political
correctness aside,

00:09:05.176 --> 00:09:06.550
I'm going to use
this opportunity

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.430
to tell you that you have
been one of my biggest

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.680
celebrity crushes growing up.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.210
Not only have been,
you still are.

00:09:15.775 --> 00:09:19.990
Being a business graduate,
I think in matrices a lot.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.970
So imagine, there's this matix
of an x-axis that shows you

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.330
the Greek godlike
looks of an actor,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.700
and there is a y-axis
that shows you the--

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.130
ARJUN RAMPAL: Are we talking
Silicon Valley language?

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:33.460
I don't understand.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.376
APRAJITA JAIN: No, no.

00:09:34.376 --> 00:09:37.020
I'm just talking basic maths.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.580
So let's say there's
looks over here

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.890
and superior acting skills here.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.630
You'll find many
Bollywood stars that

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.820
are on the far bottom right--

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.970
great looking-- and you'll
find many that are on the left

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.080
corner there--

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.600
amazing acting skills, but
so-so in the looks department.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.870
You for me are on
the up and the right

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.100
that covers both these areas.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.850
So with this versatility
and you know,

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.900
being a fantastic actor as well
as jaw-droppingly good looking,

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.490
tell me a little
bit more about--

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.240
and we know a lot about it--

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.364
ARJUN RAMPAL: It sounds
like a great app, you know?

00:10:09.364 --> 00:10:10.698
Just now, I mean, what she said.

00:10:10.698 --> 00:10:12.239
APRAJITA JAIN: Like
Rate Your Actors?

00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:13.610
ARJUN RAMPAL: The Crush App.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.830
APRAJITA JAIN: No, but
tell me a little bit more

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.230
about how you moved from
modeling into acting,

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.270
and take us on that ramp.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.010
ARJUN RAMPAL:
Yeah, so actually I

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.100
was going to be studying
finance and business.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.320
And I was really into sports.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.630
I was running 400 meters.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.890
I ran state level.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.950
And I really never
thought that I

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.200
would get into the
entertainment business

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.630
because nobody
from my family was.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.400
In fact, they're more
from the army side.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.680
Everybody wanted me
to join the army.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.620
My dad didn't join the army, but
both my dadaji and nanaji both

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.720
were from the army,
very decorated.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.010
So I did not think--

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.550
I was the only
boy, so obviously I

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.130
didn't think I had
any score or chances.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.800
I loved watching the movies.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.390
From when I was
a kid, I remember

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.670
I used to go watch the
movies first day, first show,

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.950
and then dressed like those
heroes for a little while.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.295
But I didn't think that that
means that there's something--

00:11:12.295 --> 00:11:15.640
that it's going to be
pulling me towards acting.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.200
So one day I was at a nightclub.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.090
And this designer saw me.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.640
And he said, are you a model
and would you like to model?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.690
So I thought he was
making a pass at me.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.710
And I was like, no, sir.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.340
No.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.249
No interest in modeling.

00:11:30.249 --> 00:11:32.290
But actually it turned
out to be a family friend.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.740
His name was Rohit Bal, who is
now one of my closest friends.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.750
And from there, I was
an economic student,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.480
and economically it
made a lot of sense

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.700
to me that [INAUDIBLE] to go and
stand on or walk on the ramp,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.720
or wear some very nice clothes.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.170
It pays you a lot
more than I would

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:55.040
be getting paid by any bank
or any financial institute

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.990
that I'd be working for,
unless of course I owned it.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.050
So from there-- and
I really enjoyed it.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.700
From there, it kind of grew--

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.380
one thing grew into another.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.550
I worked with wonderful people,
like Ashok Mehta, Skehar Kapur,

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.730
through my modeling
career, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.780
who kind of insisted
that I get into acting

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.280
and to the movie business.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.790
Then I came to New York.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.200
I wanted to study
filmmaking here

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.870
and enrolled in NYU film school.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.700
But by the time
I went back home,

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.060
Ashok Mehta I had this film
called "Moksha," which I did.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.020
And once I bit that
Apple, like Adam bit his,

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.750
I was completely taken
in into this industry.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.000
And I'm really glad
that that happened.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.800
So a lot of credit to Ashok-ji,
may his soul rest in peace.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.260
He's not with us anymore.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.460
But truly, from
there, Rajiv Rai,

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.480
all these people in the
beginning who really,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.600
really helped me
from being a nobody

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.819
to reach wherever I reach.

00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:57.110
APRAJITA JAIN: We are very
grateful to all these people

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.943
too, because otherwise
we wouldn't know you.

00:12:58.943 --> 00:13:00.740
So thank you.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.836
Now, the teaser is
back up, so let's watch

00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:05.210
the teaser really
quick before we

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.707
jump into our next questions.

00:13:06.707 --> 00:13:08.540
ARJUN RAMPAL: Oh, you
didn't see the teaser?

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.330
APRAJITA JAIN: There was
a technical glitch before.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.720
ARJUN RAMPAL: At Google, hm.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.880
APRAJITA JAIN: So we get
to watch it together.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.748
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:13.748 --> 00:13:17.396
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:13:17.627 --> 00:13:19.210
ARJUN RAMPAL: We
need some volume, no?

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.500
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:01.662
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:18.526 --> 00:14:19.518
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:19.518 --> 00:14:20.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:20.940
APRAJITA JAIN: Fantastic.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.560
ARJUN RAMPAL: So that
was just a teaser,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.770
but you'll get to
see a lot more.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.978
APRAJITA JAIN: Just a teaser.

00:14:24.978 --> 00:14:27.700
And I don't know if
I told everyone yet,

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.680
but Arjun is here
today officially

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.829
to unveil the theatrical
trailer of "Daddy,"

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:34.120
which we'll watch in just a
little bit together, right?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.540
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.831
And you'll also get to know
when the film is releasing.

00:14:36.831 --> 00:14:39.640
And so I thought it would be
kind of unique to come and do

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.290
it here, you know, because
obviously the digital medium

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.750
has gotten so huge right now.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.530
And I had that opportunity
to come here and have

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.630
a talk with all of you.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.540
So I said, it'd be a nice
way to just come and give you

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.630
my trailer.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.860
We will do a big launch
in India, usually,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.750
but we're doing it here
for the first time.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:06.310
A lot of people ask me, why
are you launching a Hindi movie

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.150
thing at Google?

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.580
I was like, yeah,
Google is universal.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.870
And you know-- and I
think it makes sense

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.470
because digitally I think
today everybody watches it.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.950
And so you'll push this and
make it go completely viral

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.610
and make sure everybody is
going to go and watch "Daddy."

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:29.605
And excuse me,
technical, sir, [HINDI]..

00:15:29.605 --> 00:15:30.563
APRAJITA JAIN: [HINDI].

00:15:30.563 --> 00:15:31.370
ARJUN RAMPAL: Hi.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.150
Can put the volume
a little higher

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.581
when you play the trailer?

00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:35.080
Yeah?

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.970
Thank you.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:36.515
OK.

00:15:36.515 --> 00:15:37.390
APRAJITA JAIN: Great.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.140
Fantastic.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.620
So you have been one of the
most versatile Bollywood actors.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.990
And you're going to show
us yet another facet

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.910
of your skill in this movie.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.720
Tell us a little bit more
about how did this come about,

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.270
where did you get the
idea from, and why did you

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.362
go about making a movie about
a mobster in the first place?

00:15:55.362 --> 00:15:57.820
ARJUN RAMPAL: Well, you see,
the first thing is, basically,

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.260
every gangsters--

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.420
I mean, every actor's
dream is really

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.350
to play a gangster at one
point in their lives, you know.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.945
I'm sure a lot of your
boys will agree with me.

00:16:08.945 --> 00:16:10.850
Do you agree with me,
a lot of you guys?

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.440
You like that
gangster film, right?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.411
I mean, you want to
play that one gangster.

00:16:14.411 --> 00:16:16.160
And there have been
so many gangster films

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.475
that have been made, like
"The Godfather," "Goodfellas,"

00:16:19.475 --> 00:16:26.840
"Scarface," you know, "Satya,"
[INAUDIBLE],, "Company," really

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.700
good films that have come out.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.590
And I was wondering,
now, who could I play?

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.720
And there were these
guys who came up

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.720
to me, who were producers
earlier on this film,

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.260
and they said, we'd like
you to play Arun Gawli.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.590
Now, Arun Gawli, I said.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.110
OK.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.440
But what's the resemblance?

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.390
I mean, how do we
even look alike?

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.480
Because if you see Arun
Gawli, and please Google him,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.130
you will know--

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.480
so once you know, it's
completely different,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.480
the way we look.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.380
But I started
reading up about him.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.740
And I found his life
extremely intriguing.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.720
And I found him a very reluctant
kind of a gangster, which

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.125
was very, very different.

00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:12.500
It wasn't the gangster who
was going to be walking around

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.270
with all guns blazing.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.790
He was a guy who used his mind.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:21.470
He was a guy who went
through a journey, which--

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.040
from gangster, turned
into a politician,

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.579
was called the Robin Hood.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.500
And what was the most
amazing part of it

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.860
was that people call him Daddy.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.200
They don't call him by--
they don't call him Don.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.300
They don't call him, you know--

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.020
you know, whatever,
other terms that you

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.630
use for gangsters in India.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.500
They call him Daddy.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.230
Why would somebody
call him Daddy?

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.680
Because he actually went
out there and looked

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.700
after a lot of people.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.332
APRAJITA JAIN: Interesting.

00:17:49.332 --> 00:17:50.790
ARJUN RAMPAL: But
at the same time,

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.266
we wanted not to make this film
a very propaganda kind of film.

00:17:55.266 --> 00:17:57.140
But I was still not
impressed with the script

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.740
that came to me earlier.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.800
So I kept rejecting
it, rejecting it,

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.690
but I got very upset with it.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.420
And in that process
of my obsession,

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.860
I locked myself in a hotel
room for three months,

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.800
and I started
writing this story.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.130
And suddenly the story
came about and got life.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.730
And then I gave it to one
of my biggest critics,

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:23.660
who is the director
of this film, whose

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.490
name is Ashim Ahluwalia.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.410
And he's a really, really
fantastic director.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.550
He'd made this film called "Miss
Lovely," which did really well

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.690
in the Cannes,
indie film circuit.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.890
He's extremely great
with detailing.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.850
And everybody's asked him to
make a movie, and he said no.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.260
So I gave him the script.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.020
I said, he's going to rip it
apart because I don't know

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.000
if he'll-- you know?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.612
And he read the script.

00:18:48.612 --> 00:18:49.820
And he said, dude, I love it.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.361
I'm doing it.

00:18:50.361 --> 00:18:52.670
I said, but Ashim, I
don't want you to do it.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.980
I was just asking you
to read the script.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.585
I don't want you to direct it.

00:18:56.585 --> 00:18:57.800
But he said, no, dude.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.730
I'm doing the script.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:59.340
I love it.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.820
But we're going to tweak it.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.990
So Ashim and me kind of
co-wrote it after that.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.670
It was a long process.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.950
Then we got the permissions
from the family.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.350
We did a tremendous
amount of research.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.940
See?

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.860
He took me to all
these crazy locations,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.750
like you're seeing,
which are rat infested.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.550
And I'll make a confession here.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.250
I have-- I hate rats, OK?

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.920
I can fight a tiger, but if
you put a rat in front of me,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.700
I will run away from that room.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.920
So he's got this really
great aesthetic sense.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.930
This is all his framing.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.860
So it's-- and to create
that world, we needed Ashim.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.141
And then we went out
there and we made it.

00:19:39.141 --> 00:19:41.390
APRAJITA JAIN: And how was
Arun Gawli himself involved

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.960
in that process?

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.000
Did you meet him a lot?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.264
Did you ask him about his
past life and what he did?

00:19:46.264 --> 00:19:47.180
ARJUN RAMPAL: So, yes.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.820
I did have the opportunity
to meet him a couple of times

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.090
when he came out on parole.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.760
And of course met a
lot with the people

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.470
who are involved with
him, like the shooters,

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:05.930
the people who were part
of his gang at that time.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.950
He's in prison now, so he
does come out on parole.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.650
And he's a very, very--
what was really amazing

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.710
about him was that he is
not at all intimidating.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.062
He is actually very humble.

00:20:18.062 --> 00:20:19.437
APRAJITA JAIN:
He's Daddy, right?

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:20.720
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:26.230
And what's really amazing
about him is that--

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.580
they're very gentle.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.100
And they have so many--

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.690
they're so well
mannered, you know?

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.050
They speak with a lot of
respect, what you call tehzeeb.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.840
You know, they have a
lot of good manners.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.700
They speak really, really well.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.020
They're not-- they
don't raise their voice.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.020
And it was amazing.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.230
It was amazing to see that,
get that body language.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.530
And one day we were
shooting in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.740
And he was also
out at that time,

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.540
so he was watching
a bit of the shoot.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.380
So he was sitting like this
and I was sitting here,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.130
and then he went away somewhere.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.400
And it was really strange.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.320
One of his relatives came out--

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.690
and I was dressed
like this, OK--

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.580
and came out and
touched my feet.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.200
They thought it was--

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.320
so that was, I think,
the biggest compliment

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.030
that happened in [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.611
And so yeah.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.360
There have been a lot
of great experiences

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.693
that have happened through here.

00:21:21.693 --> 00:21:23.840
It's not been an easy
film to make, because we

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.880
wanted to keep it realistic.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.310
We wanted not it
to be a propaganda

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:33.290
film, where you are
kind of glamorizing

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.150
a life of a gangster.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.230
But we wanted to keep
it true to what it was.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.830
We also believe that
there is a story out there

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:47.510
where somebody goes to jail,
serves his time, you know,

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.690
comes out, and we send
the person to jail

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.600
really to want that
person to reform.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.390
But do we really
honestly as a society

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.490
give that person
a second chance?

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.162
That is something also you get
to explore through the film.

00:22:03.162 --> 00:22:04.530
APRAJITA JAIN: Fantastic.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.290
Well, you have really whet
our appetite about this movie,

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.850
about-- you talked
so much about it.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.940
And we saw in the teaser that
your look is very different

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.420
as well in the movie.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.680
So let's take this opportunity
to actually officially unveil

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.310
the trailer.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.840
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yes, let's do
it, right here, for all of you.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.940
APRAJITA JAIN: Have us
and everybody on YouTube

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.065
give us a chance to see it.

00:22:21.065 --> 00:22:22.935
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah, let's do it.

00:22:22.935 --> 00:22:25.840
And sound, volume up.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.340
OK.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.030
[FILM DIALOGUE IN HINDI]

00:24:42.688 --> 00:24:46.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:48.122 --> 00:24:50.820
APRAJITA JAIN: You don't
look anything like yourself

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.260
in this movie.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.220
How did they do that?

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.590
How long did it take you
every day to look like this?

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.506
ARJUN RAMPAL: So yeah.

00:24:56.506 --> 00:25:00.990
So we got these incredible
makeup artists from Italy--

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.050
Sergio, Simone, Ariana.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:09.600
And it was five hours of
makeup every day in my trailer.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.710
Yeah.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:16.460
And I think I learned a
lot of Italian bad words

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.820
while going through it.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.010
And yeah, so it was that.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:24.540
And it was also a lot of the
aging process that happens,

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.720
because the film
starts in the '70s

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.920
and goes all the
way to 2012, 2013.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.440
So it was a lot
of change in that.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.504
But yeah.

00:25:36.504 --> 00:25:37.170
And not just me.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:40.590
I think every actor in this
film has gone through it.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:47.370
Every actor had to go through
a lot of makeup, the styling,

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.860
you know, just to get
the body language right,

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.250
and to the clothes
and the costumes.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.670
So it was very,
very interesting.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.050
And I think it kind of
spoils you some way,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.700
to be able to fit into
these kind of worlds.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.657
And yeah.

00:26:02.657 --> 00:26:03.990
APRAJITA JAIN: Very interesting.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.300
Well, we don't only
have questions here,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.454
but we also got a lot of
video questions for you--

00:26:08.454 --> 00:26:09.620
ARJUN RAMPAL: Oh, wonderful.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.990
APRAJITA JAIN: --from
all across the globe.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.990
So we would love to give
you a glimpse into that

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.140
and give you the opportunity to
address those directly, coming

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.590
from the people on video.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.942
So let's play our
first video question.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:23.307 --> 00:26:26.752
ARJUN RAMPAL: I don't lip read.

00:26:26.752 --> 00:26:29.850
- --transport yourself back
to, because you had a lot of--

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.650
APRAJITA JAIN: Can
we restart that?

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.425
Thank you.

00:26:34.425 --> 00:26:35.480
- Hi, Arjun.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.390
This is Sanditi.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.680
If you had a time machine,
to which of your past movies

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.440
making would you
transport yourself

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.876
back to because you had a
lot of fun acting in it?

00:26:44.876 --> 00:26:45.850
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:46.890
ARJUN RAMPAL: Oh, wow.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.650
Which one would I--

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.060
I've enjoyed all my movies.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.160
But one which I would
really like to go back to

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.780
would be "Rock On."

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.970
We had a lot of fun making that.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.906
It was a great crew,
and it was great music.

00:27:00.906 --> 00:27:03.030
And maybe I could go back
there and play the guitar

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.830
a little bit better.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.100
APRAJITA JAIN: Did you actually
learn it for the movie?

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.850
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yes.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:07.500
You have.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.060
I mean, Abhishek
Kappor and Farhan

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.610
are very, very anal about all
of that, and being musicians--

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.250
a musician himself, it was very,
very critical that all of us

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:19.300
learned our instrument.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.150
But I always wanted to learn
the guitar, so it was good.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.405
APRAJITA JAIN: There you go.

00:27:23.405 --> 00:27:23.905
Fantastic.

00:27:23.905 --> 00:27:27.300
Well, talking about the
versatility of the roles

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.349
that you have played, and also
the different genres of movies

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:31.890
you have done--
right, normally, when

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.806
you think about Bollywood
stars, a lot of them

00:27:33.806 --> 00:27:35.610
carve a niche for themselves.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:40.170
They're known as Bollywood
chocolate actors or action

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.270
heroes or dancers.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.114
And in the new
generation, these days

00:27:44.114 --> 00:27:45.280
it's a little bit different.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.210
They're more versatile.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.834
They can do a little
bit of everything.

00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:49.860
But honestly, you were
one of the first ones who

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.560
broke that mold and
decided to do everything,

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.940
from comedy in "Housefull"
to musical drama in "Rock

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.510
On," to thrillers in
"Aankhen" and "Ek Ajnabee"

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.030
to romantic movies--

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.260
you had "Pyaar Ishq Aur
Mohabbat," "Dil Ka Rishta,"

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.780
then you also did
"Raajneeti" and "Satyagraha,"

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.040
which are political dramas.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:08.416
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah.

00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:09.750
And a villain in "Om Shanti Om."

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.374
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah,
you did a villain.

00:28:11.374 --> 00:28:12.480
You were a cop in a movie.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.270
Then now you're doing a
criminal turned a politician.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.920
How do you go about
deciding which

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.250
roles you're going to take on?

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.680
And how do you
prepare for those?

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.410
ARJUN RAMPAL: You
know, actually,

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.870
one of my main criteria
of signing a film really

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:31.400
is that if I went out there
at the ticket counter,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.270
and if I was not in this
movie, would I go and watch

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.460
this film regardless?

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.360
And that's the first question.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.247
So that's the story.

00:28:39.247 --> 00:28:40.330
APRAJITA JAIN: User first.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.080
ARJUN RAMPAL: Huh?

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:41.750
APRAJITA JAIN: User first.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.030
That's how Google thinks too.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.821
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah.

00:28:43.821 --> 00:28:46.390
So you have to, you know, say,
would I really want to be--

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.340
would I watch it?

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.550
Then the second one
is who the people are

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.320
that you're associating with.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.320
Then obviously what is the
graph that your character has?

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.940
And if it is just
one-dimensional,

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.010
I usually kind of
stay away from it.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.880
But if it does have
layers and allows

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:09.330
me to explore a new
expression, a new body language

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:14.530
or allows me to bring anything
that would, A, surprise me,

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.710
which would then
surprise my audience,

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.010
is how I kind of like
to choose my work.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.460
And there's very little
work like that that happens,

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.090
which would be only
based around you.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:30.100
So it's good to experiment with
parts that you can do in films.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.840
And then when you get
a film like "Daddy,"

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.320
you get a lot of
layers and you get

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.950
a lot of experience,
where you can put together

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.460
many, many layers together
through your experience.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.010
So I guess, yeah,
that's how you do it.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:45.730
I like to do it.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.906
I get really bored
doing the same thing.

00:29:47.906 --> 00:29:49.780
You know, if you tell
me to do the same thing

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.610
every single day, I
wouldn't be able to do it.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.520
So if it is to work
out in the same way

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.685
or to go and meet the
same people everyday,

00:29:59.685 --> 00:30:01.324
no, it doesn't happen with me.

00:30:01.324 --> 00:30:02.740
APRAJITA JAIN: I
mean, it's easier

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.960
to keep doing the same thing
over and over again, but--

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.260
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:05.860
But I can't.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.430
APRAJITA JAIN: --the
effort that you

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.260
put in in doing all
these different things,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.201
it actually shows.

00:30:09.201 --> 00:30:10.450
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah, thank you.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.692
APRAJITA JAIN: Absolutely.

00:30:11.692 --> 00:30:14.612
Now, we have a second
video question for you.

00:30:14.612 --> 00:30:16.628
Let's roll that.

00:30:16.628 --> 00:30:18.532
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:18.532 --> 00:30:19.603
- Hi, Arjun.

00:30:19.603 --> 00:30:20.436
This is [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:20.436 --> 00:30:22.564
So my question is,
in the recent years,

00:30:22.564 --> 00:30:24.355
we have seen a lot of
Bollywood celebrities

00:30:24.355 --> 00:30:25.390
doing Hollywood movies.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:29.047
So, do we see Arjun
Rampal in Hollywood soon?

00:30:29.047 --> 00:30:29.630
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:30.540
ARJUN RAMPAL: OK.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:35.002
If you get me a nice
agent, we'll talk about it.

00:30:35.002 --> 00:30:35.710
But I don't know.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.840
I guess, you know, it's great.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.460
It's great.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.440
I mean, you see so many
of our actors, especially

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.200
[INAUDIBLE],, who has
really come out there

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.970
and he's done some great work.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.850
And now there's
Priyanka, Deepika,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.860
everybody who's coming out
here as well and doing it.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.620
So I think it would be nice.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.180
They can take our
actresses, and we

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.100
can take theirs and
move them to Bollywood,

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.760
and make them act with us.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.710
But it really depends,
again, I think,

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.680
borders are kind of diminishing.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.010
And you know, everybody
is kind of interacting.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.090
There's a big
audience out here who

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:18.960
likes to watch their own
actors in good parts,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.810
in good mainstream
Hollywood films.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.000
And so if something like that
does come across, why not?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.140
But it has to be a really
good part, and something

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:33.120
which would make all of
you proud [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.076
It wouldn't be that.

00:31:34.076 --> 00:31:35.950
APRAJITA JAIN: I'm sure
we wouldn't say that.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.440
Don't worry.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.160
So let me come
back to the reason

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.350
why you were in the Bay
Area a few weeks ago.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.950
You came to promote
a charity called CRY.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.830
And I'm personally very
fond of causes that support

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.197
the betterment of children.

00:31:49.197 --> 00:31:50.780
So tell us a little
bit more about CRY

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.704
and how you got
involved in that.

00:31:52.704 --> 00:31:53.620
ARJUN RAMPAL: So, yes.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.950
As a kid, my father
used to always insist,

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.140
if it was anybody's
birthday or if it

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.500
was Mother's Day, Father's
Day, you know, whatever,

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.010
to go and buy a CRY card.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.430
Now, I had no clue
what this CRY card was,

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:10.150
so I used to buy
these CRY cards.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.570
And they were really pretty.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.370
And then as, you know, I
got a little successful

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.640
and I was on an aircraft
or something, you know,

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.160
you'd find this little envelope
which had a CRY envelope.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.870
And so I just put
money in there.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:27.370
And this went on for,
I think, a few decades.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.130
And recently CRY
approached me, and they

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.250
said that they were doing
these gala events where they

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.659
wanted to raise these dinners.

00:32:36.659 --> 00:32:38.950
I thought "Daddy" would have
released really, honestly,

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:39.449
by then.

00:32:39.449 --> 00:32:40.240
So I was like, OK.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.540
Fine, I'll come.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.380
I'll come.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.960
I'll do this.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.560
But then "Daddy" got
pushed to the 21st of July.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.190
And I had committed
to them a year ago.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.370
But I saw the body of
work that they've done.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.210
It's absolutely incredible.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.865
You know, 18 million children
are out of school in India.

00:32:59.865 --> 00:33:01.240
There are 30
million children who

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.840
get pushed into child labor.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.280
There are 18.5
million children who

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:12.660
are pushed into child
marriage or sex trafficking.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.180
And child really works
on grassroot level--

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:19.090
CRY really works on grassroot
levels to help these children.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.290
And we went for these dinners,
and it was a superb success

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.640
from CRY America.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.520
We raised half a million
dollars for all of them,

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.710
and that's really going to help
all these kids when we go back.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.320
So yeah, it was great.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.150
And I'm really,
really happy I did it.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.180
And through that, I also
got to come to Google here.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.790
So yes, it all comes
together nicely.

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.500
And this is where I end my trip.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.340
I've been, I think, on--

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.610
I was just calculating
today in the shower.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.840
It was, I think, 14
flights I've done in--

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.670
in 12 days.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:52.910
That's what's happened.

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:53.070
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.650
I know you've been flying back
and forth from the East Coast.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:57.730
So thank you for coming
back just for today's event.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:58.346
Really appreciate it.

00:33:58.346 --> 00:33:59.137
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah.

00:33:59.137 --> 00:33:59.941
Thank you.

00:33:59.941 --> 00:34:02.440
APRAJITA JAIN: Now, CRY isn't
the only social responsibility

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.260
cause that you stand behind.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.680
Due to some personal
experiences,

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.400
you actually started a charity
called the Gwen Beat Cancer

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.444
Foundation for cancer survivors.

00:34:11.444 --> 00:34:13.610
Tell us a little bit more
about how that came about.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.940
ARJUN RAMPAL: So Gwen
is the name of my mom.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.820
She was three
years ago diagnosed

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.489
with breast cancer,
which got metastatic

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:23.420
and went into the lungs.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.800
And so obviously, you know,
you want to do everything

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.909
for your mother.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:32.290
And we came here to New York
and put her in the best hospital

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:32.900
there--

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.960
Sloan Kettering--
wonderful doctor,

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.360
Dr. Larry Norton, who
did the best that he

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.040
could with chemotherapy.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.730
But chemotherapy really
takes its toll on your body.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.830
And this was the
first experience

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:48.889
I was having with
anybody with cancer.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:52.370
And through this process
I said, it's expensive.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:54.710
You know, it is not cheap.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.530
The drugs are really expensive.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:58.780
In India, you don't have
those kind of insurances

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.060
that you guys have
out here as well.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.790
But still, you know,
even the treatment

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:05.500
is very, very aggressive.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:11.540
And it really amazes me
that we've got the internet,

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.890
we've got all of this,
we've gone to the moon,

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:18.650
you know, we've come back,
we've got satellites everywhere,

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.540
but we don't have
a cure for cancer.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:25.830
And that really is kind of
baffling and not realistic.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:30.680
So the chemo stopped working
for my mom at Sloan Kettering.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.440
And I went to this
place [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.050
in Portugal, in
Lisbon, where there

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.970
was this doctor
called [INAUDIBLE],,

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:41.900
who does this thing called SDRT,
which is Single Dose Radiation

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.980
Treatment.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.100
And it's a completely charity--

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.480
charitable organization.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.770
It's a foundation.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.480
You know, it's really
cheap for people

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.640
who are not part of Portugal.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.270
So it's really, really
not that expensive.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:02.300
And it was like a James
Bond kind of a set up.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.640
You know, they made
a hologram of my mom.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.040
They practiced how
to shoot this--

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.220
shoot this one shot in there.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.880
It's not invasive.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:18.040
And in 48 hours, three tumors
in her lungs were all gone,

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.730
and nobody knows about it.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:23.960
So I really wanted to
bring this to people.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.990
So I said, OK, we're going
to start this charity

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.170
organization, which will be--

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.390
it's actually the
Gwen Breast Cancer,

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:35.120
but we removed the R and
the S from the breast,

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.620
and it becomes beat cancer.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.270
So that's how we've done it.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:44.080
And I wanted to kind of promote
that so that more people get

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.360
to know about it, have
opportunities about it,

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.650
and we can kind of
bring more people--

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.210
get more people cured.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.293
APRAJITA JAIN: Thank you
for standing behind that,

00:36:54.293 --> 00:36:56.920
because people that have that
much of a reach on social media

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.050
and everywhere else,
they can definitely

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.670
play a big role in bringing
these type of awareness.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.540
ARJUN RAMPAL: You
know, it's amazing.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.039
It's amazing what's
happening there.

00:37:04.039 --> 00:37:05.550
So you've got to support it.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.075
Kind of, that's
what I wanted to do.

00:37:07.075 --> 00:37:08.950
And that's something
which I support as well.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:09.991
APRAJITA JAIN: Fantastic.

00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:13.000
So let's shift gears
from reactive health care

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.040
to proactive health
a little bit.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.040
We all know that you are
a fitness enthusiast,

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.620
and you've been
talking about it a lot.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.730
But I also know that in the
making of "Daddy," you had to--

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.962
well, shall I put
it-- look human.

00:37:26.962 --> 00:37:27.670
I'm just kidding.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.420
You had to look like
a regular human being,

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.070
like somebody who doesn't
work out or who was a mobster

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.590
and didn't have all the bulk.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.530
So how did that feel, not being
able to work out for so long?

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.220
And I'm sure it wasn't
a linear process.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.190
You probably had to look a
certain way for some shots,

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:43.600
and then another way
for another shot.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.340
So how do you--

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.630
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah,
because the film kind of

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:52.330
goes over so many
decades and yes, he's

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.120
not a bodybuilder, Arun Gawli.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.230
I couldn't come with a
six pack and, you know,

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:59.170
muscles and all of that, or
else it would just make it--

00:37:59.170 --> 00:37:59.860
it was tough.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.700
I mean, I had not gone
to the gym for two years

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.820
through this process.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.800
I had-- I just ran a lot.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.400
And at some point, I
had to really be skinny.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.170
And then when he
gets a little older,

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:17.650
Ashim wanted a little
more bulk on him.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:23.150
So you know, I had to
then drink a lot of beers.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:25.074
APRAJITA JAIN: Oh,
what a sad thing to be.

00:38:25.074 --> 00:38:25.990
ARJUN RAMPAL: So, yes.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:30.130
These two years, I lost a
lot of my muscle quality.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:32.470
But now I'm getting
back into it slowly.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:33.790
I need to get back to the gym.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:37.300
I really missed it, and I
realized the value of health

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.370
because these last
two to three years

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.140
I don't think I've
been very healthy.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.662
So yeah, it's good to get
back into the gym now.

00:38:43.662 --> 00:38:44.620
APRAJITA JAIN: Awesome.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.635
Any tips for us chair
potato Googlers?

00:38:46.635 --> 00:38:49.805
We spend a good 10 hours
of our day in chairs.

00:38:49.805 --> 00:38:50.680
ARJUN RAMPAL: Really?

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.514
10 hours in a chair?

00:38:51.514 --> 00:38:52.638
APRAJITA JAIN: Pretty much.

00:38:52.638 --> 00:38:53.710
ARJUN RAMPAL: Oh, no.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.240
I don't envy you.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.040
But no, I just
believe, if you look

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:06.940
at exercise just as a
necessity, as you need to eat

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.950
or you drink water or
breathe or rest and sleep,

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:18.640
look at exercise as well as a
necessity, and as your fuel,

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.010
that you're going to take
out the best de-stressor.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.270
It's great for your
backside, which

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.523
you're going to be covering
so much on a chair.

00:39:27.523 --> 00:39:29.740
But get your core strong.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.400
Go out there.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.960
Just do any form of
exercise for an hour

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.350
every day, 45 minutes, one hour.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.496
It will change your life.

00:39:39.496 --> 00:39:41.120
It will really, really
change your life

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.630
and do you a tremendous
amount of good.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.140
And I think you all owe it to
each other and to yourselves.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.338
And that's how I look at it.

00:39:50.338 --> 00:39:51.970
APRAJITA JAIN: Good.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:55.320
They say that a six pack of
abs is made in the kitchen,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.240
and there are two
types of six packs that

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.970
can come out of that.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:02.360
But tell us a little bit
more about your diet.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.970
ARJUN RAMPAL: So yes, I eat
healthy when I'm training

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.490
and not being Arun Gawli.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:11.970
So when I wake up
in the morning--

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:14.150
what, you want to know
everything that I eat?

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.566
APRAJITA JAIN: No,
but just like--

00:40:15.566 --> 00:40:17.530
do you avoid certain things?

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.580
Do you really love
certain things

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.290
that we may think
is unhealthy, but it

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:23.480
doesn't make a difference?

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.460
ARJUN RAMPAL: It's
good to eat everything.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:29.450
I don't think you should
become a fanatic about--

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.610
because that's a disease
as well, according to me,

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:32.899
because it's happened to me.

00:40:32.899 --> 00:40:34.940
Where you say, OK, I want
to get really shredded.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.647
I want, like, 5% body
fat, 4% body fat.

00:40:39.647 --> 00:40:41.480
And then you kind of
get obsessive about it.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.280
Anything obsessive is not good.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.200
Anything excessive is not good.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:50.855
So yes, if you want to shed
body fat, obviously you

00:40:50.855 --> 00:40:54.520
lower your carb intake, take
a more high protein diet,

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.790
put more cardiovascular
into your exercise.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:03.312
And as you lose it, then
start kind of taking the--

00:41:03.312 --> 00:41:04.520
but you need carbs, you know?

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.535
You need carbs to
fuel your exercise.

00:41:06.535 --> 00:41:07.725
So have good carbs.

00:41:07.725 --> 00:41:08.600
There are good carbs.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.200
There's good fats, like
avocado is a very good fat.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.410
And you get great avocados
here in your region.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:19.760
And have lots of fruits,
have lots of greens.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.730
And being Indians, most of
you are vegetarians as well.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.280
So greens are great.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.120
I have good pulses, maybe
take a good protein shake

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.500
to get enough protein
intake inside of you.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.380
But most importantly,
to eat like that,

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.840
you also have to work
out like that, you know?

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.500
Because you watch what you
eat, you control what you eat,

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.050
but also that food
has to be like fuel

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:47.160
that refules your workout.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.660
So kind of just be aware.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.040
But don't say no to everything.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.320
We have great food, you know.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.940
And enjoy it.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.900
Enjoy it once a week.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.252
Don't enjoy it every day.

00:41:58.252 --> 00:41:59.710
APRAJITA JAIN:
Thanks for the tips.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:01.660
We have lunch hour coming
up soon after that,

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.180
so I hope everybody
paid attention.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.800
Now, you couldn't
have come to Google

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.990
and not expected
that you'd be asked

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:10.694
a question about technology.

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:11.610
ARJUN RAMPAL: Oh, god.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:12.130
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:12.260
ARJUN RAMPAL: OK.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.206
APRAJITA JAIN: It's
not a hard one.

00:42:13.206 --> 00:42:14.295
It's not a hard one.

00:42:14.295 --> 00:42:16.610
In today's world,
where everything

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:19.730
has gone digital and especially
in the entertainment industry,

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:22.280
we know from our own
statistics that depending

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.940
on how well you promote a movie
digitally before its launch,

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.329
it can really impact the
launch week of the movie.

00:42:28.329 --> 00:42:29.870
And I know we are
sitting right here,

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.540
using YouTube as a platform
to talk about "Daddy,"

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.571
but what else have you
been doing digitally

00:42:34.571 --> 00:42:36.320
to promote your movies--
not only "Daddy,"

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.460
but any other movie
that you have produced?

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:42.585
ARJUN RAMPAL: I'm
totally relying on you.

00:42:42.585 --> 00:42:44.440
No.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.680
You do everything on Facebook.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.630
You have Twitter.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.150
You have Instagram.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.960
You have so many
websites today, you

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.780
know, which promote your film,
like Bollywood Box Office

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:05.870
or different-- there are so
many different kinds of channels

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.610
that you can use.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:10.790
There are lots of people
who create a lot of--

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:14.390
which we will be
doing, which make

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.630
a lot of these gigs and
programs around the film,

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.880
you know, which go viral.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.640
And you know, youngsters
really like that,

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.650
rather than just talking
about the film, film,

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.650
film, to take the Mickey out
of the film as well is fun.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:30.710
And if you can promote
it, the whole idea

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:34.530
is to get it as much
out there as possible.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.530
So whatever the platforms
are digitally that you

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.060
can do it in you do it in.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.100
Whatever we can
do as filmmakers,

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.950
which is to create and
give you content like this,

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.494
you know, which
we put out there,

00:43:45.494 --> 00:43:47.660
is something which would
be exciting enough for them

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.640
to come in to watch it.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.500
But yes, we need
all those platforms

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.746
to come together and help us.

00:43:53.746 --> 00:43:55.370
APRAJITA JAIN: And
I saw you yesterday.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.564
You were personally
sending out tweets and--

00:43:57.564 --> 00:43:59.480
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah, I
do it personally myself,

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.865
and I get really irritated
that it's only 134 characters,

00:44:01.865 --> 00:44:04.550
and how am I going
to get this in there.

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.450
And there's so much to say.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:08.960
And you know, to do
it through Instagram.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.090
And I was doing it on
Facebook, and then we got lost.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.730
And I was like, OK,
guys, I got to go.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:15.130
I'm not going to make this.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:20.540
So I'm not very tech savvy.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.520
But I think my kids are.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.345
My kids are super--

00:44:23.345 --> 00:44:25.470
APRAJITA JAIN: Do they help
you with the promotion?

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:26.261
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah.

00:44:26.261 --> 00:44:27.795
They say, Dad,
what are you doing?

00:44:27.795 --> 00:44:28.670
That's not a hashtag.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:29.720
You've got to do this.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.650
You've got to be cool.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:31.566
You've got to be dope.

00:44:31.566 --> 00:44:33.800
I say, what's dope?

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.900
Come on.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.289
So yeah.

00:44:37.289 --> 00:44:38.330
APRAJITA JAIN: Fantastic.

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:40.370
And out of all the
Google products

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:43.402
that you may have used,
which one would you say

00:44:43.402 --> 00:44:45.860
is-- and I'm going to explain
a concept to you before that.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.380
So there is this
thing at Google.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.580
We call it the toothbrush test.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.190
And a toothbrush test
means that every single one

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:56.150
of our products needs to be
used at least once a day,

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.600
ideally twice by people.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.110
That's how we think about
coming out with our products.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:01.610
So which of our
products would you

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.931
think serves as a
toothbrush to you?

00:45:04.931 --> 00:45:06.430
ARJUN RAMPAL: It's
not a toothbrush.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.350
It's like a towel for me, you
know what I mean, or clothes--

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:09.850
Google.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.130
Everything-- I think your
search engines, you know,

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:15.880
the way you guys are,
your Google Maps--

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.690
I mean, it's genius.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:21.390
I think the way it just kind
of connects everybody together,

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:23.110
you're in a foreign
place, you don't

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:25.930
know how to get from
one place to another.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.399
And boom, you just put in an
address, it's right there.

00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:29.440
APRAJITA JAIN: Fantastic.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.900
So you do use our
products extensively.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.150
ARJUN RAMPAL: I do.

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:31.314
I do.

00:45:31.314 --> 00:45:31.813
I do.

00:45:31.813 --> 00:45:33.450
APRAJITA JAIN: We're
glad to hear that.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.430
We also have a live question
coming in right now,

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:37.840
because we are on live stream.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.710
So does somebody want
to display the question?

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.180
Yes?

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:45.815
On my phone?

00:45:45.815 --> 00:45:47.190
ARJUN RAMPAL: It's
on your phone?

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:48.981
APRAJITA JAIN: I don't
have my phone on me.

00:45:48.981 --> 00:45:51.570
So if somebody wants to bring
me a phone, that would be great.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:52.695
ARJUN RAMPAL: Ashim, do it.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.084
There, Ashim.

00:45:57.084 --> 00:45:58.000
Take your clothes off.

00:46:09.882 --> 00:46:11.930
AUDIENCE: So these questions
came from your fans

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:12.770
on social media.

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:13.170
ARJUN RAMPAL: OK.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:13.930
AUDIENCE: Who
watched your trailer.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:15.910
So I'm just going to
read out the first one.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.070
Any similarities between
Arun Gawli and Arjun Rampal?

00:46:21.765 --> 00:46:22.890
ARJUN RAMPAL: In real life?

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:23.330
APRAJITA JAIN: Totally.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:24.600
He was a mobster too.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.975
ARJUN RAMPAL:
We're both daddies.

00:46:29.396 --> 00:46:30.410
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:32.060
Here's another one
from your fans.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.276
Which other real-life character
would you like to play?

00:46:36.276 --> 00:46:38.150
Or have you thought
about playing, let's say.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:41.480
ARJUN RAMPAL: Well, actually,
I'm toying with one script

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.370
right now.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.070
But right now I
think I'm done with

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.420
a few real-life characters.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.210
I want to do something
more fantasy.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:51.520
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.940
Another one from your fans.

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.036
Is a movie with a
fictional script

00:46:56.036 --> 00:46:58.160
more challenging or less
challenging than a biopic,

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.447
like you're doing with "Daddy"?

00:47:00.447 --> 00:47:03.030
ARJUN RAMPAL: I think a biopic
definitely is more challenging,

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:04.760
because you are
restricted, and you

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.050
want to stay true to the story.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:11.450
Fictional, you can just become
a pirate in the Caribbean,

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:12.830
and it's fine.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.580
AUDIENCE: And this
last one, which I think

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.697
is a fantastic request.

00:47:16.697 --> 00:47:18.780
Could you recite a dialogue
from the movie for us?

00:47:22.452 --> 00:47:23.160
ARJUN RAMPAL: OK.

00:47:28.131 --> 00:47:28.880
What should I say?

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.330
I don't know.

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.680
I think the dialogue that he
really uses in person also.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.976
He says, [HINDI].

00:47:35.976 --> 00:47:38.040
You know, that's what he does.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:44.720
And the other one, which I
really like where he says, is--

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.630
actually, you know what
I would like to do,

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.690
is I would just like to play
a little game with all of you

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:54.920
out here instead of
saying my dialogues.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:48:00.680
I want you to know some
lingo, like the gangsta lingo.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.620
How you all say "dope" and
this, that, and I don't get it.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:08.080
OK, I'm going to
ask you a few words.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:08.770
[HINDI]

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:09.830
What does [HINDI] mean.

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.664
Does anybody know
what [HINDI] means?

00:48:11.664 --> 00:48:13.999
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:16.801
ARJUN RAMPAL: Ah.

00:48:16.801 --> 00:48:19.190
To give a nice tight slap.

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.690
So [HINDI].

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:27.960
APRAJITA JAIN: Thank god
you explained [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.940
ARJUN RAMPAL: [HINDI].

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.180
[HINDI], what is a [HINDI]?

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.790
No, I know they're slippers.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:39.780
But what does a gangster
say when he says--

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.102
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:41.102 --> 00:48:42.906
ARJUN RAMPAL: Huh?

00:48:42.906 --> 00:48:44.690
[HINDI]

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:46.050
[HINDI] means a gun.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:48.430
A country-made gun.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:52.010
Or English, [HINDI] means
a nice foreign gun, OK?

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.510
So there are words like this.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:57.590
And I think what Google should
do is maybe create an app.

00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:59.222
APRAJITA JAIN: Seriously.

00:48:59.222 --> 00:48:59.930
That's important.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:01.700
Next time I'm walking
around Bombay,

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.960
I don't want to be [HINDI].

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.742
Awesome.

00:49:07.742 --> 00:49:09.200
One more question
for you, and this

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.180
is a little lesser
known fact about you.

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.160
So we talked about your modeling
career, your acting career,

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.820
your social engagements.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.890
But you are also
an entrepreneur.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:23.210
You opened a restaurant and
lounge in Delhi in 2009.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:26.300
How did you get into that,
and where are you taking that?

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.110
ARJUN RAMPAL: Well, actually,
I really like to spin music.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.040
I like electronic music.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.560
I like deep house
and tech house.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.040
And I think I'm a good DJ.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.710
But my family didn't think so.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.890
So I was like, OK, so if I
had to go and play this music,

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:44.030
where would I play?

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.940
And I thought, let me open
a nightclub, and let me go,

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.950
and I'm going to
go and spin there.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:49.940
But I like music.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.190
I like to promote such artists.

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:53.380
And I've always--

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.350
I'm a foodie.

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:56.720
So it's nice.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.980
You know, you walk into
your own restaurant,

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.480
you have a little club, a lounge
bar, people enjoy themselves,

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.240
and I really wanted--

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.310
the first club that I
went to was in Delhi.

00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:10.880
And when I went back to
Delhi when I became an actor,

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.260
nobody was going out.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:16.430
People found it unsafe, and
the girls weren't going out.

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:18.450
And nothing was happening.

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:20.844
And when I opened
this place, once again

00:50:20.844 --> 00:50:21.885
girls started coming out.

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.720
It was a really safe place.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.230
And you know, it started
the business again.

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.650
And it was a
wonderful experience.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.110
And we're going to do many more.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.250
I love FNB.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:35.570
I think it's really, really
great, if you can be--

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.130
I like hospitality.

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.240
I like people to come
there, enjoy a good meal,

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:45.975
feel safe, dress up nicely,
and then go home and be happy.

00:50:45.975 --> 00:50:47.600
APRAJITA JAIN: So
when people go there,

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.279
are they likely to find
you there once in a while?

00:50:50.279 --> 00:50:52.320
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah,
sometimes I do land up there.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.340
I land up there quite
often, actually.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.850
And now I'm opening one in
Dubai and one in Mumbai.

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:00.005
So yeah, it'll be fun.

00:51:00.005 --> 00:51:00.880
APRAJITA JAIN: Great.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.510
ARJUN RAMPAL: So come, anytime.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.129
AUDIENCE: Where in Mumbai?

00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:07.420
APRAJITA JAIN: Where in Mumbai?

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:08.503
ARJUN RAMPAL: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:08.503 --> 00:51:10.880
We're just locking the property.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.090
Please come.

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:17.640
APRAJITA JAIN: My next question
is a little quirky in nature,

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.760
just like the
person it is about.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.730
So a few years ago we had
Lady Gaga here at Google,

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:23.850
doing a similar talk.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:24.540
ARJUN RAMPAL: Oh, really?

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.373
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:51:25.373 --> 00:51:26.370
Today we have you here.

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:28.980
But there's more in common
to that than, you know,

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.720
both of you being here.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.810
You actually hosted Lady
Gaga in India a while ago.

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:34.975
How did that happen?

00:51:34.975 --> 00:51:35.850
ARJUN RAMPAL: So yes.

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:38.670
We were doing the
Formula, my club, the lap,

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:41.880
which was asked to do the
entertainment for the Formula

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.280
1, which came to India.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.710
And they had this big budget.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:49.020
And they said, we need
to get some artists down,

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.540
and they wanted me to do
the full entertainment

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.510
for the weekend.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:53.900
And I was like, yeah, sure.

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.520
OK.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.480
And I was very confused who
to get down as the artist.

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:01.077
And this is really,
really interesting.

00:52:01.077 --> 00:52:02.410
So I'm sitting with my daughter.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:05.680
And I asked her, I
was like, I don't

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.480
know, who should I get down?

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.180
And she said, Dad, get Lady Gag.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.175
So I was like, who?

00:52:12.175 --> 00:52:14.070
She said, Lady Gaga.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.710
So I said, who-- you
don't know Lady Gaga?

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:18.100
OK, I'm sorry.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.700
OK, so she showed me Lady Gaga.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.840
And I'm sorry I'm
as ignorant as that.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.790
And I really liked her.

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:28.450
I thought she had a great
attitude, a great vibe.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:31.280
And I called this
friend of mine in LA,

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.930
and I asked him, dude,
is there a chance we can

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.390
get Lady Gaga for this thing?

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.160
And coincidentally,
she was coming down

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:44.200
to India at that time to
promote her "Monster" album.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:49.450
And things happened, things
fell into place, and I must say,

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:52.060
she was really, really
a wonderful artist,

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:56.260
great person to meet, you
know, extremely humble,

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.670
loves children.

00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:00.700
And she was supposed to
perform only for, I think,

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.160
15 minutes or 20
minutes, and she

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.200
did a full performance
of 45 minutes

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.259
because she enjoyed it so much.

00:53:07.259 --> 00:53:08.050
APRAJITA JAIN: Wow.

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.237
And that was at your club?

00:53:09.237 --> 00:53:10.570
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah, at the club.

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:14.080
And you know, it was really,
really a special event

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.510
that we did and
I think something

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.950
that Dehli will always remember.

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:21.514
APRAJITA JAIN: Great.

00:53:21.514 --> 00:53:22.930
My next question
for you is really

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:25.900
about today's
political environment

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.990
and things that are going on
in general, including India.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:33.304
What keeps you up at night
when you think through those?

00:53:33.304 --> 00:53:34.970
ARJUN RAMPAL: What
keeps me up at night?

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:35.280
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.696
Like, what are the
things that you

00:53:36.696 --> 00:53:39.760
would like to change if you had
the means and time to do that?

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.260
ARJUN RAMPAL: Well, I think the
disparity is something which

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:46.090
really is of the biggest
concern, you know,

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:49.940
with the rich-rich and
then there's too much poor.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:53.275
And I think to bridge
the gap between that.

00:53:53.275 --> 00:53:59.970
I think women's safety today
is on everybody's mind.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.770
I have two daughters.

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:07.250
I want India to be the safest
place in the world for women.

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:09.740
And I think that's
something which one really

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.080
needs to work towards.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.900
It is.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.810
And of course cleanliness.

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:16.820
You know, and I think
we all are working

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:20.100
towards that, [INAUDIBLE]
about it and everything.

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.680
We keep our homes
very clean, but I

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.830
don't know why we use the rest
of our country like a garbage

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:26.390
bin.

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:29.240
So I think a certain
amount of civic sense.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.790
Education, education,
education--

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:35.270
if we can promote that and
educate people, you know,

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:38.480
I think India's got--

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.450
I love India.

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:40.370
It's so diverse.

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:42.530
It's got so many
wonderful cultures.

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:47.270
And if there can just be peace,
harmony, and these things taken

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:50.970
care of, and everybody
has a full stomach,

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:51.750
it would be great.

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:52.250
Yes.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:54.083
APRAJITA JAIN: We have
an audience question?

00:54:54.083 --> 00:54:55.130
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.711
So as a celebrity, you lead a
very glamorous and interesting

00:54:58.711 --> 00:54:59.210
life.

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:03.830
So do you ever get used
to being a celebrity?

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:06.000
ARJUN RAMPAL: Glamorous
and interesting?

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.570
I don't know.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.770
It looks glamorous and
interesting from there,

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:11.980
but really, it's--

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:14.420
I've been a
celebrity now, if you

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:18.670
can say it, for a long time.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.340
It's been, I think--

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.400
I started modeling
when I was 17.

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.800
And I'm 44 now.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.640
So what's that?

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.150
That's, like, 27 years.

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:34.800
And it's a long
time to be there.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.530
And I don't think of
myself as a celebrity.

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.960
I think everybody's
kind of human, you know.

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.840
I have a certain
amount of power,

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.350
which as celebrity gives me,
to go and voice my opinions,

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:50.490
and to get certain things done,
like, for example, all of this.

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:54.360
But otherwise I like to lead my
life as normally as possible,

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.510
and I'm as normal as any one of
you out there, I promise you.

00:56:00.414 --> 00:56:02.830
APRAJITA JAIN: Unless we have
any more audience questions,

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:04.290
I have one last one for you.

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:07.110
And we know we are
super-excited for July 21st

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:10.080
to see "Daddy," but
with everything that

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.840
takes a culmination
like that, I'm

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.250
sure you have other
things on the horizon,

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.630
projects you're thinking about.

00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:18.450
So what's next in the life of
Arjun Rampal, professionally

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:19.506
or personally?

00:56:19.506 --> 00:56:20.880
ARJUN RAMPAL: I
think I just want

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.230
to take a nice long
holiday after this one,

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:27.575
and write my new script,
and take off and maybe

00:56:27.575 --> 00:56:28.830
come in this area.

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.000
It's nice and quiet.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.812
And come here and
make lots of noise.

00:56:34.812 --> 00:56:36.645
APRAJITA JAIN: That
noise is always welcome.

00:56:36.645 --> 00:56:36.930
ARJUN RAMPAL: Yeah.

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:37.500
So yeah.

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.730
No, I think just take
it easy right now.

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.550
There's lots of
scripts that are there.

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:43.410
I have not had
time to read them.

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:45.150
I've been very
busy with "Daddy."

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:48.350
And so as soon as
this film releases,

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:49.602
I'll take some time off.

00:56:49.602 --> 00:56:51.810
APRAJITA JAIN: Do you write
most of your own scripts?

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:52.050
Or do you--

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:53.175
ARJUN RAMPAL: No, this is--

00:56:53.175 --> 00:56:54.810
I've started enjoying it.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:59.790
It's nice to get involved
on a writing level

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:04.350
because it helps you as an
actor to really, really prepare

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:06.560
yourself well, you know?

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.760
Obviously the writing
is done by the pros.

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:12.510
You know, the dialogue
is given by all of them.

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:14.400
And you know, the
screenplay and all

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.170
of that-- you could
work towards it,

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:20.440
but I think the process is
wonderful to be a part of,

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.950
because it really, really
helps you understand

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:24.360
your characters really well.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.610
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:27.150
Fantastic.

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:30.270
With that, we wish you a ton
of success with the launch

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:31.155
of "Daddy," and--

00:57:31.155 --> 00:57:31.430
ARJUN RAMPAL: Thank
you very much.

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:32.970
APRAJITA JAIN: I'm sure
everyone present here

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:34.386
and many people
on the live stream

00:57:34.386 --> 00:57:36.630
are going to go
watch it on the 21st.

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:39.860
We will keep our fingers crossed
for this to be a great success.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.720
And thank you again
for coming here.

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.650
ARJUN RAMPAL: Thank
you very much.

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:42.330
Thank you for having me.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:43.430
APRAJITA JAIN: Spending
the time with us.

00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.790
ARJUN RAMPAL: Thank you.

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:44.770
It's been wonderful.

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:46.504
Thank you, thank you,
thank you for having me.

00:57:46.504 --> 00:57:47.670
APRAJITA JAIN: Thanks a lot.

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:52.270
