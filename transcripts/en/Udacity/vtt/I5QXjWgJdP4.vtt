I think the best way to followup with
somebody you met at a networking event

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.000
that made an impression is, of course,
send them a thank you email.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.280
But it's really about finding that
one thing you spoke about in your

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.540
conversation that you want to mention
again in that email that would

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.460
make this email specific and

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.680
not a generic email that the person
thinks you sent out to everyone.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.900
I think also having an action
item is a great thing.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.150
Perhaps, following up with a coffee
chat or a Skype call or maybe you talked

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.240
about an interesting topic and if this
followup email will include an article

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.770
about this or something that
you wrote or found recently.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.510
Trying to make a connection after
the event is just as important,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.250
if not more important,
than the connection in the event
