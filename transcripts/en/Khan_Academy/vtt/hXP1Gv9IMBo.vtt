00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.020
Welcome to the presentation
on figuring out the slope.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.320
Let's get started.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.780
So, let's say I
have two points.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.270
And, as we learned in previous
presentations, that all

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.080
you need to define a
line is two points.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.200
And I think if you think about
that, that makes sense.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Let's say we have two points.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.450
And let me write down the two
points we're going to have.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.020
Let's say one point is,
why isn't it writing.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.846
Sometimes this thing
acts a little finicky.

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:30.080
Oh, that's because I was
trying to write in black.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.160
Let's say that one point
is, negative 1, 3.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.660
So, let's see.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.500
Where do we graph that?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.470
So, this is 0, 0.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.490
We go negative 1, this
is negative 1 here.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.970
And then we're
going to go 3 up.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.530
1, 2, 3.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.560
Because this is 3 right here.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.580
So, negative 1, 3 is going
to be right over there.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.310
OK, so that's the first point.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.210
The second point, I'm going to
do it in a different color.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.890
The second point is 2, 1.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.290
Let's see where we
would put that.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.080
We would count 1, 2.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.610
This is 2, 1.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.670
Because this is 1.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.530
So the point's
going to be here.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.710
So we've graphed
our two points.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.600
And now the line that connects
them, it's going to look

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.450
something thing like this.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.060
And I hope I can draw it well.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.078
Through that point.

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:40.430
Like that.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.070
Then I'm going to do it.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.170
And then I'm just going to try
to continue the line from here.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.400
That might be the
best technique.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.293
Something like that.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.570
So, let's look at that line.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.270
So what we want to do in this
presentation is, figure out

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.000
the slope of that line.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.225
So let's write out a
couple of things that

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:07.120
I think will help you.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.410
So, there's a couple
ways to view slope.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.930
I think, intuitively, you
know that the slope is the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.170
inclination of this line.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.470
And we can already
see that this is a

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.880
downward sloping line.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.820
Because it comes from the top
left to the bottom right.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.590
So it's going to be a
negative number, the slope.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.200
So you know that immediately.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.770
And we'll have -- what we're
going to do is figure out how

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.750
to figure out the slope.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.280
So the slope, let me write this
down, slope and -- oftentimes

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.700
they'll use the variable m, for
slope, I have no idea why.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.060
Because m, clearly, does
not stand for slope.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.370
That is equal to -- there's
a couple of things

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.300
you might hear.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.270
Change in y over change in x.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.920
That triangle, which is
pronounced, delta just a Greek

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.560
letter, that means change.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.560
The change in y
over change in x.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.970
And that also is equal
to rise over run.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.800
And I'm going to explain what
all of this means in a second.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.650
So let's start at one
of these points.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.130
Let's start at this green
point, negative 1, 3.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.760
So how much do we have to rise
and how much do we have to run

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.710
to get to the second
point, 2, 1?

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.130
So let's do the rise first.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.640
Well, we have to go minus
2, so that's the rise.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.400
So the rise is
equal to minus 2.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.120
Because we have to go down
2 to get to the same y

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.290
as this yellow point.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.450
And then we have to
run right there.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.830
We have to run plus 3.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.140
So rise divided by run is
equal to minus 2 over 3.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.340
Well, how would we do that if
we didn't have this nice graph

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.790
here to actually draw on?

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.400
Well, what we can do is, we
can say let's take this

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.690
as a starting point.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.360
Change in y, change in y, over
change in x, is equal to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.110
we take the first y
point, which is 3.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.010
And we subtract the
second y point, which

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.700
is 1, you see that?

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.590
We just took 3 minus 1.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.620
So that's the change in y over,
and we take the first x point.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.250
Negative 1, minus the
second x point, minus

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.345
2, so 3 minus 1 is 2.

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:30.590
And negative 1 minus 2
is equal to minus 3.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.990
So, same thing.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.880
We got minus 2 over 3.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.070
Now we could have done
it the other way.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.850
And I'm running out
of space here.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.380
But we could've made
this the first point.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.770
If we made that the first
point, then the change in y

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.100
would have been -- I want to
make it really cluttered,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.460
so to confuse you.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.300
Change in y would be this y.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.380
1 minus 3 over change in x,
would be 2, minus minus 1.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.960
Well, 1 minus 3 is minus 2.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.330
And 2 minus negative 1 is 3.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.620
So, once again, we got minus
2/3, So it doesn't matter which

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.030
point we start with, as long
as, if we use the y in this

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.310
coordinate first, then we have
to use the x in that

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.480
coordinate first.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.900
Let's do some more problems.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.280
Actually, I'm going to do a
couple just so you see the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.565
algebra without even
graphing it first.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.560
So, let's say I wanted to
figure out the slope between

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:33.100
the points 5, 2, and 3, 5.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.760
Well, let's take this
as our starting point.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.930
So, change in y over change in
x, or rise over run, well,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.430
change in y would be this 5.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.950
5 minus this 2.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.471
Over this 3 minus this 5.

00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:59.110
And that gets us 3, this
is a 5, over minus 2.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.890
Equals minus 3/2.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.370
Let's do another one.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.070
This time I'm going to try to
make it color-coded so it'll

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.070
more self-explanatory.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.410
Say, it's 1, 2.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.990
That's the first point.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.390
And then the second
point is 4, 3.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:25.120
So, once again, we say slope
is equal to change in

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.790
y over change in x.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.980
Well, in y.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.180
We take the first y.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.270
Let's start here.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.850
And we'll call that y1.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:42.250
So that's 3 minus the
second y, which is that 2.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.240
And then all of that over,
once again, the first x.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.045
Which is 4, minus the
second x, which is that 1.

00:06:54.045 --> 00:07:00.230
And this equals 3
minus 2, is 1.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.620
And 4 minus 1 is 3.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.540
So the slope in this
example is 1/3.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.860
And we could have actually
switched it around.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.440
We could have also
done it other way.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:22.380
We could have said, 2
minus 3 over 1 minus 4.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.820
In which case we would
have gotten negative

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.800
1 over negative 3.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.170
Well, that just
equals 1/3 again.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.750
Because the negatives
cancel out.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.660
So I'll let you think about
why this and this come

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.110
out to the same thing.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.810
But the important thing to
realize is, if we use the 3

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.290
first, if we use the 3 first
for the y, we also have to

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.320
use the 4 first for the x.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.550
That's a common mistake.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.810
And also, you always have to be
very careful with the negative

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.240
signs when you do these
type of problems.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.240
But I think that will give you
at least enough of a sense that

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.740
you could start the
slope problems.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.450
The next module, I'll actually
show you how to figure

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.380
out the y intercept.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.250
Because, as we said, before
the equation of any line is,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.880
y is equal to m x plus b.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.680
And I'm going to go
into some more detail.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.280
Where m is the slope.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.310
So if you know the
slope of a line.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.403
And you know the y intercept of
a line, you know everything you

00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:13.350
need to know about the line,
and you can actually write down

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.180
the equation of a line, and
figure out other points

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:15.990
that are on it.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.400
So I'm going to do that
in future modules.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.660
I hope I haven't
confused you too much.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.620
And try some of those
the slope modules.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.410
You should be able to do them.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.710
And I hope you have fun.
