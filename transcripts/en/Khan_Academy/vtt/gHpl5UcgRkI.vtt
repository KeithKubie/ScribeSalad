00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:03.566
Voiceover:Jamie's dad gave
her a die for her birthday.

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.433
She wanted to make sure it was fair,

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:09.101
so she took her die to school
and rolled it 500 times

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:10.833
and kept track of how many times

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:12.933
the die rolled each number.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.501
Afterwards, she calculated
the expected value

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:20.434
of the sum of 20 rolls to be 67.4,

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:24.967
the expected value of the
sum of 20 rolls to be 67.4.

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:27.501
On her way home from
school, it was raining,

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:30.767
and 2 values were washed
away from her data table.

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:33.679
Find the 2 missing absolute frequencies

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.500
from Jamie's data table.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.566
So you see here, she
rolled her die 500 times,

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.700
and she wrote down how
many times she got a 2.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.833
She got a 2 110 times, a
3 95 times, a 4 70 times,

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.766
a 5 75 times,

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.967
and then she had written
down how many times

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:52.300
she got a 1 and a 6, but
then it got washed away,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.236
so we need to figure out how
many times she got a 1 and a 6,

00:00:55.236 --> 00:00:57.700
given the information on
this table right over here

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.911
and given the information
that the expected value

00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:03.638
of the sum of 20 rolls is 67.4.

00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:05.100
I encourage you to pause this video

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.567
and think about it on your own

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.840
before I give a go at it.

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.767
So first, let's think about
what this expected value,

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:16.903
the sum of 20 rolls being 67.4 tells us.

00:01:16.903 --> 00:01:20.034
That means that the
expected value of 1 roll,

00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:23.566
the expected value of the sum of 20 rolls

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:27.433
is just 20 times the
expected value of 1 roll.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:29.646
The expected value of a roll,

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:30.834
let me do it here,

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:37.694
expected value of a roll
is going to be equal

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:42.700
to 67.4 divided by 20.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.438
We can get our calculator out.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:45.433
Let's see.

00:01:45.648 --> 00:01:53.766
So we have 67.4 divided by 20 is 3.37.

00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:57.500
So this is equal to 3.37.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.266
So how does that help us?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.633
We know how to calculate an expected value

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:06.300
given this frequency
table right over here.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.566
If we say that this
number right over here,

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.567
let's say that's capital A

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:13.900
and let's say that this
number here is capital B,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.967
if we were to try to calculate
the expected value of a roll,

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:20.300
what we really want to do is
take the weighted frequency

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.701
of each of these values,

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:22.834
the weighted sum.

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:27.966
So, for example, if we got
a 1 A out of 500 times,

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:32.966
it would be A out of 500 times 1,

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:36.365
times 1 plus,

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:37.967
I'll do this in different colors,

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:42.434
plus 110 out of 500 times 2,

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:46.500
plus 110 out of 500 times 2.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.966
Notice, this is the frequency which was

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:49.668
they got 2 times 2.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:54.033
We're taking a weighted
sum of these values.

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:59.768
And then plus 95 out of 500 times 3,

00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:05.300
plus 95 out of 500 times 3,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.900
plus,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.300
I think you see where this is going,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.100
70 over 500 times 4,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.433
plus 70 over 500 times 4,

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:17.833
almost there,

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:21.501
plus, let's see, I haven't
used this brown color,

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:25.101
plus 75 over 500 times,

00:03:25.101 --> 00:03:25.701
I'll do it here,

00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:31.801
plus 75 over 500 times 5.

00:03:31.832 --> 00:03:38.166
Finally, plus B over 500,

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:45.700
plus B over 500 times 6,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.500
this is going to give us our
expected value of a roll,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.034
which is going to be equal to 3.37.

00:03:52.034 --> 00:04:00.266
So all of this is equal to 3.37.

00:04:00.638 --> 00:04:01.835
One thing that we can do,

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:02.900
since we have all these 500s

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.766
and this denominator right over here,

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:07.900
let's multiply both sides
of this equation times 500.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.166
If we do that, the left-hand side becomes,

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:17.500
well, 500 times A over 500 is
just going to be A plus 110,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.167
plus 110 times 2.

00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:23.368
So it's going to be 220.

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:29.998
Plus 95 times 3, that's
going to be 15 less than 300,

00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:32.306
so it's going to be plus 285,

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:35.500
plus 285,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.166
and then 70 times 4 is 280,

00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:41.366
plus 280.

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:46.101
75 times 5 is going to be 350 plus 25,

00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:48.103
375,

00:04:48.103 --> 00:04:50.867
so plus 375,

00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:58.300
plus 6B.

00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:00.766
let me make sure I'm not
skipping any steps here,

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:06.966
plus 6B is going to be
equal to this times 500,

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:13.433
and that is going to be
equal to 3.37 times 500

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:16.235
is equal to 1,685,

00:05:16.235 --> 00:05:18.500
1,685.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.993
All I did to go from this
step right over here,

00:05:20.993 --> 00:05:23.670
which I set up saying here,
this is the expected value

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.967
of one roll, which we
already know to be 3.37,

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:31.300
is I just multiplied both
sides of this equation by 500.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.966
I just did this times 500,

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.833
and I did this times 500,

00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:40.300
and this 500 obviously
cancels with all of these,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.233
and then 500 times 3.37 is 16.85,

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:45.034
and so I got this right over here.

00:05:45.034 --> 00:05:47.700
Now, I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.034
Yup, I did enough.

00:05:49.034 --> 00:05:50.500
I have the right number of terms.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.768
I just want to make sure I'm
not making a careless mistake.

00:05:52.768 --> 00:05:54.300
If we want to simplify this,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.900
we can subtract 220, 285,
280, and 375 from both sides.

00:05:59.668 --> 00:06:02.508
If we did that, we would get A,

00:06:02.508 --> 00:06:04.033
if we subtract that
from the left-hand side,

00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:06.571
we're just going to get A plus 6B,

00:06:06.663 --> 00:06:08.439
A plus 6B.

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.300
And on the right-hand side,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.034
we are going to get,

00:06:12.034 --> 00:06:13.500
let's get our calculator out,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:20.967
1,685 minus 220,

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:22.367
220,

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:26.100
minus 285

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.033
minus 280

00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:34.900
minus 375

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.740
gets us to 525.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:46.766
So we get A plus 6B is equal to 525.

00:06:46.766 --> 00:06:48.436
You say, "OK, you did all that work,

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:50.167
"but we still have one
equation with 2 unknowns.

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:55.534
"How do we figure out what
A and B actually are?"

00:06:55.835 --> 00:06:56.901
We know something else,

00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.841
We know, and this is actually
much easier to figure out,

00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:01.767
we know that the sum of this
whole table right over here,

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:04.966
A plus 110 plus 95 plus 70 plus 75 plus B

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.567
is equal to 500.

00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:07.967
Or if we ...

00:07:07.967 --> 00:07:09.100
Let me write that down.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:24.572
So we know that A plus 110
plus 95 plus 70 plus 75 plus B

00:07:24.696 --> 00:07:28.944
needs to be equal to 500.

00:07:28.992 --> 00:07:32.301
Or we could subtract 110
plus 95 plus 70 plus 75

00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.688
from both sides and get,

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:36.502
if you subtract it from
the left-hand side,

00:07:36.502 --> 00:07:39.366
you're just left with A plus B,

00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:41.712
A plus B,

00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:42.834
and on the right-hand side,

00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:46.768
if we start with 500,

00:07:46.768 --> 00:07:50.551
so 500 minus 110

00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:53.290
minus 95

00:07:53.967 --> 00:07:56.293
minus 70

00:07:57.094 --> 00:07:59.489
minus 75

00:07:59.568 --> 00:08:01.986
gets us to 150.

00:08:01.986 --> 00:08:05.034
So A plus B must be equal to 150,

00:08:05.034 --> 00:08:08.567
is equal to 150.

00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:11.566
Now we have a system of 2
equations and 2 unknowns,

00:08:11.566 --> 00:08:13.100
and so we know how to solve those.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.166
We could do it by substitution

00:08:15.166 --> 00:08:18.300
or we could subtract the
second equation from the first,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.766
so let's do that.

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:22.633
Let's subtract the left-hand
side of this equation from that

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:25.504
or essentially, we could multiply

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:27.900
this one times a negative 1

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.433
and then add these 2 equations.

00:08:30.433 --> 00:08:32.434
The As are going to cancel out,

00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:34.366
and we are going to be left with

00:08:34.366 --> 00:08:42.100
6B minus B is 5B is equal to 375,

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.100
is equal to 375.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:47.900
Did I do that right?

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.905
If I add 125 to this, I get to 500,

00:08:49.905 --> 00:08:52.234
then another 25, I get to 525.

00:08:52.234 --> 00:08:54.767
So 5B is equal to 375,

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:58.034
or if we divide both sides by 5,

00:08:58.034 --> 00:09:05.134
we get B is equal to 75.

00:09:05.284 --> 00:09:07.433
B is equal to 75.

00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:10.233
This right over here is equal to 75.

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:13.033
If B is equal to 75, what is A?

00:09:13.033 --> 00:09:16.434
We know that A plus B is equal to 500.

00:09:16.434 --> 00:09:17.833
We figured that out a little while ago

00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:19.368
before we multiplied both sides of this

00:09:19.368 --> 00:09:20.900
times a negative 1.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.085
We knew that A plus B,

00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:27.433
when B is now 75,

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.833
so we could say A plus 75,

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:34.771
is equal to 150,

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:36.700
and that's just from this,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.633
we figured out that A
plus B is equal to 150

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:41.900
before we multiplied both
sides times a negative.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.901
Subtract 75 from both sides,

00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:48.634
you get A is also equal to 75.

00:09:48.634 --> 00:09:51.000
And we are done.
