00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.813
- There's two kinds of ideal
sources we're gonna talk about.

00:00:02.813 --> 00:00:04.652
One is an ideal voltage source,

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:07.768
and the other is an ideal current source.

00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:10.681
A ideal voltage source, the symbol is,

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:12.264
looks like a circle

00:00:14.457 --> 00:00:15.290
like that.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.906
We put a voltage indication
right inside there

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:23.262
and that's called V.

00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:25.540
And this is a constant voltage,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.123
what I've shown here
is a constant voltage.

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:37.556
And that come from a power supply

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.479
or it could come from a battery.

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:40.564
When it comes from a battery,

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:41.986
we have a special symbol for that,

00:00:41.986 --> 00:00:44.327
the battery symbol looks like this

00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:48.193
and the convention for
this, we also label it V.

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:52.038
The convention for the
polarity of a battery symbol

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:55.654
is the long line there
is the plus terminal

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:58.224
and the short line right there,

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.711
that guy is the minus terminal.

00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:03.093
So that's the convention for a battery.

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:06.019
The other type of ideal source
is called a current source

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.008
and it also has a symbol with a circle

00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:10.930
and this one we put an arrow

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.919
and it goes in the
direction of the current.

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:15.695
The current symbol is I.

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:17.158
It can look like that

00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:19.143
or we could point the arrow
the other way, like that,

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:22.173
depending on how the application goes.

00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:25.015
And that's an ideal current source.

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:29.182
And those are the two
symbols for constant current.

00:01:38.087 --> 00:01:39.769
One of the things we can do,

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:43.761
we can plot these, we can plot
theses two voltage sources,

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:46.185
the voltage source and the current source.

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:48.065
We can plot them on a curve

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:51.368
that has coordinates
as voltage and current.

00:01:51.368 --> 00:01:53.520
So this would be called an IV curve

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.401
or an IV plot that we're about to do here.

00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:57.365
For a constant voltage source,

00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:59.246
the voltage doesn't change.

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:00.584
The current goes up and down,

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:03.739
depending on what the rest
of the circuit demands,

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.958
but the voltage is the same everywhere,

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.298
so it plots something like this.

00:02:09.298 --> 00:02:13.298
That would be the IV plot
of a constant voltage,

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.238
where V equals some constant V.

00:02:18.768 --> 00:02:21.900
And if we wanna plot our
constant current source

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.243
on this kind of IV plot,
this would be something where

00:02:25.243 --> 00:02:27.020
the current is always the same,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.360
the current is the same,
independent of the voltage.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.969
And so a plot of that

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.268
for a positive current
would look like this

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:37.435
and we would say something
like I equals a constant I.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.397
So that's the IV plot of a current source

00:02:41.397 --> 00:02:44.397
and the IV plot of a voltage source.

00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:47.708
Alright, these are the two basic ways

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:50.049
we deliver power or signals into circuits.

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.285
Now we have a complete set of elements

00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:54.192
that we can build things with.
