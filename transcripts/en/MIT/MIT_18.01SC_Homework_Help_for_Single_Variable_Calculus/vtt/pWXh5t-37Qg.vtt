CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.850
In this video, I'd like us to
practice integration by parts.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.410
Specifically, I'd like to solve
the following four problems.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.150
Or I'd like you to solve
the following four problems.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.760
I'd like us to find
antiderivatives

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.200
for each of these functions.
x e to the minus x,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.340
x cubed over the quantity
1 plus x squared squared,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.540
arctan x, and natural
log x over x squared.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.300
And so the main goal, because
we're using integration

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780
by parts, is to figure out
what you should make u,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.970
and what you should
make v prime.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.611
And why don't you
give it a shot.

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:43.860
Work on that for a little bit.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.620
I'm actually going
to give you one hint,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.830
and that's that this one,
you may want to break up

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.140
in a nontraditional way.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.260
You may not want to break
it up as x cubed and 1

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.350
over this function.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.930
You're going to want to split up
this function in the numerator.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.200
Part of it will be in u, part
of it will be in v prime.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.039
So that's my hint on number 2.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.580
So now with that information,
I'd like you to give it a shot,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.890
and then I'll come back, and
I'll show you how I do it.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.050
OK, welcome back.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.570
So again, what we're looking
for is antiderivatives for each

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.180
of these four functions.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820
And now, what I'm
going to do, is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.120
I'm going to help you
pick u and v prime,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.680
and then I'm going to show
you what answer I got.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.140
And I'm going to let you
do the work in the middle.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.890
So let's start
off with number 1.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.136
So if I have x e to the
minus x-- integral of x e

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:43.370
to the minus x
dx, it's very easy

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.600
to do either-- to make either
e to the minus x either u or v

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.100
prime.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.330
Doesn't really matter.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.490
Because an integral
of e to the minus

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.850
x is going to have an
e to the minus x again,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.550
and a derivative is going to
have an e to the minus x again,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.010
with a minus sign in
front, in both cases.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.740
But this doesn't really change.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.364
So we have-- when
we go up or down,

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:03.155
it doesn't really matter
if we integrate up

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:04.430
or take a derivative.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.270
So really it's, we
get to pick what

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.160
we do with the e to the
minus x based on what

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.610
we want to do with the x.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.310
Well, we like taking
derivatives of things

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.710
that don't have two functions
of x, so it would be nice if we

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.460
chose our integration
by parts pieces

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.264
so that this thing
wasn't there anymore.

00:02:22.264 --> 00:02:24.180
So let me write down--
actually, before I even

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.890
do number 1, maybe
I should remind you

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.590
what the integration
by parts formula is.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.010
So let me just, I'll scratch
that out for a second.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.843
And what we're doing,
is we're going to have

00:02:32.843 --> 00:02:35.705
integral of u v prime dx.

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:37.455
And if you recall what
you saw in lecture,

00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:42.880
is this should be equal to u*v
minus the integral v u prime

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.240
dx.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.782
And we'll put that plus c,
because sometimes I forget

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:47.740
to write it at the end.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.712
So I'll put it there,
so I don't forget.

00:02:49.712 --> 00:02:52.045
So really, what we're trying
to do, right, is pick the u

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:53.540
and v prime.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.470
And so we want to
make this thing,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.030
this v u prime, as
simple as possible.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.700
So what I was saying is if we
make this v prime or this u,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.870
it doesn't matter.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.820
So let's pick whether we
want this to be u or v prime.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.930
Well, if I make this
u, then u prime is 1.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.900
That's good.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.450
If I make it v prime, then
v is x squared over 2.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.690
That's more complicated.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.480
So we obviously
want to make this u.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.150
So for number 1, we're going
to choose u is equal to x,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.520
and v prime is equal
to e to the minus x.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.650
And then you can
proceed from there.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.270
And I'll leave it at that.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.310
Well, actually, just
to make sure we're OK,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.970
I'll even write u
prime is equal to 1,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.750
and v is going to be equal
to negative e to the minus x.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.120
So we'd be able to
proceed from there, right?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.020
We have all the pieces we need.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.420
Now, number 2-- I'll give you
the final answers at the end.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.760
Number 2, picking u and v prime
is a little more complicated.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.920
And let's look at this function.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.436
x cubed over 1 plus
x squared squared.

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:04.090
The problem with picking--
that does not look like a 2.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.660
Sorry.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.100
The problem with picking
u and v prime here,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.780
is that it's hard to see what's
going to be easy to integrate.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.700
So what we want to
do is rewrite this

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.050
as-- let's see-- x
squared times x over 1

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.840
plus x squared squared.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.324
And now, why is this any better?

00:04:27.324 --> 00:04:28.740
Well, I mean, it's
the same thing.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.370
But why does this help us
see what we want to do?

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.770
Well, if you notice this thing
right here-- 1 plus x squared.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.020
What is its derivative?

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.260
Its derivative is 2x.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.960
Up here we have an x.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.180
So this piece right
here looks like it

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.730
could be much more easily
integrated than this right

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.120
here.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.692
So this might be a
little counterintuitive,

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:53.900
because we're going to take
the harder-looking thing,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.990
and make that our v prime.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.620
But the nice thing is
that we can actually

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.340
integrate this quantity.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.170
So we choose, in this
case, this is our u,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.146
and this is our v prime.

00:05:10.146 --> 00:05:11.270
So how do I integrate this?

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.660
Well, I integrate this
by using a substitution.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.260
And that will give me v.
And the derivative of this

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.970
is quite simple.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.511
It's just 2x.

00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:18.610
Right?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.550
But this is the strategy
that we want here.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.400
Why did we even think to
split that up like that?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.710
Well, we knew we had to
deal with the denominator

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.770
in some fashion, and
taking a derivative

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.950
with this in the
denominator-- so

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.040
putting this part of
the function in u--

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.370
when I look at u prime,
it's going to be even worse.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.470
It's going to be a
higher power here.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.720
It's going to be a cubic
in the denominator.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.160
That's just making things worse.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.830
So we know we'd like to
integrate this denominator.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.870
We'd like it to be
a part of v prime.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.850
But the problem is that if I
put all the x cubed in the u,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.220
and if I just had a 1 here
for my v prime, that's, I

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.820
can't really integrate
that very well.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.130
But if I keep one
of the x's, then I

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.920
can integrate this quite
simply with a substitution.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.210
So that's the sort of
reasoning behind why

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.850
we choose it that way.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.350
All right.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.183
We've got two more to
look at, and then I'll

00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:09.720
give you the answers.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.350
3.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.850
OK.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.410
3, you've seen
this trick before.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.500
The function was arctan x.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.620
Now, you've seen this
trick I'm about to do

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.280
with natural log of x.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.170
The same kind of thing
with natural log of x.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.946
You actually saw this in
one of the lecture videos.

00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:27.570
Because there's only
one function here,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.710
you might think, well, I have
no idea what I'm supposed

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.330
to pick for u and v prime.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.490
But remember, it's
really arctan x times 1.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.120
Now I have two functions.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.260
And what gives us a hint for
why we would want to do this,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.840
is that what's the
derivative of arctan x?

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.197
Let me just remind you.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.410
d/dx of arctan is 1
over 1 plus x squared.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.970
Right?

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.640
We're back to actually an
almost similar situation to what

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.560
we had in the previous thing.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.990
d/dx of arctan x is 1
over 1 plus x squared.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.220
So taking a derivative
of this puts it

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.600
in a form that almost
looks easy to integrate.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.920
What would make this
function easy to integrate?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.310
If there was an x up
here, instead of a 1.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.830
Then I could use substitution.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.090
Where do we get that
x from when we're

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.880
solving this problem, where
we're actually finding

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.930
an antiderivative of arctan x?

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.070
Well, it's going to come from
the fact that I make this u,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.210
and I make 1 v prime.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.620
So let me write
that out explicitly.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.790
u I make arctan x,
and v prime I make 1.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.910
What does that do
in our formula?

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.550
Well, we're going
to be integrating

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.990
something that is v u prime.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.070
Well, v is going to be x, and
u prime we see right here.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.530
So it's going to be, I'm going
to be integrating x over 1

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.280
plus x squared when I started
doing the integration by parts

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.200
method.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.500
That's much simpler, as we
talked about previously,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.500
because the derivative
of x squared is 2x,

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.440
and you have an x in
the numerator when

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.250
you put in that v.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.630
So this is sort of the flavor
of how these things are actually

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.475
working.

00:08:08.475 --> 00:08:12.410
So let me do the final one here.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.950
We have ln x over x squared.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:17.960
OK.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.240
Let me just tell you right now.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.500
In integration by
parts, natural log x

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.139
is not something you
want to make the v prime.

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:27.180
You don't want to try and
take an antiderivative.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.480
You know an antiderivative
of natural log of x.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.560
x ln x minus x.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.340
But that's certainly not going
to make things any easier.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:34.840
Right?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.214
You're actually--
then you've got

00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:38.460
a product of two
functions all of a sudden.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.700
Everything's getting
more complicated.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.640
But natural log of x has a very
nice derivative, because you

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.300
end up with something that
has just a power of x.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.529
Derivative of natural log
of x is just 1 over x.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.070
So that's probably
the way you always

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.150
want to go when you see natural
log of x in these integration

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.650
by parts techniques.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.730
Because if I choose u is equal
to ln x, and then v prime.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.890
In this case, I'm going
to write it as a power.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.690
Let's think about what happened.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.050
u prime is 1 over x, right?

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.500
So u prime is x to the minus 1.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.430
What's v?

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.900
Well, it's something
like, let's see.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.215
Negative x to the minus 1.

00:09:16.215 --> 00:09:17.340
Something like that, right?

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.714
Let's make sure
I did that right.

00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:20.410
Yeah, I think I did that right.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.550
So all of a sudden, if
I integrate v u prime,

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.750
that's just a power rule.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.820
It's x to the minus 2,
negative x to the minus 2.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.120
So that's quite
easy to integrate.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.050
So again, when I see natural
log of x in an integration

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.990
by parts method,
almost always, I

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.770
hate to say always,
almost always,

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.050
almost a guarantee that you
want to take a derivative.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.967
You want to make that the u.

00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:47.300
So hopefully that makes sense,
some of these strategies.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.760
I tried to pick ones that
were somewhat different,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.950
so you could see some different
types of strategies we needed.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.385
And now I've done these earlier.

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.760
So I'm just going to write
down what the answers actually

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.050
are, and you can
compare to what you got.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.064
So the answer to number
1, just to check.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.430
Number 2.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.200
Some of these are kind of long.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.250
Number 3.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.135
Number 4.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.930
So let's just go through.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.370
We get-- in number 1, we get
negative x e to the minus x

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.930
minus e to the minus x plus c.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.740
Number 2, we get
negative x squared

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.300
over 2 times 1 plus x squared
plus 1/2 natural log 1 plus x

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.480
squared plus c.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.210
Three is x arc tan x minus 1/2
natural log of the quantity 1

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.035
plus x squared plus c, and
four is negative natural log

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:15.290
x over x minus 1 over x plus c.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.550
So again, the whole point of
this exercise, in my mind,

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.600
is really to make sure we
get a good understanding of,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.440
when we're doing integration
by parts, which function makes

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.200
the most sense to have as u, and
which function makes the most

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.280
sense to have as v prime.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.470
So that was the main
point of this exercise.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.110
Hopefully you're starting
to get a flavor for how

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.340
these problems actually work.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.331
And I think I will stop there.
