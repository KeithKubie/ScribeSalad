00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.250
We're on problem 240.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.630
Seed mixture x is 40% rye
grass and 60% bluegrass.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.240
Let's see, x is 40% rye grass
and 60% bluegrass.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.070
Fair enough.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:26.110
Seed mixture y is 25% rye
grass-- so it's 0.25 rye

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.690
grass-- and 75% fescue.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.850
So I should look up
what that is.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.780
75% fescue.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.650
If a mixture of x and y contain
30% rye grass, what

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.690
percent of the weight
of the mixture is x?

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.310
OK.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.560
Well, let's say that A is equal
to the percent of weight

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.280
of mixture that is x, what
they're asking for.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.650
So how much rye grass-- what
percentage of that mixture

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.450
will be rye grass that
comes from x?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.650
Well, we have A%, or you know,
we could call that-- fraction

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.740
A of the mixture is from x.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.040
And then x is 40% rye grass.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.010
So if we multiply the amount
that we're getting from x

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.110
times 40%, times 0.4, this'll
tell us the amount of rye

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.490
grass from x.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.810
So r from x, or the proportion
of rye grass from x.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.430
And now, how much rye grass are
we going to get from y?

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.630
So first of all, what's
our proportion of y?

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.870
If this mixture is A of
x, there's going to be

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.450
1 minus A of y.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.160
If this is 1/4, this is going
to be 3/4, right?

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.930
Makes sense.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.240
So this is how much y we have,
and y is 25% rye grass.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.180
So our rye grass from y will
be the amount of y we have

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.630
times how much y is rye grass.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.920
So this is rye grass from y.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.580
And they tell us that this
is equal to a mixture.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.520
The mixture should have
30% rye grass.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.310
So let's just solve for A.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.100
We get 0.4 times A plus-- let's
see, multiply-- 0.25

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.780
minus 0.25A-- just distributed
the 0.25-- is equal to 0.30.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.550
0.4A minus 0.25A-- 40 minus
25-- that's 0.15A.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.240
And then subtract 0.25 from both
sides, is equal to 0.5.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.890
So A is equal to 0.5 divided by
0.15, is the same thing as

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.427
5 over 15, which is equal to
1/3, which is equal to 33 and

00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:57.360
1/3%, Which is choice B.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.260
Next problem.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.210
Problem 241.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.560
If the integer n has exactly
three positive divisors,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.480
including 1 and n-- so it's
divisors are, I don't know, 1,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.990
some number, and n-- how many
positive divisors does n

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.790
squared have?

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.900
So one thing, I don't know if
you've ever thought about

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.890
this, but how can any
number have an

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.660
odd number of divisors?

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.000
Right?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.200
Because normally, if you take
a number, let's take the

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.500
number 6-- and you shouldn't
do this on the GMAT, it's a

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.510
waste of time.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.230
But its divisors are 1 times
6, or 2 times 3.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.060
So every divisor tends to have
a corresponding divisor.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.100
So how can you have an odd
number of divisors?

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.790
Well, only if one of the
divisor's corresponding

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.020
divisors is itself.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.070
If it's 1 times n, and x times
x, which implies that if you

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.590
have an odd number of divisors,
you're dealing with

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.780
a perfect square.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.810
Anyway, I just wanted
to point that out.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.840
But that's actually not that
relevant to that problem.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.350
It's just something, you know,
it is useful sometimes.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.810
But anyway.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.490
They just want to know how many
divisors n squared has.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.180
Let's just find a number
that has this property.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.180
Well, we know any perfect
square-- well, a small perfect

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.680
square will have
this property.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.560
So let's see.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.085
Number 4, it has its property.

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:17.690
It's factors are 1, 2, and 4.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.250
So how many factors does
4 squared have?

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.490
Well, 4 squared is 16.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.250
Its factors are 1 and 16,
2 and 8, and 4 and 4.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.870
So it has five factors,
and that is choice B.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.340
And you could do it
mathematically.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.820
You could say all the
combinations of when I

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.990
multiply all the factors of
this times itself, and you

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.050
could say, oh, they have
five combinations.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.540
But in this case, it's just way
easier to think of, OK,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.110
let me think of a small perfect
square that's going to

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.930
have three factors.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.990
A perfect square just tells you
it has an odd number of

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.690
factors, but a small one
will have three.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.700
And let me just square it and
just count its factors.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.550
Fastest way to do that
problem, I think.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.300
Unless there is-- I
don't know, maybe

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.940
there is a faster one.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.440
242.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.340
If n is a positive integer, then
n times n plus 1, times n

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.870
plus 2 is-- OK, they have
a bunch of things.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.130
What happens when n-- let's see,
even when n is even, the

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.620
even only one is odd,
odd [? 1n ?]

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.670
is odd.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.080
OK, so they want us to
see what happens when

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.850
n is even or odd.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.100
So let's see what happens
when n is even.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.210
Let's say that n-- if n is even,
that means it's equal to

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.700
2 times some integer k.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.110
We don't know, some positive
integer k.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.220
So let's substitute that in.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.470
So then this breaks down
to 2k times 2k plus 1,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.330
times 2k plus 2.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.460
Interesting.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.190
And let's see, it looks like
this is saying that e should

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.640
be-- right.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.400
Because let's see, we could
factor 2 out of this one.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:53.390
So this becomes 2k times
2k plus 1, times 2,

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.500
times k plus 1.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.830
Right?

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.330
I just factored the
2 out of there.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.760
And let's multiply these two.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.910
So you get 4k times 2k plus
1, times k plus 1.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.490
So this one is divisible by 4.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.250
And I just glanced at statement
e, they talk about

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.200
divisibility by 4, so
I think we're done.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.910
This simplifies to this if we
can assume that n is even.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.420
So if n is even, then we are
definitely divisible by 4.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.660
4 can definitely go into
the number evenly.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.350
So statement E is right.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.410
Divisible by 4 when n is even.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.170
Statement E.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.070
Next problem.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.130
We're on the last page, 243.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.720
A straight pipe 1 yard in
length was marked off in

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.950
fourths and also in thirds.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.770
Maybe I'll give some
dimensionality to

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.150
our straight pipe.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.730
So let's say the pipe looks
something like that.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.260
It's a straight pipe, and
it was marked off

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.400
in fourths and thirds.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.640
So if I mark it off in fourths,
let's see, that's the

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.350
middle, and that's a
fourth, and that's

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.200
another fourth, roughly.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.130
And if I mark it off
in thirds, it looks

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.130
something like this.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.040
Right?

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.780
All right.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.790
If the pipe was then cut into
separate pieces at each of

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.260
these markings, which of the
following gives all the

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.720
different lengths of the pieces
in fraction of a yard?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.240
Fascinating.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.590
OK, so we're going to cut it,
actually, at here, and here,

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.955
and here, and here,
and at here.

00:07:22.955 --> 00:07:25.350
And actually, if we go halfway,
then we can just use

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.930
symmetry to say, OK, this piece
is going to be the same

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.180
as this piece, and this piece
is going to be the same as

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.820
this piece, and that piece
is going to be the

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.030
same as that piece.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.720
So we really just have to
figure out up until the

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.390
halfway point.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.020
So let's think about it.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.940
So this whole thing is 1 yard,
so this distance right here,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.190
that distance right
here is 1/4.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.620
That distance is 1/4.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.980
We know that this whole
distance is 1/3.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.820
This distance is 1/4, so this
distance right here is going

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.570
to be 1/3, because that's
1/3, minus 1/4.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.790
Common denominator over 12.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.910
1/3 is 4/12, minus 3/12
is equal to 1/12.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.290
So this distance is
going to be 1/12.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.330
And then what's going
to be this length?

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.340
Let me get a different color.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.540
I want to make sure that
you see that 1/12.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.960
Well, this distance is 1/2, and
this distance is 1/3, so

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.290
it's going to be 1/2 minus 1/3
is equal to common denominator

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:32.200
of 6, is equal to 3/6 minus
2/6, is equal to 1/6.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.080
So this piece is 1/4.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.090
This piece is 1/12.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.929
This piece is 1/6.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.530
And then you could just say, oh,
well, it's going to happen

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.549
the same thing on
the other side.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:46.590
This is 1/6, 1/12, and
then this is 1/4.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.670
And so if I say-- let's see,
1/6, 1/12, and 1/4.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.460
Right, that is choice D.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.440
1/6, 1/12, and 1/4.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:56.900
Choice D.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.590
Those are the different
piece sizes we have.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:08.970
Problem 245.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:25.640
If 0.0015 times 10 to the m,
over 0.03 times 10 to the k,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:35.970
is equal to 5 times 10 to the
seventh, then what does m

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.230
minus k equal to?

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.580
And that's important to
read, I was about to

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.800
solve-- m minus k.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.700
So they want to know
what m minus k.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.030
So if we immediately divide
these, we should be able to

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.640
come up with something
interesting, right?

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:58.190
Because this is the same thing
as 0.0015/0.03 times 10 to the

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.970
m divided by 10 to the k.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:06.270
Well, that's just times 10 to
the m minus k, is equal to 5

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.470
times 10 to the seventh.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.050
And I don't know, let's see if
we can do anything interesting

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.800
to this decimal number.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.100
Let's see, if we were to--
let's just divide it.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.840
So if we just say 0.03, instead
of multiplying by 10

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.640
and doing-- going into 0.0015.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.350
Let's add some 0's.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.260
OK.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.120
If we take this decimal two to
the right, we're going to take

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.290
this decimal two to the right.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.900
So then we get 3 goes into 1
zero times, 3 goes into 15

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.880
five times.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.700
So we get 0.05.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.230
So this whole thing simplifies
to-- and I'll write it in

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:53.490
magenta-- so that simplifies
to 0.05 times 10 to the m

00:10:53.490 --> 00:11:00.560
minus k, is equal to 5 times
10 to the seventh.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.850
So let's divide both
sides by this 0.05.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.540
What is 0.05 goes into 5?

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.330
Let's add some decimal
points here.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.200
So if I push this to the right
two, I push this to the right

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.230
two, and this is my
new decimal point.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.410
So 5 goes into 5-- well,
5 goes into 5 one

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.300
time, so it's 100.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.070
Right?

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.750
So 5 divided by 0.05 is 100.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:31.800
So we get 10 to the m minus k,
is equal to 100-- what's 100?

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.810
That's the same thing
as 10 squared.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.870
Times 10 to the 7th.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:41.680
So 10 to the m minus k is equal
to 10 to the ninth.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.530
So m minus k must
be equal to 9.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.300
And that is choice A.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.360
See you in the next video.
