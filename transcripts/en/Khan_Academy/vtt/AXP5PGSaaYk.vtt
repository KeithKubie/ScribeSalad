00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:01.827
- [Voiceover] Let's do some examples

00:00:01.827 --> 00:00:06.444
where we're finding sums
of finite geometric series.

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:08.438
Now let's just remind
ourselves in a previous video

00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:12.376
we derived the formula where
the sum of the first n terms

00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:14.543
is equal to our first term

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:19.269
times one minus our common ratio

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.199
to the nth power all over
one minus our common ratio.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.091
So let's apply that to this
finite geometric series

00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:29.553
right over here.

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:32.231
So what is our first term
and what is our common ratio?

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:33.870
And what is our n?

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.416
Well, some of you might
just be able to pick it out

00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:38.112
by inspecting this here, but
for the sake of this example,

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:39.860
let's expand this out a little bit.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.225
This is going to be equal to
two times three to the zero,

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:44.498
which is just two,

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:47.709
plus two times three to the first power,

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:51.222
plus two times three to the second power,

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:52.620
I can write first power there,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.595
plus two times three to the third power,

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:59.881
and we're gonna go all
the way to two times three

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.985
to the 99th power.

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:03.617
So what is our first term?

00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:05.084
What is our a?

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:07.082
Well, a is going to be two.

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:10.189
And we see that in all
of these terms here.

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.533
So a is going to be two.

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.824
What is r?

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:17.023
Well, each successive term,
as k increases by one,

00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:18.901
we're multiplying by three again.

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:22.121
So, three is our common ratio.

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.750
So that right over there, that is r.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.272
Let me make sure that we, that is a.

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:30.686
And now what is n going to be?

00:01:30.686 --> 00:01:32.029
Well, you might be tempted to say,

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:35.220
well, we're going up to k
equals 99, maybe n is 99,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.850
but we have to realize that
we're starting at k equals zero.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.675
So there is actually 100 terms here.

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:42.121
Notice, when k equals zero,
that's our first term,

00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:43.766
when k equals one, that's our second term,

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.775
when k equals two, that's our third term,

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:47.752
when k equals three,
that's our fourth term,

00:01:47.752 --> 00:01:51.919
when k equals 99, this is
our 100th term, 100th term.

00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:56.451
So what we really want
to find is S sub 100.

00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:59.665
So let's write that down, S sub 100,

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:03.748
for this geometric series
is going to be equal to

00:02:06.348 --> 00:02:10.098
two times one minus
three to the 100th power,

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:14.944
to the 100th power, all of that,

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:20.634
all of that over, all of
that over one minus three.

00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:25.820
And we could simplify
this, I mean at this point

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.384
it is arithmetic that
you'd be dealing with,

00:02:28.384 --> 00:02:30.803
but down here you would
have a negative two,

00:02:30.803 --> 00:02:34.023
and so you'd have two
divided by negative two

00:02:34.023 --> 00:02:35.355
so that is just a negative.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.348
And so negative of one
minus three to the 100th,

00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:41.844
that's the same thing, this is
equal to three to the 100th,

00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:44.761
three to the 100th power minus one.

00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:46.878
And we're done.
