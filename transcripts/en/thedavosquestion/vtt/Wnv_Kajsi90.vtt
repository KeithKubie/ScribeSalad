Well I think China of course is going to be
one of the places with the most growth in

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.920
the world. And will in that way, in a large
part, be most responsible for pulling the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.770
global economy to a much better place then
if China weren't growing. But I think every

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.099
country needs it's own responsibility towards
contributing towards the recovery. I think

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.409
as China has with its substantial stimulus,
with a lot of other policy measures, both

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.099
on a micro and macro level is encouraging
and stimulating it's own recovery. I think

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.439
every country's gotta participate.
