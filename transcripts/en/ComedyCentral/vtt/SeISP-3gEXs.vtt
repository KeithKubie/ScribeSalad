(electronic whooshing
and beeping)

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.406
- Come on, you gotta hit this.

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:07.807 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't know,
man, we're working.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.410
- I'm never not
high at this job.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.579 align:start size:81% position:19%
Come on, man, this
is how we roll.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.813
Mort, tell him.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.348 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Hey, he made do this
my first time, too.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:16.716
Don't worry, I also hated it.

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.118
- [Driver] And now Mort
and I are best friends.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.085
- [Mort] 'Cause he
made me get rid of

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.253
the rest of my friends.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.222 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He had two friends,
both named Gary.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.189
And they sucked.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.424
- I loved the Garys.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.658
- Why don't we just
deliver these pizzas?

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.394
- Are you the trainee
or am I the trainee?

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.628
I'm wearing the red shirt.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:29.696 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're wearin' a
played-out white shirt

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.064 align:start size:72% position:28%
like a pussy.
- Okay,

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:32.198
let's take it easy, huh?

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.666
- Just hazing.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.335 align:start position:0%
But seriously, man, Samuel
said I'm supposed to train you.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.736
I'm the head delivery driver.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.271
Red shirts are for closers.

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.374
- Isn't the deal closed
when they make the order?

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:42.776
- Just hit this, man!

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.844
- I don't want to, man.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:45.879
- He's gonna be pretty shitty

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.247
to you until you
smoke that weed.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.681
- Yeah.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.217
(sighs)

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.453 align:start size:72% position:28%
- All right.
- Yeah!

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.554
- One hit.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.222 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're a party man.
- One hit.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.190
(laughing)

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.024
Why's it look like this?

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.926
- It's a dick pipe, go.

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:02.328 align:start size:84% position:16%
Oh my God, wait,
that's the crack pipe.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.430
- Oh fuck, spit it
out, spit it out!

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.732
- (laughing) Classic haze!

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.467
(laughing)

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.668 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Is it--
- It's just weed.

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:10.036 align:start size:88% position:13%
Take another one
because you got confused

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.304 align:start size:94% position:6%
during that one.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:12.605
- You want your brain
clear when you smoke.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.307
Yeah! (laughing)

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:15.508
- Shotgun me, shotgun me.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.342
- Don't do that, Mort.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.111
That's for girls.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.779
It's so gross.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:22.449 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh hell yeah!
- All right ,give it to me.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:23.550 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Hat trick, hat trick.
- Yeah, three-way boys out.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.319
(dub step music)

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.326 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Mort] Hey,
shouldn't one of us be

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.494
at the home base right now?

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.962 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Relax, Mort,
Samuel doesn't care.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:37.564 align:start size:84% position:16%
And besides, what's
more important?

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.032
Getting customers their food,

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.635 align:start size:81% position:19%
or bonding with
your new teammate?

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.170
- Oh, I'm really high.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.738
Too high!

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.273
I wanna call my mom.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.675
What if my stepdad answers?

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.243
Fucking hate Bruce!

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.879
- No! That's why I emphasized
that as like the positive one.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.747 align:start size:94% position:6%
Mort, you gotta be on
the same page as me, man.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.182 align:start size:75% position:25%
- I am.
- No you're not.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.617
Cause it confuses the trainee.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.918
- The trainee's
already confused.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.788
(distorted speech)

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:06.759
- No I didn't man.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.994
- Guys, I haven't been this high

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.662 align:start size:81% position:19%
since I saw Avatar
in the theater.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:10.530
(laughs)

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.731
- That movie sucked.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.199 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm psyched for
the sequel, though.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.367
Let's do this.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.636
(doorbell)

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.341
- Uh, Pie Guys delivery?

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:22.709
- This can't be my pizza.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.377
- Why not?

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:26.412
- Cause I ordered my pizza
over a fucking hour ago,

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:27.514
that's why not.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.949
- Um, I'm sorry ma'am. Man!

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.951 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Did you just call me ma'am?
- No!

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.086
- Are you stoned right now?

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.320
- No.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.021
- Don't fucking lie
to me shit stain!

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.523
(yelling)

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:37.757
- What the fuck?

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.726
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait! I know you!

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.927
- No, no, no, no, you
don't know him, Mort.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.028 align:start size:81% position:19%
Let's just do what
he says, okay?

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.530
- You're John's friend.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.398 align:start size:97% position:3%
You picked him up from
work a week ago. That's it.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.766
- Goddamn it, Mort.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:47.600
You ruined it.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.768
We were gonna X him.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:49.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Like Jimmy
Kennedy experiments.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.104 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Why was I supposed
to know, man?

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.172
- I was winking at you.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.439
- You always wink.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.908 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Trainee] But
you do wink a lot.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.109 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I don't always wink,
what are you talking about?

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.076 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Always winking.
- Do you know this guy?

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.244
- Yes, this is my buddy Steak.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.078
He's an actor.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.346
- Hey, what's up man?

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.681
Don't worry, this is
just a starter pistol.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.016
- Oh, I recognize you.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.450 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're the guy from
the carpet commercial.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.621 align:start position:0%
- Oh, yeah, "Gentleman's carpet.
Always clean, never mean."

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.191 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That makes me always think,
like, are they implying

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.826
that people at other
carpet stores are mean?

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.461
- Oh yeah, I don't know the
business side of things.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.496
I'm just the hired gun.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.330
- Yeah, yeah.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.164
- No pun intended.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:18.998
(gunshot)

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:19.866
- Oh my god!

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.134 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Sorry!
- What the fuck?

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:21.935
- I got a big fat index
finger and accidentally

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:22.669
pulled the trigger.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.836
(gunshot)

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.271 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Damn it! Can you
figure out the trigger?

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.105
- Dude, I'm sorry.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:26.940
(crying)

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.174
- You okay? You okay?

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:29.409
Go get some ice. Go
get some ice, yes.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.543
- Am I bleeding?
- No, you're not,

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.377
no you're not bleeding.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.345
- Why are you winking?

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:33.880
Unbelievable!
- Shh, shh.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.982
- Yeah, you guys were pretty
scared for a second, though.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.750 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Mort] It was more
confusing than it was scary.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.585
- Hey.

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.321
Hey, guess where I've been?

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.823
Making deliveries because
all my drivers were gone.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.058
- Relax, Samuel.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.492
- I'm sorry. I'm cool.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.561 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm cool. It's just
been very busy.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.063
- Well, instead
of yelling at us,

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.065 align:start size:97% position:3%
you should be congratulating
Rob, who, did a fantastic

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.399
job on his first delivery.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.234
High five!

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.068
- What?

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.704
- Congratulations, Rob.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Hey great work,
buddy, but be patient.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.373
Mort had to shadow
me for two months

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.841
before he could fly solo.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.276 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's because you kept
telling Samuel I wasn't ready.

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:06.813 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Shhnah. Look, your training
is almost 25% complete.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.047
Your next mission is two parts.

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.949
First part, I need you
to go to the supermarket

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:10.917
and pick up some drain cleaner.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.085
The toilet kind.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.586
Second part, go to my apartment.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:14.821 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'll give you the
address, you're gonna want

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:15.955 align:start size:88% position:13%
to go into the bathroom.
- Here.

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:17.190
You're not a trainee anymore.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.825 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Goddamn it, Samuel.
- Get in there, come on,

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.360
we're busy.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.863
- Whoa, this shirt is way
too big and super filthy.

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:25.465 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Oh yeah, must've
been Steingold's shirt.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:26.866
- Oh yeah, he had a heart
attack in the bathroom.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.101
- Mhmm.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.869
- He didn't die in
this shirt, did he?

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:31.971
- Questions are for trainees.

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.806
You're a driver now.

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:37.243
- Hey, this is your
life now, buddy. Wow!

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:42.282
(sighs)

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:45.184
