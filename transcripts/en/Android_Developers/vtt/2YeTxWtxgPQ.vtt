ROMAN NURIK: Hello, everybody,
and welcome to Android Design

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.300
in Action, our sixth show.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.790
Sixth is actually one of the
hardest word in the English

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.590
language to pronounce, which
I just found out.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.690
But Android Design in Action
is a show where we look at

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.040
different elements of
Android design.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.470
We usually take a look at
specific applications and how

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.680
their user interfaces can be
improved using the elements of

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.125
Android design, which are very
well documented on the Android

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.340
Design site.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.930
But today, we're going to be
looking at rich notifications

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.960
and local video players, as you
can see here in our slide.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.000
Before we get started,
we should

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.220
probably introduce ourselves.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.050
As always, my name
is Roman Nurik.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.920
ADAM KOCH: Hi, guys.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.470
Adam Koch.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.914
NICK BUTCHER: And Nick Butcher
here in London.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:47.650
ROMAN NURIK: Yes.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.280
I should mention that Adam and I
are broadcasting live to you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.230
from New York.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.530
So let's get started with
Android Design in Action,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.200
Local Video and Rich
Notification.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.640
What we did today was we didn't
look at any specific

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.070
local video players that
were previously

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.270
reviewed in the App Clinic.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.510
I believe they're actually
re-doing that due to some sort

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.280
of technical difficulties.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.110
But what we did today was,
instead of looking at specific

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.390
apps, we came up with an example
app that did some

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.270
similar things, but it wasn't
branded in any way.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.210
It's not kind of like
a published app.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.060
We have no intention
of publishing it.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.890
It's really just kind of a "what
if", you know, what if

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.210
we were to design a local video
player from scratch.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.040
And we didn't do all
of the screens.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.530
We only did just a few of the
screens, primarily around the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.060
browse experience.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.890
We won't be talking too much
about video playback, because

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.250
while you're playing the video,
there's a lot of things

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.490
that you can really do.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.060
And we have some examples of
apps that do it really well.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.970
For example, the YouTube
App does a fairly

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.930
good job with that.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.230
So if you already starting to
create a local video player or

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.620
a video player in general, you
should probably model your

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.250
playback screen after something
like YouTube.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.910
But what we did do is look
at browse screens

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.720
and things like that.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.009
Before we get started, does
anybody else have any things

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.075
to add to the exposition
for the show?

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:15.680
NICK BUTCHER: I'll just say at
the top of the show that,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.860
unfortunately, we don't have a
fancy studio setup this week.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.430
So while the stream quality
might be a little bit lower,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.780
you can get the slides
downloaded later.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.790
So if you're watching this, look
at the description in the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.120
YouTube video, and there
should be a link to get

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.045
high-quality slides.

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:32.530
If you can't quite make out all
the visuals, then click

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.090
through to that link.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.285
ROMAN NURIK: And we're going
to post the slides in, I

00:02:36.285 --> 00:02:40.520
think, like 2,560 by 1,440 or
something resolution, so

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.310
you'll get all the little--

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.460
NICK BUTCHER: Super
HD or something.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.560
ROMAN NURIK: Super, super, super
HD, 4D, four dimensions.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.360
OK, anyway, so let's jump
into the screens.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.080
So this is our example
local video player.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.520
And wow, I probably could have
taken up more space on the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.360
screen than just that.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.040
But this is our example
video that we have.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.010
This is an example video player
that just, again, local

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.170
content, and it shows you
a couple of things.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.220
And basically, the rough
structure of this app is that

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.510
you could imagine that you've
categorized your local videos

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.890
into different groups
or categories.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.240
We'll show that in a second.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.130
And then you might have a queue
of a local videos that

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.480
you plan on watching.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.650
And then you probably want to
have some sort of sense of

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.615
what has been recently added,
what are recently looked at

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:37.450
or, whatever has been
added in the device.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.300
So this screen is this kind of
your up next screen, which is

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.700
kind of like a dashboard
or home screen.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.630
And we chose here to showcase
the two probably most

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.660
important things-- in my
opinion, at least--

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.010
for local video playback and for
general media consumption

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.800
is what's up next, right?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.000
Either stuff that I've recently
added or stuff that

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.630
I've explicitly added
to a queue.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.920
Now, you notice that there are
a couple things you can do

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.490
with this queue.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.906
You can first--

00:04:05.906 --> 00:04:06.740
uh-oh.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.290
Actually, oh, my mouse
is moving.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.312
That's what it is.

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.076
[CHUCKLES]

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:15.730
You can first reorder the queue
items by using this

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.500
dragging affordance to the
left of each list item.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.120
This is something that again,
that you could find in the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.400
Google Play Music App within a
playlist to reorder tracks.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.760
And then below the queue,
there's the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.910
recently added list.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.840
And it's not really a
list as it is more

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.910
like a set of tiles.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.360
You've seen this several
times in the show.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.620
We use this presentation of
content fairly frequently

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.070
because it's very versatile.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.850
It works across different
device sizes.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.930
It works across different aspect
ratios of content.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.680
It's, in general, very,
very versatile.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.370
What I wanted to point out here
is that there's a lot you

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.570
can do with this tile area, and
it's going to be really

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.750
hard to show here.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.530
Let's see if this works.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.470
So zooming in on my laptop does
not work, unfortunately.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.980
But there's a lot of detail
in these tiles.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.480
If you look at the top right
tile in Recently Added, you

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.390
notice that there's a little
status indicator, indicating

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.270
that something is
in the queue.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.120
So this is something that--

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.850
again, you can use this for
starring or bookmarking or, in

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.740
this case, queueing.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.640
It's a good, nice, little,
non-interactive indicator that

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.525
this is a special item.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:32.850
And in this case, it really
means this is

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.120
already in your queue.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.010
This is just like you would
see in like Gmail or such.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.220
If something is starred,
it has an

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.190
indicator in the playlist.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.390
The other thing is that you
can swipe to dismiss items

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.250
from the queue.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.940
So we're not really using a
horizontal swipe for anything

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.690
else on this screen.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.690
And even if we were, we'd be
able to still use bezel swipe

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.760
to access adjacent
lateral content.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.190
But in this case, a queue is
something that naturally lends

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.700
itself to swipe to dismiss.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.060
So you can dismiss items, get
rid of them off of your queue

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.860
by just swiping them away.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.380
Before we move on to
other screens,

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.855
anything thoughts, guys?

00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:16.350
NICK BUTCHER: Personally,
I think

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.670
it's a very nice treatment.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.820
I think a problem with a lot of
these video-playing apps is

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.770
they seem to concentrate a lot
on the video playback, which

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.200
is awesome.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.220
I mean, it's the core utility.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.510
But then they don't make a
huge amount of effort to

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.040
follow any design guidelines
for the file

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.216
management type tasks.

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:37.780
It seems like there's a lot of
apps like in the early 90s

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.570
when everyone was building
Winamp skins.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.430
It's all about the visual bling
and then like having

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.207
17,000 different format
playbacks, but then no effort

00:06:45.207 --> 00:06:48.060
is being spent on the thing that
actually gets you to into

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.820
that presence.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.355
So I really like the
treatment here.

00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:51.760
Especially I like the key
management features with the

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.935
swipe to dismiss.

00:06:52.935 --> 00:06:55.820
I think that really works
very well here.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.490
ADAM KOCH: and I guess I kind of
like how queue is given the

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.940
priority here, and it's a sort
of infinitely growing list, so

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.160
there can be a ton of
items in your queue.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.730
And then below that, you've got
Recently Added, which may

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.515
not be as important, but kind of
nice to browse, and you can

00:07:10.515 --> 00:07:13.610
possibly add those items
straight to your queue, which

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.916
then gets that mass or
indicator, which we're always

00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:17.035
talking about.

00:07:17.035 --> 00:07:18.420
ROMAN NURIK: It's actually
very similar to

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.810
the People app, too.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.320
In the People app, you have
your Favorites tab.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.020
And in your Favorites tab, you
have the top items, which are

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.746
your starred people or your
favorite people, kind of like

00:07:28.746 --> 00:07:29.820
your quick dial.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.060
Then below that, in case you
haven't favorited anybody, or

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.620
even if you have, it's kind
of like extra content.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.980
It's kind of below the fold.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.090
It's not as important as your
favorites, but your recent or

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.880
frequently called people or
frequently contacted people

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.220
are also something that
you probably want

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.012
to have access to.

00:07:47.012 --> 00:07:50.020
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, and then if
your queue is getting kind of

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.040
short, there's not that many
items in it, then you

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.490
instantly can see those recently
added items if you

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.398
want to add something
to it, too.

00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:58.020
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.720
So let's move on to the next.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.500
Item.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.730
NICK BUTCHER:Definitely
you've mocked it up.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.421
How do you envision the action
of adding something to the

00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:05.452
queue from here?

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:07.445
ROMAN NURIK: So, I mean, adding
something to the queue

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:08.200
is a good question.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.460
We haven't really-- again, we
haven't gone into video

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.300
playback or video
detail screens.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.210
But I envisage that it will--
is that even a word?

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:16.750
Envisage?

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.010
Yeah, I'd imagine that when you
long press any video from

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.000
anywhere, you enter
a contextual--

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.295
I guess the contextual selection
mode, and they you

00:08:26.295 --> 00:08:27.860
can long press multiple
videos.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.270
And then in the contextual
action bar, you can have kind

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.600
of In Queue or Add to Queue.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.140
And then on the video playback
screen, by default, you

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.220
probably wouldn't show
the action bar.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.179
It would probably be hidden
because you won't have the

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:41.485
full-screen viewing
experience.

00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:45.040
But when you touch the screen
once, your status bar, your

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.540
action bar, and your video
controls pop up.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.420
And in the action bar, you have
like Add to Queue just in

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.290
case you want to-- or maybe
you'd call it like a Watch

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.770
Later or something, just in
case you don't like watch

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.032
right now, right then.

00:08:58.032 --> 00:09:00.410
NICK BUTCHER: Just to take off
one of his points, actually, I

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:04.180
think the contextual action
bar is one of my favorite

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.220
Android design paradigms because
it lends itself really

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.590
well to handling not only
single selection but

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.150
multiselection selection in
quite an elegant way, which I

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.710
very much like.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.730
So if you long press on one
video from this Quick VIew,

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.070
for example, you can see the
action bar will transform into

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.540
options suitable for a single
video, so there might be

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.540
different set of options
to support multiples.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.742
But then as you touch to select
more items within the

00:09:25.742 --> 00:09:28.440
grid, the action bar can then
refine its selections to just

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.960
those actions suitable for
multiple, which is, I think, a

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.190
very elegant kind of design
in the way it handles

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.180
this sort of thing.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.190
ROMAN NURIK: And the other
thing is just users, in

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.340
general, are very accustomed--
or Android users are very

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.400
accustomed to using long press
to trigger context menus.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.470
And in our case, I mean, I guess
since Android 3.0, I

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.370
guess even 4.0, we've
been using long

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.400
press as really selection.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.040
And context, like entering
a selection context and

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.030
providing extra actions, is
really kind of a secondary

00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.660
thing, right?

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.480
So first, select the things you
want to act on, and then

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.000
see the different options
available to you rather than

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.860
long press and immediately
have options or actions

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.235
available only on the view
you interacted with.

00:10:13.235 --> 00:10:15.940
NICK BUTCHER: Some examples of
that kind of behavior if you

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.740
wanted to follow up and look
into that, I think Gallery

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.071
does this quite nicely, and
Gmail also does a good job of

00:10:21.071 --> 00:10:23.105
this because of multiselection
behavior.

00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:25.360
ROMAN NURIK: And then we have a
bunch of open source code in

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.790
the iOS, the iOSched project,
the Google I/O 2012 app that

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.800
does multiple selection
and single

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.451
selection action bullet.

00:10:34.451 --> 00:10:38.660
All right, so let's move
onto the next screen.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.520
So let's say you that spinner.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.360
What do you see&gt;

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.530
Like I said earlier, like I
mentioned earlier, you have

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.080
different categories.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.610
So your up next, or your
queued items would be a

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.180
dynamic category that would
be updated constantly.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.650
And then you could categorize
videos into custom categories

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.740
like, let's say, family videos
or TEDTalks, since TED

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.990
provides, I think, most of
their videos in an open

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.140
format, and then maybe cartoon
clips, stuff that you're

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.910
working on, things like that.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.500
And then this would be
customizable by you, right?

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.000
So maybe this is--

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.430
depending on what app
you're building,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.450
this could be folders.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.020
This could just be like tags or

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.550
collections, whatever it is.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.030
It's really up to you.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.570
These aer just examples
of using a spinner.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.600
So then once you select one of
the items, let's say, family

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.570
videos, you get presented with
a, I guess, detail or the

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:33.230
category detail screen, which
gives you a list of items in

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:39.510
that category that are organized
by some attributes,

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.280
so, in this case, the date.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.505
And then when you touch on the
sword or the filter-- or

00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:45.830
whatever you want to call it--

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.950
action button, you get presented
with different ways

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.350
to categorize your content.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:55.250
So this immediately lets you
apply filtering, apply a

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.350
better, more easily consumable
perspective on your videos

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.120
rather than seeing an extremely
long stream of all

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.140
the different videos you have.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.390
Even in a certain category, you
can immediately filter by

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.580
different things like title,
year, or percent viewed.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.780
Actually, percent viewed
is something that you

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.290
want to call out.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.440
You can't really see it here.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.160
But in that tile, imagine
that I've seen

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.840
already 40% of the video.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.940
Let's say it's like a two-hour
wedding video, right?

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.310
And I'm 40% of the way in.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.660
ADAM KOCH: Sounds like
an exciting video.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.234
ROMAN NURIK: So let's say I'm
40% of the way in, right?

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:33.340
I think one of the most
important things to bubble up

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.750
is that, hey, you've already
seen 40% of this.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.680
And to finish off watching this
video, there's only like

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.840
10 minutes left.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.000
So instead of showing the
full duration of the

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.660
video in the tile--

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.570
in this case, we've chosen-- and
again, you're not really

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.860
going to make this out here,
but there's a little like,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.280
eyeball icon, and it says 72%.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.870
There's about 31 minutes
left or something.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.910
So this is just one example of
one of the things you can

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.580
tweak within a tile since
you have lots

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.910
of screen real estate.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.300
And like I said before,
I mean, you have

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.140
this sorting option.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.745
And from there, you can choose
book or by title, so the

00:13:08.745 --> 00:13:11.120
section headers would be like
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and so

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.330
on, year or duration,
things like that.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.540
All right.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.420
And then the last thing on the
screen is the tablet version

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.300
since we always like to show at
least one tablet screenshot

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.670
for the different things
that we look at.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.440
So in this case, we've
taking a look at that

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.710
initial Up Next screen.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.900
We've imagined what it could
look like on a 7-inch tablet,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.410
in this case, a Nexus
7 in landscape.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.540
So what you basically have is
instead of a stacked single

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.240
list, you have two
separate columns.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.745
On the left, you have the queue,
and on the right, you

00:13:45.745 --> 00:13:46.720
have recently viewed.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.470
And you'll notice that each
of those list items

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.340
has just more space.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:57.000
So for the queue, we've broken
it out into kind of a larger

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.100
item, larger thumbnails, same
size text, but different

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.930
treatment of text.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.320
And then for the actual tiles,
those, again, should probably

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.600
scale to take up exactly 50%
of their list in width and

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.460
then maintain the aspect
ratio, right?

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.890
So with that extra space, you
can show more of the text,

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.620
potentially anything else you
want to show about the video,

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.540
like, again, time viewed, or
if people are tagged in it,

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.240
you can show that,
things like that.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.680
So that was the last
screenshot.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.790
Before we move on to rich
notifications, any parting

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:40.110
words for I guess local video
in general Adam or Nick?

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.860
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I like the
treatment of this screen.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.676
I think it's very
nicely balanced.

00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:47.190
I think the things you've picked
out there about how the

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.625
changes you've made from the
smaller list view to the

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:52.280
larger side-by-side view,
it really calls out

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.890
how you want to treat--

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.950
having thoughts about ahead of
time how you're going to treat

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.310
the different amount of space
rather than just stretching

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.853
everything and keeping the same
aspect ratios, but really

00:15:01.853 --> 00:15:05.126
kind of optimizing to take
advantage of that extra space.

00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:06.370
ADAM KOCH: I had one comment.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.880
If you can skip back just
one screen, I guess.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.980
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.450
ADAM KOCH: What I kind of like
about this is, I guess

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.530
depending on the type of video
that you're looking at, the

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.280
quartering or sorting
would be important.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.040
So, for example, family videos,
sorting by date or by

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.600
year in this case is
fairly important.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.640
One nice thing to add here, and
it might be already out.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.480
I don't what you're imagining,
but sort of a section indexer

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.150
or a good way to scroll
up or down.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.770
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, scrolling.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.510
ADAM KOCH: So if you had a ton
of different videos, maybe

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.580
baby videos or wedding videos,
or anything else, you could

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.440
quickly skip up and down and
look at all those videos.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.420
And then if you have maybe
TEDTalks and you're trying to

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.920
look for something by title, you
can switch to title and do

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.110
the same thing.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.080
So there's a lot of power here
in being able to navigate

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.338
through a pretty broad array
of different video types.

00:15:53.338 --> 00:15:55.940
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and I think
for TED videos, one of things

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.570
that I would probably
filter on is

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.570
duration or percent viewed.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.300
So, like, I'm going to go
on the train right now.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.950
I have 10 minutes, right?

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.130
What can I watch from TED
that's 10 minutes long?

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.870
This is something that's really
important to me in

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.120
general, is just time.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.720
So not only for local video,
but reading, right?

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.370
For articles, you should always
show the rough amount

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.770
of time that this will take you
to read, because I know

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.390
that I'm on a train, and
I have five minutes.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.270
Or I'm walking to the train.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.480
I probably shouldn't be reading
my phone, but I have

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.930
exactly this amount of time.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.360
What can I do in that time?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.800
And I think that giving you the
option to filter by size

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.550
or length or duration, or I
guess in the case of percent

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.510
viewed, how much you have left,
like three minutes left

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.540
in this video.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.870
That's a fairly powerful
way of organizing.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.890
The last thing I'd point out is
that you'd probably make it

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.490
sticky, right?

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.300
So for family videos, you'd
always do year, or TEDTalks,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:48.570
you would--

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.050
I guess not always, but show
the last sorting that you

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.870
applied to that category.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.510
So in the interest of time since
we only have 10 minutes

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.640
left, let's go jump into
rich notification.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.550
So, Nick, do you want to talk
about rich notification?

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.934
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, just also
a little note on the second

00:17:07.934 --> 00:17:08.319
one as well.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.815
So we're trying to introduce
some more content into Design

00:17:10.815 --> 00:17:12.130
in Action as well
as to just doing

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.329
straight-up app redesign.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:14.980
So we're going to try to
highlight some of the cool,

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.670
awesome features that make
Android Android, really.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.200
So this is why we picked rich
notifications today to do a

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.829
deep dive into what I think is
one of the more exciting

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.500
features in the Jelly
Bean launch.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.069
So Android has always
had a very strong

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.850
notification story.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.610
I think it's been one of my
favorite features, that it

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.360
unobtrusively lets you know
what's going on without you

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.200
having to dive in and out of
applications all the time or

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.390
have that obtrusive modal
dialogues, pop-up, say.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.890
It's been one of my favorite
features for a long time.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.450
And what happened in the JB
release is they kind of

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.120
supercharged.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.540
They added lots of additional
functionality.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.750
So we're going to take you
through a few examples of what

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.240
you can do and how you
might go about

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.480
designing for this feature.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.730
So straight ahead, as you can
see, this is a fairly

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:03.130
standard-looking notification,
which we would call a one-unit

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.795
sized notification, or 1U in
my photo here, showing the

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:08.430
standard information.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.330
So you have a headline and
a subtext start line.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.340
And what you can do is, by
running a finger down the

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.420
notification, you can
then expand it out

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.740
to a greater size.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.865
So this is an example
we've taken here.

00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:26.490
For an online video streaming
service, which is say you've

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.130
just kind of paused or abandoned
playback from

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.710
another device or another
computer or laptop or

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.600
whatever, and we're taking the
opportunity to then present

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.620
the user with an opportunity
to resume exactly

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.660
where they left off.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.640
So I think this is hugely
compelling having this

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.380
additional still frame calling
out the last moment you got up

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.640
to, much more compelling than
just some piece of text

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.530
telling you that you can resume,
which I really like.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.690
And right there, there's
an action in the

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.500
notification as well.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.140
So as well as providing
information, it provides a

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.080
strong call to action to
then go and do this.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:07.180
And the reason we picked this
video resumption idea was to

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.800
highlight another feature of the
new notifications API, is

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.990
the ability to have what we're
calling opportunistic

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.110
notifications.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:17.440
That is, by default, your
standard form of notification

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.830
will add an icon into the User
Status bar so that they can

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.000
see, hey, there's a
message waiting.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.860
Something's happened requiring
your attention.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.095
As of the latest release, you
can now provide a priority to

00:19:29.095 --> 00:19:32.560
the notification, one of which
is you can say this is a

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.040
minimum priority notification,
in which case the system will

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.710
not notify the user
with an icon.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.889
But it's kind of opportunistic
in the sense that if the user

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:44.050
is in the notification tray,
then it will display it to

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.580
them anyway.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.780
So another example of this
might be Google Now, for

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.160
example, which can let you know
the weather and what it's

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.620
going to be like for the
next couple of hours.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.030
But it says, hey, this isn't
super-important information.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.330
I'm going to interrupt the user
and tell him about it.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.460
But should they be in the
notification tray seeing

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.330
what's going on, then I'm
going to present this

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.920
information to them.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.180
So we've kind of used the power
of this opportunistic

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.190
notification combined with--

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.550
showing a large image and a
strong call to action to add a

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.026
really cool little feature
to our video

00:20:14.026 --> 00:20:16.388
streaming service there.

00:20:16.388 --> 00:20:19.010
ROMAN NURIK: I would love
this for a Netflix

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.370
or a Hulu or something.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:24.450
I'd love that ability to just
open up the notification chain

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.680
and say, actually, I do have a
few minutes right now to watch

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.580
the rest of this "Futurama"
episode or something.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.862
Let me just touch that
and jump into it.

00:20:32.862 --> 00:20:35.210
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, one thing I
just want to focus on while

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.000
we're talking about this is that
some people might wonder

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.645
is this crossing over territory
of what might go

00:20:40.645 --> 00:20:42.890
into a widget as compared
to the notification?

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.360
I'd say the key being that
time sensitivity, really.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.300
Like I'd say this is the kind of
thing you might want to pop

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.910
up and just, say, for 15 or
20 minutes, show this

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.620
notification, and if the user
hasn't jumped into it at that

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.730
point, then I would probably
remove it.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.200
Because notifications should be
about timely information,

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.840
whereas a widget can be more
about just the latest things

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.776
that have happened,
more of a digest.

00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:05.545
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:21:05.545 --> 00:21:06.090
Shall we move on?

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.350
NICK BUTCHER: Let's.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.940
ROMAN NURIK: All right,
next one.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.210
NICK BUTCHER: So we hark back
to one of our previously

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.990
visited applications in Design
in Action, and we've had a

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.910
look at the London Underground
application, which gives you

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.340
information about what's
going on on the tube.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.225
One of the important things to
me, as a Londoner, is if

00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:25.926
there's a service interruption,
if I'm going to

00:21:25.926 --> 00:21:29.840
have to re-plan my journey
somehow, so that's important

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.440
that they show me
a notification.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.040
But rather than having to make
me go into the application and

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.950
do something, what we've done
here is if we swipe down on

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.900
the notification, we've used
the big text style, which

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.630
allows you to provide additional
textual information

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.590
in addition to, say,
what's expanded.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.390
So here you have an example of
big text that lets you kind of

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.750
let the user know
what's going on.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:52.550
And I can press it.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.450
I can just swipe it away
and get rid of it.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.970
I don't think the message can
affect me, or I can then click

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.180
through to me to the
application.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.750
So yeah, this is an example
of the big text style.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.230
ROMAN NURIK: Another option,
and let's say you have the

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.750
ability to do rerouting or
something, and let's say, this

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.750
app knows about your trips or
your destination, you can

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:15.340
offer actions here like find an
alternate route, or look at

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.060
the full details of-- in this
case, touching it should

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.660
probably give you the details
on the error or something.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.890
And then maybe then actions like
look at alternate routes

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.938
besides in this case
the circle line.

00:22:28.938 --> 00:22:29.780
ADAM KOCH: Cool.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.785
ROMAN NURIK: Lots of
different options.

00:22:30.785 --> 00:22:33.352
OK, next notification type.

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:35.570
NICK BUTCHER: So, yeah, those
are two of the built-in styles

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.180
that come with the platform,
which you could just say, hey,

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.630
I want to show a big image, or I
want to show a larger amount

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.560
of text than a normal
notification might.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.980
But with the additional
notifications, you can also

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.630
get like a blank canvas and
draw whatever it is your

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:51.570
application wants to do.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.930
So we revisited the TripAdvisor
app, which we took

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.360
a look at a couple of weeks
back and envisaged

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.020
what they could do.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.860
So here, that scenario we're
envisaging is someone's just

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.080
arrived in a new city, and
they've detected this location

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.930
change, and we're preemptively
offering them to see what is

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.095
going on in the attractions
around them.

00:23:09.095 --> 00:23:11.120
So, straight away in the
minimized version, you just

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.300
say, well, welcome to London.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.680
It says, see nearby
attractions.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.915
But if we were to swipe down,
we can actually provide a

00:23:16.915 --> 00:23:19.810
completely custom layout
within the

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:20.670
notification itself.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.530
So here we're displaying two
tiles, like picking out the

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.740
top two near attractions near
the user where they've just

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.230
arrived in a new city, which
might be kind of fun.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.610
But yet, really, this is
just a window into your

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.970
application.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.640
So you can completely extend
your branding, your look and

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.830
feel right into the
notification bar.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.710
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and then one
thing you can offer here,

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:44.390
again, as further actions may
be see all, or search for a

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:45.100
specific area.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.910
Like if for some reason the app
accidentally just didn't

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:52.250
get your location right, you
could say, choose a different

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.700
location or something
like that.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.230
So providing actions, I mean,
almost always there are

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.650
multiple things you can
do on notifications.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:05.000
Providing extra actions, it's
just a really, really easy way

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.570
to provide extra functionality
without much effort.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.780
NICK BUTCHER: It's one of my
favorite functions on Android.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.240
So it means it leads to less
jumping around between

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:12.800
applications.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.080
I no longer have to come and go
in and out, in and out, and

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.660
have these context switches
all the time.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.920
With the introduction of rich
notifications, I find myself

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.130
processing information and
staying on top of things and

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.830
doing quick actions straight
from the notification.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.930
I find it really satisfying.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.180
It makes me feel super
productive and powerful.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.870
So I really encourage designers
and developers to

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.140
think about how you can use
this newly expanded

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.846
functionality in your apps.

00:24:34.846 --> 00:24:37.020
ADAM KOCH: One quick thing I
wanted to mention on the

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.940
technical implementation side
is that the support library

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:44.520
has an app called Notification
Compact that allows you to

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.820
build these rich notifications,
but also great

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.850
for earlier versions
of Android.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.640
So it's definitely recommended
to use that so that you can

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.410
start using these immediately
and not worry about

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.875
maintaining compatibility for
earlier versions of Android.

00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:02.020
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, basically,
it lets you not do like

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.920
ifbuild.SDK.version.version
codes or whatever.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.520
It lets you avoid all of that.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.550
It just does that for you.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.660
So you don't have to
worry about it.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.450
It stores all the codes.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:11.292
ADAM KOCH: No excuses.

00:25:11.292 --> 00:25:14.342
You're going to start using
them now, you're saying.

00:25:14.342 --> 00:25:16.626
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:25:16.626 --> 00:25:17.690
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.010
OK.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.360
We're running out of time, so
let's do a quick fly through

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.210
Android Design News,
shall we, Roman?

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.460
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.405
Android Design News.

00:25:23.405 --> 00:25:26.090
We need a drum roll or
a gong or something.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.880
[DRUMMING ON TABLE]

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.560
ROMAN NURIK: Thank you.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.212
We actually have Daniel
Them from Memphis.

00:25:31.212 --> 00:25:33.750
DANIEL THEM: Hello, Daniel.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.776
ROMAN NURIK: And he's providing
our drum rolls for

00:25:35.776 --> 00:25:36.525
this evening--

00:25:36.525 --> 00:25:37.820
or, actually, this morning.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.520
So first, very quickly, so
Taylor Ling, who's I guess a

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.950
common name that we talk about
on design or in our Design

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:46.930
News segment.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.070
Taylor Ling has come
back and done a

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.210
password manager redesign.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.370
So this is kind of like a
re-imagining of a password

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:57.170
manager, basically something
that manages your passwords,

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.110
that kind of uses different
techniques like the Google Now

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.990
style cards, and Crouton--

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.330
which we'll talk about
in a second--

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:11.010
Croutons for messages that
pop up from the top.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:15.220
And just overall in my opinion,
it's a solid starting

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:20.750
point for a Holo style
password manager.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.020
Moving on.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.350
Holo There.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.390
Nick, do you want to talk
about Holo There?

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:27.510
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.370
This is a Tumblr that's been out
there for a little while,

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.080
but we just wanted
to call it out.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.060
So similar to this show, they're
taking applications

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.410
and re-imagining them
in a Holo'd style.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.320
So if you're looking for some
inspiration for how you might

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.380
implement some Holo look and
feel, then it's a great, great

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.526
source for that.

00:26:45.526 --> 00:26:48.980
So If this is your blog, then
get in touch on Google+ and

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.650
then let us know because we
didn't actually know who to

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.890
attribute this to, but keep
up the good work.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.360
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.390
Marie strikes again.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.510
Nick, since you just spent
some time with Marie in

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.010
Berlin, do you want to talk
about her recent work?

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.910
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.990
So I've just got back from
Berlin over the weekend where

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.897
there was a DevFest going on,
so it was great to hang out

00:27:10.897 --> 00:27:13.410
with the Android developers and
hackers over in Berlin,

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.140
one of whom was Marie, who is
frustrated with Blogger's

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.410
interface and thinks
that it needs a

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.390
little bit of a refresh.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.430
So she's taken the slightly
tired Blogger look and feel

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.030
and given it fresh Holo
coats of paint.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:28.280
So I think she's done a very
nice job here of marrying the

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.360
branding of Blogger, the quite
strong branding, with Holo.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.600
And not content with just that
one redesign, she's actually

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.420
also done a quite in-depth
redesign of the Sixt car

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.280
rental application as well,
which I think is much, much

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.750
better than the official app.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.240
So I really hope that Sixt is
paying attention and can take

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.405
a little look at perhaps
hiring Marie

00:27:49.405 --> 00:27:50.655
to make this happen.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.440
ROMAN NURIK: All right,
moving on.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.860
Showcase view.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.820
So this is something that's come
up a couple of times in

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.040
the App Clinic even.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.010
So let's say there's something,
and i this case I

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.650
think, it may not be used in
the best possible way.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.850
But let's say there's something
that's like a very

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.360
difficult-to-discover feature,
and it's not necessarily

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.460
well-labeled, like some sort
of gesture or something.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.730
Showcase View is a little tool
that'll give you this kind of

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:25.360
blue overlay that you can use as
a one-time Help dialogue or

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.250
whatever you want to call
it, help overlay.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.670
So when a user first opens the
app, if there's something

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.150
that's very difficult to
discover, then you may

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.450
want to show this.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:39.820
Before you jump in and start
using it, you should read our

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.080
design pattern on Help, which
talks about the specific cases

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.670
where you should use something
like this.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.410
In general, you should try
avoiding on-screen tutorials

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.330
or things, because your
interface should

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:50.270
just explain itself.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.670
And if there's a problem
with labeling,

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.050
then do better labeling.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:58.020
But if you do find an area
where it's a gesture or

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.200
something that's super, super,
super important, then you may

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.450
want to use Showcase with it.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.550
And Crouton.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.456
Who wants to talk
about Crouton?

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:10.710
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
I'll take Crouton.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.510
Crouton is a--

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.260
initially I think it came from
a blog post by Mr. Cyril

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.270
Mottier, who had some
frustrations with the Android

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:22.470
toast class, which is a way
of giving these transitive

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.660
messages that show up after a
little while and disappear.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.200
But some of the limitations of
it were annoying him in that

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.460
it wasn't really attached
to an activity.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.615
So if you were to show a toast
message and then switch away

00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:35.320
to another activity, the message
may remain and be out

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.240
of context.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.790
So he has come up with a
toast-like API for showing

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.140
more contextual messages, so you
can have info messages and

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.320
error messages and so on
within the flow of the

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.260
application.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.740
So he outlined this in a blog
placement, but actually

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.660
couldn't read any code.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.470
I think the IP was owned
by his employer.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:57.110
So Mr. Benjamin Vice, another
Berlin hacker, has taken this

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.600
idea and run with it and
open-sourced the Crouton

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.620
library, which you can
find on GitHub.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.970
And it's in active development
and getting their

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.186
contributions and stars.

00:30:05.186 --> 00:30:08.050
And I encourage you to take
a look at it, and it might

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.610
provide you a nice
way to get these

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.096
contextual in-app messages.

00:30:12.096 --> 00:30:13.090
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:13.730
And is that it?

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:17.840
No, we have one more from
Cyril strikes again.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.980
So this is Polaris.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.750
Cyril released a library called
Polaris, which is built

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.070
on top of the Global
Maps add-on.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.570
And it basically gives you
things like a standardized

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.160
on-screen My Location buttons,
standardized on-screen Zoom

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:38.960
buttons, and also standardized
on-screen Info bubbles, so

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.080
bubbles or balloons or whatever
you want to call them

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.216
that pop up above markers
when you touch them.

00:30:44.216 --> 00:30:47.190
NICK BUTCHER: So I really like
this for a couple of reasons.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.770
Not only will it make your
developers' lives easier to

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.400
implement mapping features,
but for me, it also really

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.090
standardizes the interactions,
like to be

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:55.230
very similar to Maps.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.850
Maps is probably one of the
most used apps on Android.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.440
And if you deviate from the
patterns where they're going

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.320
to locate new buttons or how
balloons pop up and so on,

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.690
then your app's going to
just feel slightly off.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.490
And I think using this Polaris
library will really help in

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.636
getting that consistent feel.

00:31:12.636 --> 00:31:13.760
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.320
I think that's the last one.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.870
Yeah, that was the last item.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:24.320
So that was Android Design
in Action for this week.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.390
So I think that's all the time
we have, and we're about three

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:26.900
minutes over.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.430
So sorry about that if you're
running to your meeting, and

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.312
you have your laptop or
something, and you're trying

00:31:31.312 --> 00:31:32.190
to catch the end of the show.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.100
Sorry about that.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.830
You can now sign off.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.710
As always, thanks again.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.476
My name is Roman Nurik.

00:31:38.476 --> 00:31:39.402
ADAM KOCH: See you guys.

00:31:39.402 --> 00:31:39.865
Adam Koch.

00:31:39.865 --> 00:31:40.980
NICK BUTCHER: Bye from London.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.620
Nick Butcher.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.200
ROMAN NURIK: And catch
you guys next week.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.450
Peace out.
