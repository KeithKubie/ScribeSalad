00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.600
MALE SPEAKER 1: Shanghai GDG
is a very interesting

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.570
developer community.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.400
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.670
has asked this question.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.210
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.260
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.890
answer show.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.760
MALE SPEAKER 1: GDG is a very

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.840
interesting developer community.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.670
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.940
has asked this question.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.470
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.370
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.950
answer show.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.305
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions--

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.049
IKAI LAN: Good Afternoon,
New York City.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.950
Good morning, if you're
somewhere else.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.210
Late night, if you're
really far away.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.170
Welcome to Apps Script
Office Hours.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.760
My name is Ikai Lan.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.940
JAN KLEINERT: I'm
Jan Kleinert.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.460
IKAI LAN: And today, we have
a good show for you.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.020
Well, it's pretty
straightforward.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.430
There's nothing special
going on today.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.390
But I do want announce events
that are coming up.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.150
Next week we've got our
Austin Hackathon.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.250
So if you're not yet signed up
and you're in the Austin area,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.810
go on Google and search for Apps
Script Hackathon Austin.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.170
It's going to be one
first results.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.970
We've still got spots.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.720
We need you to sign up because
we're ordering food, and

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.280
there's going to be
fun activities.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.500
So for those of you that are not
in Austin, we are planning

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.770
a West Coast hackathon.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.500
That's coming sometime
in November.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.600
We'll be posting as soon
as we have the details.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.890
So we're still working
on that.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.530
But we hope to see you
at that event soon.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.020
So yeah, that's what I have
for announcements.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.020
JAN KLEINERT: Next, I think
we're going to go

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.840
over release notes.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.560
We had a release
late last week.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.135
And I'll just run through
what happened there.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.100
And this was a release from
the evening of August 30.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.937
So we added some new methods to
script properties and user

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:43.910
properties.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.840
This is a feature request that
quite a few people had asked

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.850
for to be able to basically
delete properties and keys

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.950
from script properties
and user properties.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.040
So we've added those methods.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.240
We also added several other
methods to do things like

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.660
delete all properties, box set
properties, things like that.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.420
So it's a lot more robust
of an API now.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.200
IKAI LAN: This is a really big
deal because I know that

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.160
before, I was doing set
as null and undefined.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.830
And that became really ugly
really fast, because you

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.020
couldn't delete the
properties.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.330
And then, it caused a lot of
weird programming issues.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.410
JAN KLEINERT: And you could
run up against your quotas

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.240
that way, too.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.600
So it's a much more usable
interface now.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.270
We also added a set
option method.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.920
This is for the charts service
so that all of the different

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.220
charts builders can now set
advanced options for charts.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.260
I think this came about because
somebody specifically

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.690
wanted to be able to set
multiple axes on the charts.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.740
But now with this set option,
you can do a whole

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.430
lot more than that.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.070
So there's links to the docs
from the release notes.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.890
And then finally, we
fixed an issue.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.340
This was just kind of a minor
issue with the script editor,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.120
where if you had a really long
line somewhere in your script

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.170
and you'd scroll to the
right, the line

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.830
numbers would disappear.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.170
So that's fixed now, too, which
makes it a little easier

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.440
to debug your code if
you have really long

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.100
lines in your script.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.600
So those are our release
notes for the week.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.400
IKAI LAN: I want to remind
people that a few weeks ago--

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.790
I think it was two weeks ago--
we rolled out a streamlined

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.800
interface for publishing to
the Chrome Web Store.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.290
So we have a script
gallery now.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.810
And it's where you'd want to
go if you wanted to publish

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.670
scripts for, say, spreadsheets
and what not.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.550
But if you're starting to build
web apps in full apps

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.960
that have UI, you really should
be publishing in the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.060
Chrome Web Store for much
more discoverability.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.110
So I will be plugging this week
after week after week

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.790
until we start seeing
more applications.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.980
And if you need any help, do
come to Stack Overflow and ask

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.550
us for help.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.720
Or if you run into any problems,
come to the Issues

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.060
Tracker, and tell us where your
troubles are publishing,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.590
and why you're not doing it, and
how we can help make this

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.340
easier for you.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.800
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah, we are
starting to see some really

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.930
interesting things come into the
Chrome Web Store that were

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.580
built with App Scripts,
so it's very exciting.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.060
OK, so that's it for
release notes.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.170
Before we take live questions,
we have a lot of questions

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.080
here actually on the Moderator
page, which you can see linked

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.610
from the Google Developers Live
show listing for today.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.800
So what do you say, Ikai?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.780
Do you want to just take
these in order?

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.180
IKAI LAN: What order?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.880
Whatever you want
to do these in.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.400
JAN KLEINERT: All right, well,
let's just start at the top.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.959
So I'll take this one first.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.634
So the first question here--

00:04:18.634 --> 00:04:21.335
"Is there a time frame for
adding the rest of the UI app

00:04:21.335 --> 00:04:24.750
widgets to the GUI builder?"

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.380
I guess there was a comment from
when the GUI builder was

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.500
launching saying that we could
expect the rest of the widgets

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.900
to come shortly.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.230
I'm not actually sure
about those plans.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.310
I know we've added some of
the widgets over time.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.970
But I don't have the specific
roadmap on when/if the rest of

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.790
the widgets will be added.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.410
We can try to follow
up on that for you.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.512
But off the top of my
head, I'm not sure.

00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:47.720
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.620
Moving on to the
next question.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.160
"I'm using content service to
create a web services that

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.400
uses the Gmail API
to access mail.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.050
Can you explain the process
for how the user will

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.600
authorize the web
server script to

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.720
access their email account?

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.150
The web service has no direct
user interface."

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.500
So for everyone that's watching
right now, content

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.940
service is a way to
provide API-like

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.140
access to your scripts.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.350
So let's say you want to put
out JSON, or XML, or some

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.100
other crazy format.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.660
You would be using
content service

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.180
instead of HTML service.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.160
Now, the problem with content
service is that because it's

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.760
not expected to use the inside
browser, you don't really have

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.730
a way to authorize access
to user data, such

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.760
as the Gmail service.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.700
So I know that we're working
on a solution.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.490
We have nothing to announce
at this point.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.260
But we are working on a solution
so that you will be

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.580
able to build content
service applications

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.180
that users can authorize.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.530
JAN KLEINERT: Right.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.570
So the way that it works today,
it is possible if you

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.490
publish this.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.710
So when you go in, and you've
built this, and you have to go

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.690
through the publish as a web app
workflow, if you publish

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.890
it to run as the developer, so
as you the script developer,

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.820
you can authorize it that
way and that will work.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.900
But obviously, if you're using
something like Gmail, you

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.110
don't want to run against
your inbox.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.010
You want it to run against
the user's inboxes.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.830
And there's not a particularly
straightforward way of doing

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.410
that today.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.600
So we were talking about
this morning.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.620
And we have some plans
in place to

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.650
support that in the future.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.940
But we can't get into
specifics yet.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.030
But for sure it will be
in the documentation

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.040
once we have it available.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.950
OK.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.810
The next one here--
contextapp.getcontacts is

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.030
running slow for this
person here.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.990
So we actually have an issue
in the tracker open.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.080
I've linked to it in
the response here.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.670
It's dealing with
the performance

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.570
issues for Get Contact.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.900
We're looking into that.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.900
But you can follow the
status of that issue

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.320
in the issue tracker.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.480
We're aware that there are some
performance issues there.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.060
IKAI LAN: OK, I noticed
that Jan set me up to

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.650
take this next one.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.410
This one's actually
really confusing.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.160
I don't want to read it out.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.200
But I'll read it out.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.720
It says "To build a UI, I use
both command lines in the

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.410
script and use GUI builder."
So it goes on a little bit.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.460
And I'm not exactly sure
what this is asking.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.150
Let me open it up to see if
there's any clarifications.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.440
JAN KLEINERT: I don't
think so.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.140
IKAI LAN: How to
study GUI Apps.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.320
I'm not even sure if that's
what he's asking.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.640
So why don't I move on to the
next one, which is "Is there a

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.770
way to password protect the
Apps Script attached to a

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.720
spreadsheet?"

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.850
The requirement is that when
we share the spreadsheet to

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.410
others in a company, we
don't want the Apps

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.990
Script visible to others.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.530
Now, one way to do this is to
create code, and Jan answered

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.430
this, so I'm really just taking
credit for her work,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.150
Create the code in a
separate project.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.900
And what you can do is when you
publish a version, there

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.750
will be inside Project
Properties a--

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.310
it's a script key,
a project key.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.130
Now, what you can do is, later
on in a different project, you

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.940
can import your important
functions.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.490
You can say I want to import
a library and copy

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.450
the script key in.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.070
So you copy and paste
that script key in.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.740
And what you'll need to
do is you'll need

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.730
to provide a prefix.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.690
So let's say I build a library
that has a function called Hi.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.140
And I call the library
My Cool Library.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.630
I would save this, publish a
version-- let's say version

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.940
one, version two, whatever--

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.140
and I would get a project key.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.940
I would create a second project,
and I would import

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.340
it, and I'd namespace it.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.870
So in my code, I would
write something like

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.890
MyCoolLibrary.hi.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.070
Everything would be namespaced
and prefixed.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.990
So in this case, you wouldn't
have to share the code, and

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.880
this would work.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.230
JAN KLEINERT: Right.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.020
So the spreadsheet of the
project that you want to

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.810
import the library into which
you want to put the library

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.410
will have to have at least view
access to that library.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.340
But the users of the spreadsheet
aren't going to

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.120
have that library available
to them.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.380
So you can use it within the
spreadsheet script, but it's

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.700
not visible to the users when
they go and look at the script

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.840
of the spreadsheet itself.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.690
So that's a good way
of doing this.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.350
But specifically what you ask
for to be able to password

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.580
protect the scripts, we
don't have that today.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.790
I think there is actually
something in the issue tracker

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:01.560
for basically being able to
lock down and not show the

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.370
source of scripts.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.150
But that's an open
feature request.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.540
It's something we
have available.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.470
OK.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.210
Next one here, and this
one I haven't actually

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.820
read through yet.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.780
So we'll take a look
on the fly.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.130
"I'm learning to display data--
table options, grid,

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.590
FlexTable, HTML5 and others.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.500
One record per page with
Next and Back.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.920
Any options?" OK, so this sounds
like a question about

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.870
some of the different ways to
display data, probably mostly

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.500
within UI App, it sounds
like, If we're

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.780
looking at grid and FlexTable.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.892
It really is going to depend
on your use case, so,

00:09:37.892 --> 00:09:41.570
specifically, what you're trying
to do and what features

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.870
you need to be supported
to deal with your data.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.610
And so if you can provide us--
if you can post a response

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.040
here, we'll take a look later,
and see if we can give you

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.240
more guidance on that.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.550
But without knowing what sort of
date is, how much you have,

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.790
how you want to interact with
it, it's a little tricky to

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.590
make an across-the-board
recommendation.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.450
I would say if you're
bent on using UI

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.850
App, that's one thing.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.490
But if you're willing to use
HTML5 service, then it's

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.270
pretty wide open.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.410
And you can kind of build
whatever you want.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.880
And there's a lot of premade
solutions out there that might

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.090
work for you that other people
have built that many of them

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.740
will be compatible with
HTML5 service.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.750
So that might be the more
flexible way to go, even

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.080
though it's not going to be
necessarily as out of the box

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.620
as some of the UI app widgets.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.790
There may be stuff in jQuery
UI, for example,

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.680
that would work well.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.200
IKAI LAN: The jQuery UI
stuff is pretty basic.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.700
So there's probably stuff built
on top of jQuery UI.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.420
But we need to go look for
it and need to test

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:45.930
it for it to work.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:46.680
JAN KLEINERT: Right.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.490
IKAI LAN: One thing that's
really new about spreadsheets

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.130
is that they are a built-in
UI for your application.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.610
So depending on what it is
you're trying to do, sometimes

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.690
I find that if I'm replicating
too much spreadsheet

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.930
functionality, one thing that I
might do is I might just use

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.670
spreadsheet's input and build
a custom menu instead.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.452
So again, it really depends
on what it is

00:11:06.452 --> 00:11:07.060
you're trying to do.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.590
But I feel like you have
a lot of options.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.690
Moving on to the next one. "I
have a custom function in my

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.360
Apps Script.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.880
How can I access it whenever I
open a new spreadsheet without

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.520
publishing it in the gallery?"
Well, one thing that you could

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.230
do is you could create a
template that has the

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.150
spreadsheet, and every time you
create a new spreadsheet,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.530
you could clone the spreadsheet,
and you'll pick

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.190
up the function.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:33.700
Other than that, you have the
script library option, which

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.050
is a little bit clunky.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.240
I just feel like you want
global access to this.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.510
Anything else comes to mind?

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:39.940
JAN KLEINERT: No.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.670
This is something that we've
heard requested before,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.340
particularly within an
organization that has a Google

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.500
Apps account to be able to have
an admin install scripts

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.270
across an account.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.300
It's not something
we support today.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.095
But I do believe there's
something in the issue tracker

00:11:52.095 --> 00:11:53.210
or feature requests for that.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.590
But what you mentioned with the
templates is a really good

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.840
option, too.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.260
OK, so the next one here: "When
we publish a spreadsheet

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.780
as a web app, how can we make a
particular cell or multiple

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.400
cells editable on the HTML
page?" So I think this one, if

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.790
I'm understanding correctly,
is not actually

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.740
an App Script question.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.820
So Google Spreadsheets has an
option in the sharing settings

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.430
to publish a spreadsheet as
a web page, which makes it

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.390
publicly viewable.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.430
And it's no longer really an
interactive spreadsheet.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.210
It's kind of this
read-only view.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.440
So I'm not especially familiar
with what you can and can't do

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.270
in that view of the
spreadsheet.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.290
But I imagine that if you
go to the Help pages for

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.070
spreadsheets, if this is
possible, they'll explain how

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.100
to do it there.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.630
OK I think that's
all we've got.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:48.840
Let me just refresh here and
double check, and then if

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.270
there's nothing else new--

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.000
ah, here's one more.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.390
IKAI LAN: This is not a
App Script question.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.301
JAN KLEINERT: This
last one here?

00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:00.551
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.840
JAN KLEINERT: I'm not sure which
Google App this person

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.470
is referring to.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.430
If you mean can you build
something with Google Apps

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:19.740
Script and use it and display
it publicly, I believe so.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.570
But if you're asking something
else, maybe clarify the

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.080
question so we can
take a look.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.460
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.890
Also, if your question is more
around the terms of use for

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.870
Apps Script, then there's a link
to the developer terms

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.570
from our documentation page.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.800
So you can read through there
and see if that covers your

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.524
question as well.

00:13:40.524 --> 00:13:43.590
OK, do we have anybody live in
the Hangout that wants to ask

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.573
a question?

00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:46.050
IKAI LAN: Hey, guys.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.190
I see we have some regulars.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.950
And we have a new person who
I haven't seen before.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.740
So before we get started, I just
want to put this on your

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.030
radar, which is we're thinking
about people that--

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.430
we're thinking about doing some
live interviews of some

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.070
team members.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:10.430
Now, I've asked Sohrab, who is
the product manager for Google

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.920
Apps Script.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.830
And he said I don't know.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.210
People have seen me too much.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.070
They don't want to
see me anymore.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.360
And I said that's not true.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.160
We want to interview you.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.820
We want to see what you're
about, who you are.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.720
So I'm still going to
try to rope him in.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.020
But if there's any one of the
team that you guys think might

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.810
be interesting, I think it'd
be interesting to have a

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:28.970
conversation with Nikhil, who's
a TL, or Mike, who is

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.080
the uber TL.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.080
That's the way I've heard
him referred to.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.405
Or just individual software
engineers on the team working

00:14:36.405 --> 00:14:36.890
on different things.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:41.100
Like Corey's given talks at
Google I/O. And he always has

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.460
a lot to say, actually.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.520
It's more about narrowing
the scope of the

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.000
things for him to say.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.170
So if you guys have anyone that
you would like to see

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.950
interviewed, do let us know.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.372
Anyway, all right, live
audience have at it.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.876
JAN KLEINERT: Any questions
from you guys today?

00:14:59.876 --> 00:15:01.244
IKAI LAN: Anything you guys
want to talk about?

00:15:01.244 --> 00:15:02.060
MALE SPEAKER 3: Hey, how
are you guys doing?

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.750
Can you hear me OK?

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.166
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah, we
can hear you great.

00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:04.950
MALE SPEAKER 3: Cool.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.920
Thanks.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.110
I have one quick question.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.970
I've got a--

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:09.610
I'm really excited.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.890
I've got a web app that I'm
just having my graphic

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.850
designer pretty up the UI and
some icons and stuff for the

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.380
Chrome Web Store.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.180
And I'm thinking I'll probably
publish it for

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.670
free at this point.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.990
But I was thinking about
monetization options.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.020
One option, sell it for $0.99
or something like that.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.000
And then I was thinking, you
know I'd really like to be

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.690
able to do is link my AdSense
account to it.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.650
Is there any talk or has there
been any discussion around

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.940
about having an AdSense
service?

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.970
I tried that through a couple
of things, and the AdSense

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.340
JavaScript got stripped out.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:47.580
JAN KLEINERT: It did?

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:47.640
OK.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.430
MALE SPEAKER 3: I didn't seem
to be able to publish it.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.180
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.050
JAN KLEINERT: Is your app
using HTML service?

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.080
MALE SPEAKER 3: No.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.670
UI App.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.970
JAN KLEINERT: UI App.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:56.570
OK.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.380
MALE SPEAKER 3: I tried to
use the HTML within it.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.120
What I'd like to be
able to do is--

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.390
I was thinking it
would be good.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.140
It'll run in a browser.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.760
It's not an extension.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.910
It's a UI.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.810
And it works with Google Docs.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.580
So it's timely and cool.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.770
But I was thinking that one way
to monetize it would be to

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.660
have a AdSense panel
within the UI app.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.590
But I can't see any easy way
do that at this point.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:28.150
Any thoughts?

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.860
Comments?

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.870
JAN KLEINERT: I think you're
right that it's probably not

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.290
possible within UI app.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.330
And I haven't actually tried
it in HTML service.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.760
It's possible that it
would work there.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.560
I'll have to check.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.630
There may be some tricky
things that we'd

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.370
have to sort out first.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:46.050
But I think it's a very good
request that we can take back

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:46.860
to the team.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.916
And--

00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:49.410
MALE SPEAKER 3: Issue
tracker material?

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.700
--certainly with web
apps that's a--

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.000
I'm sorry?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.400
What's that?

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.610
MALE SPEAKER 3: Issue
tracker material?

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.480
JAN KLEINERT: Absolutely.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:54.990
For sure.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.640
IKAI LAN: I do have a question
for you, though.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.740
Now, you mentioned that you
might want to sell the app.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.980
So Jan, do you have any updates
about Chrome Web Store

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.400
and being able to do that?

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.550
JAN KLEINERT: So we're still
working through some of the

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.440
details on that.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.720
So technically, yes,
it's possible.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.290
The challenge that we have
today is we don't have a

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.380
simple way for you to then--

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.599
so the Chrome Web Store has a
licensing API, where you can

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.780
know-- so it's possible to sell
an app today, say $0.99,

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.030
whatever you choose.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.339
And people can purchase
the app.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.380
But then what we don't have is
round trip with the licensing

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.050
server to be able to query
for this user--

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.590
from your app for this user have
they purchase the app?

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.320
So it's not the full round-trip
solution today.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.660
So there's a gap there,
basically.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.460
And we're aware of it.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.050
And we're working on solving it
in the future so that you

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.420
can have the reassurance
basically that--

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.640
and check on it, and that's
especially important for

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.500
things like free trials or
recurring subscriptions and

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.220
things like that.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.820
IKAI LAN: So have you
used AdSense before?

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.340
I'm asking because for
things that are more

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.250
application-like--

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.380
and Jan has this famous
presentation from when she was

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.980
on the Chrome team about the
difference between an

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.910
application and web page--

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.490
AdSense may not be your best
bet, only because, unless

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.750
you're getting a huge volume,
it might not be enough to

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.530
cover your costs, which is one
reason that selling the

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.900
application in the Chrome Web
Store when we get that out

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.970
might be a very good option.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.800
JAN KLEINERT: It may also
depend on the amount of

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.330
contextual content that's
in your app as well.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.940
So you probably know the answer
to that one better than

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.470
we can guess.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.140
But it may also be the kind
of thing once we have the

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.410
solutions totally worked out
for both sides of them that

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.970
you do kind of like an A/B test
sort of thing and see

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:53.130
what works best for your
particular web app.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.880
MALE SPEAKER 3: Mostly
it's going to be--

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.780
it's for promotion.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.530
And it's really solving a
problem that I've seen people

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.800
ask fixed for Google Docs.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.390
So I don't expect it to
have a long lifespan.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.980
In fact, any day, I would
imagine the Google Docs team

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.310
will announce something that'll
do the same thing.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.410
But until then--

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.440
and there is some context to
it that might make AdSense

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.680
particularly interesting to
certain types of vendors.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.130
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:21.190
JAN KLEINERT: Interesting.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:25.140
MALE SPEAKER 3: Anyway, I
was just wondering if--

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.810
it is an application, but
people come back to it

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.620
repeatedly.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.100
And there is some context to
it that might make sense.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.360
JAN KLEINERT: OK

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.260
MALE SPEAKER 3: Although
I'll throw that

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.120
in the issue tracker.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.370
IKAI LAN: Great.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.460
JAN KLEINERT: Any other
live questions?

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.430
IKAI LAN: That is something
that we're seeing a lot of

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.890
usage for App Script, which is
extending the functionality

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.700
apps and bridging a lot of
different applications.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.390
This is one thing that Sohrab,
the PM, was talking to me

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.562
about, which is that we think
that we're going to see a lot

00:19:53.562 --> 00:19:56.840
of very powerful applications
that extend Docs.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.880
So when you say the Docs team
might go ahead build this,

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.020
there's also a very good chance
that they might not and

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.540
would decide that it's something
which makes a lot

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.890
more sense as a script or
an extension, because it

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.310
doesn't apply to--

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.460
it applies to a small
subset of uses.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.740
So App Scripts are really good
for if you want to build

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.490
something specific to
a specific vertical.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.490
JAN KLEINERT: And it's
relatively quick and easy to

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.890
build these things and tailor
them to exactly how you want

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.590
to work, which is nice, too,
because everybody has their

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.160
own preferences for how they
want some of these extensions

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.410
and things to work.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.760
MALE SPEAKER 3: Well, when it's
done, you'll take a look

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.230
at it, and I think you'll
see what I mean.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.850
It's probably something that I
would expect that the Docs

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.496
team will come out with.

00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:40.918
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:20:40.918 --> 00:20:41.340
JAN KLEINERT: OK.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.563
Well, we're certainly interested
to check it out.

00:20:43.563 --> 00:20:47.150
MALE SPEAKER 3: I'm hoping to
have it by next week in the

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.580
Chrome Web Store.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.210
We'll see how fast
my designer goes.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:49.500
JAN KLEINERT: OK.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.853
Definitely let us know.

00:20:50.853 --> 00:20:51.560
MALE SPEAKER 3: Cool.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.810
Will do.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.090
I think there looks
like there's some

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.711
stuff in the chat.

00:20:58.711 --> 00:20:59.750
JAN KLEINERT: OK.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.280
So we don't--

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.640
MALE SPEAKER 3: On
the Hangout.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.680
JAN KLEINERT: --actually have
that visible at the moment.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.690
We may be able to switch
over to that possibly

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.610
on the other screen.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.780
IKAI LAN: We've got
Eric producing.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.910
Eric is normally in this chat.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.300
But he's back there.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.085
He's making all of the--

00:21:17.085 --> 00:21:18.540
MALE SPEAKER 3: Is that why the
screen's a little crooked?

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:18.810
IKAI LAN: Is it?

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.670
MALE SPEAKER 3: The camera's
a little crooked?

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.880
IKAI LAN: Oh, are we?

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.920
JAN KLEINERT: Maybe
we're crooked.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.680
It's possible.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.175
IKAI LAN: Maybe I'm-- maybe--
here, let me fix

00:21:24.175 --> 00:21:26.850
myself right there.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:27.670
This is a shared studio.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.880
That's all I'm going to say.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.290
MALE SPEAKER 3: Don't tell
him I said that.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.950
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah,
unfortunately,

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:37.230
I think that is--

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.960
I can see the all caps comment
that says "Any news about

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.750
Google Glass?" No, we
don't have any news

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.000
about Google Glass.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.590
I can't read it.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.683
I'm sorry.

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:50.540
IKAI LAN: Let me do this.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.205
Let me solve this.

00:21:52.205 --> 00:21:54.140
JAN KLEINERT: We'll fix this
technical problem in the

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:54.570
future when--

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:55.580
MALE SPEAKER 3: It looks like,
actually now, I'm looking at a

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.790
question from--

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.960
a clarification on the one
from the modifier.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.490
JAN KLEINERT: Oh, that's great.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:21:59.910
OK.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.240
IKAI LAN: OK, so there's
a lot of junk in here.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.960
MALE SPEAKER 3: There is
some junk, too, yeah.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.210
IKAI LAN: Let's see.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.220
OK.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.500
He's asking should he use
the GUI builder or

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.980
programmatically create
an application

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.715
using the program coding.

00:22:16.715 --> 00:22:18.300
JAN KLEINERT: Oh, OK.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.160
Whether to use UI app
programmatically to build it

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.250
versus GUI builder?

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.320
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.670
JAN KLEINERT: So that depends
on a couple things.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.950
So GUI builder is going to
give you a subset of the

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.630
functionality of UI apps.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.580
So if GUI builder can do
everything that you want your

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.860
user interface to do, then that
is a quick way to get

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.840
started without having to figure
out, I want this panel

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.200
to go here, and then having to
style everything and come up

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.720
with all the attributes
yourself.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.320
So it can save you
a lot of time.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.160
But if you want to use some of
the more complex widgets that

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.250
are not part of UI app, then
basically your only choice is

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.850
to write it all
programmatically.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.600
You can mix and match the two.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.457
So you can start with a basic
template that you

00:23:02.457 --> 00:23:03.890
build in GUI builder.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.090
And then as you load the
component, then you can add

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.900
things to it programmatically if
you want to extend it or do

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.750
things that you couldn't do
straight out of the box.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.653
I hope that's helpful.

00:23:14.653 --> 00:23:15.903
IKAI LAN: Great.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.150
Eric, give us give a thumbs up
if there's anything that's not

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.620
Google Glass related.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.130
We don't have any news
about Google Glass.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:26.500
I'm sorry.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.560
JAN KLEINERT: I wish We did.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.690
That would be cool if next week
we were sitting here with

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:30.751
what the glasses on.

00:23:30.751 --> 00:23:32.910
But I don't think
we're going to.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.100
MALE SPEAKER 3: He actually
posted another question that

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.990
said "not one or the other.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:41.220
The question is how to switch
between the two tools on one

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.530
UI, steps to do/" I think it
sounds like he wants to build

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:49.350
some of it in GUI and then
build some of it--

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.780
add on to it with script.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.200
JAN KLEINERT: I think we
have an example of

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.720
how to do this somewhere.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.970
What I'll do is I'll try to dig
that up and post it as a

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.970
response to the original
question in the Moderator page

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.390
afterwards.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.800
I can't remember off the top my
head whether that is in the

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.010
tutorial section or if it's
something that we had in the

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.270
old forum or Stack Overflow.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.050
But we do have some examples
of how you

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.480
can use the two together.

00:24:14.372 --> 00:24:15.466
OK.

00:24:15.466 --> 00:24:16.320
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.010
We've got someone else
on the live Hangout.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.460
I'm sorry we haven't given
you a chance to speak.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.100
Is there something you wanted
to ask us are talking about?

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:28.910
JAN KLEINERT: Maybe just--

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:29.390
IKAI LAN: Maybe just like--

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.050
JAN KLEINERT: Maybe just
there to listen.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:30.950
That's cool.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.180
IKAI LAN: That's cool, too.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:32.570
JAN KLEINERT: All right.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.260
Well, I think that's actually
all for me.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.320
Did you have anything else you
wanted to talk about today?

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.330
IKAI LAN: We can go
back to bantering.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.580
JAN KLEINERT: Or we could not.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.480
JAN KLEINERT: Jan and Eric
recently just moved.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.280
So they used to sit a little
bit further from me.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.680
And they moved to right
next to me.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.020
So now we are just literally
within earshot all day long.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.814
So I think that they've
had enough of me.

00:24:55.814 --> 00:24:56.760
JAN KLEINERT: That's not true.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.640
That's not true.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.170
But I think we're--

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.090
unless we have anymore live
questions, I think we might be

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.490
just about out of
stuff for today.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.736
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:25:07.736 --> 00:25:07.820
Great.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.086
Well, thank you all for
joining us today.

00:25:11.086 --> 00:25:12.010
JAN KLEINERT: All right.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.510
And we'll see you next week.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.590
IKAI LAN: And again, Eric
is in the background.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.400
He's running things.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:22.260
So a special thanks to
Eric for powering us.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.640
All right.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.350
JAN KLEINERT: All right.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.600
See you next week.
