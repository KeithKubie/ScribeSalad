LAURENCE MORONEY:
Today, I'm meeting

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.571
with Paige from Google Search
to talk about the coolness that

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:11.940
is Now on Tap.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.470
So, Paige, you're
a Product Manager

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.975
for Google Now on Tap, right?

00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:15.390
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Right.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: So, tell me
all about Google Now on Tap.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.330
What is it?

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.710
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: It's
a new feature for Android

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.510
Marshmallow, and it helps
bring me related information

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.426
and actions.

00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:24.800
Whatever I'm doing on my phone,
I can just use Now on Tap

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.730
to get information and actions.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.590
LAURENCE MORONEY: Ooh,
are you going to show me?

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.610
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: So, here is
a chat with my friend Brian.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.520
So, he says, hey, thanks for
picking me up at the airport,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220
gives me his flight
number, and then

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.660
I'm asking him about dinner.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.080
So, what I would typically
do in this situation

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.130
is copy and paste
some of these things.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.490
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: You look
up the flights number--

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's awkward
to copy with your fingers.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.100
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: --and
you might check out

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.349
a couple different apps to
see about the restaurant he

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.900
suggested.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.396
So, with Now on Tap, it
makes all of that super easy.

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:52.395
You tap and hold on the
Home button right there.

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:53.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.690
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: And then
you get all this information

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.610
and actions--

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, nice.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.025
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: --related
to what you are doing.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.990
So, here is the restaurant
that he suggested.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.930
Here is the flight.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.365
LAURENCE MORONEY:
There's his flight.

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:02.020
Oh, and he's delayed.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.319
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: I can see
it's delayed, so that's useful.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.370
I can create a calendar
event for this dinner

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.159
that we're having.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.700
And it actually used
natural language

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.510
to predict this calendar event,
which I think is pretty cool.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.529
Because we had mentioned
dinner, tonight, and the place

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:16.320
all in different parts
of the conversation,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.932
and it combined all of
those into one action.

00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:20.890
And so it's trying to
predict what I want to do

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.400
and also what
information I need.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.975
Now, beyond just the information
in a chat like this, can it

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:30.055
also, when you're in
a particular location,

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.430
it can predict
the kind of things

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.510
that you do based on time?

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.080
Is that right?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.600
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: So, that's
more of like a Google Now use

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.099
case.

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:36.689
So, Now on Tap is
actually building

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.480
on top of what Google
Now has already done.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.250
So, Google Now predicts what's
going on in the real world

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.290
and what information you need
that's happening around you.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.686
Now on Tap is about what's
happening on your phone.

00:01:46.686 --> 00:01:47.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, OK.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.280
Cool.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.840
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: And so, when
we were thinking about this,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.260
this was one of these
crazy ideas we had.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.040
What if you could get
Now cards for what's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.507
on your screen at any moment,
any screen that you're on?

00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:58.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: When you were
working on this kind of thing,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.520
it must have been really
challenging and exciting

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.590
to think about the context of
what people do on their phones.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.230
How was that?

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.230
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Yeah.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.620
It was a completely new idea.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.870
It was something that's never
really been done before.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.970
And so we looked at
a ton of screens.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.900
We were all donating
our screens as data.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.720
And we had people going
through their top apps

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.490
and making sure Now
on Tap worked well.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.270
And yeah, it was a
totally new project

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.900
that started out as just a
small team doing some prototypes

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.380
and then grew into this product
that we launched in less than a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.910
year.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.070
And it's in Android
Marshmallow, right?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.480
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Right.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.470
LAURENCE MORONEY: So, cool!

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.900
So, if I'm an app
developer and I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.150
want to take advantage of
something like this, what do

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.860
I need to do?

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.310
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: So, the
great thing about Now on Tap

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.830
is that developers don't
really have to do anything.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.350
And so it just works
automatically on most apps.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.220
There are a couple of
things that we really

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.120
recommend you do.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.450
So, one of those is getting
your app into App Indexing.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.180
Basically, if you
have information

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.500
that should appear in
search-- so, for example, you

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.860
have Yelp with a
bunch of Yelp reviews,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.240
or IMDB with a bunch
of pages about actors--

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.000
we actually show
those apps in search

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.560
if you've gone through and
participated in App Indexing.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.590
And that's where we know exactly
where to go within Now on Tap.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.260
So, if you noticed, we have all
those app icons on the cards.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.440
And then when you
click on those,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.790
it goes to exactly
the right place.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.200
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, wow.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.741
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: And the way
that we do that is we actually

00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:20.850
know from search
where to point to.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.450
One of the other
issues that we have

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.930
is when people do crazy
things with views.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.860
And so that's a little
more rare, but as long

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.650
as your app is basically working
well with accessibility, APIs,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.240
and such like that, it should
work well with Now on Tap.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.970
LAURENCE MORONEY:
What kind of stuff

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.219
did you guys encounter while
trying to build something

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.830
into Android?

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.480
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN:
One of the things

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.230
that was really exciting
for me was seeing

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.620
how the API was designed.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.700
So, Now on Top is actually
built on top of an open API.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.700
So it's an API that
anyone can build

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.160
an assistant that
takes advantage

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.510
of this information about the
view underlying on the screen

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.740
and also this layer that
comes up on top of the page.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.530
And so that was really cool
to actually design that API

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.950
and work with the Android team.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.360
And then we also had some
pretty funny challenges.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.570
It was actually pretty
hard to tell from context

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.800
what you should be showing.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.550
I guess it sounds hard, right?

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.380
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN:
And it was hard.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.540
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm sure
some things went wrong

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.680
along the line.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.680
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Yeah.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.210
We had funny-- you know how
there's a band called Yes?

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.035
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: We would
trigger for things like that.

00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:20.320
And it was a little bit
dumb at the beginning.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.190
But then we started
seeing these things

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.330
and then fixing
them, sort of tuning

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.255
to the context around the words.

00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:28.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: So, what,
if I was in a messenger

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.580
chat with a friend and the
word "yes" was in there,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.270
and I did Now on Tap--

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.510
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Yeah, you
might get a card for the band.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: --then I'd
hear all about Jon Anderson.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.920
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Right.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, I love it.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.290
I'm sure lots of other things
could go interestingly wrong

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.110
with that.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.780
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Yeah.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.029
One of the things that we
have actually struggled with

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.320
is making sure to
always find something

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.541
useful on every screen.

00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:49.040
Because, if you can
imagine, there's

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.670
just not entities perfectly
spelled out on every screen.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.320
So, one thing that we introduced
that I think is really cool

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.590
is basically ways to
find trending searches

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.139
on your screen.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.680
We actually know a lot of people
are searching for right now.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.620
And so we can actually
incorporate that into Now

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.120
on Tab.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.280
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's pretty cool.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.220
And, obviously, we're just
talking about English right

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.720
now.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.960
So, it's also available
in other languages, right?

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.095
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Yeah.

00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:11.640
At this point,
we're launched in I

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.032
think eight or more languages.

00:05:13.032 --> 00:05:13.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.500
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: And it was
a challenge, you can imagine.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.589
This all relies on natural
language processing,

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.130
and so you really have to know
all the nuances and the quirks

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.800
of the different
languages in order

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.180
to not make those types
of "Yes" examples,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.010
those bad-- "overtriggering"
is what we call it.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.880
And so--

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.680
LAURENCE MORONEY:
"Overtriggering."

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.040
I'll have to remember that one.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.990
Whenever I try to speak
French and insult somebody,

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.448
I'll just say "I'm
overtriggering!"

00:05:36.448 --> 00:05:37.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.330
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Yeah.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.720
So, luckily, we had a team
in Japan dedicated to this.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.800
We also had a lot of
engineers in Europe.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.050
That's where the core
Now on Tap team is based.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.384
And so they all speak
like seven languages.

00:05:49.384 --> 00:05:50.300
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.800
Nice.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.920
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Yeah.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.770
They were able to help out.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.944
And it works just as well.

00:05:52.944 --> 00:05:54.568
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN:
You know, Now on Tap

00:05:54.568 --> 00:05:55.730
is actually really useful.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.563
Some engineers in Japan
have been telling me

00:05:57.563 --> 00:05:59.290
it's really useful
for them, because it's

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.790
hard to type out
all the characters.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.132
Copy and paste is even more
useful in Japanese, basically.

00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:03.896
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's true, yeah.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:04.280
Of course.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.555
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: And so Now
on Tap is incredibly helpful.

00:06:06.555 --> 00:06:07.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, nice.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.420
So, back to developers.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.680
You did mention App Indexing.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.110
And App Indexing is part of it.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.060
But I hear you've got some
great resources for developers

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.220
for everything that they
need to get into Now on Tap.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.570
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Yeah.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.140
If you're really interested in
making your app work perfectly

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.580
with Now on Tap and learning
about these assistant APIs,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.630
I suggest taking a look at
our developer docs on this.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.170
We have a great article that's
all about the Assist APIs.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: One
article's all they need.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.980
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN: Yeah,
it's really pretty simple.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.410
Well, thank you, Paige, and
thanks for coming today.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.180
PAIGE DUNN-RANKIN:
Thank you so much.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.060
This was great.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: If you've
got any questions for me,

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.930
or if you have any
questions for Paige,

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.930
just please leave them
in the comments below.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.220

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.870

Thank you.
