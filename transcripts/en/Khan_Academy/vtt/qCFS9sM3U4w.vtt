00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.580
And welcome back.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.000
We are now on number
seven on page 409.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.790
Dwayne has a newspaper route
for which he collects k

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.040
dollars per day.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.400
From this amount, he pays out--
so this is how much he

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:35.180
makes-- k/3 dollars per day
for the cost of the paper.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.210
So this is cost of papers.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.200
And he saves the rest
of the money.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.690
In terms of k, how many
days will it take

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.230
Dwayne to save $1,000?

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.290
That's his goal.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.710
Well, how much does
he make per day?

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.650
Well, he makes k, and he has
to give out k/3 per day.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:06.370
So each day, per day, he
makes k minus k/3.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.060
We could write this
as 3k minus k/3.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.790
k is the same thing is 3k/3.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.225
So this is equal to 2k/3.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760
That's how much he
makes per day.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.760
So how much does he
make in d days?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.520
If d is the number of days,
how much does he make?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.920
Well, he makes 2k/3 times d.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.550
That's how much he makes,
right? d days.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:46.390
Well, he wants to make $1,000,
so how many days

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.640
is it going to take?

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.692
Hopefully, you realize this is
a level one linear equation,

00:01:54.692 --> 00:01:57.210
so you multiply both sides
times a reciprocal.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.815
So 3/2k times this,
times 3/2k.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.260
This cancels this.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.840
This cancels.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.410
That cancels.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.300
You're just left with a d
on the left-hand side.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.509
And on the right-hand side, we
can do little canceling, too.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.290
This 2 will cancel and
make this into 500.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.620
You have 500 times 3/k.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.040
So that equals-- I don't know
why I started tilting-- that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:33.880
equals 1500/k days.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.830
And that is the choice
number D.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.910
All right.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.350
I get excited.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.360
Number eight has
a number line.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.030
I get excited whenever there's
a number line problem.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.800
I don't know why.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.820
It's a psychological
disorder, perhaps.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.740
But a good one.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.260
Some abnormalities are positive
abnormalities.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.610
Let's see.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.780
So let me draw this
number line.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.320
All right.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.615
I drew that number line.

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:10.300
That's a number line.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.370
Most of the time is probably
just going to take drawing it.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.460
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.160
So I have point A.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.440
Let me do it in a more
vivid color.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.250
Point A is here, and then it's
right next to negative 2.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.240
It's a little bit less
than negative 2,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.100
which is right there.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.680
Then I have negative
1 right here.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.680
Then I got a bunch of points.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.740
I have B.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.800
I have P.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.550
I have C.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.680
Then I have 0.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.020
Then I have 1.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.920
And then I have a couple
points more.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.530
D.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.970
And then I have Q.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.760
Then I have the number
2, and I have E.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.760
All right.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.660
So let's read the problem.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.440
Which of the letter points, on
the number line above, could

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.790
represent the result when the
coordinate of point P is

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.880
multiplied by the coordinate
of point Q.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.910
All right.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.850
So this is pretty much just an
approximation problem, right?

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.950
So we're trying to figure out
P times Q, essentially.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.940
So point P, well, let's eyeball
it, it's a little bit

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.670
to the left of 0, to the
right of negative 1.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.320
It looks like maybe, I
don't know, I'm just

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.130
guessing, minus 0.5?

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.980
minus 1/2, right?

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.570
Minus 1/2.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.170
And what's Q?

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:44.260
Well, Q looks a little bit
closer to 2 than it is to 1,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.880
so I would say maybe,
1 and 3/4?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.820
I'm just guessing.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.470
You could just approximate
it as you want.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.720
So 1 and 3/4.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.550
Or if you wanted to write that
as an improper fraction, which

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.410
I prefer to deal with, 7/4.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.610
I'm just eyeballing it.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.760
Nothing fancy here.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.540
So if P is minus 1/2, and this
number is 7/4, what happens

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.810
when you multiply the two?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:21.020
So minus 1/2 times 7/4 is equal
to minus 7/8, right?

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.490
So minus 7/8, that's
almost minus 8/8.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.800
Minus 8/8 would be here.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.780
Minus 8/8 would be at negative
1, and so this is a little

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.305
less negative, so it's a
slightly larger number.

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:42.050
So minus 7/8 is going to be
someplace around this area.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.090
Well, it's interesting that
I've bumped into a number

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.030
there while I was looking
in that area.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.780
I bumped into point B.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.050
And maybe my approximation
is wrong.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.380
Maybe it could be point P.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.020
But when I look at the
choices, P isn't a

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.530
choice, and only B is.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.570
So B is what I would bubble in,
as what happens when you

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.120
multiply P times Q.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.190
And that was kind of fun,
because it's just pure

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.410
approximation.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.990
And you kind of get something
that approaches the answer.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.080
Well, it is the answer I guess.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.550
Hopefully.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.800
All right.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.060
I'm having too much fun,
absolutely too much fun.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.830
OK.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.720
Number nine.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:37.220
If 5y plus 2x is equal to 23,
and x is equal to y plus 1,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.120
what is the value of y?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.140
What does y equal?

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.490
Well, this we could
do straight up

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.560
substitution to solve.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.610
We have x is equal
to y plus 1.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.130
Substitute.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.030
Substitute for x.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:55.670
So then we're left with
5y plus 2 times x.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.910
For x, we substitute
this term.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.290
2 times y plus 1
is equal to 23.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.730
We just do algebra, or
even arithmetic.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.750
5y plus-- distribute the 2--
2y plus 2 is equal to 23.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.720
5y plus 2y is 7y, plus
2 is equal to 23.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.260
Subtract 2 from both sides.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.500
7y is equal to 21.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.740
y is equal to 3.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.850
This was just a question to see
if you even took Algebra

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.540
I, not to make you feel bad
if you don't remember.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.500
People forget things.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.600
But anyway, let's move on.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.960
Number 10.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.230
A company produced 300
appliances in the first week

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.430
of the month.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.810
So this is number
10 we're doing.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.160
Let me switch colors because
that mauve is too dark.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.410
So week one.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.540
Appliances.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.580
Produced 500 in week one.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.030
Because it received additional
machinery, its production

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.650
increased 50% from the first
week to the second week.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.390
How many appliances did
the company produce

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.030
in the second week?

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.210
Well, I didn't even have to
make a table here, right?

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.830
So it improved 50%.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.910
So plus 50%.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.690
So it's important.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.030
It improved 50% percent.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:27.650
Week 2 isn't 50% percent of 500,
it's 50% more than 500.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:34.630
So it's 500 plus 50% of 500.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.760
What's 50% percent of 500?

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.370
Well, that's 250, right?

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:44.250
So it's 250 plus 500 is 750.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.650
I was looking forward to
something more challenging.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.190
Anyway, number 11.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:56.480
Let's see if I have time to do
number 11 in this video.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.090
You know what?

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.780
I only have one minute left.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.610
I will do this in
the next video.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:01.860
See you soon.
