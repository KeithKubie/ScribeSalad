00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.180
The sheer quantity and
quality that we have here

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.600
at the Arizona State Museum
is unmatched in the southwest.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.270
It's really a
testament to long term

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.290
preservation of
the arid Southwest.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.820
If you look closely, you'll
see a huge amount of variety

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.430
and you have to imagine
that somebody picked

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.170
a piece of fiber or grass
and wove it together

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.050
to create something functional.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.630
There's many people that
believe that working

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.830
with fiber and basketry is
the oldest human technology.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.040
I've always been interested
in cultural heritage

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.470
and I like doing
things with my hands,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.300
so this is a perfect combination
of art history, science,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.490
and fine art.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.380
We've had lots of conversations
with basket weavers

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.360
and cultural representatives in
putting this exhibit together

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.370
and time after time, it's
connecting to the past,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.709
it's connecting
within families, it's

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.720
connecting to the environment.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.930
It's part of a really
essential heritage

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.300
that so many native
communities in Arizona have.
