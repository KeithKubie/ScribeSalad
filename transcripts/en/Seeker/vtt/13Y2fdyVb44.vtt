00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.800
Does the internet make us smarter or more
distracted, let’s take a look at what the…

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.689
oh wait, what was that shiny thing?

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.010
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.550
It seems like kids these days are spending
a lot of time in front of screens.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.520
And according to research published in the
journal Archives of Disease in Childhood,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520
it’s true.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.450
And what’s more, these experiences are increasingly
fragmented.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.320
You might pause this youtube video to go check
twitter or you might text your friend while

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.320
watching a movie.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.210
But while these new technologies change our
experiences, is our attention becoming more

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.840
fragmented as well?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.239
Research from University of Southern California
Marshall School of Business found that we

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.109
consume a lot of digital media.

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.219
I mean A LOT.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.789
The average American receives more than 15
hours a day of digital media, everything from

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.329
YouTube videos and Netflix movies to computer
games and text messages.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.930
By the age of 7, a child born today will have
spent the equivalent of one full year watching

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.489
screens, according to a study published in
the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.149
That’s basically spending a seventh of your
life on the computer or checking your texts.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.219
So what is this doing to our brains?

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.059
Teachers seem to think it’s nothing good.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.110
According Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American
Life Project 87% of teachers think that technology

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.979
creates "an easily distracted generation with
short attention spans,"

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.780
But the research isn’t so conclusive.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.600
It may seem easy to assume based on earlier
studies on tv watching habits that screen

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.619
time does affect attention spans.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.259
A study published in the journal Pediatrics
reports that for “each hour of television

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.619
watched per day at ages 1-3 increases the
risk of attention problems, such as ADHD,

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.740
by almost 10 percent at age 7.”

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.859
And that’s what a few studies show.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.490
Recent research from Microsoft of all places
found that average attention span has dropped.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.610
15 years ago, attention spans were about 12
seconds on average.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.460
Now they’re around 8 seconds.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.219
But maybe this is a case of adaption.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.150
As we’re bombarded with more and more media,
we’re more discerning about how we consume

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.150
it.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.049
Just like when used to get yelled at for flipping
channels too fast, it only takes an instant

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.159
to decide if we want to watch something or
not.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.049
Maybe technology changes the way we focus
our attention.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.430
But some researchers caution that "Just because
we may be allocating our attention differently

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.210
as a function of the technologies we may be
using, it doesn’t mean that the way our

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.930
attention actually can function has changed.”

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.140
One study published in the journal Human Performance
found that young people, under 30, begin to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.600
lose concentration on workplace tasks after
5 to 15 minutes.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.410
But it also suggested that the internet is
both the poison and the cure.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.210
The study implies that young adults get a
boost in mood and attention after browsing

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.150
the web for a few minutes, then returning
to a task.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.190
This wasn’t the case of older adults who
didn’t receive the same benefits from a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.800
leisurely scroll around the web.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.590
That same poll from the Pew Research Center
found that 77% of teachers think the internet

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.410
has a "mostly positive" impact on students'
research habits.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.250
But while technology like the internet and
smartphones changes the way we tune into information,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.550
it literally gives us the world of knowledge
at our fingertips.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.760
And I wouldn’t trade that for anything.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.920
Since you’ve paid attention this far, maybe
you should check out this video where Trace

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.390
explains what ADHD is.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.660
Oh yeah there’s some great green screen
action in this.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.710
Now..

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.940
. I’m going to go check my twitter and watch
some cat videos at the same time.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.700
Alright guys, how often to you double up on
screen time?

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.170
Are you checking facebook as you watch this?
