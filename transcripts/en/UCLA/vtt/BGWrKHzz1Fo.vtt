00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:19.847
- Thank you, everybody, for joining us

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:22.120
in this week two of 10 questions.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.810
This evening's question is

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.033
what

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.680
(audience laughs)

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.880
is

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.663
time?

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.850
One of our world's greatest photographers

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.190
and a colleague here at UCLA, Kathy Opie,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.370
has said it this way, ideas always start

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.020
with questions.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.020
Questions powerfully drive
research of all kinds today.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:56.570
It drives forward whether in the sciences,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.220
the humanities, in medicine or the arts

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.720
and arts indeed and part of
the predicate of this course

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.540
is that the arts are a form of research,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.930
they're research into ideas
and things that not only shape

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.160
but become our world and
if you'd allow me to take

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.280
a few minutes here, I'd
like to briefly introduce

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.190
to all of you 10 questions

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.570
and then introduce each
of our terrific guests

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.020
here with us this evening
so I am Brett Steele,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.400
the host of this event
here and dean of the UCLA

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.132
School of the Arts and Architecture

00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:31.770
and you are joining us here at the school

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.857
for a very special experiment in education

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:38.510
and public programming,
10 questions is both

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.470
a lecture course with
80 students, students,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.020
give me a shout out, where are you,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.230
so we can see you here.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.100
With students and this is a public event.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.450
Public, a show of hands and thank you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.399
so much for coming in,
this combination of class

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.970
and public event gives us an
opportunity to build bridges.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.280
To build bridges rather
than reinforce walls

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.900
between the university and
the public whom we serve.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.890
We are striving here to
make a state of the art

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.210
education not only more
visible but literally

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.070
more available in the world around us,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.940
in turn, by making UCLA more porous,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.810
we hope to communicate
to you, our students,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.367
the importance of the
work each of you are doing

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:29.160
in the classroom and beyond,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.310
each of the questions
being asked in this series

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.160
is drawn from the critical engagement

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.460
of arts practitioners, who
we canvassed considerably

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.600
for many months to come up
with the list of 10 questions

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.470
that have organized this
course, the questions of space,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.470
time, beauty, freedom,
memory, the body, failure,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.963
work and knowledge are all
central to artistic practices

00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:58.090
of all kinds today, by
sharing these inquiries

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.258
with not only artists but
also scientists, scholars

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:06.250
and activists, we genuinely
believe that we are building

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.010
a stronger foundation for
understanding both disciplinary

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.010
commonalities and different
individuated perspectives.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.700
In this way we hope to
both build and develop

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.760
an appreciation for the interdisciplinary,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.310
the interdisciplinarity
that is so necessary

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.820
for progress in this tightly
interconnected 21st century

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.770
universe that you all know so well.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.600
Over these 10 weeks, 10
questions will bring together

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.348
40 terrific faculty
members across the entire

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:40.280
UCLA campus, students
enrolled in this course

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.730
include majors from the School
of the Arts and Architecture

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.100
as well as neuroscience,
biology, French, music,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.350
political science and many,
many other campus majors.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.710
In addition to being
here Tuesday evenings,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.520
you students meet weekly
with our graduate teaching

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.950
assistants in the course,
Kyle, Jing Jing, Anna

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.250
and Haley, who are here
with us this evening

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.940
to respond to and discuss these questions,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.250
creating as well as curating
your own individuated

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.883
responses in a variety
of different formats.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.160
10 questions is the
brainchild of Victoria Marks,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.810
choreographer and associate dean

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.570

Nurturing and bringing
this project to fruition

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.960
with Victoria and to the broader public

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.540
is the work of Anne Marie
Burke sitting next to Victoria,

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.914
right up here up front.

00:04:38.914 --> 00:04:42.680

Kyle Kerrigan and Louise Kale.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.063
Jennifer Wells Green, our
executive director of development

00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:55.960
worked alongside Victoria
and Anne Marie to ensure

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.900
that Friends of UCLA
were able to join in this

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.120
unique project, finally,
Marilyn Pace offered

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.180
her tremendous expertise
in UCLA teaching to ensure

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.750
that this moved forward
in the form that it is,

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.380
so thank you to all who've
made that possible here

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.200
within the school and I know
like in any introduction,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.050
time is of the essence, but
please, two more thanks here,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.980
very briefly, alongside
Victoria and Anne Marie,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.220
I wish to thank two vice
provosts here at UCLA

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.250
for supporting our initiative, Tim Brewer,

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.930
our Vice Provost for
Interdisciplinary and Cross Campus

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.440
Affairs, provided a seed
grant initially to allow us

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.000
to plan this work, and Roger Wakamoto,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.811
our Vice Provost for Research
provided additional support

00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:41.465
which when combined with our own efforts,

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:44.400
has been able to make this event possible

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.450
and more accessible, and finally we thank

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.240
the Department of World Arts Culture Dance

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.540
for their enormous support,
for this terrific venue

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.870
and for the considerable
technical expertise

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.745
which is spread around
the room as I'm speaking

00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:00.800
that makes an event like this possible.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.940
And with that as a broad introduction,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.030
I'd like to briefly
introduce each of our guests

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.336
a variety of media to explore
the nature of perception

00:06:20.336 --> 00:06:24.520
in media representation,
she is especially interested

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.010
in how cultures express
themselves through the style

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.990
of nature that they
produce at any given time

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.630
and the medium through which
they construct this idea

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.160
of nature.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.740

will give a brief presentation,
I will open up the floor

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.280

00:08:37.121 --> 00:08:39.124
(audience laughs)

00:08:39.124 --> 00:08:43.530
- Oh, rats, okay, thank you
very much for that introduction,

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.610
overly generous, good evening everyone,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.970
it's a pleasure to be here
and pleasure to see you all.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.280
I'm going to talk about how
historians look at time,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.896
historians of modern Europe
or European historians,

00:08:55.896 --> 00:08:58.260
this'll give us two different perspectives

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.317
on how historians look at time,

00:09:00.317 --> 00:09:04.010
I'm gonna focus really on
three issues that European

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.660
historians have looked at

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.670
in a broad range of European history.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.670
The first is the technology
of time and that's the

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.780
transition from bells to
clocks to watches and so on

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.000
which has a long history in
the west and all over the world

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.657
and that's one thing that people look at

00:09:25.657 --> 00:09:27.690
and we'll see how that
comes back at the end.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.060
The second is sort of the
metaphysical notion of history.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.030
With the decline of the
Roman Empire and the rise

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.350
of Christianity,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.820
Christian conceptions of
time kind of took over

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.850
in the medieval west and
dominated western thought

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.860
for a long, long time, the
easiest way of seeing that

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.600
is in the Bible as history,
there's an Old Testament

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.382
and a New Testament, divided
by the coming of Christ

00:09:48.382 --> 00:09:51.110
and then with the prefiguring of the

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.750
last judgment.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.930
That also opens up the
notion of a temporal

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.830
versus the eternal, which was
as much on people's minds,

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.460
the temporal, the post, after the fall,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.040
after Adam and Eve, men
and women were subject

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.860
to all the vicissitudes of
life and subject to time.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.276
Whereas the eternal which
was the realm of God

00:10:14.276 --> 00:10:18.430
was without time or could be conceived of

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.647
as endless time, time
after time after time.

00:10:21.647 --> 00:10:24.580
And the notion was of
course, the common notion was

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.410
that that temporal age would
end at the last judgment,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.890
everything would be brought
together and some people

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.150
would enjoy eternity, either
up above us or below us

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.460
in heaven or in hell and that
was a kind of dominant theme.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.005
Another aspect of that
that was very important

00:10:41.005 --> 00:10:42.030
was that the teleological
aspect, people thought

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.800
of history as having an end,

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.560
it was guided towards something,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.950
things were either going to get better

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.250
or they were going to get
worse, but they were always

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.470
going to an end and that
end was the end of time

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.300
so the Christian conception
of time in the medieval West

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.470
was very dominant and had
really captured people's minds.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.530
It also captured people's
minds in another way,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.414
which I'll come back to,

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:06.880
and then finally the third
conception is a social

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.550
and economic conception of
time, how society patterns time

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.460
or the vice versa, how time
patterns social activities

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.117
and work, and those were two
very, very important issues

00:11:19.117 --> 00:11:21.310
and they are the issues
that really surround

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.831
what became one of the
central and has been

00:11:23.831 --> 00:11:25.350
one of the central concerns
of European history

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.850
for a long time and that is modernization

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.710
or industrialization, now modernization,

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.890
industrialization, is a process
that lasted for centuries

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.160
in Europe, it is a process
that is still going on

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.950
around the world, you can
think of it in simple terms

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.801
as industry, factories,
trade, globalization,

00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:47.890
but more importantly from our standpoint

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.530
here in this group, it also requires

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.240
a radical restructuring
of time, of movement

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.700
from preindustrial to
post industrial time.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.650
And those are two radically
different regimes.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.230
In order to show you how
radically different they were

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.860
in the European west, I'll
refocus on, to begin with,

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.960
preindustrial time, agrarian
time, the time dominated

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.230
by the work of the fields, the work that

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.280
the majority, the vast
majority, 99, 95, 99%

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.073
of the population enjoyed or
worked in during their lives

00:12:22.073 --> 00:12:26.130
so it's that early aspect
that I want to think about

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.603
and when you think about agrarian time,

00:12:29.603 --> 00:12:32.610
you have to think about
day time because night

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.820
was absolutely dark and the possibility

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.725
of falling into a cesspool,
stepping on a plow,

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:41.850
getting rolled over by a
cart was all too common

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.670
so you didn't go out after
dark, you were too poor,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.680
likely, to have candles even,
so most of the European West

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.663
was really dark, so we're
talking about daytime

00:12:50.663 --> 00:12:53.971
and daytime was structured by work.

00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:56.750
The way in which you organized your day,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.600
the way in which you
thought about your day

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.030
was according to the tasks you did.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.573
Now how many of you are horse racing fans?

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.683
Okay, how long is a furlong?

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.293
You don't know?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.600
Eighth of a mile, well,
that's almost correct,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.460
it's the distance that
a plow team could go

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.110
in a straight line before
it had to turn around

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.600
and come back again to
plow the other side.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.393
That's where, it's a furrow long.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.610
Now.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.470
Given that, and given that
several furrows make an acre,

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.043
how big is an acre?

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.512
Oh, God, you're so post industrial.

00:13:40.512 --> 00:13:42.380
(audience laughs)

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.810
An acre is the amount
of land that a plow team

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.233
could plow in one day.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.640
Okay?

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.810
Now that's somewhat irregular
if you think about it.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.960
If you plow in heavy
clay soil, you're only

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.230
gonna be able to plow a little bit.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.880
If you're plowing in light sandy soils,

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.200
you're gonna plow a lot,
so an acre which is a day's

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.600
worth of work for a plow
team, varied from one place

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.739
to another, that irregularity
is what characterizes

00:14:10.739 --> 00:14:13.890
preindustrial time or preindustrial work.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.470
It's not divided by time,
it's divided by the tasks

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.960
you have to do.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.200
And there's no real division
between life and leisure,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.730
work and things that you need to do,

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.760
it's irregular and that
kind of irregularity

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.370
dominates the way in which people live.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.500
Villages were organized around churches,

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.609
the church bell rang, the morning rang,

00:14:33.609 --> 00:14:36.020
the evening rang when
you had to go to Mass,

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.560
didn't tell time, didn't
have any timekeeping as such.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.950
You had the sun, you had
the cock crow and you had

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.710
basically your work and that was the way

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.900
in which the rhythms of life were set.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.370
Sunrise, sunset, and the various
seasons that went with it.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.750
The calendar, the annual
calendar was likewise dominated

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.970
by the rhythms of agriculture,
the rhythms of what you did

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.970
daily, sowing, reaping,
hoeing, harvest or it could be

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.380
pasturing, lambing, shearing, butchering

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.940
and all the things that you
did in the pasture world,

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.100
but those were the activities,
the kinds of things you did

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.480
and that's how you told
time, you told the seasons

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.883
according to what you had to
do when you needed to do them.

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:24.300
On top of that, there were
also and most people thought

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.100
about not just the tasks they
had to do or the seasons,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.010
but they also thought greatly
about the Christian calendar,

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:35.090
the feast days, time was
marked by great feasts,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.270
not feasts in the sense of a lot of food,

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.100
but celebrations of
saints, Saint Bartholomew,

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.690
you'll hear about, Saint Martin.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.459
We only have left pretty
much Christmas and Easter

00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:49.530
from those times, but
every week had, every day

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.180
had a saint associated
with it and we'll see,

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.340
that's how they told time.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.630
So work, life, feast days,
that's what structured

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.010
people's memory, that's how
they came to locate themselves

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.850
in time, historical time if you will,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.120
so I want to illustrate
that by some quotes

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.630
which we don't, one of the
problems of doing preindustrial

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.820
work is that the people
didn't write anything,

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.835
they didn't leave diaries,
they didn't write letters

00:16:13.835 --> 00:16:16.780
so we have to kind of
triangulate and get at them

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.947
from other ways what
they were thinking about,

00:16:18.947 --> 00:16:20.221
what was going on in their minds

00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:21.767
and one of the ways we get in their minds

00:16:21.767 --> 00:16:23.189
was in England,

00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:25.730
coming of age was a very important time.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.710
You came of age if you were a man at 21,

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.240
a woman at 14 or 15.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.810
And that was important
because at those ages

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.780
you could inherit land and
the king was very concerned

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.890
about that, who was gonna
inherit land that belonged to him

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.130
and so he had a whole system
set up called proof of age,

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.350
so if you think you're 21 years old,

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.160
the king would set up an
inquest, which was a jury,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.780
and the local neighbors, 12
of them, would get together

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.540
and testify as to whether or not

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.260
you were really 12 years old

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.517
or you were 15 years
old or whatever it was

00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:58.670
and so we have records of that that say,

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.650
these proof of ages, and you'll see that

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:02.960
they're not exactly what you think.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.700
So I've got one and fortunately
there were two juries,

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.540
two inquests, that were
held three months apart,

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:13.540
one in October of 1303 and
one in January of 1305.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.280
Let me just go through this very quickly.

00:17:19.132 --> 00:17:22.500
First one was for John, son
and heir of Richard Tempest,

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.870
here's what they said,
William de Martin, age 60,

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.650
says that the said John
was born in Bracefield

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.210
on the day of Saint Bartholomew,

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.150
which is, you're right, 24th of August,

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.560
21 years ago, and he was
baptized in the baptistry

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.030
of the Church of Saint Michael
there and he recollects

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.930
the day and the year
because on the exaltation

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.509
of the feast of the Holy Cross following,

00:17:44.509 --> 00:17:46.610
right, the 13th of September,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.450
his son Patrick was born
who was 21 years old

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.460
at that feast last.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.140
Robert Buck aged 41 agrees and recollects

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.378
because he was in school at Cliffrow

00:17:57.378 --> 00:18:01.160
and on the morrow of the nativity
of Saint John the Baptist

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.370
25th of June, next before the said birth,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:08.930
he was so badly beaten at
school that he left school

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.930
and from the day of that
beating, it was 21 years

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.580
on the same morrow last past.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.310
What's missing from those accounts?

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.470
What would you normally
have if you were saying,

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.423
you think, 21 years ago, what's missing?

00:18:21.423 --> 00:18:22.610
- A year.
- A year,

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:27.313
there's no calendar
year, no day of the week,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
there are feast days, there's events,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.740
that's the way you pattern your time,

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.917
you think about where you
were according to what

00:18:34.917 --> 00:18:39.917
the feast day was and according
to what the (stammers)

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.410
whatever, so the next one, the next,

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.180
I lost the train of thought
there, that happens.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.520
We'll see that in a second.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.791
Emma, the wife of Richard
Fovell and the daughter

00:18:51.791 --> 00:18:53.540
of Elias, this is the one
that's three months later,

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.340
this is the inquest, okay, so.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.110
One of the interesting
things is this inquest

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.330
was held in the same town,
Skipped on a Pond Craven,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.370
lovely town, you should visit it.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.680
Emma was the daughter
of Elias de Ruleston.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.530
Elias de Ruleston died in 1295.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.934
And at the time of his death,

00:19:12.934 --> 00:19:16.510
an inquest determined that
his heirs were his daughters

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.333
Emma aged three in 1295,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.730
and her sister Cecily aged
three months who disappears.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.420
So we fast forward nine years.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.250
Nine and three is 12?

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.020
So we would expect the
jury to come out in 1304

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.220
and say 12 years old,
John de Keely, age 50,

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.370
says that the said Emma was
born at Fleshby on Sunday

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.870
for Saint Peter and
Cathedral, 22nd February,

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.703
15 years ago and was baptized
in the baptistry of the church

00:19:45.703 --> 00:19:49.410
of Saint Andrew Cargrave and
this he recollects because

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.610
at the Feast of Saint Martin,
10th of November before that,

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.410
he leased a certain
land for a term of years

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.980
whereof at the Feast of
Saint Martin last 15 years

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.410
had elapsed and so the indenture,
he had a document shows,

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.100
so the document shows
that that's accurate,

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.870
but he says that she's
15, but clearly she's 12.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.900
John was one of several men on both juries

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.050
and you can compare their
testimony, remember Robert Buck,

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.800
the guy who was beaten so badly?

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.640
Well, at the time, he
gave the first testimony,

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.708
he was 41, when he came
back in January, he's 38.

00:20:22.708 --> 00:20:24.270
(audience laughs)

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.690
He recalled in October,
John's age, a few months later

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.010
in January, he agrees that
Emma is 15 and he recollects

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.010
that because Adam Buck, his
father, died 12 years ago

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.570
at the Feast of Ascension,
next, and the said Emma

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.540
was then three years old
and he was in the church

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.340
the day she was baptized.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.060
More interesting is the
testimony of Elias de Stretton,

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.350
aged 70 in the first inquest, this I love,

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.653
having just turned 70, in
the second inquest, he's 60.

00:20:50.653 --> 00:20:51.550
(audience laughs)

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.030
In the first he agreed
that John was 21 years old

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.220
because he recollected
that his wife Annabelle

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.130
died at the Feast of Saint
Martin, 10th of November,

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.740
after John's birth 21 years
ago, he's been a grieving

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.010
widower for 21 years.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.863
In the second January,

00:21:08.744 --> 00:21:12.150
he agreed that Emma was 15
years old because he recollected

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.870
that his wife Annabelle died
12 years ago at Christmas

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.840
last and on Sunday before the
Feast of Saint Peter Cathedral

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.690
following, the said Emma
was three years of age.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.320
Now Elias was actually in the jury in 1295

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.310
that testified that she was
three years old in 1295,

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.180
but he says no, she's 15 years old,

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.740
so the point here is that this
is kind of a little window

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.446
you can have onto the way
in which people thought.

00:21:37.446 --> 00:21:40.640
We all look at our watches,
we look at our time

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.720
and gradually as these
jurors were talking,

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.490
time was changing, they
were establishing work bells

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.470
in cities to get cloth
workers to work and appear

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.380
on time and when they
could take meals and when

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.590
they could go home, a
very small proportion

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.090
of the population, but
that's the start of it.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.180
From work bells you get clocks in towns

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.620
and clocks tell the workers in the towns,

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.760
the cloth workers, the leather workers,

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.080
the beer makers, the beer brewers,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.270
and all of those people when they can work

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.760
and when they can leave
work, when they can eat

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.980
and when they can stop
eating, then you start getting

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.680
clocks in homes and clocks in shops,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.680
then those clocks get
transported to your wrists

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.180
or your pocket, actually,
first, you carry a clock

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.320
in your pocket and those
things tell you what time it is

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.740
but they also tell you what
your work is supposed to do

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.060
and it's the work that regulates the time,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.570
it's the work that regulates
your life so that you think

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.760
not in terms of oh, this
task is gonna take so long,

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.210
it says I have so much
time to do this task

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.975
and suddenly time becomes a commodity.

00:22:41.975 --> 00:22:45.320
You can save time, you can spend time,

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.410
you can waste time, that
wouldn't have made any sense

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.720
to Elias de Stretton or
any of his colleagues

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.570
at that time, the
apotheosis of this, I think,

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:58.570
is the FitBit, not only
does it calibrate minutes,

00:22:59.525 --> 00:23:04.460
seconds, miniseconds, it
also calibrates heartbeats,

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.230
sleeping rhythms, brain waves,

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.726
so there's no part of your life

00:23:08.726 --> 00:23:11.470
which is without regulation
and without the discipline

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.110
of time, it's that discipline
of time that's taken

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.652
centuries to impose,
those medieval villagers

00:23:18.652 --> 00:23:21.420
resisted and resisted and resisted

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.780
and the history of
industrialization in the West

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.919
and in Europe is the history
not only of the imposition

00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:29.998
of time but the resistance
of time, thank you.

00:23:29.998 --> 00:23:32.998
(audience applauds)

00:23:42.544 --> 00:23:45.608
- So I think we have a
PowerPoint presentation

00:23:45.608 --> 00:23:50.608
and while that's happening
I want to thank Dean Steele,

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:54.320
Marks, Anna Marie Burke,
and others for inviting me

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.853
to be a part of this conversation.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:01.490
So I'm gonna talk about
time in premodern Islam.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.570
Premodern Muslims, it's fair
to say, were obsessively

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.070
and deeply engaged with time.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:12.610
So you might find a philosopher
in 11th century Baghdad

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:16.000
who thought about the
relationship between God

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.880
and eternity, you might have a

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.900
11th or 12th century Persian
scientist and inventor

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.302
who spent lots of his,
who spent a lot of time

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:34.570
designing and building the best clocks

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.100
and astrolabes of his era.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.170
And a 13th century
Anatolian mystic who tried

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:46.170
through his meditations to
transcend time altogether.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:50.570
So in all of these sort of
deep engagements with time,

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:55.320
with defining it, with
pondering its philosophical

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.683
implications, with measuring it,

00:24:59.106 --> 00:25:02.100
you see sort of engagement
across a range of disciplines

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.520
in Islamic studies, so to
talk in any serious way

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.570
about time in Islam is to
engage with art, art history,

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.700
history of science, Koranic studies,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.900
philosophy, theology,
and the list goes on.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.390
So what I'm gonna do
today is confine myself

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.390
to four areas, I'm gonna
highlight intersections

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.060
in terms of the study of the Koran,

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.455
cosmology, some cosmology,

00:25:26.455 --> 00:25:30.660
history of science,
philosophy and mysticism,

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.560
so that's quite a lot for
the little time that I have

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.910
but I'll see what I can do.

00:25:35.838 --> 00:25:40.250
Islam as some of you know was
born in 7th century Arabia.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.550
It's a area that's
populated by pagans, Jews,

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.760
Zoroastrians, and Christians.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.650
And to differentiate
itself in this environment,

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:55.650
Islam thoroughly and
radically redefined time.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.750
For preislamic Arabs,
time and the Arabic word

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.394
or an Arabic word for
time, I should say, is

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:05.229
(speaks foreign language),
for preislamic Arabs,

00:26:05.229 --> 00:26:08.930
(speaks foreign language) was
a cosmic force of its own.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.660
It controlled what we
might say is transient

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.260
earthly happiness, it
ushered an inevitable death,

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.450
and we see an allusion
to this kind of view

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:23.178
in a Koranic verse that says,
they say there is nothing

00:26:23.178 --> 00:26:26.980
but the life of this
world, we die and we live

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.950
and nothing destroys us but time.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:34.540
So in contrast to this,
Islam imposed or asserted

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.700
a theocentric worldview,
a view that there was

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.950
a monotheistic omnipotent
God who was the ultimate

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.030
cause of all aspects of his creation

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.173
and that is referenced in the second

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:50.760
report that I have there, it's attributed

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.710
to the prophet Muhammad,
in addition to this

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.886
theocentric view or
alongside it, I should say,

00:26:56.886 --> 00:27:00.960
there is this notion of an afterlife,

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.880
so Scott Waugh alluded
to it a little while ago,

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.880
but essentially what Islam does
is extend the time horizon,

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:14.640
if you will, of a believer to just

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.610
this is not, it's not just
the life of this world,

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:22.010
but there is an afterlife
to follow and Islam also

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:27.010
preached the idea that faith
and actions were ultimately

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.060
determinants of one's
destiny in the hereafter

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.760
and not just the passage
of time that would control

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.490
one's happiness or sorrow.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.755
Now alongside what I call a
cosmological reconfiguration,

00:27:41.755 --> 00:27:46.755
or as part of it, Islam
introduced a new calendar.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.250
Most of the communities of that time

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.120
adhered to what we might
call a loony solar calendar,

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.480
right, a lunar or solar calendar
that was roughly calibrated

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.592
to the seasons, so I
mean, for us, in the north

00:28:03.592 --> 00:28:05.610
we follow a solar calendar,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.480
for us in the northern hemisphere,

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.130
January is always a winter month,

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.550
it was when I was young, it is now

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.706
and it will be when I am very, very old.

00:28:15.706 --> 00:28:18.130
Islam instituted a lunar calendar,

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:23.080
and it's roughly 11 days
shorter than the solar calendar.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.560
And what that means,
essentially, is that the calendar

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.896
is completely detached or
unmoored from the seasons

00:28:31.896 --> 00:28:34.770
so let's take the example of Ramadan.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.300
The holy month of fasting in Islam,

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.403
when Muslims fast from sunup to sundown.

00:28:41.956 --> 00:28:45.960
In my youth, Ramadan was in the fall,

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.750
right, when the days
are shorter so the time

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.880
that you have to fast is a lot shorter

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:54.566
and now that I am 20, (laughs)

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.133
(audience laughs)

00:28:56.133 --> 00:28:59.350
I won't say how old I am,
Ramadan is in the summer months

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:03.040
when the days are a lot longer and so

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.680
Muslims might fast something
like 16 hours, 17 hours

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.960
of the day, in addition to
this calendrical innovation

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.033
or change,

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.810
there were a whole host
of new rituals that were

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.510
associated with the
religion, so one of them

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.950
is the five daily prayers,
which were set at,

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:27.730
which are recited at set times of the day,

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.100
and they are also recited with a believer

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.390
facing the Kaaba, which
is in the city of Mecca

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:37.200
in Saudi Arabia, the
sacred center of Islam

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.870
and the introduction
of all of these rituals

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:45.370
was against the backdrop of
tremendous Muslim expansion,

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.940
from the 8th to the 16th
century, the Muslim world

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:53.040
expanded or grew out of its
boundaries in Central Arabia.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.080
In the West, it went all the way to Spain,

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.553
in the east, to the borders of
China and so this historical

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.270
moment or these eras,
let's say, were accompanied

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:08.660
by tremendous advances in
sciences and technology,

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.170
the need to navigate across
this incredible expanse of land

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.700
and then for a believer,

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.940
wherever they were, to have
to figure what the time

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.500
of prayer is, when it is,
and how you figure out

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:25.290
where Mecca was or is, resulted
in sort of different types

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.873
of advances in astronomy
and you heard last week

00:30:27.873 --> 00:30:30.852
that astronomy in the
premodern period was the queen

00:30:30.852 --> 00:30:35.852
of sciences, so from about
the ninth to the 16th century,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.683
Muslims were actually leaders
in the area of astronomy.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:45.696
There are incredible astrolabes and clocks

00:30:45.696 --> 00:30:50.490
that were invented in this
time that just testify to

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.827
the Muslim preoccupation with
astronomy, with technological

00:30:53.827 --> 00:30:58.560
advancement and also with
absorbing a whole host of

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.203
cultural influences as Islam expanded.

00:31:03.949 --> 00:31:07.440
One of these people was the polymath

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.230
Al Jezari Ibn al Razzaz,

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.080
Al Jezari, who wrote this marvelous book

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.830
that has been recently
translated from Arabic

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.660
into English, the Book
of Knowledge of Ingenious

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:22.320
Mechanical Devices, and
there are sketches in there

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.510
and plans for all sorts
of incredible devices,

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.488
that employed technologies that were

00:31:28.488 --> 00:31:33.058
really advanced for that
time, in the 13th century,

00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:36.910
12th and 13th century and
one of these ingenious

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.683
mechanical devices was this
awesome elephant clock.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:44.400
It's also called the water
castle clock and it has been

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.990
reconstructed in a mall in
Abu Dhabi, in all places,

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:51.254
so if you're ever there,
you can go see how it works.

00:31:51.254 --> 00:31:53.690
But you can see from the
clock that it incorporates

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:56.260
a number of artistic
influences from across

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:00.740
the Muslim world, there's
allusions to East Asian art,

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.070
and other geographic
regions of the Muslim world

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.680
and I have this very short
video because I am not

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.300
an engineer or a scientist,
I do Islamic studies

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.227
and history, I wouldn't
be able to describe to you

00:32:13.227 --> 00:32:15.790
how this clock works if
I tried so this video

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:19.180
will do it for you, if
you can show the video,

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.780
I don't know if I have
to press something, or.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.440
- [Narrator] This elaborate
clock has a display

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.730
at the top showing the number
of equal hours since sunrise

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:30.721
and marks every half hour
with a wonderful display.

00:32:30.721 --> 00:32:33.530
It measures the passing
of time using a bowl

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.310
which floats on a water tank
hidden inside the elephant's

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.580
belly, the bowl slowly fills with water

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.863
from a hole in its bottom
and sinks every half hour.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.410
When the bowl sinks, it
tugs a series of pullies

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:49.153
and mechanisms connected
to the top of the clock.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:53.930
At the top of the clock, it
tilts a channel of balls,

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:57.110
causing one ball to be
released, this causes

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:00.640
the bird on the top to spin
and causes the hour indicator

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.740
to advance, the ball
travels through the clock,

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.812
falling from a falcon's
beak into a tilting serpent.

00:33:08.812 --> 00:33:12.510
It causes a cymbal to sound
and makes the elephant driver

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.023
beat his drum and the
body of the elephant.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:18.690
As the ball falls out
of the elephant's mouth,

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.890
the floating bowl is pulled back up

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:22.740
and starts filling with water again

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.293
for the next half hour.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.690
- So very impressive, right?

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:32.420
I mean, and there were
other clocks like this.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.640
Across the Muslim world,
actually, and you can get

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.150
a sense of how these were
not just mechanical devices

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.310
meant to tell time, they
were the celebration

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:46.420
of a cosmopolitan global
culture, they had an obsession

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.290
with precision, with
technological advancement

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:53.390
and with incorporating all
kinds of artistic influences.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.640
Now in addition to these what I would say

00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.280
are practical somewhat mundane
concerns of keeping time,

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.440
there were other Muslims who
grappled with more abstract

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:08.440
problems, 9th and 10th century, oh, no.

00:34:08.759 --> 00:34:13.380
9th and 10th century Muslims
engaged with the ideas

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:18.010
of Aristotle and other Greek
philosophers who maintained

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.870
that the world is eternal.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.528
Now this idea actually doesn't sit

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:26.200
quite well, it's not really compatible

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.130
with the notion of creation of a cosmos

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:32.373
at a fixed moment in
time by a creator God.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.060
Muslims at the time who engaged with

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.400
the Hellenic tradition
were really impressed

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.030
with the Hellenic tradition,
they considered Aristotle

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:44.880
to be actually somewhat
of a Muslim philosopher,

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.450
if you will, and they tried
to integrate his thought

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:53.070
into Muslim thought and
philosophers like Avicenna,

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.510
Ibn al Arabi, articulated
a whole host of questions

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.890
and analytical frameworks
for trying to reconcile

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.610
Greek and Islamic
philosophy and they asked

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.540
all sorts of questions, I've
listed a few of them here.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.977
Like what is eternity,
did it exist before God,

00:35:11.977 --> 00:35:16.977
did God create time, does
time exist separate from God?

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.840
As an aspect of his creation,
and obviously I am not

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.367
going to talk about those
philosophical discourses here,

00:35:24.367 --> 00:35:29.160
but I just wanted to sort
of highlight that this area

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.490
that is time and the
philosophical tradition

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.620
and the Muslim philosophical tradition

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.680
is a wonderful way to
explore the shared histories

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.750
and interconnectedness of
Greek and Islamic philosophy.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:44.050
And I will just say in brief
that one of the solutions

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.990
that Muslim philosophers
put forth was that time

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:51.780
was indeed an attribute
of God, a divine attribute

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:55.870
like mercy and reason, they
enumerated a whole host

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.540
of attributes that were divine attributes

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:03.423
and time became one of
them, so obviously for some

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:08.510
Muslim philosophers and
theologians in particular,

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.990
concepts and questions of
time were to be tackled

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.050
through intellectual or mental exertion.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.880
For the last group that I'll talk about,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.240
Muslim mystics, also known as Sufis,

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.362
they took an entirely different angle.

00:36:23.362 --> 00:36:28.362
For Sufis, time was an
experiential challenge,

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:32.710
not an intellectual one,
through rituals that involved

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:37.710
music and dance, Sufis actually
tried to embody eternity

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.680
so I'll give a very
brief explanation here.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.230
In Muslim thought, right,
the creation of Adam

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:49.610
and all of humankind after
him represents what we call

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:52.530
the moment of a primordial covenant

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:56.630
with God, it was a moment
when humanity attested to

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.050
or submitted to divine will
and was in perfect harmony

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:04.270
with it, right, so Sufis
through their rituals

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:09.270
tried to return to that
moment of perfect harmony

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.860
or union with the divine
and they do this through

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.800
a whole host of meditations,
some are just invocations

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.350
that are recited, some are dances,

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:23.350
and one of the most well
known of these Sufi groups

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.730
is that associated with Rumi,
the internationally acclaimed

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.500
Sufi poet and philosopher
and his brotherhood,

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.620
his following, is properly
called the Mevlevi brotherhood,

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:39.620
but is popularly known as
the whirling dervishes.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.170
And so I want to very, very
quickly play 30 seconds

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.409
of this ritual by way of concluding

00:37:47.409 --> 00:37:50.900
and it really doesn't
do justice to the ritual

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.143
which goes on for more than an hour

00:37:53.143 --> 00:37:56.690
but I just want to give
you a sense of how music,

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.780
movement and meditative
focus come together

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.715
in this ritual, do I hit?

00:38:03.715 --> 00:38:06.382
(Arabian music)

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.070
That's very, very short
and doesn't do it justice

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:37.780
but I hope that conveys
a little bit of how

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.829
through this ritual, this
meditation, Sufis aim

00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:44.823
to transcend time and unify,

00:38:45.719 --> 00:38:47.620
each individual attempts
to unify with the divine

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.480
so in kind of through
these broad brushstrokes

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.960
of time in the Koran, in
the history of science

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.803
and philosophy and
mysticism, I hope that I've

00:38:58.803 --> 00:39:03.180
sort of conveyed that there
is no monolithic concept

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.910
of time in Islam, instead,
it's much more appropriate

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:10.880
to see time as something
of a canvas where Muslims

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.940
sort of contemplated and
explored across the sciences,

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.362
arts and humanities, thank you.

00:39:17.362 --> 00:39:20.362
(audience applauds)

00:39:26.196 --> 00:39:27.029
- Oh, yes.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:29.373
Yes, I think so.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.443
Okay.

00:39:39.044 --> 00:39:41.440
(sighs)

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.820
For me, time

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.603
is me.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:50.483
Time is as I move my hand.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.143
Time is between us.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.853
I am time.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.133
We are time.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:03.690
I think

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.163
I might need the lights a little bit down

00:40:06.163 --> 00:40:08.860
because I think that it is
just too bright overall,

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.793
please, thank you.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.270
Yeah, that's better.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.320
All right, I'll read a little.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.730
Many of us consider
ourselves to be storytellers.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.653
Perhaps even mythmakers.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:27.660
And we all know that origin
stories are powerful,

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.240
we need as humans to understand

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.453
who we are, where we come from.

00:40:34.084 --> 00:40:37.420
And to place ourselves
in stories in histories,

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.373
and in time.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.276
My story and interest
in the question of time

00:40:43.276 --> 00:40:45.480
begins in Mexico City,
where I was born and raised

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.660
to parents educated as chemical engineers.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.255
They instilled in me, that was funny?

00:40:53.255 --> 00:40:54.220
(audience laughs)

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.640
Who did it?

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.400
That was very funny because I saw,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.570
because yes, they're chemical engineers.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.900
I heard it back here. (laughs)

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.365
No worries.

00:41:04.365 --> 00:41:05.198
(audience laughs)

00:41:05.198 --> 00:41:08.510
Because I find that funny and

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:12.970
they instilled in me the love of,

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.130
everything that I would
ask, they would answer it

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.240
with the tome of organic
and inorganic chemistry

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.510
but what was wonderful was
that they instilled in me

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:25.750
the love and the fascination
for the natural world.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:29.180
And especially the nature
of matter, its cycles,

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.690
organization, all of its
composition, so in a sense,

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.713
they taught me to see matter in time.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:44.950
I took this photograph in the late 1980s

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:48.930
with my first serious camera
and this is the jungles

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:52.680
in Guatemala, in the border with Mexico

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.427
in an archeological site called
(speaks foreign language).

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.710
And it is (speaks foreign
language) in Maya,

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:03.710
which means great gate and
my family loved going into

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:08.290
archeological digs, it was
the passion of my father,

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:12.980
so so many times I lived just
in the jungle for months,

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.030
listening to the cicadas,
listening to the howler monkeys

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:22.030
and just allowing time to be,
surrounded by this incredible

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.083
jungle.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.000
But also at the same time,
my father would teach me

00:42:31.012 --> 00:42:35.850
about the obsession of the
Maya with time in general

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:39.263
and specifically about the
calendars in astronomy.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.660
How they used three separate
calendars and they were

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:46.830
connected in three cycles
because they were cyclical

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:50.550
calendars, how the Maya
calendar system was not just

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:54.500
a method to track various celestial cycles

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.085
but it was a complex
system used to establish

00:42:57.085 --> 00:43:01.020
which of the many gods
were ruling at each moment

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:04.786
in their lives, the gods
were constantly creating,

00:43:04.786 --> 00:43:09.570
controlling, renewing the
world and all of the beings

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:14.570
within it, so there was a
fluid cyclical map of creation,

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.660
a making and unmaking, a
making and unmaking, and making

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:23.610
and unmaking of all existence continually.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:26.710
So that sense of time
was so instilled in me

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:30.951
that it kind of, the idea of linear time,

00:43:30.951 --> 00:43:34.343
I've had such a hard
time entering my brain.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.740
There was a time that I
literally asked my husband

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.530
what century we were in
because that does not matter,

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:45.973
it doesn't matter in
my everyday and so yes,

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.483
time is gonna be a problem
for me, I already can see it.

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:54.663
Anyway.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.710
Composer Carl Hein Stockhausen said,

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:03.010
we are transistors in the literal sense,

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.670
people always think they are in the world,

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.850
but they never realize they are the world.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:12.040
What Stockhausen means is
that there are no phenomena

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.256
in the natural world that
do not manifest as vibratory

00:44:16.256 --> 00:44:21.240
or rhythmic phenomena,
these vibrations attack us,

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.420
they modulate us, and in the end become us

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.173
so we are time.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:31.770
With some of these ideas in
mind, I created this series

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.140
of works called At Any Given Moment,

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:39.040
which they are captured
with a 16 millimeter camera,

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.550
film camera, so that I
can have a materiality

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:46.010
to the work, they are
captured slightly slower,

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.743
they are 60 frames per second.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.130
And they are just of these
moments where I found

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:56.510
one element that was repeated
and repeated and repeated

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.600
but that the light and its modulation

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.972
created incredible complexity.

00:45:00.972 --> 00:45:04.139
(low vibration noise)

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.693
This is called At Any
Given Moment, Fall One.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.420
And like that I created six in the series.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:23.420
They get exhibited at very
large scale, 22 feet by 19,

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.940
with it's very dark but it's
about one ton of lava rock

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:32.130
and gravel and sand in
front of it, and that again,

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.056
it is I feel that time, I
experience it in my body,

00:45:36.056 --> 00:45:41.056
I need to then create work
that makes me be present

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.203
and have a full embodied experience.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:53.147
I wrote here, I create
work that makes me feel

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:59.000
like I am in the very
instant of the present,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.510
it is so easy to be in
the mind, it is so easy

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.733
to be anywhere else, everywhere else.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.220
And so in this way I also
create a place of repose

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:13.890
of the soul, 20th century
philosopher Henry Bergson

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.883
has had a profound influence
in my life and work.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.963
He believed that time was
neither a real phenomenon,

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.930
a real homogenous medium
nor a mental construct

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:30.460
but possesses what he
referred to as duration.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.180
Duration in Bergson's view was creativity

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:37.283
and memory, as an essential
component of reality.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:41.850
At the core, a lot of his
ideas were thinking in terms

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:46.490
of time rather than space,
the very instant of becoming

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:51.180
is the now, the moment of
action, of the creative act,

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.720
of change, of chance, of
intuition, he said that being

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.000
is in the past and the
present is pure becoming

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.980
so I explored this
through getting a camera

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.830
that was 65 years old, bollocks reflex,

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.290
that I cranked it with
my hand so I could have

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.480
this sense of the apparatus
being an extension of my body

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.830
and therefore I could
not control everything

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:22.450
and thus the possibility
of chance to happen.

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:26.120
The possibility of my being
able to through the film

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.910
perhaps stopping and
going, that I could have an

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:30.653
amorphous sense of the present.

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:37.380
So in a way, my camera and I

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.613
are becoming with each other, oh boy.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.690
I told you, time is gonna be an issue.

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:46.410
It's gonna be an issue, right? (laughs)

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.983
So let me move to the next.

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.200
With this work, I'm then
pushing further this idea

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:58.100
of using the apparatus
as the 16 millimeter

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.223
because it's a thick material
presence that it has.

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:08.060
In a way, this work, and I'm
gonna show you this video.

00:48:10.356 --> 00:48:13.356
(atmospheric music)

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.380
By using the 16 millimeter
camera, I tried to have you

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.750
perhaps begin to see
some of the oscillations

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:25.540
and be aware of its
materiality and so it also

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.570
evokes the idea of looking at looking

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:32.040
and so you can oscillate
in the present moment,

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:35.240
you will see that a lot of
my work, I use 16 millimeter,

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.540
and I'll move to the next.

00:48:39.475 --> 00:48:42.320
And I'm literally not even
halfway, so I'm in trouble.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.280
This work, I'm exploring
infinity, the idea that through

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.780
the fog, the space that surrounds
me, that sometimes I have

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.940
this line, I can just go
and feel like there is

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.600
something is pulling at
the edges of the universe

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.530
and so for me this is an
exploration through light

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:06.080
and void of that nothingness
and there's more photographs

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.990
of this and here, I consider
the journey as a medium

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:12.700
in itself and I have
produced large body of work,

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.923
just looking, going to
extreme and unfamiliar spaces.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:21.270
This work is called
walking, I have learned

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:24.040
that by being in a place,
sometimes waiting 12 hours,

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.190
24 hours, for phenomena
to act differently,

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:31.400
to perhaps show me a moment of otherness,

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.323
I live in a place where I
can perceive more precisely,

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:39.970
and this project, I have
myself, I filmed myself

00:49:40.984 --> 00:49:42.280
walking the earth, the
project's called actually

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:47.280
Walking the Earth, with this work,

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.377
I will end it when I die,
I will go everywhere I go

00:49:51.377 --> 00:49:55.040
and I will film myself
crossing that horizon line.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:58.010
I want to see myself,
perhaps, with a little cane

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.788
but just going and
experience my entire life

00:50:00.788 --> 00:50:02.950
walking the horizon.

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:05.750
French philosopher Michel Surtout argued

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:07.890
that the practice of walking is analogous

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:10.870
to the speech act and
can also be understood

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:15.330
to create a kind of spacing
or syntax in relation to how

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:19.040
things are encountered, walking
and travel are described

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.840
as a form of enunciation
that carries the possibility

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.920
of breathing life,
introducing a temporal beat

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.793
to the narrative.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:36.050
So artistic field work is
the closest to what I do

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:38.600
as an artist in that

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.310
I place myself in a situation
where I go into the field,

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:45.380
I go and experience the
elements, rather than being

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.140
in the studio and trying
to control everything,

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.800
I need to have that relationship
with the environment.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.910
An artistic field work,
then, is where you have

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.180
the introduction of
different fields of study.

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.540
I could be collaborating with

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.480
a geologist, a glaciologist, scientists

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.350
that are exploring the
earth and then whatever

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.710
you bring back, it can be
in any kind of artifact,

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.199
from a film, a video, a book, a poem.

00:51:12.199 --> 00:51:15.100
And with that I have
created, I have traveled

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.540
to Svalbard, to the arctic region,

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.210
following the arctic tern,

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:24.572
and I'm gonna speak about
this project, Circumsolar,

00:51:24.572 --> 00:51:27.900
which is now becoming with.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.450
So if we were before
speaking about this becoming

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:33.750
in the moment of the present of Bergson,

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:36.370
this idea of becoming with so a little bit

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:41.370
of Donna Harroway's idea
of the world in together

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:44.383
with other species, with Circumsolar,

00:51:46.818 --> 00:51:49.520
it's a longterm project
with a growing body

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.240
of artworks that emerge
from my profound love

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.738
of the arctic tern, its
unwavering determination

00:51:55.738 --> 00:51:58.535
and the space it occupies in our earth

00:51:58.535 --> 00:52:01.293
and our imagination.

00:52:02.981 --> 00:52:06.360
Every year, the arctic
tern, a small seabird,

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:10.120
flies from the arctic to the
antarctic and back again,

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.930
making its migratory journey
the longest every recorded.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.180
As a result, the arctic
tern experiences two

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.610
polar summers in a year, which
makes it the only creature

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:22.080
that lives the most daylight,
and that's a little bit,

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.670
you get a sense of its trajectory,

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:26.070
so this is a project that I,

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:28.670
it's a project that again, it might be one

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:30.940
that I will have my entire
life that I'll be doing

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:35.480
this project, this is, I
created a video that focuses on

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:40.480
the arctic tern's mating
and breeding season,

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.680
but the arctic tern is a
canary in the coal mine.

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.853
It is basically,

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:51.240
in 2012 we collaborated
with an ornithologist

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.780
and 90% of the chicks are
dying because of the way

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.023
in which the water is
warming up all around it.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:02.650
And it was exhibited at
Globe that Mark Pally is here

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:06.353
and he was the creative
artistic director of the show.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.640
And you can see it in my website,

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.053
it's called circumsolar migration one.

00:53:14.911 --> 00:53:16.010
(atmospheric music)

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:19.920
And it focuses on the migration of humans,

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.910
of all creatures and that we must be

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:24.275
in movement and in time.

00:53:24.275 --> 00:53:27.275
(atmospheric music)

00:53:28.878 --> 00:53:30.366
And I think I'm just gonna close,

00:53:30.366 --> 00:53:32.316
I'm gonna skip completely two projects.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.730
And then this is an actual clock,

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:43.420
so this is a mural for metro

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:48.250
and it is 96 15 minute intervals

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:51.900
where, and it is going
to be installed in metro

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.840
in about a couple of months,
I just did a dry fit,

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.630
but it is a Day in Los
Angeles, it's 96 moments

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:02.530
of a day in Los Angeles,
it's built out of tile,

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.593
out of very small mosaic.

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:10.306
And that was only a few days
ago which was very exciting.

00:54:10.306 --> 00:54:13.740
So as storytellers and
makers, we have an opportunity

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.100
to change the conversation,
to tell a story in self

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.420
and relation, but not
only at a planetary scale,

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:23.400
but within the history of the universe,

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.650
what American historian
David Christian calls

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:29.570
big history, in the 13.8 billion year

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:31.050
history of the universe

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:35.000
humans have only existed
in the world for 200 years.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.210
As long as we do not have a
sense of this big history,

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.820
it will be very hard
to understand ourselves

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.410
as humans and that we
share urgent problems

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:45.812
that we need to work together with.

00:54:45.812 --> 00:54:47.093
Gracias.

00:54:47.093 --> 00:54:50.093
(audience applauds)

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:00.543
- Thank you.

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:04.560
Good evening, everyone.

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:06.963
All right.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.180
My approach to time

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:16.420
as everyone else's is,
is extremely personal

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.280
and to really

00:55:19.926 --> 00:55:23.180
give an eye into my
research, I have to give you

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:28.180
a little bit of my past and
how my life has impacted

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:32.020
the way that I look at
time so I'd like to start

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:35.260
by just talking about a few things.

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:39.340
Musical time changes
from culture to culture.

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:43.840
Seconds pass by in the same
manner throughout the world,

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:48.840
however, musical time is
reflective of cultural influences

00:55:49.868 --> 00:55:53.170
and expressions, so one
of the things I wanted

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:56.850
to talk about first is
a couple of concerts

00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:00.740
that occurred in New York
city about a month apart

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:05.740
when I was 29 years old, the
first was at Carnegie Hall

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.723
and it was with Winton
Marcellus, Bobby McPheron,

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:14.890
Anthony Davis, a professor at UCSD now,

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:18.490
a dear colleague of mine,
and a number of young

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:22.393
musical masters, it was called
the young lions concert.

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.523
And the music that was
played was modern jazz.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.320
And so one of the points is that

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:38.320
the approach to time,
metrical time, a steady pulse,

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:43.320
was hyper precise and the
way that time was approached,

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:50.470
you could spread your emotions
over that hyper precision,

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.150
but one of the things that
had to occur is the fact

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:59.150
that everybody had to
agree where the time was.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.310
You have to find that
commonality, you have to come

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:08.130
together, and you're taking
in not only what people

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:12.163
are playing technically,
but you're also intaking

00:57:12.163 --> 00:57:16.313
what they are playing emotionally.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:22.810
Okay, the second concert,
I was one of three soloists

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:27.393
at Lincoln Center with
the New York Philharmonic.

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.653
Walked out on the stage.

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:37.040
And amazing experience
and this concert was,

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.853
yeah, I said Lincoln Center.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.810
The conductor gave his
downbeat and the orchestra

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:48.373
came in slightly behind the beat.

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.475
I said, oh, God.

00:57:51.475 --> 00:57:54.308
(audience laughs)

00:57:56.266 --> 00:57:59.473
Thank God I didn't have
to play that first chord,

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.990
but one thing that I knew

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:07.410
because classical music,

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:10.920
a lot of it the time, the way it unfolds,

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.000
the tempo, the pace of it is flexible

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.730
to fit the particular emotions that exist

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:23.510
within the composition so I had to play

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:28.510
in a very different way, I
also had to perceive time

00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:32.260
in a different way than
the experience with

00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:34.610
Winton Marcellus and Bobby McPheron.

00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:37.560
And so on, so musicians, what do we do?

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.430
Composers, what do we do?

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:43.630
We learn different cultural approaches

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:47.270
and we bring them into
what it is that we do

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.993
and I think one other very quick point,

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:54.483
time is like a mystic.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.193
You're chasing it.

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:01.693
You want to learn more.

00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:06.020
You want to understand,

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.500
you want to become more intimate with time

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.421
because the more intimate with time,

00:59:11.421 --> 00:59:16.421
the more profundity that can
exist in your compositions

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:22.390
and also your improvisations,
so with that being said,

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.330
what I would like to do

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.483
is could you play this video please?

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.670
We'll hear a few minutes of
it, I should let you know

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:39.670
this is an incredible Senegalese composer,

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:44.810
Doudou N'diyae Rose and
this is his ensemble

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:48.560
and one of the things that happens,

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:51.305
can you turn it up a little
bit, you got to feel it,

00:59:51.305 --> 00:59:54.803
there you go, he's calling the ensemble,

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:59.842
they're getting up,
he's letting them know,

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:03.717
he doesn't say, okay, the
rehearsal's gonna begin,

01:00:03.717 --> 01:00:07.580
he calls them with the sabar, on the side,

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:11.290
that's what we call a
toe post, that's a short

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:15.559
rhythmical phrase and all of
the music is built around that.

01:00:15.559 --> 01:00:17.976
(drum music)

01:01:14.185 --> 01:01:16.669
The tempo's gonna get a
little faster, just slightly.

01:01:16.669 --> 01:01:19.086
(drum music)

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:50.928
I hated to stop it, oh.

01:01:50.928 --> 01:01:51.761
(audience laughs)

01:01:51.761 --> 01:01:56.670
But you can find it's online,
it's Doudou, D-O-U-D-O-U,

01:01:56.670 --> 01:02:01.070
N, apostrophe, D-I-Y-A-E Rose,

01:02:03.889 --> 01:02:04.722
and it's called the rose rhythm.

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:06.580
Did you hear a lot of
rhythms stacked on top

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.210
of one another?

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:12.640
We call those polyrhythms,
guess what's really important.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.453
The rhythms speak to one another,

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.410
this communication is so essential,

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:22.690
it's such a key part of African music

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:25.830
where you have multiple
rhythms that are speaking

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:28.580
to one another and they're all stacked up

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.453
and they're in communion with one another.

01:02:34.524 --> 01:02:38.600
So let's look at this, when
I think about time in music,

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.100
I think about it primarily in three ways,

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.943
on the level of the individual,

01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:48.580
you can get a wide range of
the most profound aspects

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:52.700
of the human condition
communicated by the way

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.970
you approach the beat,
we're gonna talk about that

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:57.050
with Billie Holiday in a second,

01:02:57.050 --> 01:03:00.140
on the communal level,
you know, it brings groups

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.560
of people together,
that's what you just saw

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:07.560
in that ensemble, they have
agreed upon the pulse, right?

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.690
Otherwise, you stack all
of the rhythms on top

01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:13.020
of one another and it's like,

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.450
it's moving all over the place.

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:17.190
It's not working, you know?

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:21.870
And finally, I perceive it
as a continuous universal

01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:24.170
calibration that allows us to connect

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:27.900
every aspect of creation,
no matter how close or far,

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.370
from micro to macro and infinity.

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:37.370
What I'm trying to say there
is I'm composing pieces now

01:03:37.476 --> 01:03:42.473
that are images from the Hubble telescope,

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:45.580
they're giving me the form.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.310
And if we think back to the
beginning of the 20th century,

01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:54.040
Claude Debussy was buying
Japanese woodcuts in Paris

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.160
because he was so
intrigued with those images

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.339
and he figured out a
way to take those images

01:04:01.339 --> 01:04:06.339
and move those images and
put them in his sound world

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.763
where you could hear Japan
in his orchestral works,

01:04:13.644 --> 01:04:16.200
in his piano music,
isn't that fascinating?

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.560
Now 120 years later,

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.210
I can look at images
of the Hubble telescope

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:26.030
and compose.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:29.080
It always pushes me to new territory

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.260
that I've never discovered before.

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.690
I'm finding new harmonies, new rhythms,

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:37.810
new ways of approaching
form and then I think

01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:42.810
of the rhythm of the
image and the distance.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.180
Okay?

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:47.150
How long does that image,
how much time passes

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:51.230
before that image gets to telescope

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.898
and we can then download it and see it

01:04:53.898 --> 01:04:56.993
and receive these
amazing, powerful lessons?

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.510
Now I have to go to Duke
Ellington because jazz

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:06.990
is a huge part of who
I am, even though now

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:11.260
almost all of my music
is completely notated,

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:13.950
written for classical musicians,

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:17.520
but what I'm trying to do
in my research is taking

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.727
the time of the improviser,
the time of the African

01:05:21.727 --> 01:05:24.810
and the time of people
from all over the world

01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:27.220
that I've had the honor to perform with

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:31.910
and move that into a
fully notated context.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:36.800
And what Ellington said
that was so powerful,

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.633
he says,

01:05:39.868 --> 01:05:44.868
it is music, when he defines
jazz, with an African content

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:48.000
that comes out of an American environment

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.300
so it's all of the
cultures coming together

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.640
and mixing with that African root.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.120
That's what I want to compose,
that's what I'm coming

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.480
out of, and communities
thrive on the ability

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:06.480
to interact within a
shared internal pulse.

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:08.700
How can this shared pulse be organized,

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:12.620
how does it function, how
does its function change

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:17.300
from one culture to another,
really intriguing questions

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:22.300
and we talked a little
bit about a lot of African

01:06:22.758 --> 01:06:27.758
derived music has sort of
what they call a clave,

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:33.731
right, a key, so you have a rhythm like

01:06:33.731 --> 01:06:36.898
(claps hands in beat)

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.450
Have you heard that before?

01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:42.300
Okay.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:45.100
It's called a (speaks
foreign language), the music

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:48.280
is structured around that,
it holds it together,

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.650
you can add all of the elements to

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.650
the basic rhythms that you're building on,

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:03.650
as Doudou N'diyae Rose went
to the side of the drum

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:06.970
to give the clave for that piece.

01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:10.053
Then the other rhythms were
able to stack on top of it.

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:14.450
That's an amazing thing about this music.

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:18.833
So now, this is Doudou
N'Dyiae Rose right here,

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.930
a great master, one of the great composers

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:27.620
in the 20th century and the
beginning of the 21st century,

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:32.613
and he left us about, yeah,
he died in, I mean, 2015.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.383
Now.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.619
This is it right here.

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:40.280
(audience laughs)

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.933
This is the stuff.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:43.893
Okay.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:49.571
I gotta rush, so that means
that I'm going to have to

01:07:49.571 --> 01:07:52.263
talk you through this very quickly.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.080
What Billie Holiday did and
please go and listen to her,

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.383
we won't have time to play,

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.583
I'm gonna ask you to stand
up real quick, real quick.

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:10.483
I want you to lean forward.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.393
Do you feel the energy like you
want to go forward like tat?

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.003
That's ahead of the beat.

01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:21.110
(audience laughs)

01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:26.110
You become anxious, you're
really excited about something.

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:31.612
I always use the image of two
people that love each other

01:08:31.612 --> 01:08:34.240
so strongly and they
haven't seen each other

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.310
in three months and they're
running towards each other

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:39.890
in the airport, okay, that's a good one.

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:43.380
On the beat, you go to concerts, let's say

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:46.241
you're going to a hiphop
concert, a funk concert

01:08:46.241 --> 01:08:49.150
and you see the heads
all moving to the tempo,

01:08:49.150 --> 01:08:51.720
everybody's bodies moving,
all the students know

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.720
what I'm talking about, right,

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.513
that gives you a sense of
community, you all come together,

01:08:58.363 --> 01:08:59.750
you want to be one.

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:01.890
You know, and that's really important.

01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:04.623
Now I want you to just lean back slightly.

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:09.903
Sadness.

01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:11.783
Tragedy.

01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:16.363
pain, sorrow.

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:22.440
Billie Holiday would
start a phrase like this

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.683
and by the time she got
to the end of one phrase,

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:28.333
she was like that.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:35.980
And that had to do with her
incredible sophistication

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:40.750
and number crunching and
having this hyper sensitive

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:45.210
relationship to the beat
where she can really play

01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:47.713
and toy with the emotions.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.840
I wish I could play you some of my music,

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.427
but I'm out of time.

01:09:53.427 --> 01:09:54.543
(audience groans)

01:09:54.543 --> 01:09:57.793
- Please, let's play it, let's play it.

01:09:58.889 --> 01:10:00.551
(audience applauds)

01:10:00.551 --> 01:10:04.490
- Okay, I'll do it really
quickly, I feel like

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:05.983
I should play Billie Holiday.

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:15.143
I'll play you a little
bit of Amazing Grace.

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:21.060
Some pieces, I'm torn between
that and the Orion Nebula.

01:10:22.292 --> 01:10:23.800
(audience laughs)

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.823
But I guess I'll go traditional.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.680
This arrangement came when

01:10:31.714 --> 01:10:35.670
the tragedy happened at
Emmanuel AME in Charleston.

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:39.050
And President Obama, the
president at that time,

01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:43.783
sang Amazing Grace at the
funeral of Clementa Pinkly.

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:47.490
How many of you remember that moment?

01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:51.620
A number of you do, I was
so moved by that moment

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:55.370
that I wrote an arrangement
for string orchestra

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.493
of Amazing Grace and we
recorded it and can you please

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.273
hit the audio?

01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:11.208
And it's in time, but
it gives you the feeling

01:11:12.333 --> 01:11:14.119
that it's not in time.

01:11:14.119 --> 01:11:18.452
(string version of "Amazing Grace")

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:32.699
Okay, thank you.

01:13:32.699 --> 01:13:35.699
(audience applauds)

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:39.273
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

01:13:39.273 --> 01:13:42.273
(audience applauds)

01:13:49.648 --> 01:13:51.480
- Fantastic, each of you, thank you,

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.179
all four presentations,
just spectacular together

01:13:55.179 --> 01:13:59.640
and with an idea that
with the time we have,

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.210
we're gonna open the
conversation to everybody

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:03.740
in the room in just a moment, I thought,

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.640
prior to doing that, if
there was anything that might

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.060
resonate across the presentations
as you listened to them

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.480
that you'd want to speak about first.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.490
I think I'm incredibly
struck by which the extent

01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:17.340
to which each of you
presented this idea of time

01:14:19.283 --> 01:14:21.919
as a kind of experience, maybe
in the most extreme version

01:14:21.919 --> 01:14:24.730
as you said with the Sufi and mystic idea

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:28.230
that time is a part of our
experience of the world

01:14:29.487 --> 01:14:30.710
and each of you touch on this
in really interesting ways,

01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:34.510
historical, personal, in
terms of it being a part

01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:35.750
of a world to arrange,

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:38.530
I'm curious if there's
anything in the presentations

01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:41.610
that you were thinking of
as someone else might have

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:44.843
been talking about their
own ideas or experiences.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.870
- Yeah, I mean, I think
that one of the things

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:50.960
that really stood out of me of course

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.960
is that we are under
this time regime, now,

01:14:56.330 --> 01:15:00.412
I mean, we are very much
disciplined by time.

01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:03.810
We are told to live by
it, but it seems to me

01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:07.856
that other cultural constructions of time

01:15:07.856 --> 01:15:12.070
that we have heard about
here actually allow

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:16.150
in different ways much more
of that, a fuller experience

01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:17.793
of time as it were.

01:15:18.868 --> 01:15:22.790
Through music or photography
or the mystical experience

01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:25.970
where you can actually be in the moment

01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:30.080
in ways that our time
regiment here doesn't allow us

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.140
to be in the moment so
all of these presentations

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.776
really help me think about
those cultural constructions

01:15:36.776 --> 01:15:38.193
of time.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.370
- And for me, for
example, it was incredible

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:47.000
how we can be talking
about time but the moment

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.700
that we actually feel
it, is like, the moment

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:54.150
that you started playing
the piece, not only

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:57.920
I was very aware of
what you became, right,

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.350
because you suddenly was like, it was like

01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:05.280
you were inhabited by the
time that we're talking about

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:07.530
and I entered into a different place,

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:10.800
it's as if there is only
a very limited part of us

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.040
that exists when we are
speaking about something

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:16.370
and then we become something
so different when we allow

01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:18.830
ourselves to actually experience it fully

01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:22.040
with our entire body and
then we are in that present

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.920
and then we become and then we're creative

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:29.113
so I think that that was so,
so clear that I felt that.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.460
- One thing I really learned
is that from everyone's

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:39.460
presentation is that we
can step out of the time

01:16:40.065 --> 01:16:42.613
that we feel constricted to.

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:49.120
And live in other ways, I think
in everyone's presentation

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:53.329
and sometimes it's
connected to God, you know,

01:16:53.329 --> 01:16:57.490
as you were speaking
about the feast and so on

01:16:57.490 --> 01:17:00.790
and being gathered around
this and also thinking

01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:03.290
about Rumi and

01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:07.853
just how all of us,

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:11.560
a lot of times it connects
to God, the different ways

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.080
that we see God, and then

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:20.080
just this gift of realizing
that we have to get off

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.720
of this conveyor belt that's
just going too darn fast

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.040
right now, occasionally and
figure out another way to go

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.550
and how do we access
it, how do we get there,

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:34.500
from what I learned in
everyone's presentation,

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.140
is that there are a number
of avenues available

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:42.090
for that experience.
- Yep.

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.580
- Yeah, the number of different cultural

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.310
and historical frames
by which to understand

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:48.750
that experience, Scott, one
of the things you touched on

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:53.750
in your summary of it kind
of agrarian preindustrial

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:57.810
notion of time as a
lived experience is that

01:17:57.810 --> 01:18:00.760
there was a kind of
unifying, what emerges as

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.944
a kind of unifying of
work routines and tasks

01:18:03.944 --> 01:18:08.850
and behavior or social
life to a great degree

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:12.900
and one of the things that
that begs is questions

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:16.340
around the limits of that
as a kind of project,

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.480
the Fitbit being maybe the
current contemporary example

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:22.310
but the sort of broader
question that it opens up

01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:25.397
about the ways in which we
can each not just individually

01:18:25.397 --> 01:18:28.880
imagine ways to step out
of time but also maybe

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.850
in larger collective or social settings.

01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:35.086
- Well, I think that it's important to,

01:18:35.086 --> 01:18:35.919
in that respect, I would look
at the sort of university

01:18:39.416 --> 01:18:41.320
and if you think about
the university, actually,

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:46.146
it has different time
regimens and there is

01:18:46.146 --> 01:18:48.280
a kind of factory time which
staff and administration

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.000
experience, which is governed by the clock

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.853
and governed by very strict time.

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.320
Then there is student time,
which, whether you like

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.890
it or not is kind of
premodern, you do the tasks,

01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:04.560
you can go to class, you
don't have to go to class,

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.270
you don't do the, you
don't read each chapter

01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:09.090
according to time, but you kind of do it

01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:11.270
at the last minute at two AM.

01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:14.010
So there's a kind of
rhythm that is dictated

01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:16.280
by the work that you do
and then there's, I think,

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.070
what's most fascinating is
faculty time which is...

01:19:20.385 --> 01:19:22.920
I've always felt that the
one thing that the university

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.420
has do above all,

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:28.017
its main mission is to
protect in our world,

01:19:28.017 --> 01:19:30.847
the modern world, the time for reflection.

01:19:30.847 --> 01:19:34.140
It's the most precious commodity,

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.630
and reflection, I think,
is a kind of timelessness

01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:40.700
in our culture where there's a bubble

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.738
where you let your mind
go, you be in the moment

01:19:43.738 --> 01:19:47.320
and I think we've seen
really superb examples

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.710
of what happens when
people reflect and are able

01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:53.460
to use that reflection
to express something.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.680
But that's not factory or industrial time,

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:58.160
it's not Fitbit time
or whatever it might be

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.080
and I think if you think about

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.780
what the use of the university is,

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.630
it encompasses all those things

01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:08.320
and that's what, you know, I
think is especially valuable

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.153
and you've seen brilliant
examples of just what it is

01:20:12.153 --> 01:20:16.310
that that use of time does.

01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:19.210
I don't like the term use of time because

01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:22.780
I don't think, these
people, you're using time,

01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:25.230
you're using your reflection, so anyway,

01:20:25.230 --> 01:20:27.430
that's random thoughts.

01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:30.320
- Another really striking
convergence across

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.252
the presentations for me was the ways

01:20:33.252 --> 01:20:35.807
in which you in different
moments touched on

01:20:35.807 --> 01:20:38.430
a kind of infinite time,
what you thought of

01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:40.970
as eternity or eternal time,

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:42.810
and I wonder to the extent of which that,

01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:45.430
I'm curious about that as
an idea in your own lives

01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:47.840
and how you see the work you're doing now

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.640
in the longer arc of a
career or a form of research

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:55.399
or an ongoing project and how
you've experimented with that

01:20:55.399 --> 01:20:57.955
over the course of your careers.

01:20:57.955 --> 01:21:00.455
(Asma laughs)

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:05.320
- I mean, it's interesting, for me,

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.790
I mean, I think for all
academics, we think about

01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:11.770
our writing and our research,
our scholarly production

01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:14.880
as something that will
enable us to connect

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.390
with an eternal, right,
your writings outlive you,

01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:20.480
your works and that, your
compositions outlive you,

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:24.490
right, but I have to say
that that is something

01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:28.060
that I only think about
when really pushed to it.

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:30.170
I mean, the moments in
which I actually think

01:21:30.170 --> 01:21:33.550
about eternity is when I think
about Islamic philosophy,

01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:37.500
for example, I mean, it really
is a very abstract notion

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.130
for me and that's why it
was interesting for me

01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:45.130
to think about the Muslim
mystics and the ways in which

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:50.350
through a particular ritual,
I mean, there is this idea

01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:52.510
that you can actually experience eternity,

01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:54.373
I mean, you can experience time,

01:21:55.561 --> 01:21:57.270
you can experience the
past through the present,

01:21:57.270 --> 01:22:02.220
and a future moment of happiness

01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:06.150
through this, through an
embodiment, through a ritual

01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:09.740
so I found that interesting
but beyond that I have to say

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:12.740
university time, I am
very much in the moment,

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:15.541
what do I have to do next, right,

01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:17.260
there's a time panel I have to go to

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:20.430
and then there's a reception,
so I think that's how

01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:23.713
most of our days are lived. (laughs)

01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:28.140
- I think that in a few projects, I have

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:34.151
looked for that specific idea of infinity,

01:22:34.151 --> 01:22:37.560
like you see those photographs
and then the nothing further

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:42.010
happens video in which I am
really kind of meditating

01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:46.740
on the idea of the sublime but
in terms of the disappearance

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:50.820
of oneself or that connection
of oneself with the earth

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:53.270
so it's truly the dissolution of

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:56.830
a sense of individuality
and becoming matter

01:22:56.830 --> 01:23:01.385
and becoming more universal and I think

01:23:01.385 --> 01:23:05.410
of, you know, when I
think of the universe,

01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:06.657
when I think of (speaks foreign language),

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:11.627
this incredible understanding
that we have of everything,

01:23:11.627 --> 01:23:14.210
there's the corners of
it, it's when I think

01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:17.530
of that infinity but
it does not include me

01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:21.010
as a human as much, right,
it includes it as thought

01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:24.010
because immediately I
come back like a yoyo

01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:26.730
and come back to extinction
and what we're doing

01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:31.730
with the planet and that I
don't see us as living beings,

01:23:31.785 --> 01:23:34.963
with that sense of, you know,

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.520
unlimited existence.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:41.900
On the other hand, it
really puts me exactly at,

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:45.820
what was it that the
humans existed only in

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:49.070
what's the equivalent
of the last millimeter

01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:52.970
of the last square of a toilet paper roll?

01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:56.370
Right, we consider the
existence of the universe,

01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:59.670
that little little little thing is us.

01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:04.170
So when I think infinity,
I think more geologically

01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:07.980
and universal, not necessarily
as existence as humans,

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:11.563
and so therefore I do feel
immediately, boom, our finality.

01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:16.930
- First of all, even before I comment,

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:21.150
I want to say how moved
I was by your images.

01:24:21.150 --> 01:24:24.810
The images of infinity
were just so touching,

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:28.073
I just want to stand over
here and start crying.

01:24:28.073 --> 01:24:30.030
(audience laughs)

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:34.403
And from everyone, it's
just been a really beautiful

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:36.383
profound experience.

01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:41.200
I have to say I'm thinking
about eternity daily

01:24:42.319 --> 01:24:44.550
and the reason

01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:48.173
is twofold.

01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:51.883
My faith is my life.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.093
And

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:58.940
it impacts everything that I try to do.

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.800
When I come to this institution

01:25:01.643 --> 01:25:06.643
to give the best of what I
have, my faith informs me.

01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:10.443
When I go home and I
have the time to compose,

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:13.513
it's an offering to God.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.593
And I feel that when I'm
in that room, I'm visited.

01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:24.663
And

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.893
it, the visitation informs the music.

01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:33.240
The visitation guides the music,

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.573
it leads the music.

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.640
And I set texts from the Old Testament,

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.950
the New Testament, I've

01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:45.640
sort of turned my back
on the commercial world

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:50.413
years ago, and this is the
only thing I want to do.

01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:55.080
And I just came back from a
conference at the Vatican.

01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:00.080
I was invited by the head
of culture for the Vatican

01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:05.590
and the conference was amazing,
people from 36 countries

01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:09.490
coming together to talk about music,

01:26:09.490 --> 01:26:10.323
and God.

01:26:10.323 --> 01:26:13.070
Words and God.

01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:17.610
And you come back from
that experience and being

01:26:17.610 --> 01:26:21.263
at Assisi, you know, where
Saint Francis is buried,

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.513
and I think about Mahalia Jackson,

01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:33.606
the great gospel singer
who could have sang

01:26:33.606 --> 01:26:37.940
any music that she wanted
to, including opera

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:41.140
and so many other forms,
but everything she did

01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:45.050
was an offering to God, so
I figured I was so crazy

01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:48.080
and so bad when I was young,
I've got to do better now.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.913
(audience laughs)

01:26:52.710 --> 01:26:55.397
- Wonderful, I think it's
time for us to open up

01:26:55.397 --> 01:26:56.560
the conversation to everybody in the room,

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.393
if we can do that.

01:26:57.393 --> 01:26:59.933
We've got a couple of
microphones in the room.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:07.493
I see a question right
up here up front, yep,

01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:10.353
if we can get a microphone over here.

01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.960
- Oh, okay, hello, so I think you guys

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.600
all gave like a very marvelous,
like, summary of your own

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.724
idea of time which I was
really moved by each and every

01:27:27.724 --> 01:27:30.376
single one of them, but I was wondering,

01:27:30.376 --> 01:27:31.720
time is such a vast topic,
like, anyone could agree

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.380
that time is vast and they usually take,

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.724
like if you ask someone with
all of these 10 questions

01:27:35.724 --> 01:27:37.130
that you ask, like what
is time, what is beauty,

01:27:37.130 --> 01:27:39.480
what is space and everyone
kind of pauses for a second

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.710
and they don't know quite how to answer,

01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:43.160
would you agree that
one of the reasons why

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:47.010
it's very difficult to, I
don't know, express or define

01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:50.630
or give a very like clear
answer to what is time

01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:53.440
is because we as humans
don't have enough time

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:57.390
to even begin to like start explaining

01:27:57.390 --> 01:28:00.326
what we're trying to say
and how was it that you guys

01:28:00.326 --> 01:28:03.201
managed to summarize all of these things,

01:28:03.201 --> 01:28:04.170
because I noticed some
of you were like trying

01:28:04.170 --> 01:28:05.650
to rush through and I could
tell you didn't want to

01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:07.730
but how did you manage
to crunch it all into

01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:09.943
like a small space of speaking time?

01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:13.994
- Obviously, I failed.

01:28:13.994 --> 01:28:16.340
(audience laughs)

01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.083
It seems that mine went on and on.

01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:22.643
Well.

01:28:24.630 --> 01:28:28.520
I think that it's just
the moment that you know

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:33.110
that you're basically having
a glimpse at something,

01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:36.253
I mean, really, even what we said,

01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:39.110
it's a glimpse of

01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:42.770
what someone can be doing
the rest of their life.

01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:47.110
I mean, I think that for some
of us, our thinking of time

01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:51.790
has really been all our lives
and so now it's more like

01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:55.320
okay, let's kind of, like
a lick of a cat, like,

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.347
that's what you got because
that's very, very little,

01:28:58.347 --> 01:29:01.570
but it's...

01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:03.940
For me, it's like being
in, trying to figure out

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:06.123
what does it mean to me in this instant.

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:11.010
- Anyone else about the
panel on this question

01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:12.660
about how did you do it,
how did you get it down

01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:14.023
to 10 minutes?

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.850
- Well, look, I mean,
I don't have an answer

01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:18.660
for how did I get it down to 10 minutes,

01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.767
but just to continue on
something that we touched on

01:29:21.767 --> 01:29:25.150
before, I have to confess
that when I first received

01:29:25.150 --> 01:29:30.150
this invitation, the only
thing that came to my mind were

01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:34.490
jokes about Pakistani standard
time and Middle Eastern

01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:35.780
standard time.
(audience laughs)

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:39.116
That's like what you use when
you're always late, right?

01:29:39.116 --> 01:29:41.199
- That is so funny.
- But.

01:29:42.396 --> 01:29:45.600
I know, I thought what am
I gonna say for 10 minutes?

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:49.890
But it really was an
opportunity for me to explore

01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:52.850
all of these
interdisciplinary connections,

01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:55.840
some of which I was unaware
of, I was mostly aware

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:00.040
of time and Islamic
philosophy, but I thought

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.527
one of the things that I
want to do in this panel

01:30:02.527 --> 01:30:07.527
is to show the interdisciplinary
nature of engagement

01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:10.870
with time across a religious civilization

01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:13.710
and I thought, what are some of the things

01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:18.710
that I can pick that would
be appropriate for this type

01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:20.710
of a setting and how
can I just get it down

01:30:20.710 --> 01:30:24.006
to two minutes per thing, so yeah.

01:30:24.006 --> 01:30:25.820
- [Moderator] Wonderful.

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:29.140
- I chose the three musical
examples sort of first

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:30.740
and then started thinking about it more,

01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:33.170
did any of you have a chance
to listen to the musical

01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:35.713
examples, a few of you did, great.

01:30:38.112 --> 01:30:41.463
I also wanted to include
Japanese gagaku music

01:30:42.819 --> 01:30:47.819
because there is a sense
of floating at times

01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:51.080
about how the music unfolds.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:56.080
And the deep meditation that
the music is based on in part

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.740
and just the profundity of the sound

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:05.091
and at times it's almost
like the sound is swirling

01:31:05.091 --> 01:31:09.135
in the room and if you
get that kind of feeling,

01:31:09.135 --> 01:31:13.057
you're going to go
somewhere else very quickly.

01:31:13.057 --> 01:31:14.602
(audience laughs)

01:31:14.602 --> 01:31:17.190
You know, and how that
happens all over the world

01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:21.340
has really fascinated me
so then after thinking

01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:26.340
of the three musical examples,
it was more trying to not

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.933
spread too wide.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:34.667
And just try to keep it fairly
focused and I also failed.

01:31:34.667 --> 01:31:36.701
(audience laughs)

01:31:36.701 --> 01:31:38.730
- No you didn't.
- Not at all.

01:31:38.730 --> 01:31:40.343
- It's hard, it's really hard.

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:42.613
- Yes please.

01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:48.720
- Again, I really enjoyed
the talk and it reminded me

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.810
a lot about some of the
elements that came up

01:31:50.810 --> 01:31:55.450
in last week's with
space and my question is

01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:59.000
do you see time, especially
since your disciplines,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.620
time in some ways, is
it the canvas on which

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.770
you do your work as a
musician, as a photographer,

01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:08.910
as a filmmaker, as a
historian, or is time itself

01:32:10.110 --> 01:32:14.900
a tangible thing or is it
just a relationship of ideas

01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:18.630
and do you see it as
a very objective thing

01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:21.300
or a subjective thing, where does it lie?

01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:23.380
And also I just wanted to
chide you for not having

01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.688
your astrophysicist here
because if you're going talk

01:32:25.688 --> 01:32:29.500
about time, so just, that relationship,

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:33.713
do you see time as some
actual tangible thing?

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.910
- Yes.
- Yeah, sure.

01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:42.773
- There's a great blues
line by Robert Johnson.

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:47.740
And it starts, I woke up this morning

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:50.690
and I saw the blues
walking down the street

01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:54.393
just like a man, what a
blues, gimme your right hand.

01:32:55.890 --> 01:33:00.487
So the rhythm of the lyric, you know,

01:33:00.487 --> 01:33:03.280
he's giving you a tangible
image, he's taking the blues

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:08.280
and he's turning it into a
person and all of that happens

01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:13.120
while he is singing with one
rhythm, playing rhythm guitar,

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.900
with another rhythm
and playing lead guitar

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:20.900
with another rhythm, so just think about

01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:22.363
what you'd have to do.

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:28.393
To have your brain do all
of that at the same time.

01:33:31.596 --> 01:33:32.942
You know?

01:33:32.942 --> 01:33:35.670
And so it's tangible and it's also

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.193
abstract, both.

01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:45.290
- Wonderful, let's carry on
with the, yes, right here.

01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:46.880
Sorry, don't mean to be
in one area of the room,

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.820
we're gonna spread it
out a little bit, but.

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:52.150
- Hi, thank you all for speaking.

01:33:52.150 --> 01:33:55.370
My question is directed
mostly to the two artists

01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:58.050
on the panel and I was
just curious, the thing

01:33:58.050 --> 01:34:00.930
that struck the most
about what everyone said

01:34:00.930 --> 01:34:03.620
but specifically the two of you was time

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:06.183
or art as a way of
stepping outside of time

01:34:06.183 --> 01:34:09.400
and the sort of constraining
element that our modern

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.870
conception of that has on our daily lives

01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:14.590
and I was curious, though, that even,

01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:17.030
we see art as a sort of
profession that exists

01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:19.160
outside of that, but it does still exist

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.390
in a capitalistic art market,

01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:23.856
that has a demand for
labor and trade and time

01:34:23.856 --> 01:34:27.750
and so I'm curious about how you at, like,

01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:30.830
in your practices, how
you guys deal with that,

01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:33.283
if you have any strategies or advice?

01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:38.330
- I mean, it's an interesting
thing in terms of,

01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:40.980
it's almost like I want
to answer a combination

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:45.980
of how do I experience
time because so many times

01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:48.590
in my life somebody has come and said,

01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:51.823
well, what you do is
like, it's not real life,

01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:54.920
it's just, and all I can think is well,

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.270
you make the life you want.

01:34:57.270 --> 01:35:01.010
And so in terms of the

01:35:01.930 --> 01:35:04.442
living or being, you know,

01:35:04.442 --> 01:35:09.150
is time a real thing, is like
as I mentioned in my talk,

01:35:09.150 --> 01:35:13.557
it's like I am time, so
it's as real as I can be

01:35:13.557 --> 01:35:16.350
and I can be real sometimes
and I can be very unreal

01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:20.440
at other times so it's so much about

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:21.310
where

01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:25.150
what you want to do with your life,

01:35:25.150 --> 01:35:27.880
how do you schedule it,
then you cannot say,

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.190
when I have time, I'm going to do art

01:35:30.190 --> 01:35:32.300
or when I have time, no.

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.740
It is what it is, it's
like I cannot help it,

01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:37.887
I have to be making it, otherwise it is

01:35:37.887 --> 01:35:42.010
like there is no air inside
of me so you have to live it,

01:35:42.010 --> 01:35:44.880
breathe it, on the other
hand, is there a time

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.570
where I can actually step
out and stick to a timeline

01:35:48.570 --> 01:35:51.890
like for a talk, right, so
for me, I have the other

01:35:53.210 --> 01:35:58.210
problem, is that can I actually
step to do certain things

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:03.283
that are very pragmatic and
that I really would be measured,

01:36:03.283 --> 01:36:06.623
it's like no, it's all
fluidity and sometimes

01:36:06.623 --> 01:36:10.090
even in paying a bill right
here and I'm making art

01:36:10.090 --> 01:36:13.990
right here, and it's just,
I'm more like this thing

01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:16.514
and (makes silly noises).

01:36:16.514 --> 01:36:18.540
(audience laughs)

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:19.977
- I love it.

01:36:19.977 --> 01:36:23.790
- That is, there isn't such a
thing as compartmentalization

01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:26.643
when you are an artist, I think, yeah.

01:36:28.176 --> 01:36:31.176
(audience applauds)

01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:35.953
- It's about your self
discovery as an artist.

01:36:37.450 --> 01:36:39.870
And really finding out who you are

01:36:40.710 --> 01:36:45.410
and what you have to say
that differentiates you

01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:48.630
from every other artist on
the planet and trying to be

01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:52.620
as great as you possibly
can, so many people think

01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:55.970
about the business of art and visual art.

01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:59.680
It's such a big deal now with the people

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.740
that have made a lot of
money from the stock market

01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:04.240
going and investing in art that becomes

01:37:05.230 --> 01:37:06.910
very fashionable.

01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:09.540
Then they run on to someone
else and someone else

01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:11.943
so if you aim for the timeless,

01:37:13.491 --> 01:37:14.683
you are free.

01:37:15.565 --> 01:37:17.100
(audience applauds)

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.487
- That's beautiful, yes, yes, yes.

01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:23.853
- Wonderful, over on this
side, I see a hand, yep.

01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.380
- I'd like to say thank you all again

01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:35.170
and to you, what role
does timelessness play

01:37:35.170 --> 01:37:37.053
in the scheme of time?

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.640
- I'm sorry, was that?

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.470
- I think that's open
to anyone on the panel.

01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:51.050
What role does timelessness
play in your own lives

01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:51.933
or your own work?

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.650
- I mean, you just said it, it's freedom.

01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:01.523
- It is freedom.

01:38:01.523 --> 01:38:04.070
- That, I mean, it's...

01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:14.080
- I mean, one thing that I
realized from this panel is

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:19.313
that musicians, artists,

01:38:22.355 --> 01:38:24.240
people who live in the
creating realm in ways

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.410
different from what I do is

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:32.070
are those who really
experience time and probably

01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:35.590
timelessness far more
fully that I have ever

01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:38.740
had the blessing to do so because for me,

01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:41.200
time is essentially, it's a clock,

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.950
it's something that ultimately
can be very oppressive

01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:50.740
and so to think about
experiencing timelessness

01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:53.440
as I think you both have is not something

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.928
that I have given much time
to, I have to say. (laughs)

01:38:57.928 --> 01:38:59.200
- Well, probably,

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.470
I think that's probably not entirely true

01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:03.580
because I think that one of the things is

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:06.150
time becomes oppressive in our society,

01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:09.422
I mean, it goes back to the question of

01:39:09.422 --> 01:39:14.010
the young woman asked,
it is constantly present,

01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:16.500
you are constantly reminded of
it whether you like it or not

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.780
and you're constantly trying
to configure your life

01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:21.706
against it or whatever it
is because of deadlines

01:39:21.706 --> 01:39:24.270
or because of needs and so the project

01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:26.967
of stepping out of time
becomes I think priceless

01:39:26.967 --> 01:39:29.970
and I think that can happen
in many different ways.

01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:32.920
It's living in the moment,
where there is no time,

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.920
where time is eternal, which
are perhaps synonymous,

01:39:38.530 --> 01:39:41.670
or living in a state of
rhythm where you lose a sense

01:39:41.670 --> 01:39:46.484
of not the, you're so immediate in timing

01:39:46.484 --> 01:39:49.520
that you lose a sense
of the larger context

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.920
so I think that notion,
I think we all aspire

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.970
to stepping out of time,
of not being oppressed

01:39:54.970 --> 01:39:56.543
and finding ways in which we can do that.

01:39:56.543 --> 01:40:00.010
You can do it in reading,
you know, when you're really

01:40:00.010 --> 01:40:03.583
studying about something,
you can lose where you are.

01:40:03.583 --> 01:40:06.730
I mean, I can go into an
archive and spend a day there

01:40:06.730 --> 01:40:10.663
and forget how, it's not dictated
by the hours I was there,

01:40:10.663 --> 01:40:13.790
it's dictated by the project,
and it's that project

01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:17.530
which is, I mean, it's boring
and tedious for everybody else

01:40:17.530 --> 01:40:21.200
but for me it was fantastic, and

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.600
so I think that that's, I think we all,

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.070
and I think that's the modern
dilemma in a lot of ways

01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:29.010
is trying to find that
way in which you're not

01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:31.860
oppressed by time which time
is not dictating everything

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:35.553
you're doing and the more you can do that,

01:40:35.553 --> 01:40:39.240
I think the better off
you are but it's singular.

01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:43.100
It can be through music,
it can be through art,

01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:46.440
it can be through
scholarship, it can be through

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.650
sitting in the park, I
don't know, but I think

01:40:49.650 --> 01:40:52.269
that becomes a project
for all of us which is

01:40:52.269 --> 01:40:54.860
to not become enslaved by time,

01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:58.410
because it is the modern dilemma.

01:40:58.410 --> 01:41:00.680
- And can I just add
to this because I think

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.150
that as we're thinking about
it, it just occurred to me

01:41:03.150 --> 01:41:08.150
that for me, it is the
creative act, feels timeless,

01:41:09.745 --> 01:41:14.745
intuition feels timeless and
it is, it comes in leaps,

01:41:15.090 --> 01:41:18.920
it's not that you build
towards it, sometimes you can

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.820
create the conditions and not get there

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:24.790
and sometimes you're washing
dishes and you have that

01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:28.580
moment of boom, almost
like a knowing and totality

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:33.580
or something that just feels,
ah, it's as if this opens up.

01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:39.400
And so timeless, it has no measure,

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:44.400
it more is an intensity
and I do think that I feel

01:41:44.436 --> 01:41:47.850
that that intensity can
happen at any moment.

01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:51.410
Sometimes it just doesn't
happen in an artist's residency

01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:54.550
of two months and
sometimes it really happens

01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:58.610
when I am petting my cat,
so when does it happen,

01:41:58.610 --> 01:42:02.110
when does that creative moment
happen, so that I would say

01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:03.383
is the timeless for me.

01:42:06.293 --> 01:42:11.293
- Up top in the middle here, there's, yep,

01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:14.683
right here in the middle, sorry,
bringing a microphone over.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.000
- My question follows
kind of along the lines of

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.890
the gentleman earlier
about the astrophysicist,

01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:27.360
but an observation I have was
a lot of the presentations

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.300
kind of

01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:35.290
saw time through kind of a
human perspective as a stage

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:40.200
or a measuring tool to how we
organize or measure our lives

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.740
or humanity, either our
personal interactions with

01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:46.040
our lives or

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:50.883
how humanity organizes from
more the other side, again,

01:42:51.717 --> 01:42:53.633
as art, the lady said,

01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:57.770
humanity's just the very
end of the toilet paper roll

01:42:57.770 --> 01:43:02.770
but as time being the
whole entity of eternity,

01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:09.120
that's a separate perspective,

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.550
I wonder if you have
anything to comment on

01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:15.480
the different types of time, like I said,

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.721
we've been focusing more on the human,

01:43:17.721 --> 01:43:20.890
how do we use it, how do we organize it,

01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:25.890
in the greater realm, how
might that be looked at?

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.070
- I can answer a little bit.

01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:36.490
I have, and I think that it's interesting

01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:38.610
because so much of my work is about time,

01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:41.160
so I have portraits of
mountains, for example,

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.930
and I just set the camera
and sometimes it's like

01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:46.730
48 hours of a portrait of a mountain

01:43:46.730 --> 01:43:50.000
and so I think that to
me maybe that is still is

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.400
my point of view, and it's my eye

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.960
but I am looking at more geological time

01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:58.280
or maybe atmospheric time, really, because

01:43:59.230 --> 01:44:01.580
nothing moved of the
mountain, but (laughs)

01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:02.580
the clouds did move.

01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:07.470
The bird, right, when I'm
looking at the arctic tern,

01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:09.780
a lot of the times it is
for me is animal time,

01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:12.300
I am actually trying to world with it

01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:16.130
and I'm camping with the bird, and I am,

01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:18.050
in order for me to film
it with the bollocks,

01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:20.900
I have to learn the
pattern because once I set

01:44:22.185 --> 01:44:24.950
the shutter speed, I cannot see anything,

01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:28.160
so I'm learning when is
it going to actually dive

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:31.610
to go eat, so I think
that our times combine.

01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:34.887
And so for me I think that if anything,

01:44:34.887 --> 01:44:38.070
it's less my time and more its time,

01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:40.920
whatever I'm filming,
whatever I'm documenting,

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:43.430
even the time of the
apparatus, I'm more interested

01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:45.806
in how the machine is
going to actually (clicks)

01:44:45.806 --> 01:44:47.013
do its thing.

01:44:48.210 --> 01:44:50.820
So I try to

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:54.060
let go of my own time

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:57.360
and there's times that
I've cried of exhaustion

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:00.397
because there is nothing is happening,

01:45:00.397 --> 01:45:04.310
nothing further happens,
and I'm like (sobs)

01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:06.540
I'm running out of film, I can't do this,

01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:11.010
so it is something that I
am a slave of this time,

01:45:11.010 --> 01:45:16.010
other time, and I enjoy
that, being taken away

01:45:16.450 --> 01:45:20.463
and ripped out of my
humanity, if I could say.

01:45:23.068 --> 01:45:27.030
- I think I'm inspired by
women and men who have been

01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:32.030
looking at eternity, maybe
through a combination

01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:37.297
of art and science, better guide ways

01:45:39.082 --> 01:45:44.082
to begin to take in the
possibilities of eternity.

01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:50.423
And I can think of a number of artists,

01:45:50.423 --> 01:45:55.423
whether they're in music
or visual art, literature,

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.600
but I really believe that

01:46:01.802 --> 01:46:06.320
the integration of the sciences

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.500
with art is going to be

01:46:10.570 --> 01:46:12.630
a very important

01:46:14.170 --> 01:46:17.020
evolution for humanity,

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:21.610
just how it comes together
in new ways to embrace

01:46:21.610 --> 01:46:24.593
the possibilities that exist of eternity.

01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:27.600
There's so much more
that we have to learn.

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.593
We are such babes.

01:46:30.690 --> 01:46:33.880
You know, and particularly
when we begin to view

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:38.880
eternity, it's like if I had my druthers,

01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:42.260
there's a huge part of
me that would have loved

01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:46.580
to have been an astrophysicist,
but there weren't many

01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:47.961
in my neighborhood.

01:46:47.961 --> 01:46:50.180
(audience laughs)

01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.013
But...

01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:55.530
I just...

01:46:56.810 --> 01:47:00.010
Because that's an important part,

01:47:00.010 --> 01:47:03.060
it's like I have to study physics more,

01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:06.860
to do the next projects
that I really want to do

01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:11.860
and it's finding the time
to approach that eternity

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.240
and I really appreciate
you bringing that up

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:18.010
because it's so important for you and I.

01:47:18.010 --> 01:47:21.760
- Thank you, and in that,
we're coming to the end

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.790
of our time, I thought
maybe we could close,

01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:28.640
to see if any of you have
any closing statements,

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:31.070
anything you'd like to
say that kind of tries to

01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:35.150
draw a thread between a few
of the points up to now,

01:47:35.150 --> 01:47:37.340
Asma, you were about to say something.

01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:40.390
- Actually, I was going to
just respond to that question,

01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:43.280
if I can do that instead
of a closing statement,

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.170
that would be good,

01:47:45.170 --> 01:47:48.890
I mean, I think that not just
Islam but world religions

01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:52.166
do a great job of this, of unsettling

01:47:52.166 --> 01:47:55.290
human beings from their current perception

01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:58.560
and rigidness in time and
having them think about

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:03.430
eternity and I mean, if
you look in the Koran,

01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:05.790
there are, and in Islamic literature,

01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:09.640
there are 25, 30 different words for time,

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:12.420
measuring it in different
ways and talking about

01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:16.278
this idea of an eternity and
talking about what a day is,

01:48:16.278 --> 01:48:21.278
you know, in the eyes of God
and sort of the Old Testament

01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:24.100
and the New Testament and the Koran,

01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:29.100
the lifespans of certain
prophets, like what Moses lived,

01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.360
what, 900 years, I mean, I don't remember,

01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:36.870
but there's just this, I think
all of the world's religions

01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:41.870
constantly try to unsettle
sort of regular human

01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:45.750
perceptions of time and have
us think about eternity,

01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:48.770
pre eternity and then
extend our time horizons

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.593
to an afterlife.

01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:56.263
- Thank you, Scott, Rebecca,
either of you, closing?

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.630
- [Scott] Go ahead, you will
have something more interesting

01:49:01.630 --> 01:49:02.873
to say.
- No, no, no.

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:06.480
But I have said so many
things, I will say it,

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:09.253
but maybe after you. (laughs)

01:49:10.190 --> 01:49:11.753
All right, so then I'll go.

01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:18.590
I have collaborated with
geologists and with glaciologists,

01:49:18.910 --> 01:49:21.780
ornithologists, but it is something that

01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:25.003
for me, I agree, like one of my very,

01:49:25.890 --> 01:49:28.830
when I was young, when I
was about, I don't know,

01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:32.190
14 or so, I went to NASA,
and I wanted, I was sure

01:49:32.190 --> 01:49:33.740
I was going to be an astronaut.

01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:37.040
And because I continued to

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:41.040
have that desire of expansion

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.390
and just understanding
this sense of the universe

01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:49.190
extent and duration, not just the extent.

01:49:49.190 --> 01:49:52.070
So I know that I've been studying

01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:54.174
like (speaks foreign language)

01:49:54.174 --> 01:49:56.460
again, just the universe itself,
and it's just so amazing,

01:49:56.460 --> 01:50:00.920
the concept, when I feel
that I am kind of getting

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:03.600
a sense of getting a little
bit lost, I just have that

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:07.970
image of that universe and
the way in which we are trying

01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:11.150
to map that infinity
and it is so inspiring

01:50:11.150 --> 01:50:14.351
so for me it is like the
collaboration with science again,

01:50:14.351 --> 01:50:17.820
it inspires me, so much, so much

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:20.080
and I feel that that's where

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:23.170
I feel the...

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.550
Both, and our relationship
to animals, for example,

01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:30.640
for me the post human, the
idea of that I do believe

01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.049
that our humanity's gonna
come from my relationship

01:50:34.049 --> 01:50:36.280
with wild animals, so that is another way

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:39.940
of entering another universe,
so it's in one way very far

01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:42.620
and on the other hand is
like what is our humanity,

01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:47.293
'cause we have lost that
connection, we're very isolated.

01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:51.313
- Francisco Toledo.
- Si, claro.

01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:55.810
(speaks foreign language)

01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:00.354
- Scott, last words?

01:51:00.354 --> 01:51:02.560
(audience laughs)

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.080
- Well, I guess what I
was trying to say was that

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:08.390
the way we live today,
where our conception of time

01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:11.411
is a construct, and it's a
construct that's been imposed

01:51:11.411 --> 01:51:15.290
on us through a lot, many, many years,

01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:18.810
knowing that doesn't allow
us to deconstruct it,

01:51:18.810 --> 01:51:20.430
but knowing it does

01:51:22.110 --> 01:51:27.110
should free us to do projects
which either work against

01:51:27.110 --> 01:51:30.780
that construct or allow us
to escape that construct

01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:33.910
in different ways, and
I think that it's vital

01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:38.363
that we understand that we,
that our notion of modernity

01:51:38.363 --> 01:51:43.363
as it's been fashioned
through industry and factories

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.870
and through a variety of other things,

01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:49.150
through stopwatches and
watches and trying to tell

01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:53.960
better time is a regime
which we brought on ourselves

01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:56.470
as humans, and that

01:51:57.570 --> 01:52:02.570
we're all as victims of
it, too busy, too harried,

01:52:02.905 --> 01:52:07.770
too stressed and we need
to understand that it is

01:52:07.770 --> 01:52:09.750
a regime we've brought on ourselves,

01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:12.090
it's not the regime of arctic terns,

01:52:12.090 --> 01:52:13.940
it's not the regime of rhythms,

01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:17.330
it's not the regime of
even the mechanical clocks

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:21.650
of elephants, so I think it's
important to understand that

01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:24.510
and understand what it is
and understand the ways

01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:26.840
we get out of it into the moment.

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:29.120
- Wonderful, thank you,
and everybody in the room,

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:31.854
please join me in thanking our guests

01:52:31.854 --> 01:52:33.250
(audience applauds)

01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:37.339
for their time.

01:52:37.339 --> 01:52:41.320
By my back of envelope calculations,

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.780
if there's 300 of us in the room,

01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:45.010
we've just spent 600 hours together.

01:52:45.010 --> 01:52:48.010
The most delightful 600 hours
I think of the week for me,

01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:52.000
most certainly, join us next
week for what is beauty?

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.030
Look forward to seeing you all then.

01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:55.233
- Wonderful, I can't wait.

01:52:55.233 --> 01:52:58.233
(audience applauds)
