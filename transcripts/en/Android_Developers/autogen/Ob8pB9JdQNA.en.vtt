is to think of what rules we can break
 

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:48.490 align:start position:0%
is to think of what rules we can break

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:48.500 align:start position:0%
and and what features we can give some
 

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.309 align:start position:0%
and and what features we can give some
subset<00:09:48.980><c> of</c><00:09:49.009><c> customers</c><00:09:49.689><c> but</c><00:09:50.689><c> not</c><00:09:50.839><c> everybody</c>

subset of customers but not everybody
 

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:52.660 align:start position:0%
subset of customers but not everybody
because<00:09:51.649><c> it</c><00:09:51.889><c> would</c><00:09:51.980><c> literally</c><00:09:52.220><c> break</c><00:09:52.430><c> the</c>

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:52.670 align:start position:0%
because it would literally break the
 

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.790 align:start position:0%
because it would literally break the
game<00:09:52.850><c> of</c><00:09:53.000><c> tinder</c><00:09:53.300><c> so</c><00:09:54.230><c> if</c><00:09:54.319><c> you</c><00:09:54.410><c> think</c><00:09:54.500><c> of</c><00:09:54.649><c> Bruce</c>

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
game of tinder so if you think of Bruce
 

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
game of tinder so if you think of Bruce
as<00:09:55.069><c> an</c><00:09:55.189><c> example</c><00:09:55.459><c> if</c><00:09:55.639><c> everyone</c><00:09:56.000><c> was</c><00:09:56.120><c> boosting</c>

00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:56.449 align:start position:0%
as an example if everyone was boosting
 

00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:58.780 align:start position:0%
as an example if everyone was boosting
at<00:09:56.509><c> the</c><00:09:56.600><c> same</c><00:09:56.779><c> time</c><00:09:57.220><c> the</c><00:09:58.220><c> whole</c><00:09:58.250><c> world</c><00:09:58.610><c> would</c>

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
at the same time the whole world would
 

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.759 align:start position:0%
at the same time the whole world would
be<00:09:58.819><c> boosting</c><00:09:59.360><c> and</c><00:09:59.509><c> the</c><00:10:00.230><c> game</c><00:10:00.439><c> would</c><00:10:00.589><c> just</c>

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:00.769 align:start position:0%
be boosting and the game would just
 

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:02.470 align:start position:0%
be boosting and the game would just
break<00:10:00.980><c> and</c><00:10:01.309><c> so</c><00:10:01.790><c> I'm</c><00:10:01.850><c> thinking</c><00:10:02.000><c> of</c><00:10:02.209><c> things</c><00:10:02.329><c> that</c>

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
break and so I'm thinking of things that
 

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.379 align:start position:0%
break and so I'm thinking of things that
we<00:10:02.629><c> can</c><00:10:02.750><c> give</c><00:10:02.930><c> people</c><00:10:02.959><c> and</c><00:10:03.410><c> limited</c><00:10:04.389><c> cohorts</c>

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:05.389 align:start position:0%
we can give people and limited cohorts
 

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:06.579 align:start position:0%
we can give people and limited cohorts
that<00:10:05.509><c> that</c><00:10:05.990><c> will</c><00:10:06.139><c> make</c><00:10:06.259><c> the</c><00:10:06.410><c> game</c><00:10:06.529><c> more</c>

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:06.589 align:start position:0%
that that will make the game more
 

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:10.809 align:start position:0%
that that will make the game more
efficient<00:10:07.220><c> or</c><00:10:07.339><c> fun</c><00:10:09.009><c> and</c><00:10:10.009><c> the</c><00:10:10.399><c> key</c><00:10:10.550><c> thing</c><00:10:10.790><c> here</c>

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:10.819 align:start position:0%
efficient or fun and the key thing here
 

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.179 align:start position:0%
efficient or fun and the key thing here
is<00:10:11.059><c> if</c><00:10:11.329><c> you</c><00:10:11.480><c> if</c><00:10:11.689><c> you</c><00:10:11.930><c> think</c><00:10:12.290><c> that</c><00:10:12.649><c> any</c><00:10:12.889><c> rule</c>

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:13.189 align:start position:0%

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:11.089 align:start position:0%
idea bad idea but this was the first
 

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
idea bad idea but this was the first
version<00:12:11.330><c> of</c><00:12:11.600><c> likes</c><00:12:11.930><c> you</c><00:12:12.200><c> which</c><00:12:12.560><c> was</c><00:12:12.800><c> the</c><00:12:12.980><c> main</c>

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
version of likes you which was the main
feature<00:12:13.399><c> so</c><00:12:13.850><c> I</c><00:12:14.779><c> broke</c><00:12:15.290><c> one</c><00:12:15.589><c> one</c><00:12:15.980><c> of</c><00:12:16.100><c> Jonathan's</c>

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:16.490 align:start position:0%
feature so I broke one one of Jonathan's
 

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.420 align:start position:0%
feature so I broke one one of Jonathan's
rules<00:12:16.760><c> which</c><00:12:17.089><c> was</c><00:12:17.300><c> I</c><00:12:17.600><c> want</c><00:12:18.500><c> to</c><00:12:18.589><c> show</c><00:12:18.830><c> you</c><00:12:18.890><c> who</c>

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:19.430 align:start position:0%
rules which was I want to show you who
 

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.449 align:start position:0%
rules which was I want to show you who
likes<00:12:19.700><c> you</c><00:12:19.910><c> before</c><00:12:20.300><c> you</c><00:12:20.450><c> swipe</c><00:12:20.890><c> we</c><00:12:21.890><c> kept</c><00:12:22.310><c> the</c>

00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:22.459 align:start position:0%
likes you before you swipe we kept the
 

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.100 align:start position:0%
likes you before you swipe we kept the
double<00:12:22.730><c> opt-in</c><00:12:23.029><c> so</c><00:12:23.300><c> you</c><00:12:23.420><c> both</c><00:12:23.600><c> need</c><00:12:23.810><c> to</c><00:12:23.839><c> like</c>

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.110 align:start position:0%
double opt-in so you both need to like
 

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
double opt-in so you both need to like
each<00:12:24.290><c> other</c><00:12:24.410><c> to</c><00:12:24.650><c> message</c><00:12:25.040><c> but</c><00:12:25.940><c> I</c><00:12:25.970><c> really</c>

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:26.330 align:start position:0%
each other to message but I really
 

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.699 align:start position:0%
each other to message but I really
thought<00:12:26.510><c> that</c><00:12:26.570><c> the</c><00:12:27.080><c> game</c><00:12:27.230><c> could</c><00:12:27.410><c> be</c><00:12:27.529><c> more</c>

00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:27.709 align:start position:0%
thought that the game could be more
 

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
thought that the game could be more
efficient<00:12:28.160><c> if</c><00:12:28.370><c> I</c><00:12:28.580><c> just</c><00:12:28.790><c> knew</c><00:12:28.970><c> who</c><00:12:29.180><c> liked</c><00:12:29.420><c> me</c>

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:29.830 align:start position:0%
efficient if I just knew who liked me
 

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.340 align:start position:0%
