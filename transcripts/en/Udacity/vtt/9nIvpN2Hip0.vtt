00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.515
So here are the numbers that I get for A, when I plug in n. You can see we have

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:07.925
some pretty long decimals here, except for our first answer, which is very

00:00:07.925 --> 00:00:13.692
simple. Since we just get 1 plus 1 to the 1st power. However, you might notice,

00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:17.310
that the difference between adjacent values, here, gets smaller and smaller as

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.236
n increases. The difference between these last two, doesn't show up. Until the

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:27.452
fifth decimal place. Something interesting is definitely happening here.
