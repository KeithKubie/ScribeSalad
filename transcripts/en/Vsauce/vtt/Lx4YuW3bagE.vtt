Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And over the weekend I was in Los Angeles,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.170
where I got to meet up with Henry,
the creator of MinutePhysics.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.750
But let's get to some DONGS.
MinutePhysics recommended

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.650
Grow Cube. You win by selecting the
elements in the correct

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.520
order. I was kinda like big deal,
but then MinutePhysics pointed out

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.550
that understanding the subtle relationships
between the way the animations happen

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.849
and way the items interact is something
that the human brain is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.900
awesome at, but computers not so much.
These's are one of the few types of games

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.120
where people can be computers. So go play
one, and after you beat it, look at the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.000
screen and go

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.860
"take that computer."
SnipeZzLeGacY recommended Continuity,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.809
a really clever game where you have to
rearrange the puzzle pieces

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.239
of the game to make it playable. And 'No
One Mourns the Nolan' recommended Blow

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:50.890
Six,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.180
where you shoot balls at bricks to knock them
off, but using larger and larger balls

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.480
costs you points,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.120
so be careful.
NothinbatHD sent me "Kill Me."

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
New versions of yourself appear
over and over again

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.189
and the bodies of your former selves can
be strategic safe zones.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.450
DeluxeFreeman sent me the best type of koala,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.110
the kind you have to laboriously wave
your cursor over and over and over

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.380
to divide into small enough pixels to
be intelligible.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.460
KryptiCxLeGenD threw me a curveball

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.750
3D pong.
And oh look, a complete breakdown of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.979
10 codes. 10-4 means OK, but there are 98 others.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.299
Htwins.net contains some of my favorite WebWork.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.430
These are the guys behind the amazing scale
of the universe tool I've covered before,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.500
but they also have spatial intelligence
games like

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.890
rolling a cube, so that a certain
face faces down at the right time.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.729
I also like this one where the guy can't
walk and you have to pre-plan

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.030
his automatic route. Joe Sabia is one of
the most creative people I know. His

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.820
internet works

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.040
are super clever. I specially like how he
made this interactive game

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.250
on Facebook.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.850
Bob Lazar was a guy who purportedly
worked at Area 51.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.590
What does he do now?
Well, he runs UnitedNuclear.com,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.300
a website where you can actually buy
small,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.950
legal quantities of radioactive
isotopes/

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.990
Finally @GothisLifeStyle @tweetsauce-d
a fantastic list of cool

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.660
mind hacks, like the Pinnochio effect or
the fact that you can not rotate one of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.920
your feet clockwise

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.310
while simultaneously drawing the number
six in the air

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.570
without having to reverse your foot.
Pretty weird, right?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.330
And as always,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.450
thanks for watching.
