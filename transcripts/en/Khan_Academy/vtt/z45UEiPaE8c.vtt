00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.790
Jada is ordering Mother's
Day gifts online.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.330
The shipping costs are based on
the dollar amount of the order.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.850
For orders less than
$20, shipping costs $4.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.970
For orders $20 or
more, shipping is $7.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.990
Can the dollar
amount of the order

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.700
be represented as a
function of shipping costs?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.760
So they're saying,
can the dollar amount

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.520
of the order-- so can
the amount of order

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.870
be represented as a
function of shipping--

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:46.130
let me do that in
that blue color costs.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.440
So if we have the shipping
costs as an input,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.400
will that map to exactly--
for a given input,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.640
will we get exactly one output
for the amount of order?

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.190
In order for this to be
represented as a function,

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.680
we have to input a shipping
cost, a shipping cost

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.590
where this relationship
is defined.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.810
We need to input
a shipping cost,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.600
put it into our relationship,
and get exactly one dollar

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.750
amount of the order in order
for this to be a function.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.020
If we get multiple dollar
amounts of the order, then

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.510
the relationship, well,
it's still a relationship,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.630
but it's not going
to be a function.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.790
So let's think about it.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.390
What are the
possible inputs here?

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.570
Well, there's only two
possible shipping costs.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.360
Shipping costs are
either going to be $4,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.280
or they're going to be $7.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.990
So let's think
about what happens

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.120
when we input $4 in
as a shipping cost.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.190
So if we input $4
into our relationship,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.200
so we input $4 into our
little potential function box,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.400
so $4 into it,
what is the output?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.180
What is going to be the
amount of the order?

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.810
Well, if the shipping cost is
$4, the amount of the order

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.160
just has to be
anything less than $20.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.259
So it could have been $1.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.990
It could have been $1.50.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.990
It could've been $7.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.230
It literally can take
on any value up to $20.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.080
So it could even be $19.99.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.470
We could do a similar
thing if we input 7

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.490
into this relationship.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.000
If 7 was-- and I could put
literally an infinite number

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.500
of numbers.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.750
It could be a million dollars.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.960
So if I input 7 into
this relationship

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.780
that we're trying to test
whether it's a function, if 7

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.870
is the shipping costs,
then the order we just know

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.180
is over $20, $20 or more.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.790
So it could be $20.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.190
It could be $800.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.646
It could be $1 million.

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:51.520
There's actually an
infinite number of values

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.420
that it could take
on right over here.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.480
So because for a
valid shipping cost,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.770
for each of these
valid shipping costs,

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.030
I can get many, many,
many potential outputs,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.276
I don't know which output it
necessarily will output to.

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:07.900
If someone tells you
the shipping costs

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.010
and you don't necessarily
know what the order size was,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.840
this is not a function.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.170
You cannot represent the
amount of order as a function

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.310
of the shipping cost.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.420
So, no.
