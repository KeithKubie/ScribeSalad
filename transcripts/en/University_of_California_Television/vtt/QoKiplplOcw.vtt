00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.989
- Our final special
presentation actually came from,

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.411
I think our Planning
and Advisory Committee

00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:19.739
as well as the evaluations from last year,

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.727
and so this is a very
special, unique presentation

00:00:24.727 --> 00:00:28.161
from Rick Guidotti, who is right here,

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.165
a fashion photographer,

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:32.376
who has done something pretty incredible

00:00:32.376 --> 00:00:35.901
called the Frame Project
and so we're gonna let Rick

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.479
do his thing.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:38.402
Alright.

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:39.333
- Thank you.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.257
- Thank you.

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:41.361
- Thank you so much.

00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:43.327
Hey, I'm so thrilled to be here.

00:00:43.327 --> 00:00:44.160
Thanks for having me.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.492
So, here's the thing for
changing it, that would be great.

00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:49.235
So, I'll tell you a little about,

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:51.053
I'll give you a little
history on Positive Exposure.

00:00:51.053 --> 00:00:54.048
I am a fashion photographer
based in New York City

00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:57.146
but I also lived in Milan
and Paris for several years

00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:00.425
and got to work with some pretty
amazing models and clients

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:03.857
and this, of course, is
Claudia for an Elle shoot.

00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:06.292
This is Marie Claire.

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:08.751
I did a lot of work for the
House of Ives Saint Laurent

00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:09.703
in Paris.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.035
So I lived in Paris for quite a bit.

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:12.357
I did a lot of portraiture as well.

00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:14.257
That's a portrait of Mr. Saint Laurent

00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:18.252
and that's one of the images
from our global campaign.

00:01:18.252 --> 00:01:20.319
French Elle magazine.

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.229
This is New York Style magazine.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.312
Marie Claire.

00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:27.220
English Marie Claire.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.856
French Elle and, of course,
here's our beautiful, Cindy,

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.704
from a Revlon shoot.

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:34.258
So I got to work with lots of great models

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:36.395
and lots of great clients and
I traveled around the world.

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.011
I was living in Milan and it was amazing

00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.397
but it was also really quite frustrating

00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:44.931
'cause I was always, always,
always told who was beautiful.

00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:47.720
You know, and I was told who
the model of the moment was

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.061
and we all had to photograph that face

00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:51.021
and then it would change the next season

00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:53.031
and we'd photograph that
face the next season

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:56.263
but I was always told who's
beautiful and as an artist,

00:01:56.263 --> 00:01:58.147
I never, ever, ever saw

00:01:58.147 --> 00:01:59.675
and I continue never to see beauty

00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:02.637
only on covers of magazines.

00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:05.449
It exists there but it
doesn't only exist there.

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:06.792
I see beauty everywhere.

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:09.646
I was leaving my studio one
afternoon in New York City,

00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:11.548
running down Park Avenue after doing

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.463
a huge casting for Elle magazine.

00:02:13.463 --> 00:02:16.255
I pretty much saw every model
in town, it was amazing,

00:02:16.255 --> 00:02:18.862
but I was just running
down Park Avenue and there,

00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:20.970
waiting for the bus at Park and 20th,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.314
was this stunning girl.

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:26.776
She had long white, white,
white hair, she had pale skin,

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:29.871
she had this genetic
condition called albinism.

00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:32.414
I knew the terms was albino.

00:02:32.414 --> 00:02:34.494
That's what I knew and she was stunning

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:37.614
but I never model that
looked like this girl.

00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:40.186
She had never been included
in that beauty standard

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:41.764
and I wanted to grab her

00:02:41.764 --> 00:02:43.213
and say I have to take your photograph,

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:44.230
you're amazing,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.235
but the bus came and she
got on the bus and took off.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:47.360
(audience laughs)

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.632
And you know, I always say this,

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:50.545
and I always say this in my presentation -

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.340
I'm actually quite
pleased that the bus came

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.612
because she was 12 years old
and I would be in prison.

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:56.630
(audience laughs)

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.796
So I'm glad that that didn't happen.

00:02:57.796 --> 00:02:59.872
So she was stunning but I just ran down

00:02:59.872 --> 00:03:02.688
to the local Barnes &amp; Noble
to find more photographs

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:04.522
of this gorgeous girl or friends of hers

00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:06.317
with the genetic condition albinism.

00:03:06.317 --> 00:03:09.424
I went to the School of
Visual Arts in New York City

00:03:09.424 --> 00:03:10.637
so I only went to an art school.

00:03:10.637 --> 00:03:12.990
I never saw a medical textbook photograph

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.972
or a medical textbook prior to that moment

00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:17.070
and there was my first medical textbook,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.430
I pulled it off the shelf
so excited to open it up

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.807
to albinism to find images
of this gorgeous girl

00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:24.439
or her friends but instead
of finding those images,

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.629
I found these images.

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.496
I found images of the
bright red albino eye.

00:03:29.496 --> 00:03:31.677
This kid did not have bright red eyes.

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.292
She had beautiful blue eyes

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:35.518
and I saw thousands of
photographs of people

00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:38.478
in cancer clinics with great
big open festering wounds

00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:39.644
and cancers.

00:03:39.644 --> 00:03:41.496
I'm thinking this is horrible!

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:44.703
But then even more disturbing
where the countless images

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:47.401
that I saw of kids up against
walls in doctors' offices,

00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:50.326
usually naked with those
black bars across their eyes

00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:51.838
standing up against the wall.

00:03:51.838 --> 00:03:55.056
See and I'm thinking this
is not what I'm looking for.

00:03:55.056 --> 00:03:57.152
Where are those photographs
of that gorgeous kid?

00:03:57.152 --> 00:03:59.044
So I very quickly closed those books.

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:00.675
I figured, an encyclopedia!

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.833
That's where I'm gonna
find 'em but instead,

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.036
and I grabbed an encyclopedia,

00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:06.317
but instead of finding
photographs of this gorgeous kid,

00:04:06.317 --> 00:04:09.084
I found the freak albino
family in the circus

00:04:09.084 --> 00:04:11.322
and then I started doing more research

00:04:11.322 --> 00:04:14.671
and I found all these
incredible negative portrayals

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.767
in Hollywood feature films from Powder,

00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:19.410
who had albinism 'cause his
mother was struck by lightning

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.722
when she was pregnant with him,

00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:24.417
to the Princess Bride, the pit of despair,

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:26.194
to the Matrix Reloaded,

00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:28.384
these evil ghostlike
characters that would come

00:04:28.384 --> 00:04:30.529
and they'd wreak havoc
and then they'd disappear

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.272
to even most recently,

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.499
the Da Vinci Code, where the Da Vinci,

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.567
it was the evil Silas driving around Paris

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:37.929
at night shooting at people.

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:40.219
One of the first things I
discovered in my research

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.723
about albinism that
people with this condition

00:04:42.723 --> 00:04:44.205
have a visual impairment.

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:46.826
Most people with albinism
are considered legally blind.

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:49.222
So certainly wouldn't
be driving around Paris

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.277
and like shooting at
anybody and expect to hit

00:04:51.277 --> 00:04:52.426
any of their targets.

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:54.936
So this is terrible
information that's out there.

00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:58.098
I'm thinking this is getting
worse and worse and worse

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:02.255
but I did see in one
of my research moments,

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:04.647
I saw that there was a
support group called NOAH.

00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:07.436
NOAH's the National
Organization for Albinism

00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:08.928
and Hypopigmentation.

00:05:08.928 --> 00:05:11.533
It's a support group for people
living with this condition

00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:12.727
and their families.

00:05:12.727 --> 00:05:13.959
I got so excited.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:15.698
I called 'em instantly
and I was like, hey,

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:16.761
I'm a fashion photographer.

00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:18.444
Let's show the world
the beauty of albinism.

00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:19.966
This is gonna be amazing!

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:21.368
They said, get lost.

00:05:21.368 --> 00:05:22.565
(audience laughs)

00:05:22.565 --> 00:05:24.001
You know, I'm pretty persistent,
I'm kind of a New Yorker.

00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:25.414
I don't give up so easily.

00:05:25.414 --> 00:05:27.216
I kept going after them and asking them

00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:30.005
and trying to find out why
they told me to get lost

00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:32.363
and they eventually
made it very clear to me

00:05:32.363 --> 00:05:34.055
about their fear of exploitation,

00:05:34.055 --> 00:05:36.242
that every time there
was a magazine article

00:05:36.242 --> 00:05:37.480
about somebody with albinism,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.178
it was always the story about a victim.

00:05:39.178 --> 00:05:40.971
It was always sensational.

00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:43.030
It was always exploitative.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.056
It was always negative.

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:46.684
I'm like, okay, I get it.

00:05:46.684 --> 00:05:47.696
I see this.

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:48.712
I feel this.

00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:50.187
I understand this completely but that's,

00:05:50.187 --> 00:05:52.922
I can't find one positive
portrayal of albinism

00:05:52.922 --> 00:05:54.733
and it's just wild.

00:05:54.733 --> 00:05:56.942
So can, why don't we do
something strange here?

00:05:56.942 --> 00:05:59.829
Let's form a non-traditional partnership.

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:02.910
Fashion photographer,
genetic support group,

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.175
and together we'll collaborate

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:06.816
and create a photographic
essay that celebrates

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:10.134
the beauty of albinism and they agreed.

00:06:10.134 --> 00:06:11.433
I'm like, oh this is amazing!

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:13.435
So Positive Exposure is born that day.

00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:15.755
In walks the first girl
I'm going to photograph.

00:06:15.755 --> 00:06:17.015
Her name is Christine.

00:06:17.015 --> 00:06:18.286
She's stunning.

00:06:18.286 --> 00:06:20.296
She's 5'9", long white
hair, she's amazing,

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.417
but she walks into my studio
with her shoulders hunched,

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:26.690
head down, no eye
contact, one word answers.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.757
This kid had zero self-esteem
as a direct result

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:31.864
from the bullying,

00:06:31.864 --> 00:06:33.756
the teasing, the abuse,

00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:36.230
she experienced in the school environment

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.199
because of her difference
and it was heartbreaking

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.711
to see this beautiful kid
standing there like this.

00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:43.031
I didn't know what to do.

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:44.506
How am I gonna photograph this kid?

00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:48.366
She's so vulnerable but just
the day before on the same set

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.933
in my studio I did a Revlon
shoot with Cindy Crawford

00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:52.040
and I thought, you know,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.982
out of respect for this gorgeous kid,

00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:57.292
I'm gonna photograph her
like I would any supermodel.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.919
So the fan went on, the music went on,

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.572
and I grabbed a mirror and I
held it up to her and I said,

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:04.140
Christine, look at yourself.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.723
You're magnificent!

00:07:06.631 --> 00:07:09.841
And this kid looked in the
mirror and saw what I saw

00:07:09.841 --> 00:07:11.674
and she went from this

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:14.895
to this.

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:15.935
(audience laughs)

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.983
And she exploded with
a smile that literally,

00:07:17.983 --> 00:07:20.097
literally lit up New York City.

00:07:20.097 --> 00:07:22.044
That's our beautiful Christine.

00:07:22.044 --> 00:07:23.043
(audience cheering)

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:24.195
Thank you, thank you!

00:07:24.195 --> 00:07:25.192
(audience laughs)

00:07:25.192 --> 00:07:26.192
She loves applause.

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:27.196
So Christine, now,

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:29.598
she's gonna walk into school
the next day not like this,

00:07:29.598 --> 00:07:31.568
like she normally does but like this.

00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:35.313
She desperately needed to
change the way she saw herself.

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:39.586
Her community desperately
needed to change the way

00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:41.429
that they saw her difference.

00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:44.314
So she created that moment,
that very first photo shoot,

00:07:44.314 --> 00:07:46.098
that Positive Exposure studio,

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.969
the philosophy that drives
everything that we do

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.994
and that philosophy is change how you see,

00:07:51.994 --> 00:07:53.766
see how you change.

00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:56.644
Those first images were in Life Magazine.

00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:59.281
It was in an article
called Redefining Beauty.

00:07:59.281 --> 00:08:00.920
Everybody saw it.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.385
I got lots of awards for it.

00:08:02.385 --> 00:08:03.567
It was great.

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:04.672
It kind of put albinism on the map.

00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:05.997
The Albinism Foundation was thrilled.

00:08:05.997 --> 00:08:07.830
It went to all the different
foundations worldwide.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.758
As I was doing my fashion work,

00:08:09.758 --> 00:08:12.463
I'd show up in London and
we'd do a family photo shoot

00:08:12.463 --> 00:08:15.064
at a conference there or
in the UK or in Australia

00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:16.519
or in New Zealand,

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:18.748
we started an organization
for a support group,

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:19.767
all over the world.

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:21.274
It raised a lot of noise.

00:08:21.274 --> 00:08:22.823
It was fantastic.

00:08:22.823 --> 00:08:25.133
When I came back to New York City

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:26.205
while in the middle of all this,

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:27.523
I received an award,

00:08:27.523 --> 00:08:30.012
one of the best awards that
I ever received in my life.

00:08:30.012 --> 00:08:32.167
It was an award from this organization

00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:33.666
called the Genetic Alliance.

00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:35.805
The Genetic Alliance is a coalition

00:08:35.805 --> 00:08:37.400
of all the genetic
support groups worldwide

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.348
and as they were presenting the award,

00:08:40.348 --> 00:08:42.311
they explained that they see beauty

00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:44.836
in all these gorgeous
photographs of kids with albinism

00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:48.117
but there absolutely is a
universal message here -

00:08:48.117 --> 00:08:49.769
it's not about albinism,

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:52.323
it's about all differences
and they asked me,

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:53.633
would I be interested in going

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.108
to one of the other genetic support groups

00:08:55.108 --> 00:08:57.015
that they represent and take photographs

00:08:57.015 --> 00:08:58.612
celebrating the beauty
of those gorgeous kids,

00:08:58.612 --> 00:09:01.284
celebrating the beauty
of their differences

00:09:01.284 --> 00:09:02.791
for their families?

00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.827
I was like, what an amazing idea.

00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:06.812
Of course, I would love to do that!

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.647
But, you know, I wanted
to do my due diligence.

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:10.732
I went back to those
scary medical textbooks

00:09:10.732 --> 00:09:13.718
to find out what the heck
a chromosome 18 anomaly was

00:09:13.718 --> 00:09:15.532
'cause that was the very next conference

00:09:15.532 --> 00:09:16.704
that they were representing.

00:09:16.704 --> 00:09:19.014
It was for the chromosome 18
registry and research society.

00:09:19.014 --> 00:09:21.259
So I figured, okay,

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:22.601
I'm gonna go and figure it out

00:09:22.601 --> 00:09:23.851
and as I opened those medical textbooks

00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:27.316
to chromosome 18 anomalies
and that's what I saw.

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:28.906
It was terrifying.

00:09:28.906 --> 00:09:30.916
I saw images of kids with cleft palates.

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:33.339
I saw images of stillborns .

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:35.793
I saw images of doctors
turning kids' heads like this.

00:09:35.793 --> 00:09:39.267
I saw, there were just
images of kids with tracs

00:09:39.267 --> 00:09:43.461
and feeding tubes and I, it
was trisomy 13, trisomy 18,

00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:47.378
tetrasomy 18, 18P and Q
minus and I'm thinking,

00:09:48.812 --> 00:09:50.119
this is horrible!

00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:51.116
I don't wanna do this.

00:09:51.116 --> 00:09:52.626
Albinism was so easy compared to this.

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:55.875
This is frightening but I
went, I had committed to this,

00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:58.666
and it was in San Antonio,
Texas and I committed.

00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:00.864
So I went to this conference
and I was terrified

00:10:00.864 --> 00:10:02.742
but I walked into this conference

00:10:02.742 --> 00:10:04.947
and went down to the auditorium
where there were kids,

00:10:04.947 --> 00:10:07.832
kids and young adults being
entertained by a clown on stage

00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:11.127
making balloon animals and I
walked into that auditorium

00:10:11.127 --> 00:10:14.495
with these horrible images
burned in my head, terrified,

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:17.201
but I walked in and I
was instantly surrounded

00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:19.540
by kids screaming with laughter.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.615
They were kids, they were
people in that audience.

00:10:21.615 --> 00:10:23.869
They were kids with
cleft palates and tracs

00:10:23.869 --> 00:10:26.582
and feeding tubes and mobility
issues but they were people,

00:10:26.582 --> 00:10:27.801
they were kids,

00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:29.637
where were those giggles
in those photographs?

00:10:29.637 --> 00:10:32.298
These are some of the great
friends that I met right away.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.747
That's Pauline and Rebecca.

00:10:34.747 --> 00:10:37.240
My very good friend, Ellington.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.490
Remi, Deek, and they weren't just kids.

00:10:43.612 --> 00:10:45.490
There were some kids,
there were young adults,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.492
and their were adults.

00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:47.769
This is my great friend, Shawn.

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:49.989
I've been photographing Shawn
from the day that I met him

00:10:49.989 --> 00:10:54.250
to just a few weeks ago at
my studio in New York City.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.280
My great friend, Rebecca.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.882
So it was really so incredible

00:10:57.882 --> 00:10:59.572
that like these gorgeous kids,

00:10:59.572 --> 00:11:00.710
they were people.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.238
Where were those giggles

00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:03.689
in those medical textbook photographs?

00:11:03.689 --> 00:11:06.329
I came back to New York City just inspired

00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:09.984
and really energized and revved
up to do more of this work

00:11:09.984 --> 00:11:13.177
and I was approached by
Francis Collins who was then

00:11:13.177 --> 00:11:15.533
the Director of the National
Human Genome Research Institute

00:11:15.533 --> 00:11:17.452
and he wanted to create,

00:11:17.452 --> 00:11:19.361
we were gonna create a
photographic exhibition

00:11:19.361 --> 00:11:21.688
at the Museum of Natural History
commemorating the mapping

00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:23.239
of the people's genome.

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:25.454
It was gonna be an
exhibition that would launch

00:11:25.454 --> 00:11:27.163
at the Smithsonian and
would travel worldwide

00:11:27.163 --> 00:11:30.154
and he wanted to see
the heterogeneity within

00:11:30.154 --> 00:11:32.705
that homogenous diagnosis of albinism.

00:11:32.705 --> 00:11:34.957
I thought, great idea but
you're not gonna believe this,

00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:38.223
I just came back from the
chromosome 18 registry conference

00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:40.727
and I had this incredible experience.

00:11:40.727 --> 00:11:43.719
It really, really is a
universal message here.

00:11:43.719 --> 00:11:45.175
It's about all differences.

00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:47.872
Let's invite many genetic
support groups to participate

00:11:47.872 --> 00:11:50.647
in this human celebration,
the celebration of difference,

00:11:50.647 --> 00:11:52.456
and he agreed.

00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:55.178
So together with the Genetic
Alliance and Sharon Terry

00:11:55.178 --> 00:11:56.281
who's the current president,

00:11:56.281 --> 00:11:59.583
we then did a great outreach
program and a campaign

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:01.424
to invite many groups to participate.

00:12:01.424 --> 00:12:03.207
The first group that stepped up was

00:12:03.207 --> 00:12:04.521
the National Marfan Foundation.

00:12:04.521 --> 00:12:06.358
Marfan Syndrome, as you know,

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:09.238
is a connective tissue
disorder, grow very, very tall,

00:12:09.238 --> 00:12:11.960
you're at risk of an aortic
dissection, scoliosis,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.723
really long arms and legs
and limbs and I thought,

00:12:14.723 --> 00:12:18.497
okay, I went and did my research
and I saw that photograph

00:12:18.497 --> 00:12:20.053
and I understand the importance

00:12:20.053 --> 00:12:24.122
of that photograph in medical education,

00:12:24.122 --> 00:12:26.644
how important it was to
show how Marfan Syndrome

00:12:26.644 --> 00:12:27.808
presents itself.

00:12:27.808 --> 00:12:31.041
I get it but now let me take
over 'cause I'm an artist.

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:33.149
Let me show the same
information in that photograph

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:36.315
but show the most important key
ingredient that needs to be,

00:12:36.315 --> 00:12:38.734
not just shown in medical
education but embedded

00:12:38.734 --> 00:12:40.521
in medical education,

00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:41.862
and that's humanity.

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:43.882
Let's show Billy in a swimming pool.

00:12:43.882 --> 00:12:46.122
Let's show those long gorgeous arms but,

00:12:46.122 --> 00:12:48.076
and really get a sense of Marfan Syndrome

00:12:48.076 --> 00:12:52.102
but also get a sense that
it's Billy first and foremost.

00:12:52.102 --> 00:12:54.209
So my other great friends that I started

00:12:54.209 --> 00:12:55.786
working with right away
is my great friend Caleb.

00:12:55.786 --> 00:12:57.151
Caleb is a little person.

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.121
He has achondroplasia, dwarfism,

00:12:59.121 --> 00:13:00.902
a very common form of dwarfism.

00:13:00.902 --> 00:13:03.298
Caleb wants to be the
President of the United States

00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:04.951
or an actor.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.337
(audience applause)

00:13:06.337 --> 00:13:08.618
But I told him all about
Ronald Reagan and now he knows

00:13:08.618 --> 00:13:11.029
that he, and he will do
both and he's going to,

00:13:11.029 --> 00:13:13.162
because now he knows
that Ronald Reagan did it

00:13:13.162 --> 00:13:14.814
so he can do it and that's Caleb.

00:13:14.814 --> 00:13:16.459
This is my great friend Dr. Nadia.

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:18.913
She was a second year medical
student in the Middle East

00:13:18.913 --> 00:13:21.753
when I met her in Education City.

00:13:21.753 --> 00:13:24.090
She has anachronism melic dysplasia,

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.243
a rare form of skeletal dysplasia.

00:13:26.243 --> 00:13:27.689
She is a little person as well.

00:13:27.689 --> 00:13:29.608
She's now finished her residency

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:31.782
at Dayton Children's Hospital
and doing her postdoc

00:13:31.782 --> 00:13:33.458
at Baylor in Genetics.

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:35.637
She said all she ever needs to succeed

00:13:35.637 --> 00:13:37.503
as a doctor is a stool.

00:13:37.503 --> 00:13:39.357
She is amazing.

00:13:39.357 --> 00:13:40.697
(audience laughs)

00:13:40.697 --> 00:13:41.570
That's our Dr. Nadia.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.622
My great friend Lily with
4P-/Wolf-Hirschshorn Syndrome.

00:13:45.622 --> 00:13:49.065
Ronan living with Prader-Willi Syndrome.

00:13:49.065 --> 00:13:51.178
Looks like Frank Sinatra, I think.

00:13:51.178 --> 00:13:52.429
(audience laughs)

00:13:52.429 --> 00:13:56.512
My beautiful Jayda living
with 22q 11.2 Deletion.

00:13:57.409 --> 00:13:59.089
Caitlin living with Cerebral Palsy.

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:02.179
She's a senior and deciding
on her final school selections

00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:05.322
right now which is really exciting.

00:14:05.322 --> 00:14:06.721
Simone, I do a lot of work

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:10.223
with the National Down
Syndrome Foundations worldwide.

00:14:10.223 --> 00:14:12.432
This is the incredible
Simone who represents

00:14:12.432 --> 00:14:16.427
the National Down Syndrome
Foundation of Italy

00:14:16.427 --> 00:14:18.808
and my great friends from
the Clemson Life Program

00:14:18.808 --> 00:14:20.765
at Clemson University.

00:14:20.765 --> 00:14:23.143
Clemson Life Program is a
program that works with kids

00:14:23.143 --> 00:14:24.535
with intellectual disabilities,
brings them on campus,

00:14:24.535 --> 00:14:27.746
puts them in integrative
classrooms where they actually

00:14:27.746 --> 00:14:31.333
have great classes but they
learn all kinds of good things

00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:33.957
and they have a full on college experience

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:37.854
and also learn, really
learn, life skills as well,

00:14:37.854 --> 00:14:39.954
and so it's really exciting
to be part of that.

00:14:39.954 --> 00:14:42.010
We went back and we're
rephotographing these kids

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.922
at Clemson Life Program
and we're gonna launch

00:14:43.922 --> 00:14:46.062
an exhibition there in
the next couple of weeks

00:14:46.062 --> 00:14:48.935
which is really thrilling.

00:14:48.935 --> 00:14:50.657
I go to medical schools.

00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:52.336
I go to medical schools worldwide.

00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:54.515
I speak to usually first or
second year med students,

00:14:54.515 --> 00:14:56.602
not because I really want to deliver

00:14:56.602 --> 00:14:58.408
all this medical information
to medical students

00:14:58.408 --> 00:15:00.474
but really because I can pronounce

00:15:00.474 --> 00:15:02.773
Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita

00:15:02.773 --> 00:15:03.789
(audience laughs)

00:15:03.789 --> 00:15:04.973
and I know what it means!

00:15:04.973 --> 00:15:06.037
I know exactly what it means,

00:15:06.037 --> 00:15:08.179
not because I ever studied
it from a textbook.

00:15:08.179 --> 00:15:10.236
I know what it means 'cause I met PJ

00:15:10.236 --> 00:15:11.873
at an Arthogryposis conference.

00:15:11.873 --> 00:15:15.111
I met PJ and a lot of
his friends with AMC.

00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:17.798
PJ's this incredible, incredible kid

00:15:17.798 --> 00:15:20.438
and he can't use his arms
because, or his hands,

00:15:20.438 --> 00:15:23.113
because of the type of
Arthogryposis that he has

00:15:23.113 --> 00:15:26.853
and so his family call his
eating technique his Viking dive

00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:28.817
'cause he'll go into his
plate of mashed potatoes

00:15:28.817 --> 00:15:30.210
and he comes up,

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.187
then he goes into his plate
of peas and he comes up,

00:15:32.187 --> 00:15:34.103
then he chases his
sisters around the table

00:15:34.103 --> 00:15:36.305
with a face full of
mashed potatoes and peas.

00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:37.319
(audience laughs)

00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:38.423
You will never, ever, ever forget

00:15:38.423 --> 00:15:40.993
Arthogryposis Multiplex Congenita

00:15:40.993 --> 00:15:44.339
because you will never,
ever, ever forget PJ.

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:46.801
I go to so many family
conferences in the summer months.

00:15:46.801 --> 00:15:48.657
Last summer, I went to
15 family conferences.

00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:52.882
They're always from the middle
of June to the end of July,

00:15:52.882 --> 00:15:54.803
beginning of August and I go

00:15:54.803 --> 00:15:56.328
and I take a billion photographs

00:15:56.328 --> 00:15:58.433
and we gift all those photographs
back to the foundations

00:15:58.433 --> 00:16:00.222
to use on their websites

00:16:00.222 --> 00:16:02.925
and their public awareness
materials and their brochures,

00:16:02.925 --> 00:16:05.700
whatever they can do to replace
those horrifying photographs

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.107
but I also now bring healthcare providers

00:16:08.107 --> 00:16:09.210
in training with me.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.958
I bring med students most importantly

00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.327
and genetic counseling students
and nursing students and OTs

00:16:13.327 --> 00:16:16.331
and PTs and I bring them in
and I shove them in daycare

00:16:16.331 --> 00:16:19.459
and I lock the door and
I check back in on them

00:16:19.459 --> 00:16:21.199
at the end of the day
and they're always like

00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:22.634
a little shell shocked
and they always have

00:16:22.634 --> 00:16:23.638
like a little poop on their shoulder

00:16:23.638 --> 00:16:25.069
and then they have like gum in their hair

00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:27.829
but they're gonna be
better healthcare providers

00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:30.406
'cause they're meeting these kids

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.051
not in the clinical environment,

00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:34.466
they're meeting these kids not in crisis.

00:16:34.466 --> 00:16:37.143
They're meeting these
gorgeous kids being kids

00:16:37.143 --> 00:16:39.251
and being the individuals
and being people.

00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:40.560
So it really is incredible,

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.285
making sure that we really instill

00:16:42.285 --> 00:16:44.837
and embed in early medical education

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.628
that it's never what you're treating,

00:16:46.628 --> 00:16:49.451
it's always, always who you're treating.

00:16:49.451 --> 00:16:51.985
So we've created this program
here which I'm gonna talk

00:16:51.985 --> 00:16:54.109
a little bit more about next called FRAME.

00:16:54.109 --> 00:16:58.680
FRAME is the Faces Redefining
the Art of Medical Education.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.017
It's an online based library featuring

00:17:02.017 --> 00:17:03.614
several genetic conditions,

00:17:03.614 --> 00:17:05.972
many genetic conditions,
physical conditions,

00:17:05.972 --> 00:17:07.348
intellectual conditions

00:17:07.348 --> 00:17:09.004
and developmental differences as well.

00:17:09.004 --> 00:17:12.687
Kinda creating opportunities
to kind of create and show

00:17:12.687 --> 00:17:15.540
and illustrate all the basic hallmarks

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.689
of a certain condition but as presented

00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:19.298
by somebody living with
the condition themselves

00:17:19.298 --> 00:17:21.206
or their family members,

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:25.373
putting front row and center
in medical education, humanity.

00:17:26.522 --> 00:17:27.819
Each gallery,

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.572
they're free to the public
and you can actually,

00:17:30.572 --> 00:17:32.947
can access all these in medical education.

00:17:32.947 --> 00:17:35.035
We have a mobile device which
I'll give you that number

00:17:35.035 --> 00:17:37.307
in a second but it really
is creating this library

00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:39.871
that not only has these very brief films,

00:17:39.871 --> 00:17:41.493
they're about six to seven minutes long

00:17:41.493 --> 00:17:43.315
'cause keeping in mind that med students

00:17:43.315 --> 00:17:44.906
have very short attention spans.

00:17:44.906 --> 00:17:45.976
(audience laughs)

00:17:45.976 --> 00:17:47.552
But it really is about
offering an opportunity

00:17:47.552 --> 00:17:49.605
to really get to meet
these kids firsthand,

00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:52.127
or individuals living with
this condition firsthand.

00:17:52.127 --> 00:17:53.593
This is one of our,

00:17:53.593 --> 00:17:55.209
this is gonna be a little compilation

00:17:55.209 --> 00:17:58.459
that I'll talk a bit about in a second.

00:18:10.018 --> 00:18:12.435
(soft music)

00:18:18.322 --> 00:18:19.939
- Hey, my name is Noah

00:18:19.939 --> 00:18:22.693
and I'd like to introduce
you to some of my friends.

00:18:22.693 --> 00:18:25.178
We all have a genetic
condition called albinism.

00:18:25.178 --> 00:18:28.554
You may have seen us in movies
or heard that we're all evil

00:18:28.554 --> 00:18:30.960
or have magic powers or have red eyes.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.127
We're like any other group of people,

00:18:33.127 --> 00:18:34.956
we're all different, we're all unique,

00:18:34.956 --> 00:18:37.726
and you will see here
the diversity among us.

00:18:37.726 --> 00:18:40.848
- Albinism affects people across the world

00:18:40.848 --> 00:18:43.814
from all ethnicities but
it's not only in humans.

00:18:43.814 --> 00:18:48.710
It affects animals too and
all kinds of them as well.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.492
- There are two main types of Albinism -

00:18:51.492 --> 00:18:54.011
Oculocutaneous and Ocular Albinism.

00:18:54.011 --> 00:18:57.159
Oculocutaneous affects the
eyes, the skins and the hair,

00:18:57.159 --> 00:18:59.909
and Ocular affects just the eyes.

00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:03.264
- Hi!

00:19:03.264 --> 00:19:04.674
- You say it's my birthday,
bah nah nah nah nar.

00:19:04.674 --> 00:19:05.749
- My name's Alex.

00:19:05.749 --> 00:19:06.926
- And I'm Ezra.

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:08.958
- And this is Cassie and Penelope.

00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:09.963
- Hello!

00:19:09.963 --> 00:19:10.973
- Hello!

00:19:10.973 --> 00:19:12.883
- And Cassie was born
with a genetic syndrome

00:19:12.883 --> 00:19:14.800
called Marfan Syndrome.

00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:18.236
- [Ezra] We wanted to
show you a feature Cassie

00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:19.633
was born with.

00:19:19.633 --> 00:19:20.841
As you can see,

00:19:20.841 --> 00:19:22.527
Cassie's chest sinks
inward toward the middle.

00:19:22.527 --> 00:19:25.185
This is called Pectus
Excavatum but, Penelope,

00:19:25.185 --> 00:19:27.823
what is it that you call,
you and Cassie call it?

00:19:27.823 --> 00:19:28.765
- Target.

00:19:28.765 --> 00:19:29.879
- Target.

00:19:29.879 --> 00:19:31.317
- [Alex] Why do we call it a target, Cass?

00:19:31.317 --> 00:19:33.625
- [Cassie] 'Cause Penelope
likes to shoot water at it.

00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:35.468
- Yeah, she used to laugh all the time

00:19:35.468 --> 00:19:36.620
when I put water in it.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.968
- [Rick] Why would you put water in there?

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:40.604
- Because that's what made her laugh.

00:19:40.604 --> 00:19:42.006
- Can you take a picture of it?

00:19:42.006 --> 00:19:43.268
- [Rick] I am, I'm doing it right now.

00:19:43.268 --> 00:19:45.310
I'm making a movie of it!

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.277
- [Female Narrator] Chromosomes
are the instructions

00:19:47.277 --> 00:19:49.685
that tell our bodies
how to grow and develop.

00:19:49.685 --> 00:19:53.285
Most people have two
copies of each chromosome

00:19:53.285 --> 00:19:56.549
for a total of 46 chromosomes.

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:59.682
Some people have 47 chromosomes.

00:19:59.682 --> 00:20:02.828
Most people who have Down
Syndrome have three copies

00:20:02.828 --> 00:20:06.411
of chromosome 21, also
known as Trisomy 21.

00:20:08.782 --> 00:20:13.111
This is caused by a sporadic
event known as non-disjunction

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:16.089
which usually occurs prior to conception.

00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:16.922
- I'm Max.

00:20:16.922 --> 00:20:18.032
- Hi, I'm Mitch.

00:20:18.032 --> 00:20:19.726
- I'm 15 years old.

00:20:19.726 --> 00:20:22.309
It's been a great world for me.

00:20:26.384 --> 00:20:30.551
It's basically like an extra
chromosome and that chromosome

00:20:31.703 --> 00:20:35.870
blends in the awesomeness and
blends in all of the loyalty

00:20:37.882 --> 00:20:41.632
and, you know, I could
go on and on about it.

00:20:42.719 --> 00:20:47.502
- Me and Myles have a
rare skin called confetti.

00:20:47.502 --> 00:20:51.538
It makes us very itchy
and our skin is very scaly

00:20:51.538 --> 00:20:54.159
so be very careful when you scrub us!

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:55.866
(laughs)

00:20:55.866 --> 00:20:57.404
(audience laughs)

00:20:57.404 --> 00:20:58.237
- Yay!

00:21:01.182 --> 00:21:03.417
It's a web-based library.

00:21:03.417 --> 00:21:07.178
We're building that library
and each FRAME piece

00:21:07.178 --> 00:21:10.341
is accessible on phones or on the computer

00:21:10.341 --> 00:21:13.308
but it'll have actually the
FRAME film itself translated,

00:21:13.308 --> 00:21:14.488
they'll be English captions

00:21:14.488 --> 00:21:16.346
and also in Spanish at the moment

00:21:16.346 --> 00:21:18.474
and we're adding other
languages as we go along

00:21:18.474 --> 00:21:21.358
and then it also has
a photographic gallery

00:21:21.358 --> 00:21:24.903
showing the diversity
within that diagnosis

00:21:24.903 --> 00:21:28.224
or syndrome community and
then there's also all the text

00:21:28.224 --> 00:21:30.834
that we'll show within
the actual diagnosis

00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:33.296
and actually within the FRAME
piece that can be studied,

00:21:33.296 --> 00:21:34.986
downloaded and printed, et cetera,

00:21:34.986 --> 00:21:36.597
for notes and notekeeping.

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:39.428
I'm really excited about,
right now to present,

00:21:39.428 --> 00:21:42.886
it's the world premiere
of our latest and greatest

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:45.982
FRAME piece on Fragile X Syndrome.

00:21:45.982 --> 00:21:47.267
Of course Fragile X Syndrome

00:21:47.267 --> 00:21:51.223
being the most commonly
thought of genetic condition,

00:21:51.223 --> 00:21:53.306
genetic marker for autism

00:21:54.788 --> 00:21:56.493
and I'd like to just present this now.

00:21:56.493 --> 00:21:58.374
This is actually done with a grant through

00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:00.552
the Special Hope Foundation
and helped us build our library

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:02.956
and we're growing and growing with this.

00:22:02.956 --> 00:22:04.036
So I'd like to introduce this.

00:22:04.036 --> 00:22:06.587
I've never seen this on the
screen so I'm really excited

00:22:06.587 --> 00:22:08.777
to share this with you
and I would like to ask

00:22:08.777 --> 00:22:11.403
for comments afterwards if that's okay

00:22:11.403 --> 00:22:13.324
and you can be really critical

00:22:13.324 --> 00:22:16.369
and you can be brutal
if you like, it's okay.

00:22:16.369 --> 00:22:18.326
So here we are, this is, oh, sorry,

00:22:18.326 --> 00:22:19.815
we're gonna show this first.

00:22:19.815 --> 00:22:23.420
If you text the word frame to 56512,

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.370
you can actually access these pieces

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.048
and we have nine of them
online at the moment

00:22:29.048 --> 00:22:31.688
and five ready to go and, I think,

00:22:31.688 --> 00:22:33.715
so we're ready to go with the next film?

00:22:33.715 --> 00:22:35.118
Is that okay?

00:22:35.118 --> 00:22:36.578
There we go.

00:22:36.578 --> 00:22:37.814
Fragile X in FRAME.

00:22:37.814 --> 00:22:39.075
Thank you.

00:22:39.075 --> 00:22:41.908
(uplifting music)

00:23:08.567 --> 00:23:10.074
- This is Brexton.

00:23:10.074 --> 00:23:13.741
He's 22 months old and
this is our Cole Cole

00:23:14.582 --> 00:23:15.832
and he is five.

00:23:16.875 --> 00:23:18.763
- My son, Cole, was born
with a genetic condition

00:23:18.763 --> 00:23:20.419
called Fragile X Syndrome.

00:23:20.419 --> 00:23:22.494
My family and other families
hope to teach you more

00:23:22.494 --> 00:23:23.919
about this condition.

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.881
Fragile X Syndrome is a genetic condition

00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:29.740
that causes intellectual
disability, behavioral,

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.066
and learning challenges

00:23:31.066 --> 00:23:33.308
and various physical characteristics.

00:23:33.308 --> 00:23:35.419
Though Fragile X occurs in both genders,

00:23:35.419 --> 00:23:38.185
males are more frequently
affected than females

00:23:38.185 --> 00:23:40.745
and generally with greater severity.

00:23:40.745 --> 00:23:42.609
Life expectancy is not affected in people

00:23:42.609 --> 00:23:44.418
with Fragile X Syndrome
because there are usually

00:23:44.418 --> 00:23:46.203
no life threatening
health concerns associated

00:23:46.203 --> 00:23:47.779
with the condition.

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:52.215
Fragile X Syndrome is caused
by mutations in the FMR1 gene.

00:23:52.215 --> 00:23:55.336
This condition has an unusual

00:23:55.336 --> 00:23:57.374
non-Mendelian inheritance pattern.

00:23:57.374 --> 00:24:00.420
Almost all cases are
caused by an expansion

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.079
of the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome.

00:24:03.079 --> 00:24:06.401
Usually the FMR1 gene
includes repetitive series

00:24:06.401 --> 00:24:09.486
of CGG triplets which is
repeated in most people

00:24:09.486 --> 00:24:11.403
from five to 45 times.

00:24:11.403 --> 00:24:13.655
Individuals with Fragile X Syndrome

00:24:13.655 --> 00:24:15.155
have more than 200 repeats,

00:24:15.155 --> 00:24:18.117
silencing the activity of this gene.

00:24:18.117 --> 00:24:20.012
- [Female] Fragile X Syndrome
is diagnosed in about

00:24:20.012 --> 00:24:23.738
one in 4,000 males and
one in 8,000 females.

00:24:23.738 --> 00:24:26.585
Females typically have
milder symptoms than males,

00:24:26.585 --> 00:24:28.643
although some females may have

00:24:28.643 --> 00:24:32.560
additional behavioral
features such as shyness.

00:24:34.218 --> 00:24:38.385
Cole was diagnosed with Fragile
X when he was 22 months old.

00:24:40.155 --> 00:24:42.655
He was not walking or talking.

00:24:44.075 --> 00:24:45.761
He started with the ear
infections the month

00:24:45.761 --> 00:24:49.290
after he turned one and
for the next few months,

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.836
he was on antibiotics probably
four out of the five months

00:24:52.836 --> 00:24:57.113
and we noticed that he
wasn't really responding,

00:24:57.113 --> 00:24:59.196
we didn't understand why.

00:25:00.956 --> 00:25:03.733
We had visited a neurologist just because

00:25:03.733 --> 00:25:06.214
the primary care physician
was a little bit confused

00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:08.298
where to put him and she said,

00:25:08.298 --> 00:25:10.620
"Well, he definitely doesn't have autism

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.728
"if that's why you're here but go through

00:25:12.728 --> 00:25:17.442
"with the tube surgery and
see what happens there but,

00:25:17.442 --> 00:25:18.730
"in the meantime,

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.853
"why don't we do these genetic testing

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:23.765
"while you already have
him under anesthesia."

00:25:23.765 --> 00:25:26.958
And so, within 24 hours of
him having the ear surgery,

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:30.524
the tube surgery, he was
walking without support.

00:25:30.524 --> 00:25:34.299
So we assumed that it was all
to do with all that fluid.

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:35.751
Maybe two weeks after the surgery,

00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:39.967
the neurologist called and
was completely baffled,

00:25:39.967 --> 00:25:42.060
said that she was completely shocked,

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.862
was not expecting that
result at all but that

00:25:44.862 --> 00:25:47.843
he had the full mutation of Fragile X.

00:25:47.843 --> 00:25:49.772
Cole's number was 300.

00:25:49.772 --> 00:25:51.790
- The diagnosis didn't change who he was

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.475
and he was still a super fun, happy kid

00:25:54.475 --> 00:25:57.475
and then so we kind of accepted that

00:26:00.267 --> 00:26:03.804
and have been working towards
getting the most help we can

00:26:03.804 --> 00:26:07.650
at the early age where
it can help the most.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.737
- Hi, I'm Brian.

00:26:08.737 --> 00:26:10.027
- I'm Haley.

00:26:10.027 --> 00:26:11.726
- Justin's 15.

00:26:11.726 --> 00:26:15.099
We got diagnosed with
Fragile X on or around

00:26:15.099 --> 00:26:16.227
when he was five years old

00:26:16.227 --> 00:26:18.091
after his first Grand Mal seizure.

00:26:18.091 --> 00:26:20.672
About 20% of all kids with
Fragile X have seizures.

00:26:20.672 --> 00:26:22.902
Haley's been an amazing sister.

00:26:22.902 --> 00:26:26.418
She has always supported Justin fully

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:29.489
and she even has a saying which is,

00:26:29.489 --> 00:26:32.898
Justin is her social barometer
and if there was anybody

00:26:32.898 --> 00:26:35.750
who wanted to be her
friend, come into the house,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.936
or be a part of her life,

00:26:36.936 --> 00:26:38.317
- He has to meet Justin.

00:26:38.317 --> 00:26:40.553
- If they did not get along
with Justin or accept Justin

00:26:40.553 --> 00:26:41.971
for who he was,

00:26:41.971 --> 00:26:43.179
that was the end of that relationship

00:26:43.179 --> 00:26:45.052
and she would move onto whomever

00:26:45.052 --> 00:26:47.846
would be open and welcoming.

00:26:47.846 --> 00:26:50.400
Many males with Fragile X
Syndrome are likely to have

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.616
the following features:

00:26:51.616 --> 00:26:55.873
long, narrow face, large ears,
prominent jaws and forehead.

00:26:55.873 --> 00:26:57.986
Approximately half of
females with Fragile X

00:26:57.986 --> 00:26:59.703
also have these features.

00:26:59.703 --> 00:27:03.035
flexible fingers, flat
feet and enlarged testicles

00:27:03.035 --> 00:27:05.318
can also be seen after puberty.

00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:08.113
These features may become
more apparent with age.

00:27:08.113 --> 00:27:10.079
- [Haley] Pre-pubertal males
tend to have normal growth

00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:12.541
but large occipitofrontal
head circumference.

00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:13.458
- I'm Tara.

00:27:14.457 --> 00:27:15.817
- I'm Steve.

00:27:15.817 --> 00:27:17.051
- I'm Jason.

00:27:17.051 --> 00:27:18.530
- Andrew.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.863
- Andrew was diagnosed first

00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:24.872
with the autism spectrum disorder,

00:27:26.547 --> 00:27:30.714
just the generic PDDNOS and
the doctor we were seeing said,

00:27:32.521 --> 00:27:34.861
"I think you need some other testing.

00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:37.316
"He doesn't quite fit
all the characteristics

00:27:37.316 --> 00:27:38.913
"'cause he's so social."

00:27:38.913 --> 00:27:41.886
Lo and behold, we got a
call that they were shocked

00:27:41.886 --> 00:27:46.053
that he had it and so that began
our journey with Fragile X.

00:27:52.197 --> 00:27:54.614
Jason was born and they said,

00:27:54.614 --> 00:27:56.603
oh, he's probably gonna be a carrier.

00:27:56.603 --> 00:27:59.246
- [Steve] It turned out
that he was full Fragile X.

00:27:59.246 --> 00:28:00.197
- [Tara] Yes.

00:28:00.197 --> 00:28:01.378
- [Steve] Whereas Andrew is a

00:28:01.378 --> 00:28:02.867
mosaic.
- [Tara] Mosaic.

00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:06.761
So two completely different presentations

00:28:06.761 --> 00:28:09.290
and two completely different answers.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.752
- A highly characteristic
behavioral feature

00:28:11.752 --> 00:28:14.425
of Fragile X is males and
females is gaze aversion,

00:28:14.425 --> 00:28:17.610
a distinctive type of poor
eye contact where the person

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.407
actively diverts his or her eyes.

00:28:19.407 --> 00:28:22.756
Hand flapping and hand
biting are nearly universal

00:28:22.756 --> 00:28:26.038
in young boys and most
girls with Fragile X.

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:27.990
While the physical features
of Fragile X Syndrome

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.139
can be very subtle in
pre-pubertal children,

00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:32.304
the triad of gaze aversion,

00:28:32.304 --> 00:28:34.216
hand flapping and hand
biting in young children

00:28:34.216 --> 00:28:36.459
with global developmental delay,

00:28:36.459 --> 00:28:39.133
is highly suggestive
of Fragile X Syndrome.

00:28:39.133 --> 00:28:43.384
Expressive language has
been delayed significantly.

00:28:43.384 --> 00:28:46.213
It seems as if that has
been his biggest hit

00:28:46.213 --> 00:28:50.081
but it's coming and so
he's at the point now

00:28:50.081 --> 00:28:51.266
where he'll ask questions.

00:28:51.266 --> 00:28:52.258
So that's coming.

00:28:52.258 --> 00:28:55.366
The other thing is the
attention and the hyperactivity

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:59.304
and he definitely has
both of those things,

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:02.549
especially in a learning
environment where the classroom

00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:06.224
is structured so that you have eight desks

00:29:06.224 --> 00:29:08.532
all sitting in one direction,
listening to a lecture,

00:29:08.532 --> 00:29:13.094
and that's probably not
going to fit him. (laughs)

00:29:13.094 --> 00:29:15.960
- So one of the advantages
is, he loves electronics.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.453
So any kind of therapeutic stuff

00:29:19.453 --> 00:29:23.120
that we can get on the
iPads and on his iPod

00:29:24.683 --> 00:29:26.874
work out well for him 'cause he likes

00:29:26.874 --> 00:29:29.296
to do the electronic piece.

00:29:29.296 --> 00:29:31.311
He's more of a follower.

00:29:31.311 --> 00:29:33.365
He likes to watch him
do the stuff. (laughs)

00:29:33.365 --> 00:29:37.532
- Andrew's mainstreamed for
social studies and science

00:29:38.525 --> 00:29:41.177
and art and music and gym.

00:29:41.177 --> 00:29:45.240
Part of the day he goes to his
support classes for reading,

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.657
math and english.

00:29:47.755 --> 00:29:49.493
- One of the most interesting
things about Justin is,

00:29:49.493 --> 00:29:52.583
in order for him to
cognitively figure things out,

00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:54.854
he does it in forms of
questions and I know this

00:29:54.854 --> 00:29:56.455
is very typical with Fragile X

00:29:56.455 --> 00:29:59.084
and so he has a set of questions
that he will go through

00:29:59.084 --> 00:30:01.877
over and over and over
again but it's a way for him

00:30:01.877 --> 00:30:03.161
to get information.

00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:04.132
Right, Justin?

00:30:04.132 --> 00:30:05.235
- Mm Hmm (affirmative).

00:30:05.235 --> 00:30:06.183
- Awesome, right?

00:30:06.183 --> 00:30:07.156
Can I get a high five?

00:30:07.156 --> 00:30:09.944
- [Tara] When there is
an interest in a subject,

00:30:09.944 --> 00:30:14.111
there's a zero in on a focus
for what they can learn

00:30:16.066 --> 00:30:18.696
and what they really can do.

00:30:18.696 --> 00:30:21.235
- So it's a matter of just
finding what interests them

00:30:21.235 --> 00:30:24.923
and then using it to your
advantage to help them

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:27.333
improve their skills.

00:30:27.333 --> 00:30:28.559
- [Haley] With Fragile X Syndrome,

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:31.730
there is also a higher prevalence
of mitral valve prolapse

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.994
than in the general population.

00:30:32.994 --> 00:30:36.483
Other medical conditions
that can be seen as part of

00:30:36.483 --> 00:30:37.868
Fragile X Syndrome include:

00:30:37.868 --> 00:30:42.228
recurrent otitis media
and hypotonia in infancy.

00:30:42.228 --> 00:30:45.102
Approximately 15% of
males and 5% of females

00:30:45.102 --> 00:30:47.385
with Fragile X have seizures.

00:30:47.385 --> 00:30:49.201
- I typically look at
three different levers

00:30:49.201 --> 00:30:52.091
when you think about anyone
associated with Fragile X.

00:30:52.091 --> 00:30:55.848
You have an anxiety lever,
you have a behavioral lever,

00:30:55.848 --> 00:31:00.368
and then you have a mental
impairment lever and so,

00:31:00.368 --> 00:31:02.082
because it's a syndrome, you know,

00:31:02.082 --> 00:31:05.563
everyone affected by Fragile
X has a different portion

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:07.701
of each of those levers and so,

00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:09.982
in Justin's case, he
has debilitating anxiety

00:31:09.982 --> 00:31:12.338
which really hurts him
with the transitions

00:31:12.338 --> 00:31:15.002
and actually just being
ready to do things.

00:31:15.002 --> 00:31:16.407
On the mental impairment side,

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.984
he's actually higher on
the cognitive ability.

00:31:18.984 --> 00:31:22.478
His puzzle ability, his ability
to think, it's all in there.

00:31:22.478 --> 00:31:23.797
We say that all the time.

00:31:23.797 --> 00:31:25.195
Just waiting for it to all, to come out,

00:31:25.195 --> 00:31:28.141
but his behaviors
associated with his anxiety

00:31:28.141 --> 00:31:31.671
are typically very bad
especially when he was younger.

00:31:31.671 --> 00:31:33.582
- [Haley] Behaviors in males
with Fragile X Syndrome

00:31:33.582 --> 00:31:34.533
often include:

00:31:34.533 --> 00:31:38.195
tactile defensiveness, poor
eye contact, repetitive speech,

00:31:38.195 --> 00:31:40.567
problems in impulse control
control and distractibility.

00:31:40.567 --> 00:31:44.504
A majority of boys and many
girls with Fragile X Syndrome

00:31:44.504 --> 00:31:47.504
exhibit features of
autism spectrum disorder.

00:31:47.504 --> 00:31:48.556
- It takes time to figure it out,

00:31:48.556 --> 00:31:50.377
figure out what works for your kid,

00:31:50.377 --> 00:31:53.567
'cause every kid truly is different.

00:31:53.567 --> 00:31:57.734
We have two and they
respond differently (laughs)

00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:01.633
to different things just
like any other two kids

00:32:01.633 --> 00:32:05.164
we would've had would respond differently.

00:32:05.164 --> 00:32:07.205
- He's brightened many
a people's life, I feel,

00:32:07.205 --> 00:32:09.543
with his smiles and his happiness.

00:32:09.543 --> 00:32:11.431
- And I don't know if that's
necessarily a Fragile X thing

00:32:11.431 --> 00:32:14.802
or that's a Cole thing
but we like it. (laughs)

00:32:14.802 --> 00:32:18.135
(light uplifting music)

00:32:19.688 --> 00:32:22.695
(audience applause)

00:32:22.695 --> 00:32:23.528
- Yay!

00:32:24.414 --> 00:32:25.617
Well, that was kind of exciting.

00:32:25.617 --> 00:32:27.398
I love seeing that.

00:32:27.398 --> 00:32:28.933
There we go.

00:32:28.933 --> 00:32:30.390
So I am gonna ask for,

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.599
does anybody have any
comments or criticism

00:32:32.599 --> 00:32:33.994
or help with this?

00:32:33.994 --> 00:32:36.566
'Cause we really want
this to be a really useful

00:32:36.566 --> 00:32:38.531
and great tool but we want it,

00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:40.426
I won't be insulted, I promise.

00:32:40.426 --> 00:32:41.699
Yes?

00:32:41.699 --> 00:32:46.473
- [Female] I just want to say
that, generally, (inaudible)

00:32:46.473 --> 00:32:47.866
- Yeah, of course.

00:32:47.866 --> 00:32:50.822
- [Female] And if I had
something like this available,

00:32:50.822 --> 00:32:53.528
I would so much rather look
at that than (inaudible),

00:32:53.528 --> 00:32:54.486
anyday.

00:32:54.486 --> 00:32:55.435
- Yay.

00:32:55.435 --> 00:32:56.435
Hello.

00:32:56.435 --> 00:32:57.384
(laughs)

00:32:57.384 --> 00:32:58.344
(audience claps)

00:32:58.344 --> 00:32:59.300
Thank you for that.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.264
Me too, me too, me too.

00:33:00.264 --> 00:33:01.284
Thank you and we're building that library.

00:33:01.284 --> 00:33:02.245
Yes.

00:33:02.245 --> 00:33:04.049
- [Female] Yeah, I just want
to say how important it is

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:07.408
to change the culture
from a medical (inaudible)

00:33:07.408 --> 00:33:11.807
because just like all
the stuff we saw today

00:33:11.807 --> 00:33:15.294
about cultural perspective,
our culture, you know,

00:33:15.294 --> 00:33:20.170
really disempowers and looks
at people with disability,

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.630
even the medical people who
are supposedly detached,

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.880
have that frame of reference because --

00:33:27.731 --> 00:33:28.804
- Sure.

00:33:28.804 --> 00:33:30.430
- It's not as human --

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:31.858
- Sure, sure.

00:33:31.858 --> 00:33:34.169
- And this is, like this kind
of thing, helps change that.

00:33:34.169 --> 00:33:35.406
- Right.

00:33:35.406 --> 00:33:36.752
Thank you, thank, that's it,

00:33:36.752 --> 00:33:38.299
and that's kind of why we're doing this

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:39.460
is really to bring in,

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.774
to make sure that we understand

00:33:40.774 --> 00:33:42.714
and we can present the
healthcare providers in training,

00:33:42.714 --> 00:33:44.798
embed early in their education,

00:33:44.798 --> 00:33:47.292
that the families are also
part of that treatment.

00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:50.563
Nobody's gonna know more about that kid

00:33:50.563 --> 00:33:51.890
than his mother or father.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.081
They're not gonna know,

00:33:53.081 --> 00:33:55.656
they're definitely gonna
know more than that doctor

00:33:55.656 --> 00:33:56.940
so the idea is,

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.739
and just listening over the last 20 years

00:33:58.739 --> 00:34:01.731
with Positive Exposure really
making these relationships

00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:04.567
and bringing all and
hearing all these voices

00:34:04.567 --> 00:34:07.290
and translating that to create a new model

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.206
that adds humanity and
medical education is so key.

00:34:10.206 --> 00:34:11.039
Yes, sir?

00:34:11.962 --> 00:34:14.921
- [Male] (inaudible)

00:34:14.921 --> 00:34:15.873
- Mm Hmm (affirmative).

00:34:15.873 --> 00:34:16.834
Sure.

00:34:16.834 --> 00:34:21.001
- [Male] It took me as many
years to get (inaudible).

00:34:25.511 --> 00:34:26.847
- Great.

00:34:26.847 --> 00:34:28.045
Awesome.

00:34:28.045 --> 00:34:28.987
Great, that's amazing.

00:34:28.987 --> 00:34:29.960
Yes.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.600
- [Male] I want to say like everybody else

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.758
that I love (inaudible).

00:34:35.758 --> 00:34:36.818
The only other comment that I can make --

00:34:36.818 --> 00:34:37.998
- Sure.

00:34:37.998 --> 00:34:40.973
- [Male] You had a few
pictures of women and color.

00:34:40.973 --> 00:34:45.140
I would love to see more
women and young women of color

00:34:46.283 --> 00:34:49.950
if they would be willing
in a final product.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.613
- Okay and that's, perfect
and that's a great criticism

00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:55.943
and what we're doing is, we're using this,

00:34:55.943 --> 00:34:58.165
now I've been to several
Fragile X conferences

00:34:58.165 --> 00:35:00.613
and the next one we're gonna
go and we'll premiere it

00:35:00.613 --> 00:35:02.756
to the families 'cause it
turns out that not only

00:35:02.756 --> 00:35:04.781
does this work for healthcare
providers in training

00:35:04.781 --> 00:35:06.777
but it's also great for
families to introduce

00:35:06.777 --> 00:35:08.980
the condition in the school
environment for the kids.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.102
What we'll do is we'll
be adding onto this.

00:35:11.102 --> 00:35:14.185
So these are all housed on a website,

00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:18.279
on our PositiveExposure.org site.

00:35:18.279 --> 00:35:20.528
It's under FRAME and then
you can pull up all that

00:35:20.528 --> 00:35:23.147
and we're gonna be adding various
films and various friends.

00:35:23.147 --> 00:35:25.937
So we have the one day of shoot
just for financial reasons.

00:35:25.937 --> 00:35:28.312
We just shoot the one shoot
and we want everybody to come

00:35:28.312 --> 00:35:31.045
and they come but then we're
gonna keep building on this

00:35:31.045 --> 00:35:34.261
and all the actual websites
that have all the up to date,

00:35:34.261 --> 00:35:36.594
pertinent information, whether
it be the support group,

00:35:36.594 --> 00:35:39.358
advocacy for families or
really up to date information,

00:35:39.358 --> 00:35:42.566
medical information, will all
be listed on this site as well

00:35:42.566 --> 00:35:44.714
so it will become, eventually, a one,

00:35:44.714 --> 00:35:47.464
kind of a pure 100% resource

00:35:48.696 --> 00:35:50.692
for all these genetic conditions.

00:35:50.692 --> 00:35:51.732
It will be pretty exciting.

00:35:51.732 --> 00:35:52.682
Thank you.

00:35:52.682 --> 00:35:53.639
Yes.

00:35:53.639 --> 00:35:56.889
- [Female] (inaudible)

00:36:09.863 --> 00:36:10.696
- Sure.

00:36:18.527 --> 00:36:19.360
Sure.

00:36:20.834 --> 00:36:21.667
Great.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.421
Sure, wonderful.

00:36:24.421 --> 00:36:25.254
Thank you.

00:36:26.124 --> 00:36:26.957
Yes.

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:32.100
- [Female] (inaudible)

00:36:39.138 --> 00:36:40.638
- Sure, of course.

00:36:44.027 --> 00:36:45.216
Great, thank you.

00:36:45.216 --> 00:36:46.393
Well, when we create these,

00:36:46.393 --> 00:36:48.632
we create these with a
whole team of geneticists

00:36:48.632 --> 00:36:51.150
but also med students,
genetic counseling students,

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.522
family members, the
advocacy support groups.

00:36:53.522 --> 00:36:57.283
So what we're also trying to
do and one of the criteria,

00:36:57.283 --> 00:36:58.464
the main criteria,

00:36:58.464 --> 00:37:01.412
is to forge new relationships
and new friendships

00:37:01.412 --> 00:37:04.512
with people that generally
don't speak to one another

00:37:04.512 --> 00:37:06.358
although they're all in
the same service industry

00:37:06.358 --> 00:37:08.506
but they don't see or hear one another

00:37:08.506 --> 00:37:10.350
and then we're bringing them all in here

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.251
so now these are friendships
that are gonna be formed

00:37:12.251 --> 00:37:14.578
and forged for life so
it's really exciting.

00:37:14.578 --> 00:37:16.575
So I'd like to show an additional one.

00:37:16.575 --> 00:37:17.539
I have one more.

00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:19.321
This one will be on Down Syndrome.

00:37:19.321 --> 00:37:21.019
So I thought it was appropriate for this.

00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:24.102
So we can go to the next one, thanks.

00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:31.186
Alright, maybe I can change it myself.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.083
Oh, maybe?

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.150
I think so.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.483
Can we get that?

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:43.057
(light uplifting music)

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.414
- Hi, my name is David and I am here

00:37:52.414 --> 00:37:54.414
with some of my friends.

00:37:55.452 --> 00:37:59.619
We are here today to talk
to you about Down Syndrome.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.083
- So when Henry was born,

00:38:10.083 --> 00:38:13.083
he got the regular kind of once over

00:38:14.389 --> 00:38:18.311
and he had what they initially
said to us very cautiously

00:38:18.311 --> 00:38:22.221
was that he had features
suggestive of Down Syndrome

00:38:22.221 --> 00:38:26.782
and I was kind of stunned
by these tiny features

00:38:26.782 --> 00:38:30.555
that seemed to be so
telling to the doctors.

00:38:30.555 --> 00:38:33.784
So the low muscle tone,
we could definitely see,

00:38:33.784 --> 00:38:35.951
but then his little finger

00:38:37.019 --> 00:38:38.887
is a little bit crooked they said.

00:38:38.887 --> 00:38:41.177
His ears were small.

00:38:41.177 --> 00:38:45.260
He had a shallow bridge
of the nose, tiny little,

00:38:48.868 --> 00:38:52.926
his eyes were maybe more widely
set than someone else's eyes

00:38:52.926 --> 00:38:57.093
so it was remarkable to me
that all of these tiny signals

00:38:58.111 --> 00:39:00.894
could add up to something.

00:39:00.894 --> 00:39:05.061
So we then did the blood
test and so the diagnosis

00:39:06.307 --> 00:39:09.307
was confirmed about two weeks later.

00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:13.388
Chromosomes are the instructions
that tell our bodies

00:39:13.388 --> 00:39:15.084
how to grow and develop.

00:39:15.084 --> 00:39:18.920
Most people have two
copies of each chromosome

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.132
for a total of 46 chromosomes.

00:39:21.132 --> 00:39:24.303
Some people have 47 chromosomes.

00:39:24.303 --> 00:39:26.991
Most people who have Down Syndrome,

00:39:26.991 --> 00:39:31.158
have three copies of chromosome
21 also known as Trisomy 21.

00:39:34.197 --> 00:39:38.615
This is caused by a sporadic
event known as non-disjunction

00:39:38.615 --> 00:39:42.032
which usually occurs prior to conception.

00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:47.982
- Each child is unique
and special (laughs)

00:39:47.982 --> 00:39:51.583
and has specific needs that are different.

00:39:51.583 --> 00:39:53.894
Get to know the person
that you're working with.

00:39:53.894 --> 00:39:57.977
The diagnosis can be the
same but each individual

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:01.097
is an individual.

00:40:01.097 --> 00:40:03.025
Children with Down Syndrome are expected

00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:06.118
to reach developmental
milestones as other children,

00:40:06.118 --> 00:40:08.541
however, it may take a little bit longer

00:40:08.541 --> 00:40:10.208
than other children.

00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:13.566
People with Down Syndrome

00:40:13.566 --> 00:40:16.494
have characteristic facial features.

00:40:16.494 --> 00:40:18.831
For example, you may see folds of the skin

00:40:18.831 --> 00:40:23.252
on the inner corner of their
eyes called epicanthal folds.

00:40:23.252 --> 00:40:25.822
You may notice that the
nose looks a little flatter

00:40:25.822 --> 00:40:27.827
at the top between the eyes.

00:40:27.827 --> 00:40:31.160
This is called a depressed nasal bridge.

00:40:32.056 --> 00:40:35.787
Individuals may have eyes
that slant slightly upward

00:40:35.787 --> 00:40:40.145
which is called upslanting
palpebral fissures.

00:40:40.145 --> 00:40:44.706
Another physical feature
commonly seen in Down Syndrome

00:40:44.706 --> 00:40:47.411
is called a single palmar crease.

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:50.636
This used to be called a simian
crease but has been changed

00:40:50.636 --> 00:40:53.322
to better describe this feature.

00:40:53.322 --> 00:40:55.840
This is when someone has one crease

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.996
that goes across the hand.

00:40:57.996 --> 00:41:00.911
About half of people with
Down Syndrome have this crease

00:41:00.911 --> 00:41:03.160
on at least one hand.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.946
It develops during the fetal period.

00:41:05.946 --> 00:41:08.475
These features don't
cause problems in children

00:41:08.475 --> 00:41:09.867
with Down Syndrome.

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:11.569
People without the syndrome

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:14.689
can also have some of
these features as well.

00:41:14.689 --> 00:41:15.716
- I'm Max.

00:41:15.716 --> 00:41:16.923
- Hi, I'm Mitch.

00:41:16.923 --> 00:41:18.506
- I'm 15 years old.

00:41:19.864 --> 00:41:23.106
It's been a great world for me.

00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:26.356
It's basically like an extra chromosome

00:41:27.853 --> 00:41:31.603
and that chromosome
blends in the awesomeness

00:41:32.565 --> 00:41:36.482
and blends in all of the
loyalty and, you know,

00:41:37.831 --> 00:41:40.655
I could go on and on about it

00:41:40.655 --> 00:41:43.547
but this person sitting right here

00:41:43.547 --> 00:41:46.714
because he is the light of the future.

00:41:47.587 --> 00:41:51.004
I love him and I got to just say this but

00:41:52.654 --> 00:41:56.640
this son of a gun is part of (inaudible).

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.922
I love you.

00:41:57.922 --> 00:41:59.339
- I love you too.

00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:01.750
- 'Cause everyone with
Down Syndrome is unique,

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.233
different people with Down Syndrome

00:42:03.233 --> 00:42:04.875
have different abilities.

00:42:04.875 --> 00:42:06.293
Max shows us what he can do

00:42:06.293 --> 00:42:07.989
and we celebrate those achievements

00:42:07.989 --> 00:42:09.997
as we would with our other child

00:42:09.997 --> 00:42:11.834
who does not have Down Syndrome.

00:42:11.834 --> 00:42:14.111
- Hi, I'm Erica and this is my mom, Norma.

00:42:14.111 --> 00:42:15.444
I love to dance.

00:42:17.072 --> 00:42:20.232
I choreograph my own dances.

00:42:20.232 --> 00:42:23.943
- Some health problems are
more common among people

00:42:23.943 --> 00:42:28.236
with Down Syndrome than
the general population.

00:42:28.236 --> 00:42:31.781
Between 40 and 60% of children
born with Down Syndrome

00:42:31.781 --> 00:42:34.311
will have a congenital heart defect.

00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:36.851
About five to 10% of
people with Down Syndrome

00:42:36.851 --> 00:42:39.221
are born with an intestinal blockage

00:42:39.221 --> 00:42:42.033
called duodenal atresia,

00:42:42.033 --> 00:42:44.317
others will have gastroesophageal reflux.

00:42:44.317 --> 00:42:49.019
Some other specific digestive
conditions can also be seen

00:42:49.019 --> 00:42:53.179
more commonly than in
the general population.

00:42:53.179 --> 00:42:55.624
AV canal, a specific heart defect,

00:42:55.624 --> 00:42:59.687
is more common in babies with
Down Syndrome than without.

00:42:59.687 --> 00:43:02.740
An AV canal occurs when
the septum that separates

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.015
the left and right sides of
the heart has a hole in it.

00:43:06.015 --> 00:43:09.369
This also causes the valves
that separate the upper part

00:43:09.369 --> 00:43:12.836
and the lower part of the
heart to not form properly.

00:43:12.836 --> 00:43:16.590
Instead of two valves,
there's only one large valve.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:20.622
The hearts of people with
an AV canal must work harder

00:43:20.622 --> 00:43:23.782
than a typical heart which can
cause it to become enlarged

00:43:23.782 --> 00:43:25.615
if it is not repaired.

00:43:26.454 --> 00:43:27.577
- I'm Lisa.

00:43:27.577 --> 00:43:28.863
- I'm Gina.

00:43:28.863 --> 00:43:30.340
- I'm Angelo.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.817
- [Lisa] Sometimes people with
Down Syndrome have a tongue

00:43:32.817 --> 00:43:34.409
that actually looks a little bit bigger

00:43:34.409 --> 00:43:37.223
than it typically is and this
is called a protruding tongue.

00:43:37.223 --> 00:43:39.692
In some cases, the
tongue is a little larger

00:43:39.692 --> 00:43:43.332
than the typical size and
this is known as macroglossia

00:43:43.332 --> 00:43:44.621
and, in other cases,

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:46.351
the mouth may be slightly smaller

00:43:46.351 --> 00:43:48.172
which gives the appearance of a tongue

00:43:48.172 --> 00:43:51.328
actually being enlarged
and, in other cases,

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:54.018
the protrusion may just
be due to poor muscle tone

00:43:54.018 --> 00:43:56.435
and this is called hypotonia.

00:43:57.412 --> 00:44:01.690
- The fears and what you have
in your mind as far as what

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.771
your child is gonna be like

00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:08.342
and what the worst case scenarios
that go through your mind

00:44:08.342 --> 00:44:10.225
and then the reality,

00:44:10.225 --> 00:44:14.745
once the person is born,
once Angelo was born,

00:44:14.745 --> 00:44:17.462
it couldn't have been more different.

00:44:17.462 --> 00:44:19.320
- My name's Anthony.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.987
I'm also known as Aedon's daddy.

00:44:23.006 --> 00:44:24.267
- I'm Jordana.

00:44:24.267 --> 00:44:25.938
I'm Aedon's mom.

00:44:25.938 --> 00:44:26.939
Who are you?

00:44:26.939 --> 00:44:27.951
- No!

00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:28.957
(both laugh)

00:44:28.957 --> 00:44:30.024
- This is Aedon.

00:44:30.024 --> 00:44:31.280
When you look at Aedon,

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.104
you will see a very active, healthy,

00:44:33.104 --> 00:44:35.568
seven and a half year old
which he absolutely is

00:44:35.568 --> 00:44:38.529
but when you scratch the
surface a little bit,

00:44:38.529 --> 00:44:40.657
I'll just go down the list
of the things that Aedon has

00:44:40.657 --> 00:44:42.951
that are frequently
diagnosed with children

00:44:42.951 --> 00:44:44.138
with Down Syndrome.

00:44:44.138 --> 00:44:45.860
He has hypothyroidism.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:50.027
He wears bilateral SMO
orthotics to help him ambulate

00:44:50.925 --> 00:44:54.249
and he's been wearing those
since he was two years old

00:44:54.249 --> 00:44:55.961
and they were crucial for
him to develop independence

00:44:55.961 --> 00:44:57.440
and walking.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.614
He also has glasses for astigmatism.

00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:03.935
He also did have surgery
to remove his tonsils

00:45:03.935 --> 00:45:07.255
and shave his adenoids
for severe sleep apnea

00:45:07.255 --> 00:45:11.982
and then he has recently
been diagnosed with ADHD.

00:45:11.982 --> 00:45:14.123
- The first thing is to
congratulate the family.

00:45:14.123 --> 00:45:17.299
Again, the nurses are wonderful
congratulating the families.

00:45:17.299 --> 00:45:19.531
The doctors don't do that right away,

00:45:19.531 --> 00:45:21.403
they're not sure of how
the family feels about it

00:45:21.403 --> 00:45:23.767
but I think no matter
what the family feels,

00:45:23.767 --> 00:45:26.416
it's just congratulate, a child is born,

00:45:26.416 --> 00:45:28.422
and that's the first thing they should do

00:45:28.422 --> 00:45:30.248
is congratulate you and say,

00:45:30.248 --> 00:45:31.780
"You have this beautiful child

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.763
"and they happen to have Down Syndrome."

00:45:33.763 --> 00:45:36.041
That's how our doctor, our
pediatrician, had the approach.

00:45:36.041 --> 00:45:39.602
He was the first person
to congratulate us.

00:45:39.602 --> 00:45:40.833
- [Sean] Children with Down Syndrome

00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:42.626
may also have hearing infections

00:45:42.626 --> 00:45:45.014
more than the children
without Down Syndrome.

00:45:45.014 --> 00:45:47.899
There are also other
problems that could happen

00:45:47.899 --> 00:45:52.349
with the ears, nose and throat
in people with Down Syndrome.

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:53.990
- Of course, she had heart surgery, right?

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:57.761
June 2005, she was 22 months
old and in December 2006,

00:45:57.761 --> 00:46:01.670
she had her tonsils and adenoids out.

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:02.753
- A lot of kids with Down Syndrome

00:46:02.753 --> 00:46:05.159
are just slightly more
complicated medically

00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:08.892
and so Max had his own complications.

00:46:08.892 --> 00:46:10.518
He was hypothyroid.

00:46:10.518 --> 00:46:15.487
He was very congested so
he had a bunch of adenoids

00:46:15.487 --> 00:46:17.371
and tubes and things like that.

00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:20.167
He's got sleep apnea so
he doesn't sleep great

00:46:20.167 --> 00:46:24.695
but now that he wears the pilot
mask he sleeps much better

00:46:24.695 --> 00:46:26.945
but he's reasonably robust.

00:46:29.832 --> 00:46:31.984
He's one of the stronger people I know,

00:46:31.984 --> 00:46:34.738
hits the golf ball a mile, he
remembers everybody's name.

00:46:34.738 --> 00:46:37.014
He's the best speller at his school.

00:46:37.014 --> 00:46:38.702
So, yeah, there's some,

00:46:38.702 --> 00:46:42.718
it's a complicated puzzle
but once you figure it out,

00:46:42.718 --> 00:46:44.718
it's really, really fun.

00:46:46.359 --> 00:46:49.692
(light uplifting music)

00:47:50.538 --> 00:47:53.456
(audience applause)

00:47:53.456 --> 00:47:54.479
- So excited.

00:47:54.479 --> 00:47:57.003
It's so much fun to work
on these FRAME pieces

00:47:57.003 --> 00:47:58.559
'cause they're really, once again,

00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:00.717
it's about the experience
of bringing the families in,

00:48:00.717 --> 00:48:03.602
empowering our ambassadors
and their families

00:48:03.602 --> 00:48:06.478
and then our communities
and really presenting these

00:48:06.478 --> 00:48:08.235
to healthcare providers in training but,

00:48:08.235 --> 00:48:09.795
of course, as I side earlier,

00:48:09.795 --> 00:48:11.728
families are using
these to introduce these

00:48:11.728 --> 00:48:16.239
in the classroom environment
and the social arenas as well.

00:48:16.239 --> 00:48:19.401
We've created so, we have
10 right now on our site.

00:48:19.401 --> 00:48:23.461
We've just finished 22Q
1.2 Deletion in FRAME

00:48:23.461 --> 00:48:26.893
in collaboration with
Nationwide Children's Hospital.

00:48:26.893 --> 00:48:30.130
We created a Cystic Fibrosis
in FRAME in collaboration

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.112
with Harvard Brigham and
Women's, the Lung Center,

00:48:33.112 --> 00:48:34.782
and Children's Hospital - Boston.

00:48:34.782 --> 00:48:37.784
We've created and there are
others that are on our website.

00:48:37.784 --> 00:48:40.607
Our next step that we're
creating is we're looking at

00:48:40.607 --> 00:48:42.690
creating autism in FRAME.

00:48:44.207 --> 00:48:46.416
We're creating opportunities
to really kind of look

00:48:46.416 --> 00:48:48.278
beyond the diagnosis to show the diversity

00:48:48.278 --> 00:48:49.545
within that diagnosis,

00:48:49.545 --> 00:48:51.444
really targeting healthcare providers

00:48:51.444 --> 00:48:54.386
and breaking that fear and that
stigma that would be there.

00:48:54.386 --> 00:48:56.840
Also looking at intellectual
disabilities as well,

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.409
creating much more of a
symptomatic but really kind of

00:48:59.409 --> 00:49:01.538
creating opportunities
to start that dialogue

00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:04.331
in the healthcare education community

00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:07.853
and then looking at also Cerebral
Palsy, we're gonna create,

00:49:07.853 --> 00:49:10.428
and then looking at and
taking it even further,

00:49:10.428 --> 00:49:12.817
we're looking at Fetal
Alcohol Syndrome as well

00:49:12.817 --> 00:49:14.877
but we're also, we're approached by,

00:49:14.877 --> 00:49:16.897
I speak to medical schools
everywhere as I told you

00:49:16.897 --> 00:49:19.208
and I was speaking,

00:49:19.208 --> 00:49:20.772
I speak every year at the
Uniformed Services University

00:49:20.772 --> 00:49:23.563
which is the medical school that serve,

00:49:23.563 --> 00:49:27.062
that trains health, medical
docs all of our military docs

00:49:27.062 --> 00:49:30.394
and a lot of their healthcare
providers in training

00:49:30.394 --> 00:49:32.729
their docs seen elevated
amount of trauma 'cause,

00:49:32.729 --> 00:49:36.380
of course, they're
practicing on the war plains

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:40.722
and so they've approached
me to create a Frame piece

00:49:40.722 --> 00:49:43.951
and we just got the grant
to do that on limb salvage,

00:49:43.951 --> 00:49:46.911
amputation and prosthetics
and creating opportunities

00:49:46.911 --> 00:49:49.036
for those healthcare
providers to really then see

00:49:49.036 --> 00:49:50.922
the diversity and all the
things that are available

00:49:50.922 --> 00:49:52.849
in collaboration with Walter Reed

00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:55.120
and the Wounded Warriors as well.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.882
But taking the same message
and going everywhere that I do,

00:49:57.882 --> 00:49:59.673
everywhere in the world, I go to,

00:49:59.673 --> 00:50:01.464
I speak not only to healthcare providers

00:50:01.464 --> 00:50:04.067
and conferences like this one
but I also speak to students.

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:06.905
I go to, I'm very much involved

00:50:06.905 --> 00:50:08.846
with the American
Society of Human Genetics

00:50:08.846 --> 00:50:11.557
and we travel and it's a
huge genetics organization

00:50:11.557 --> 00:50:13.869
and wherever, there's
an annual conference,

00:50:13.869 --> 00:50:15.726
and wherever that
conference happens to be,

00:50:15.726 --> 00:50:18.329
we then invite the local
high schools to come

00:50:18.329 --> 00:50:21.082
and the kids that are
in the science track,

00:50:21.082 --> 00:50:23.240
the biology majors but sometimes just kids

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.766
that are curious about genetics

00:50:24.766 --> 00:50:28.433
and we hold a full day
symposium on genetics

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:31.705
and I usually end that one with
a Positive Exposure message

00:50:31.705 --> 00:50:34.077
and celebrating difference.

00:50:34.077 --> 00:50:36.874
A couple of years ago I
was honored with the task

00:50:36.874 --> 00:50:40.083
of being with the judge,
or one of the judges,

00:50:40.083 --> 00:50:43.238
on their Teen Gene
Genetics Video Challenge

00:50:43.238 --> 00:50:44.797
which is really exciting.

00:50:44.797 --> 00:50:48.957
We're talking to teens
in the genetics community

00:50:48.957 --> 00:50:51.545
and we're talking to teens
in the high school community

00:50:51.545 --> 00:50:54.482
and asking them to
create something special

00:50:54.482 --> 00:50:56.158
that would really kind of be,

00:50:56.158 --> 00:50:58.396
that would really talk
about how does genetics

00:50:58.396 --> 00:51:00.042
affect your life and let's talk about this

00:51:00.042 --> 00:51:03.806
and these kids would create
these beautiful short videos

00:51:03.806 --> 00:51:06.283
and we would present those
and somebody would win.

00:51:06.283 --> 00:51:08.674
Well, the winners last
year, I'm so lucky to say,

00:51:08.674 --> 00:51:11.157
are right here with us right here today.

00:51:11.157 --> 00:51:13.928
So Cindy, Rare-all, could you
stand up for a second, please?

00:51:13.928 --> 00:51:15.516
(audience applause)

00:51:15.516 --> 00:51:17.226
These are the winners of
the last, and they chose,

00:51:17.226 --> 00:51:20.068
and they're just the most
amazing high school seniors.

00:51:20.068 --> 00:51:24.324
They're incredible and they
actually, their video challenge,

00:51:24.324 --> 00:51:27.580
their Teen Gene Video Challenge
was on the CRISPR gene

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.338
and it was magnificent
and part of their prize

00:51:30.338 --> 00:51:32.378
which besides a monetary support,

00:51:32.378 --> 00:51:35.020
they also go to Skype with me for an hour

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.609
so we talked about photography
and fashion and beauty

00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:40.351
and work and arts and these gorgeous kids

00:51:40.351 --> 00:51:42.784
were so inspired that they continued,

00:51:42.784 --> 00:51:45.622
wanted to continue to be
part of Positive Exposure

00:51:45.622 --> 00:51:47.764
and they just sent me a
little piece that I'd like

00:51:47.764 --> 00:51:49.096
to share with you right now.

00:51:49.096 --> 00:51:50.481
It's only, it's really short

00:51:50.481 --> 00:51:53.133
but this is their
introduction and their take

00:51:53.133 --> 00:51:56.133
on a Positive Exposure introduction.

00:52:01.974 --> 00:52:04.974
(people chattering)

00:52:10.037 --> 00:52:12.870
(uplifting music)

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.960
(audience applause)

00:52:44.498 --> 00:52:46.020
- The whole, FRAME,

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.816
all the work that we do
especially with FRAME,

00:52:47.816 --> 00:52:50.561
taking this into the high
school communities now as well

00:52:50.561 --> 00:52:51.875
is to inspire our young artists,

00:52:51.875 --> 00:52:53.718
our young scientists,
our young geneticists,

00:52:53.718 --> 00:52:56.580
just but really kind of, again,

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.764
embedding it in our community,

00:52:58.764 --> 00:53:00.792
growing up as who we are that we know

00:53:00.792 --> 00:53:02.417
that we all need to see,

00:53:02.417 --> 00:53:04.972
of course, beyond
diagnosis, beyond disease,

00:53:04.972 --> 00:53:07.945
to that person standing
there in front of us.

00:53:07.945 --> 00:53:09.689
All the photographs
and all the exhibitions

00:53:09.689 --> 00:53:13.020
and all the frame pieces are
part of this one philosophy

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.201
that really is about creating
opportunities to not stare

00:53:16.201 --> 00:53:19.135
or look away 'cause we know
after so many years of working

00:53:19.135 --> 00:53:21.518
with that community that
that looking away is so often

00:53:21.518 --> 00:53:23.892
more painful than the stares,

00:53:23.892 --> 00:53:25.963
but to create opportunities
for healthcare providers

00:53:25.963 --> 00:53:29.058
in training but communities,
let's just steady that glance,

00:53:29.058 --> 00:53:32.225
steady that gaze long enough
to see beauty in diversity,

00:53:32.225 --> 00:53:35.496
to see beauty in difference
and then once you see that,

00:53:35.496 --> 00:53:38.515
you're completely just
overwhelmed and empowered

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:40.698
with this new sense of what beautiful is.

00:53:40.698 --> 00:53:42.875
Then you see beyond
that difference to what

00:53:42.875 --> 00:53:45.328
we all share which, of
course, is humanity.

00:53:45.328 --> 00:53:48.790
That's the basic mission
of Positive Exposure.

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:51.099
I think we have just a few
minutes, I'd like to maybe end,

00:53:51.099 --> 00:53:53.920
but first before I do
that, I'd like to ask some,

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.251
are there any other questions
or anybody comments,

00:53:56.251 --> 00:53:58.975
any comments on the Down Syndrome in FRAME

00:53:58.975 --> 00:54:00.362
which might be helpful?

00:54:00.362 --> 00:54:01.639
Doesn't have to be a good comment.

00:54:01.639 --> 00:54:02.662
It could be a bad comment.

00:54:02.662 --> 00:54:03.725
Yes, sir.

00:54:03.725 --> 00:54:07.892
- [Male] Just the only thing
is that maybe on the thing,

00:54:09.489 --> 00:54:12.534
to have a little more (inaudible)

00:54:12.534 --> 00:54:15.806
- Mm Hmm (affirmative).

00:54:15.806 --> 00:54:16.855
- [Male] And the other question I have is,

00:54:16.855 --> 00:54:18.889
on the other end of this,

00:54:18.889 --> 00:54:21.866
any progress towards
getting positive images

00:54:21.866 --> 00:54:26.024
of different kind of
people in teen magazines

00:54:26.024 --> 00:54:27.862
and Cosmo and Seventeen?

00:54:27.862 --> 00:54:29.605
- Oh, it's startin' to happen. (laughs)

00:54:29.605 --> 00:54:33.474
It's starting to happen slowly
but surely and it really is,

00:54:33.474 --> 00:54:34.816
what's happening, there's
this gorgeous girl,

00:54:34.816 --> 00:54:36.848
her name is Winnie Harlow
and she has vitiligo

00:54:36.848 --> 00:54:38.909
and she's doing campaigns now.

00:54:38.909 --> 00:54:41.160
There's a gorgeous girl
with Down Syndrome, Theresa,

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.007
who's now walking the runway in London

00:54:43.007 --> 00:54:45.825
and there's a beautiful video
that's going viral right now,

00:54:45.825 --> 00:54:48.736
today, I just saw, it was
all over Facebook today,

00:54:48.736 --> 00:54:51.203
of this fashion show of
people in wheelchairs

00:54:51.203 --> 00:54:53.656
with prosthetics as well but
it really is about seeing

00:54:53.656 --> 00:54:56.013
this beauty and seeing
beauty in difference.

00:54:56.013 --> 00:54:59.204
So, it's, again, I don't think
Vogue magazine is quite ready

00:54:59.204 --> 00:55:01.612
to put someone with a
disability on the cover

00:55:01.612 --> 00:55:03.421
but for sure they're
gonna start recognizing

00:55:03.421 --> 00:55:04.777
that there's beauty there

00:55:04.777 --> 00:55:06.934
and there's commerce there as well.

00:55:06.934 --> 00:55:08.652
Thank you, sir.

00:55:08.652 --> 00:55:09.485
Yes.

00:55:10.528 --> 00:55:11.673
- [Female] So do you pitch to magazines?

00:55:11.673 --> 00:55:13.385
- I don't pitch to magazines.

00:55:13.385 --> 00:55:16.392
I've done lots, we've done
several pieces, the first,

00:55:16.392 --> 00:55:17.747
of course, Life magazine.

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:19.639
I've done stories in
People and things like that

00:55:19.639 --> 00:55:21.261
but I don't really
pitch it 'cause I don't,

00:55:21.261 --> 00:55:23.161
we're not trying to create
to squeeze these kids

00:55:23.161 --> 00:55:27.266
and all of our great ambassadors
into the beauty standard.

00:55:27.266 --> 00:55:30.425
We're trying, and make it so
that, oh, look, that's nice,

00:55:30.425 --> 00:55:33.118
we're trying to create a brand
new one and the brand new one

00:55:33.118 --> 00:55:34.466
that needs to exist,

00:55:34.466 --> 00:55:36.780
it has to be, it's not
about pitching this,

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.600
it's about someone
coming to the realization

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.376
that the beauty exists here
and it's beauty everywhere.

00:55:41.376 --> 00:55:43.924
Now as a fashion photographer, people say,

00:55:43.924 --> 00:55:45.394
oh, everything's changed.

00:55:45.394 --> 00:55:47.022
You were shooting fashion
models and super stars

00:55:47.022 --> 00:55:49.273
and now you're photographing
genetic diseases.

00:55:49.273 --> 00:55:50.387
I'm like, well,

00:55:50.387 --> 00:55:52.694
I've never photographed a
genetic disease in my life.

00:55:52.694 --> 00:55:55.866
It's always only people and
the most important thing is

00:55:55.866 --> 00:55:58.502
it's always beauty so
nothing's changed for me.

00:55:58.502 --> 00:56:01.240
It's still about capturing
beauty but it's about presenting

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.089
that beauty in a way that
we're all given the freedom

00:56:03.089 --> 00:56:05.241
to see and to embrace.

00:56:05.241 --> 00:56:07.996
So I don't want to kind
of make all these great,

00:56:07.996 --> 00:56:09.720
amazing ambassadors
squeeze into the parameters

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:13.258
of that beauty standard
but create this new one.

00:56:13.258 --> 00:56:15.510
(audience applause)

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:16.343
Thanks.

00:56:18.095 --> 00:56:18.928
Thank you.

00:56:19.961 --> 00:56:20.794
Yay!

00:56:22.432 --> 00:56:23.431
Woo!

00:56:23.431 --> 00:56:24.936
Yes?

00:56:24.936 --> 00:56:27.978
- [Female] Are you planning to add adults?

00:56:27.978 --> 00:56:29.827
- Yes, that was my comment.

00:56:29.827 --> 00:56:31.543
- Great, I, absolutely.

00:56:31.543 --> 00:56:33.260
In fact, we absolutely are.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.108
In fact, we've created the next series.

00:56:35.108 --> 00:56:36.524
In fact, if there's time,

00:56:36.524 --> 00:56:37.777
I probably won't have time to stay

00:56:37.777 --> 00:56:39.333
but I could show the one on CF,

00:56:39.333 --> 00:56:41.170
it's all adults, but we're presenting,

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:43.423
it's so important that we do it,

00:56:43.423 --> 00:56:46.379
and we make sure it's
inclusive of all ages for sure.

00:56:46.379 --> 00:56:47.745
Yes?

00:56:47.745 --> 00:56:50.995
- [Female] (inaudible)

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:53.893
- Yes.

00:56:55.265 --> 00:56:56.290
It would be so great.

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.839
Budget doesn't allow that
just yet but it's coming,

00:56:58.839 --> 00:56:59.861
I'm sure of it.

00:56:59.861 --> 00:57:01.856
We have to be very, we really
got stick with the budgets

00:57:01.856 --> 00:57:04.324
but I love that idea and I travel so much.

00:57:04.324 --> 00:57:07.638
I'm off to Ecuador tomorrow so
we'll be photographing there.

00:57:07.638 --> 00:57:08.955
So it's gonna be amazing.

00:57:08.955 --> 00:57:10.328
- If you get to the airport on time.

00:57:10.328 --> 00:57:11.376
- If, yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

00:57:11.376 --> 00:57:12.473
- So you really need to go.

00:57:12.473 --> 00:57:13.990
- Just a comment.

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:16.955
I first experienced Rick's presentation

00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:19.082
when he was a keynoter

00:57:19.082 --> 00:57:21.627
at the American Academy of
Pediatrics National Convention

00:57:21.627 --> 00:57:23.736
in Washington, D.C.

00:57:23.736 --> 00:57:27.903
Some 15 or 20,000 pediatricians
from all over the country.

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:30.678
- That was scary!

00:57:30.678 --> 00:57:32.488
- And other countries too.

00:57:32.488 --> 00:57:34.530
You blew us away and
you did again tonight.

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:35.633
Thank you.

00:57:35.633 --> 00:57:36.994
- Thank you so much.

00:57:36.994 --> 00:57:38.710
(audience applause and cheering)

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:40.127
- Oh, thank you.
