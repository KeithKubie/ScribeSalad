1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,640
The fourth major concept in evolutionary
biology that is really critical for

2
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:11,921
understanding how to think about medical
problems is adaptation and adaptation

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,400
is a concept that has been problematic
and it needs special attention,

4
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:23,920
but we also need to understand how
do we recognize when something isn't

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,763
adaptation?

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,620
Okay,

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,300
why is it problematic?
Well,

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,960
adaptation is the central
character in just so stories.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,760
These are often coupled to some imaginary
environment and the evolutionary past

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,500
that has just precisely the
characteristics needed to make a favorite

11
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:46,150
hypothesis.
Plausible.

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,910
We shouldn't believe such stories and
if that is the only basis for calling

13
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:54,370
something an adaptation,
well you can forget it,

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,460
claims it out of adaptations should
therefore not be accepted unexamined.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,050
Any hypothesis of adaptation needs
to be tested against alternatives.

16
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,990
Evolutionary biologists have devoted
quite a bit of thought to this and they've

17
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:14,350
developed several criteria
for recognizing adaptations.

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,460
So here are some of them
natural selection itself,

19
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,560
if you can observe it.

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,820
Perturbation criteria and the functional
criteria and the design criterion and

21
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,800
the invasion resistance criteria.

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,680
So we'll step through those
to see what they mean.

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,710
Natural selection itself.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Now natural selection on a trait is
we've seen exists given a correlation

25
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:43,810
between variation in the tree and
variation in reproductive success,

26
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,640
a response occurs when some of the
variation in the traits heritable.

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,850
So if you can document heritable
changes in the trait that result from a

28
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:58,570
demonstrate and correlation of treat
Steve With reproductive success,

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,760
then you've pretty much nailed it.

30
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,790
You've watched natural selection in
action and the many cases of experimental

31
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:10,030
evolution are cases in
which that has been done.

32
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,760
So in a case like that,

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,270
the adaptation is the change in the tree.

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,700
It's not the ground state of the trade.

35
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:22,510
The adaptation is the amount of change
that's occurred because of the observed

36
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:23,344
selection.

37
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,943
Okay.

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,930
The second criterion is
the perturbation criteria.

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,330
So for that you need both a
predictive model and an experiment.

40
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,510
The adaptation is then the state of the
trade that's predicted by a model that's

41
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:44,511
tested and confirmed by using some method
to perturb the phenotype out of its

42
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:49,671
optimal state and to demonstrate that
the fitness of the perturbed phenotype is

43
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,860
lower than the fitness
of the predicted one.

44
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,040
This is not easy to do on humans,

45
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:00,610
but it can be done with
clutch size experiments in
birds and one of the best was

46
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,400
done by Dutch biologists
working on kestrels.

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,760
So here is a Kestrel and these biologists
who are working in the northern part

48
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,410
of the Netherlands manipulated clutch
size and measured reproductive success.

49
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,010
They had reduced control and enlarged
clutches and these are the sample sizes.

50
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,120
The number of baby birds that were fledged
coming out of the reduced clutch was

51
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:32,170
2.6 on average and nearly six 5.8
in the [inaudible] in large clutch.

52
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,180
And if you ask what's the reproductive
value of that clutch, in other words,

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,550
how many grandchildren are going to
result from having a clutch that size?

54
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,500
Well, the enlarge clutch was producing
nearly seven and the reduced clutch was

55
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:51,040
producing about three so based on that,

56
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:55,270
it would seem like it would pay
kestrels to lay more eggs. However,

57
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,790
look at what happens with the parents.

58
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,450
The local survival of the parents with
the reduced clutches is about 65% 0.65

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,993
per year,

60
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,390
but it's only about 43% 0.4 to nine
per year for the enlarge clutches.

61
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,380
As a result,
the reproductive value of the parents,

62
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:21,610
the number of offspring they would
expect to have from that point on,

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
including this clutch is about 10 for
the reduced clutches and it's only about

64
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:31,690
6.7 for the enlarge clutches.
So the total value,

65
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,650
the total reproductive value of having
reduced clutch is about one full

66
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,780
offspring below that
of the control clutch.

67
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,020
And the reproductive value of the
enlarge clutch is about half an offspring

68
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,973
below.

69
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
What this means is that kestrels no the
right number of offspring to have that

70
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:02,380
is determined by a trade off between the
number of offspring that they have and

71
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,480
their search,
their own survival,

72
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,000
and the result is that we can call
their clutch and adaptation by the

73
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,740
perturbation criteria.

74
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,150
The third criterion is the functional
criterion and it defines adaptation is

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,100
inappropriate plastic response.

76
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,150
So under this definition and adaptation
is the change in a phenotype that occurs

77
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:33,331
in response to a specific environmental
signal and it has a clear functional

78
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,030
relationship to that signal that results
in an improvement in growth, survival,

79
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:40,900
or reproduction.

80
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,610
Otherwise it doesn't appear and it
doesn't appear because it's costly.

81
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,910
So it is a change that is produced
only when it pays to produce it.

82
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,030
Here are some pretty convincing cases,
is a waterfally Daphnia,

83
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:03,860
which is the first one
Daphne will develop spines,

84
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,180
a longer tail spine,

85
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:10,181
and it will develop a helmet on the top
of its head in the presence of dissolved

86
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:15,860
molecules associated with predators
whose efficacy is reduced by spines and

87
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:20,600
helmets. They have a reproductive cost
and they're not produced in the absence of

88
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:25,130
predators. Daphnia producing
spines and helmets lay fewer eggs.

89
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:26,030
Here are the eggs,

90
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,360
Vince shells and barnacles and make
them resistant to snail predators,

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,250
but they reduced their fecundity.

92
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,050
Same cost benefit analysis snails
that are Paris attired by castrating,

93
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:47,370
diagenetic trematodes,
just to some myosis reproduce earlier.

94
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,380
So these are all convincing cases.
They are induced responses.

95
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,070
Okay.

96
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,120
The fourth criterion for
adaptation is the design criteria.

97
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Adaptation can be recognized by its
complexity and its conformity to some op

98
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,780
priori design specification.
In other words,

99
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,580
by its resemblance to something
that an engineer might design,

100
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,840
any complex organ that performs
a difficult function efficiently

101
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,150
can therefore be thought to be an
adaptation by the design criterion.

102
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,370
For example,
the human eye,

103
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,180
when dark adapted can detect the arrival
of photons that are produced by a

104
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:39,940
single match at a
distance of 10 kilometers

105
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,710
that is doing something
efficiently with a complex Oregon.

106
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,530
That is a difficult task and that is
why sailors in wartime do not strike

107
00:07:55,511 --> 00:08:00,511
matches when they're out on board ship
because they can be seen by a submarine

108
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,440
at a distance of 10 kilometers.
Now

109
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,030
to judge such claims of adaptation
by the design criterion,

110
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,550
George Lauder came up with five questions.

111
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,920
The first is have any experiments
done to support the claim function?

112
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,190
Does it really have that function?
Second,

113
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:28,090
has the performance of the
trait in fulfilling that
function been compared with

114
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,230
alternative states?

115
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,290
So can you actually find variation that
would allow you as with the kestrels to

116
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:37,330
look at alternatives and see
what the fitness result was?

117
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,010
Does the phylogenetic analysis suggests
that the state that's claimed to be an

118
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:49,011
adaptation is repeatedly associated with
the kind of natural selection that's

119
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:50,550
needed to produce it?

120
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,260
Could the trade have been to this state
is a byproduct of selection for some

121
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:01,470
other trait? In other words, are you
actually asking the right question?

122
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,910
Are you really looking at the thing
under selection? And then finally,

123
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,020
is it a spandrel?

124
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,670
And by that we mean might the claim
of adaptation be confounded by an

125
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:16,440
inappropriate abstraction of just a piece
of the organism from the larger hole

126
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,700
in which it's embedded. An example
of the spandrel might be the chin,

127
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,710
the Chin on a human may simply result
from the fact that the human face has been

128
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:33,120
reshaped by selection since our chimpanzee
ancestors to be a bit more vertical.

129
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,450
And that brings out a piece of bone that
looks like a chin functions as a chin,

130
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,790
but it may simply be part of the
reforming of the entire head.

131
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,660
So the number of those criteria that are
satisfied as a measure of how well the

132
00:09:56,701 --> 00:10:00,060
claim of design has been confirmed.

133
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,700
Yeah.

134
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,110
Then the final criterion is the uh,
evolutionary stable strategy.

135
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,350
Ess Or invasion resistance criterion.

136
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,580
So think of a population with a trait.

137
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,610
This candidate for being an
adaptation to test that claim,

138
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,100
allow the population to be systematically
and repeatedly invaded by all possible

139
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:30,240
alternative states. Have that trait
in all orders and combinations.

140
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,550
So this is the kind of thing
you could do on a computer

141
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,940
if the candidate adaptation can resist
invasion by alternative states than we

142
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:43,941
can say that it is an adaptation in the
sense of being an evolutionarily stable

143
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:48,570
strategy that resists invasion.
Now,

144
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,860
that's a pretty good logical
criteria and it's a pretty tough one,

145
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,400
but it doesn't cover all cases.
For example,

146
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,000
if a beats B beets see beets a,

147
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,960
then you get an eternal cycle.
That is what happens in the rock paper,

148
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:04,794
scissors game.

149
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:06,800
Okay.

150
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,350
The state that resists all invasion,

151
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,540
all invaders might not be attainable
in phenotype space. In other words,

152
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:19,541
there might be a constraint in the system
such that the resistant phenotype is

153
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,460
not something that you can get
to starting from low frequency.

154
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,860
Another possibility is that there's
negative frequency dependence and that

155
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:32,861
yields and adapted set of phenotypes
rather than a single best adapted

156
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,550
phenotype.
In other words,

157
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,870
the stable state of the population is a
mixture of things rather than a single

158
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:39,704
thing.

159
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,440
Yeah.

160
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,700
Cases where the invasion challenge is
hard to arrange and the ability to resist

161
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:49,540
invasion have not been
convincingly tested,

162
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,850
won't be covered by this criteria.
It's a rather criteria and to fulfill.

163
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,530
So the summary on adaptation is that net,

164
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,480
when you observe natural selection,

165
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,730
that is the best demonstration
that something isn't.

166
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:07,564
Adaptation.

167
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,260
Perturbation is also quite
convincing function well in their,

168
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:19,351
in that case the induced responses are
convincing to Daphne a helmet sort of

169
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:20,194
thing.

170
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,130
The design claim is plausible if
Lauder's questions are answered.

171
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,980
And there are some things which are so
intricately and efficiently designed in

172
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:37,330
biology that it's almost perverse
not to claim that their adaptations,

173
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,400
the invasion, Kristen's criterion
is logically in extremely good one,

174
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,760
but it's only as good as the
mutations that are actually tried.

175
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:49,210
And it's rather difficult
to arrange experimentally.

176
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,150
So that is the summary on
a critique of adaptation.

177
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:00,430
And the bottom line is that adaptation
is only problematic if it's not tested or

178
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,720
if it's not testable.

179
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,190
One should be wary of
untestable claims of adaptation.

180
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,180
And this is one of those areas of science
in which in which one needs to develop

181
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,840
the willingness to remain agnostic
if you cannot produce good evidence.

182
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:20,880
Okay.
