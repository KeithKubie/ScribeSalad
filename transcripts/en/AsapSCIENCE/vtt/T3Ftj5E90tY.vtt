00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.900
The brain. Every time you think, feel, or
perform a multitude of unconscious processes,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.740
the 100 billion neurons in your skull conduct
electrical signals to communicate and carry

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.680
messages between them, ultimately creating,
well - YOU...and everything you do. It’s

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.670
the most complex, essential and identifiable
organ in the body, acting as the center of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.210
the nervous system in all vertebrates. But
what if how you think and feel isn’t just

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.000
controlled by the brain and central nervous
system, but in fact, a second brain that you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
didn’t know about?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160
The brain uses the vagus nerve to connect
and communicate with many parts of the body,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.059
including the vocal cords, heart, lungs and
most of the digestive tract. It also uses

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.129
this nerve to convey ‘fight or flight’
messages to the body, which explains why you

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.050
might experience a cracking voice, racing
heart, shortness of breath and a knot in your

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.690
stomach when you’re really stressed or nervous.
But while this extensive network is constantly

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.860
sending signals from the brain to your body,
scientists have noted that 80-90% of the nerve

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.100
fibers in the enteric nervous system are actually
going from the gut to the brain.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.790
In fact, the enteric nervous system, which
is an extensive mesh-like network of neurons

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.140
that controls your entire digestive tract
from the esophagus to the anus, doesn’t

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.000
even require the brain at all. When the vagus
nerve is severed, the enteric nervous system

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.770
is capable of organizing and initiating its
own reflexes for digestion because it has

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.130
such a complex collection of neurons. It is
your second brain, and it controls you far

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.689
more than you realize.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.520
From an evolutionary perspective - before
modern food safety protocols - our biggest

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.351
choices were about eating. Is it safe? Will
it make me sick? Will it give me energy? This

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:45.070
is why we would need a direct line of communication
between the gut and the brain. For example,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.490
fat and sugar are good sources of fuel for
the body, so we have evolved mechanisms to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.689
notify the brain to release the ‘feel-good’
neurotransmitter dopamine when we eat foods

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.670
high in fats and sugars, which make us continually
seek them out.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.539
But the enteric nervous system becomes even
more interesting when you realize that the

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.020
microbes in your gut actually produce over
50% of the dopamine found in your body, and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.739
90% of the serotonin; two neurotransmitters
that drastically affect your mood, happiness

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.950
and pleasure. And these microbes can manipulate
your cravings and eating behaviours for their

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.480
own survival. Your diet affects which bacteria
thrive, but as a result, the flourishing bacteria

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.159
in your gut can then send signals to the brain
via the vagus nerve to tell you to keep eating

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.230
the foods they love. This is why some scientists
have suggested that treatment with probiotics

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.490
or fecal transplants could be an effective
therapy for overeating; by getting rid of

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.770
certain bacteria that generate intense cravings
for high-fat and high-sugar foods.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.599
In fact, current research is pointing to a
gut with healthy microbiomes as a strong predictor

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.580
of emotional and mental health. Mice raised
in sterile environments, where no bacteria

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.530
could colonize their gut, exhibit social traits
similar to those seen in humans on the autism

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.750
spectrum. When researchers studied their brains,
they also found significant changes in the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.520
levels of serotonin and specific proteins
related to learning and memory formation.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.300
But after feeding the mice with specific probiotics
to help cultivate healthy microbiomes, the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.569
symptoms were alleviated. Their gut controlled
their behaviour!

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.160
A 30 day study comparing people who ate probiotic
yogurt found a decrease in the levels of anxiety

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.440
and depression compared to people who consumed
milk with no bacteria.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.409
And another study found that mice fed a specific
bacteria had less stress-related hormones

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.970
in their blood and performed better on tests
of learning and memory. But when researchers

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.329
severed the vagus nerve, all of these improvements
disappeared. Again, their guts were in control

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.770
of their emotions!

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.239
Studies have even shown that stimulating the
vagus nerve at different frequencies, by implanting

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.799
a small pacemaker, can help patients with
treatment-resistant depression, by mimicking

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.769
vagal nerve activity like a person with a
healthy gut.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.219
And the essential role of the gut doesn’t
end there. Given that large social groups

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:00.560
increase the potential of one’s genes being
passed on - for both us and our bacteria - researchers

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.020
now believe that the function of the microbiome
is partly to promote pro-social behaviours.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.440
Healthy gut bacteria can lead to a higher
resilience of negative emotions from others,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.159
which makes you more forgiving and better
at fostering strong social connections, ultimately

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.159
improving your shot at reproduction.

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.159
All thanks to your second brain!
