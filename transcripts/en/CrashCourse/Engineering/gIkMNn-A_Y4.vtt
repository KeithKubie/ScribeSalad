00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
Medicine matters.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.660
Whether you’re getting a flu shot or just
taking an aspirin, the medical field is vital
to the way you live your life.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.740
New treatments are coming out nearly every
day, all because of the hard work of scientists
and engineers.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.840
Together they’re creating breakthrough medicines
and figuring out how to get them where they need to go.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.720
These efforts are known as drug discovery
and drug delivery, and they’re what you need if
you want to engineer a healthier world.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:31.820
[Theme Music]

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.580
In today’s world, it’s pretty easy to
get things with a personalized touch.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.160
Everyone’s different, and people want a
lifestyle that reflects those differences.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.880
Custom cars, tailored clothes, personalized
electronics – the list goes on.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.280
But what about medicine?

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.480
What if you could walk into a hospital and
get a completely personalized treatment for
whatever you had going on?

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.020
That’s the dream of biomedical engineering:
a world where doctors can diagnose and treat a
person based on their individual differences.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.880
This concept is called personalized medicine
and it’s the healthcare of the future.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.560
It’s the idea that you could combine a person’s
genetic information with clinical data to best tailor
a treatment to meet their specific and unique needs.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.420
Medicine is the field where all our knowledge
comes together.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.800
You’ll need biology to understand the problem,
chemistry to figure out the solution, and physics to
deliver that solution in a safe and targeted way.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:27.200
As an engineer, it’s your job to bring all this together using concepts like biocompatibility and fluid flow to create one easy-to-use package that could save someone’s life.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.640
Lucky enough, there’s already some places
where this kind of personalized approach is
being used!

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.760
For instance, genetic tests can reveal how likely
someone is to get breast cancer and guide them
onto an appropriate monitoring path early in life.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.240
Hopefully this leads to detecting the
disease early on, when treatment options are
less invasive and more successful.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.740
But there are still many challenges to overcome
before personalized medicine becomes widespread.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.900
You need to develop better systems to quickly
assess a patient’s genetic profile,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.360
create inexpensive diagnostic devices using
that information, and find the best way to deliver
a drug if anything comes up.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.560
And that’s all after your come up with a
good treatment in the first place!

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.400
Drug discovery is all about finding that new
treatment.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.180
It’s the process through which you discover and
create new medications based on what you know
about your ingredients and how they’ll interact
with the human body.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.480
Even before modern healthcare, people found
natural remedies, often by chance, that improved their
health or helped them get over an illness.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.640
The early days of drug discovery were all about
finding the active ingredients inside those remedies –

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.340
the part that was actually affecting the body – and
learning how to replicate or improve on the outcome.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.840
Hot peppers, for instance, were used for centuries
to relieve the pain of things like toothaches,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.040
but today we know it’s only the substance
capsaicin that matters.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.220
You can now buy it to treat conditions such as
arthritis and shingles – all without the burning
sensation created by other parts of the pepper!

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.620
These days we have large chemical libraries of synthetic
molecules, natural products, and chemical extracts that
|have been tested to determine their effects.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.480
This is called classical pharmacology.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.200
A new tool is genome analysis, the study of
a complete set of an organism’s DNA, including
all of its genes.

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.180
It’s the result of the Human Genome Project,
which successfully sequenced our DNA.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.760
Sequencing your genome is like mapping out
all the genes in your body.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.460
It’s about figuring out the order of all
the DNA nucleotides, or bases, in your genome.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.180
For the Human Genome Project, researchers were
able to sequence all of our 3.2 billion base pairs,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.800
which allowed for the rapid cloning and
synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.480
Genome analysis is the foundation of the
modern approach to developing drugs, called
reverse pharmacology.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.580
Reverse pharmacology starts by identifying
which of those proteins is related to the
condition you want to treat.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.980
You can compare that protein to a list of
chemical reactions to find a molecule known
to interact with it.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.600
If you find a match, you can test the
substance on living cells to see if the reaction
has any positive impact.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.700
From single cells, you can move up to simple
animals and – if all goes well – eventually
to human trials.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.520
By starting with the “problem area” and working
backwards, reverse pharmacology is the more educated
– and often faster – way to discover a new medicine.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.380
Regardless of which way you got it, once you
have a treatment, it’s on to drug delivery:

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.780
getting the medicine to move through the body,
find the site of the problem, and even attach to
right parts of the cells.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.260
Syringes are the classic solution to this
problem.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.940
Just draw up some medicine and inject it right
where it’s needed.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.500
But those syringes used to need a lubricant
to help the plunger – that thing you press
down on – well, go down.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.620
This usually meant using silicon oil, which
could be a problem.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.840
Silicon oil can react with the medicine inside and,
as medicines have become more and more specialized,
the worse and worse the reactions can be.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.640
Many drugs also can’t be delivered straight
to the bloodstream, but have to be metabolized
in the stomach or intestines first.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.719
So it’s a good idea to have other options
for delivering your drugs.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.740
We’ve talked about some possibilities before,
such as nanomaterials or biomaterials.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:51.140
Researchers are currently exploring ways to
engineer nanoparticles that could deliver a drug
to its target in the body while evading your
immune system’s normal defenses.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.420
You’ve heard about smartphones and smart
cars, but what about smart medical devices?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.660
The idea is to design something that’s sensitive
to the body’s internal conditions, letting the drugs
react in the right way at the right times.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.000
Take someone with diabetes, for example.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.620
You could design smarter devices with better
materials so that insulin was only released into their
system when their blood glucose levels were too high.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.480
In the new field of tissue engineering, researchers
are combining the principles of biology

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:25.120
with the applications of engineering to create
novel biomaterials that could aid in the repair of
damaged body tissues – maybe even replace them!

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.300
One goal is a type of “medical scaffold” that
can attract stem cells and guide their growth into
specific types of tissue using biological signals.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.620
Stem cells are the building blocks of the body.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.780
And, in the future, mastery of synthetic tissue
engineering could make it possible to regenerate
tissues and even entire organs.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.060
That’s about as personalized as it gets!

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.800
Even that doesn’t cover the full spectrum
of what we want medicine to do.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.220
Sometimes the problem isn't that you’re
trying to repair or regenerate the body,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.380
but rather that you’re trying to stop something
from spreading or growing in the first place.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.500
Cancer is the second leading cause of death
worldwide, and it’s responsible for millions
of deaths every year.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.480
Conventional treatments generally rely on
a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:13.020
Chemo is often the first choice for treating many types
of cancer, but it’s basically a poison that you hope kills
the cancerous cells faster than the healthy ones.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.820
It’s a similar story with radiation – it’s
hard to limit its effects to just the bad cells.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.420
With conditions like these, a drug delivery
system that only gets the treatment generally
where it needs to go isn’t good enough.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.340
You need to have a targeted drug delivery
and not hurt anything else along the way.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.160
This enables you to maximize the positive
effect at a specific place in the body with
few negative side effects elsewhere.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.820
It would also allow you to treat hard-to-reach
places while also using smaller doses.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.960
The idea of this “magic bullet” approach has
led to a number of new drug carrier systems.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.199
A great example of these are direct local
delivery systems, like the skin patch.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.200
These patches can slowly release medicine
into the body over a period of days.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.760
They’re commonly used to administer birth
control or help smokers with nicotine withdrawal.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.520
A drug-eluting stent, which is a mesh tube
that delivers time-released medicine, can do
the same thing from within the body.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.020
They’re often implanted into patients with
coronary artery disease to prevent dangerous
blockages.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.160
Another promising tool is microparticles.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.400
They’re small enough to travel through the
heart as part of the bloodstream, yet big enough
that they can’t enter capillaries.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.060
A number of researchers have taken this unique
property and prepared biodegradable drugs
made of things like starch.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:26.260
They can deliver a large dose of chemotherapy
directly to a targeted site, a process that’s also
called chemo-embolization.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.789
The particles accumulate at designated spots
in the body, kind of like a storage depot.

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:35.200
As they break down, the drugs release slowly,
but continuously into the targeted area.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.300
Want to speed up or slow down the release
rate of the medicine?

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.880
Try using a different material – one that
degrades at a different speed – or design the
particles to have bigger or smaller pores.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.940
But let’s say you do want something that
can enter the capillaries so that it can keep
on circulating through your body.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.840
Then nanoparticles are the way to go.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.480
Particles around 110-140 nm in size seem to
be ideal for most applications

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.680
because they’re large enough to avoid being
cleaned out by the liver or kidneys, but small enough
not to be attacked by white blood cells.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:10.040
The goal is for them to stay in the body’s
circulation long enough to be removed by the target
tissue rather than something like your immune system.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.820
This approach might be especially well suited
to treat cancer.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:19.300
Since the blood vessels connected to tumors
are often quite large, the medicine is less likely
to leak into surrounding tissue,

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.040
resulting in something called the enhanced
permeability and retention, or EPR, effect.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.060
Basically, you’re increasing how much
medicine gets to where you want, while
reducing it where you don’t.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.460
Future techniques could be even more accurate.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.700
An idea currently being developed is microbubbles,
which are super small bubbles filled with gas.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:42.560
Someday they could hold a chemotherapy drug
that would only be released when the bubbles
experience the waves of an ultrasound.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.540
The ultrasound would target a specific part
of the body and burst only the microbubbles
at the site of the tumor,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.520
which would activate the drug only where
it’s needed most.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:59.660
Targeted carriers like these, along with good
disease detection systems and a wealth of drug
discoveries, will add up to that promised world
of personalized medicine.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.300
Today we learned about drug discovery and
drug delivery.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:09.360
We covered classical and reverse pharmacology,
as well as the new field of synthetic biology and what
people have been able to accomplish with it.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.900
Finally, we saw how important good disease
detection is and why we need more targeted
drug delivery systems.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.100
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll go
one step further and talk about biodevices.
