00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This one's a little trickier.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
First, I have to make the intermediate step of realizing,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
hey, I know what the tangent of α is.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The reason I know this is because I know what the opposite side is. It's 4.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I know what the adjacent side is--7.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I know tangent relates those two,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so I can say tangent of this angle α--I don't even know what that is yet,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but I know it's equal to 4/7.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I know that it's possible to go back and forth between angles and these ratios.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I can type into Google "arctan 4/7 in degrees."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't want my answer is radians. The answer is 29.74 degrees.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, this was a lot we just went over.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's one thing to be doing this with tables,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but now we've introduced this new notation,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
this new word arc tangent, arc sine, arc cosine.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If you're feeling comfortable with all this, you should move on.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But if you're still a little shaky on sines and arctangents,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
go back and rewatch whatever is helpful to you.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you still have any questions after that,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
be sure to visit the forums, and there will be plenty of people,

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
myself included, who are there to help.
