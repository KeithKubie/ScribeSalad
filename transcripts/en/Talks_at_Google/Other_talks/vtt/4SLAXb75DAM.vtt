LISA GREEN: OK.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.230
Thank you guys.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.230
Thanks everyone for coming.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.330
First, I'm Lisa Green.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.100
I run our Luxury Fashion Group.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.250
And I'm thrilled to have
these four guys here

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.100
to talk to us today about
how shopping has changed

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.340
in the modern day, and give
any advice that any of you guys

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.760
have about that specific topic.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.426
So we'll go ahead and
start with Lauren.

00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:24.130
And then we'll just
go down the line.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.838
LAUREN SHERMAN: My
name's Lauren Sherman.

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:28.610
I am Fashionista's
editor-at-large.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.440
I'm a freelance writer as well.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.549
And I write for a bunch
of different publications.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.660
My expertise is kind
of the intersection

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.090
of fashion and business.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.100
So I write for
consumer publications.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.120
I write for business
publications, trade

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.140
and-- So I've been covering
this stuff for about 10 years.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.790
And e-commerce is obviously
a big part of my beat.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.057
So I guess that's basically it.

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:52.890
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: Hi.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.970
I'm Leah Chernikoff.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.400
I'm the editor of Elle.com.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.640
So that means I oversee all
editorial, content, strategy.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.890
Before that I was at
Fashionista with Lauren.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.990
She hired me.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.310
And before that, I was a
reporter at the Daily News,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.170
covering features.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.280
And then I focused on
fashion from there.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.800
And also decided to
go digital, when,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.430
I think I experienced the
fourth round of layoffs.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.280
So I'm happy to be online.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.950
And so-- yeah, my
expertise is more

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.580
of sort of a general
view on fashion,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.480
and having watched,
sort of, things

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.757
go from analog to digital.

00:01:26.757 --> 00:01:27.840
LISA GREEN: You've got it.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.190
STEVEN ALAN: Hi I'm Steven Alan.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.610
And I started my company
about 20 years ago.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.710
And started as a multi-brand
retailer and then from there

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.340
started representing
designers, and then from there,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.410
started manufacturing.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.570
And today, we do all three,
kind of three businesses

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.280
within a business.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.490
And I think each business
is very much complementary

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.658
to the other business.

00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:55.000
BRETT HEYMAN: Thank you.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.610
Hi, my name is Brett Heyman.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.140
I have a brand of
handbags called Edie.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.290
Parker, which I launched
about four years ago.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.370
And before that, I
had a PR background.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.490
I worked in PR for Gucci
and Dolce Gabbana covering

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.622
accessories, mostly,
and ready-to-wear.

00:02:10.622 --> 00:02:11.330
LISA GREEN: Cool.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.200
Well thank you guys.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.850
Thank you again for being here.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.850
We're just going to
kick it off by asking

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.020
what the strangest thing that
you've ever bought online is?

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.670
So, Steven, we'll
start with you.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.530
STEVEN ALAN: I remember
buying a car online,

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.950
which for me was pretty weird.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.140
Without seeing it,
and it was on eBay,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.000
and it was one of
those bidding things--

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.120
And it was a
particular-- it wasn't

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.460
any amazing-- it was
just an old Volvo.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.360
But I wanted a stick-shift.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.604
And so I ended up going up to
Pittsburgh and picking it up .

00:02:43.604 --> 00:02:46.057
It wasn't that weird but--

00:02:46.057 --> 00:02:47.390
LISA GREEN: It's a big purchase.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.098
STEVEN ALAN: Yeah, it
was a big purchase.

00:02:50.468 --> 00:02:51.217
LISA GREEN: Brett.

00:02:51.217 --> 00:02:51.490
You want to go?

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.660
BRETT HEYMAN: Well, I'm excited
to hear that because I'm

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.160
mulling over a Grand Wagoneer
online, and through eBay Auto.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.900
So I'm happy that
it worked for you.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.810
I don't think I buy
a lot of weird stuff.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.515
But I do buy a lot
of geodes and rocks,

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.856
and I buy them all
online on eBay.

00:03:05.856 --> 00:03:08.530
LISA GREEN: Well, I'm just
going throw in what my weirdest

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.290
thing was-- to
maybe help you guys

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.390
along the continuum of weird--
I once bought a smitten, which

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.430
was actually a glove
for two people.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.750
So that you could hold hands--

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.580
--while walking down the street.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.970
It's really-- I've been
married for 10 years.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.691
So clearly that was
more than 10 years ago.

00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:28.535
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:30.660
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: We were
talking about this before.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.600
I'm like kind of co-opting
my boyfriend because he

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.430
buys a lot of
weird drugs online.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.366
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:39.220
And, they come in like strange--

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.760
LISA GREEN: Remember,
we are video'ing this.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.490
LEAH CHERNIKOFF:
Yeah, that's fine.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.900
They're all legal.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.494
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:45.494 --> 00:03:46.910
LAUREN SHERMAN:
Now, I really want

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.920
to know what kind
of legal drugs?

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.718
Is it like through
Canada or something?

00:03:50.718 --> 00:03:51.218
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:52.850
LEAH CHERNIKOFF:
[INAUDIBLE] from Asia.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.410
LAUREN SHERMAN: Oh, interesting.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.910
OK.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.430
We can talk about this offline.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.420
I think the weirdest
thing I've ever bought

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.840
is like a dog DNA test.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.580
I don't know if that's
that weird though.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.670
I mean, you guys are
doing stuff like that now.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.640
LISA GREEN: It's weird.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.890
LAUREN SHERMAN: And I've
tried to buy my own DNA test.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.690
But there are weird
rules in New York.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.420
And I've also bought like,
the "National Geographic."

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.600
It's like the "23 and Me"
thing, but what they do.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.459
And it's $100 bucks.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.079
But the doggie DNA was
probably the weirdest.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.700
And it confirmed
what we already knew.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.860
So it was also a
waste of money, but--

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.457
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:25.457 --> 00:04:26.040
--it was good.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.000
STEVEN ALAN: What was that
"National Geographic"?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.770
I'm just curious about that.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.686
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: It's
all about her ancestors.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.440
LAUREN SHERMAN: You
like-- it's another story.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.250
It's too long.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.540
But, you like--
they take your DNA.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.210
And they find out
one-- I think it's

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.830
like your grandmother's
grandmother.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.540
Or guys can do-- women can't
do the guy's lineage too--

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.490
but you can find out like
one path of your lineage.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.060
And again, it was everything
that I already knew.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.530
It was not-- there was nothing
exciting in there, except one.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.080
But yeah.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.580
So.

00:04:59.384 --> 00:05:00.300
LISA GREEN: All right.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.280
Well, thanks guys.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.250
Now, the rest of this is gonna
be so boring in comparison.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.665
But, let's just start
pretty general with what's

00:05:06.665 --> 00:05:09.290
the biggest change that you see
in the way people are shopping?

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.020
Leah, you've got the
mike, so why don't you--

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.280
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: Um, I think
what I've noticed most,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.080
and what I'm guilty of myself,
with everything being online

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.940
now, is if you see
one thing online,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.950
I immediately go to
like 10 other sites

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.130
to see which site has it at
the cheapest price point.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.270
So I think that's
really changing

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.310
the way-- people
aren't just maybe going

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.800
to one online
shopping destination.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.549
But sort of scoping it out.

00:05:37.549 --> 00:05:38.090
I don't know.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.923
We were talking about
the death of Huckster,

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:42.758
but that's kind of
what that did, right?

00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:45.680
LISA GREEN: If anybody
else has anything to add,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.360
or we could move on to the next.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.602
You've got something, Steven?

00:05:49.602 --> 00:05:50.461
STEVEN ALAN: No.

00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:50.960
Go ahead.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.793
LISA GREEN: Nothing?

00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:52.980
OK.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.856
In terms of devices,
I think that's kind of

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:57.480
been the big theme
lately is, we're all

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.880
talking about being multi-screen
and going from one device

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.990
to the next, and kind
of switching it all up?

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.240
Which one do you think has
become the most influential

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.250
on purchase decisions?

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.862
So not necessarily which one
is the one with the last click,

00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:12.070
because I think that we're
all aware of what that is.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.220
But what do you think?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.270
You know, from TV to a magazine,
to a phone, to a computer,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.517
to a billboard, to
in-store signage-- what

00:06:21.517 --> 00:06:23.850
do you think really has the
most influence on purchasing

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.350
decisions?

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.579
Steven.

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:29.050
STEVEN ALAN: I
think that, I mean,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.660
mobile is definitely the
most important thing.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.250
And I think that now
what we're seeing

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.790
is definitely sort of the tablet
gaining more and more strength

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.420
compared to the phone.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.630
Just because people are just
able to carry it around in.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.540
They're smaller.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.230
And even the phones are
becoming more like tablets.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.690
So the line is getting blurred.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.690
LISA GREEN: The phablet?

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.440
STEVEN ALAN: Yeah.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.522
I guess.

00:06:52.522 --> 00:06:54.590
LISA GREEN: Anything
else you guys think?

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.825
Like, why do you think mobile
and tablet are becoming so big?

00:06:57.825 --> 00:06:58.700
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.770
Obviously I agree
that mobile is huge.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.590
I just did a story this weekend
on buying fine jewelry online,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.630
for the "Wall Street
Journal"'s Weekend Section.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.130
And a lot of these fine
jewelry retailers-- people

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.224
are buying $60,000 pairs
of earrings on their phone.

00:07:14.224 --> 00:07:16.390
And I mean, that's been
happening in Asia for years.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.200
But now it's becoming
more prevalent here.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.520
But I also think that the phone
and the tablet connect you.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.050
If you're in the store and
you see something-- and all

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.500
this cross-channel stuff
that people call Omni Channel

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.190
or whatever-- is those
things are the connectors.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.860
So whether that means
going into a store

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.380
and them having tablets
for you to buy more stuff.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.360
Or that means you looking
on your phone, that's

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.200
the thing that's
really connecting us,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.870
is the mobile aspect of it.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.370
And

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.570
LISA GREEN: And what do you guys
think is that big opportunity?

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.050
I think Lauren makes a
really good point about how

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.350
mobile kind of connects
you while you're in store.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.620
If you could sort
of create-- Steven,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.080
maybe for you in your stores?

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.910
How do you feel like your--
you guys should be using mobile

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.259
once somebody is already there?

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:03.050
STEVEN ALAN: We do.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.880
I mean we have
iPads in the stores.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.270
And people come in
the store and then,

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.890
if we don't have something,
then usually the associate

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.870
will go online and see
if we have it online.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.360
Then they'll be able to
help them and complete

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.460
that purchase online.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.010
Or, if another store
has it, again they

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:26.047
can check inventory with the
same app at and other stores,

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:26.630
and sell that.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:26.840
Had

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.950
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah,
it's such a simple thing.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.430
But my husband's a big
fan of Steven's stuff.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.690
And he-- that, like,
sea-green sweatshirt you guys

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.460
did for spring?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.520
He really wanted it.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.230
But it was sold out
on his size online.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.970
And it said on there that it was
available in the Tribeca store.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.909
So he went there.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.075
That's something that's
been around for a long time.

00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:46.202
But I feel like people
are really using it now.

00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:48.660
Whereas maybe five years ago,
he wouldn't have even thought

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.481
of checking to see if it
was available in a store,

00:08:51.481 --> 00:08:53.480
or he would have picked
up the phone and called,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.284
instead of figuring it online.

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:56.700
STEVEN ALAN: That's
also-- I mean,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.040
for us, that was definitely like
101, was being able to do that.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.320
And if we didn't have it online,
just have it pop up and say,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320
sorry we're out of that.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.470
But we have it.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.460
And it would be by the SKU.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.390
So it won't tell you to call
a store if they don't actually

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.260
have that size in that item.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.750
But then, 2.0 would
definitely be--

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.910
online would actually just
start scanning all the stores.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:26.250
And then be able to just
continue that order without you

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.267
having to call the store
and have the store ship it

00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:30.350
to you and all that stuff.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.599
The store would still do that.

00:09:31.599 --> 00:09:33.630
But you wouldn't
necessarily know that.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.670
And so I think that
for me, as a retailer

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.290
I want to really make that
whole experience as seamless

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.320
as possible.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.260
So sometimes you don't want
to even necessarily buy it.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.000
You want to kind of see it,
or touch it, or feel it.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.960
So, to be able to be at home
at 2 o'clock in the morning,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.847
go online and just shop, but
actually not purchase and say,

00:09:56.847 --> 00:09:57.430
you know what?

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.254
Tomorrow I'd like
to try that on.

00:09:59.254 --> 00:10:00.670
I'll be in the
store at 2 o'clock.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.360
And you know, have that
whole experience happen.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.096
That's something that-- I don't
know who's doing that at all.

00:10:06.096 --> 00:10:07.720
But that's something
that I want to do.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.020
Because I think it's important.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.991
You want to be able to do that.

00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:13.550
LISA GREEN: I saw
a study recently

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.580
that said that
people would prefer

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.630
to consult their phone
than a sales associate.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.780
So even when they
walk into a store,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.360
the first thing that they do
is they look at their phone,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.710
rather than ask for help.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.010
And in fact people
will say, is there

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.260
something I can help you with?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.450
Can I help you?

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.210
And they say, oh no no.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.810
No thanks.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.268
And there they are,
on their phone.

00:10:31.268 --> 00:10:33.634
So what do you suggest?

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.800
How do you think you can
use that to your advantage?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.070
Or how could a retailer use
that to their advantage,

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.920
rather than it being
something that's

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.885
coming between the customer?

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:44.931
STEVEN ALAN: I mean,
that's definitely something

00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:45.680
that we're seeing.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.055
People are coming
into the store,

00:10:47.055 --> 00:10:49.730
and they're definitely trying
to get more information

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.646
on products while
they're in the store.

00:10:51.646 --> 00:10:53.270
And I think in the
future, whether it's

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:58.040
QR codes or something, where you
can actually really do a deeper

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.180
dive-- Because I think that even
the people working in the store

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.730
have a limited amount
of information.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.980
But what you can
actually-- you can videos.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.830
You can do anything,
depending on the product.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.220
LISA GREEN: Maybe
Brett, maybe we

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.890
can loop you into to the
conversation a little bit,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.480
in terms of, what
brands do you think

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.200
are doing interesting
things with all

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.620
of these-- the direction
that shopping is moving in?

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.617
Have you seen
anything interesting?

00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:26.200
BRETT HEYMAN: Well, I myself am
obsessed with personalisation.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.175
Like, we launched
our website mid-June.

00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:30.800
And we have a bespoke component
where you can type in your name

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.258
and see how it
would look on a bag.

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:34.140
And so I would love to
develop that further.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.960
And so in that
vein, I'm obsessed

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.760
with the Nike interface,
when you can do the bespoke.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.380
But I also love how
Warby Parker does

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.700
the-- you can upload your
face and try on the glasses

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.050
virtually.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.730
It is my dream to have a virtual
dressing room for my body,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.730
and just have your
body up there,

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.047
and have your virtual
clothes, and never ever ever

00:11:53.047 --> 00:11:54.588
have to try on
anything in real time.

00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:55.397
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:55.397 --> 00:11:56.730
LISA GREEN: What about you guys?

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.520
Have you seen anything, any
brands that you would call out

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.892
as doing anything
really interesting?

00:12:01.892 --> 00:12:03.142
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: I don't know.

00:12:03.142 --> 00:12:05.610
Nothing comes to mind for me.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.350
LAUREN SHERMAN: I think Nike and
personalization stuff is cool.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.890
I mean, I think there
are the obvious ones.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:17.250
Burberry and you know, that
get called out again and again

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:17.920
and again.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.130
But I think, there's a brand
in the UK called "Matches."

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.020
They sell a lot.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.730
They have a huge
presence online.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.470
But they sell a lot of-- they
have a bunch of boutiques.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.180
They sell really
expensive clothes.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.490
And they have a thing.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.020
They sell tons of SKUs online.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.070
Tons of denim.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.810
Tons of contemporary.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.661
So most of you work, I
think, in ad, fashion ads,

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:44.160
so you probably
know contemporaries,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.320
like mid-price stuff.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.680
But they don't have much
of that in the boutique,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.679
because they don't have
a lot of square footage.

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:52.570
They only have dressed
that are $1,000 or more.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.770
So when they're in the
store, they have iPads out.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.200
And they're kind of
training their probably very

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.270
well-paid customer service
people to kind of loop

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.990
in the stuff on the iPad.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.394
And anecdotally, they've
told me that a lot of people

00:13:09.394 --> 00:13:10.810
who have never
bought stuff online

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.960
before are buying jeans through
them, or a pair of earrings,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.250
or something like that,
while they're in the store.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:21.690
So I think that kind of
stuff, it's still clunky.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.150
And it's not where
it needs to be.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:29.590
But the more that happens,
the more exciting shopping

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.595
is going to become.

00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:34.776
LISA GREEN: And a little bit
in the personalization vein,

00:13:34.776 --> 00:13:36.400
we were discussing
a little bit earlier

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.340
that, I read an
article this morning

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.710
about how big data can really
play a role in personalization.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.390
The article was about this
guy who had received an email

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.499
to install solar
panels on his home.

00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:49.790
But it was really personalized.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.590
The company had used the
Google Maps technology

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.970
and overlaid their own
API, whatever they did.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.970
And they said they found
that this guy's house was

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.250
perfect for installing
solar panels.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.530
And so the email said that.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.946
It said, we've
done some research.

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:08.270
And your house is
great for solar panels.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.280
And he clicked on it.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.840
And the link brought him to
another personalized place

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.180
that had Google Earth imagery.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.770
And said, here's what we would
do with your solar panels.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.350
And the next clip
was to a rep, who

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.380
already had all his
information and was ready.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.500
He didn't have to say anything.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.520
It was such a powerful
way to use data,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.826
instead of it just
being, oh, well

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:28.950
you bought a pair of jeans.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.400
So you should buy more jeans.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.850
Here's 30% off.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.840
What do you guys think could
be done in the fashion space

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.695
with all this data that
we now have access to?

00:14:41.415 --> 00:14:44.180
STEVEN ALAN: I think
that it's interesting.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.890
Because I was just
in L.A. last weekend.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.720
And I started getting
emails-- and I'm not even sure

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.820
how this was done, but--
I started getting emails

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:57.250
for companies that
had L.A. stores,

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.570
but where I never received
the emails from those stores.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.476
I don't even know how they knew.

00:15:02.476 --> 00:15:06.200
I was just thinking about that.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.100
But I think that-- Definitely,
like for example right now,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.100
another initiative
is, if you come

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.230
into the store as
a customer, you

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.280
have your history of what
you've bought from the store.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.030
And then we have a history
of what you've bought online.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.110
But the sales
associates can't really

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.740
access what you've
bought online, yet.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.050
I mean, they will be able to.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.880
But I think that is
really important,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.140
to be able to see sort
of a complete profile.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.430
And another thing that
we're going to be using

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.650
is a technology called
Digital Marvels or Touche.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.215
I'm not sure which company.

00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:40.090
But it's interesting.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.710
What they do is,
they allow the person

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.460
who's at the store to be
able to sort of drag and drop

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.170
very easily.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.380
So if you're a customer, and
you want to find out information

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.420
on a particular brand-- you're
interested in acne, say,

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.070
now what's happening
is you might

00:15:55.070 --> 00:16:00.820
get an email with a couple links
on different items, whatever.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.020
But with this, you'd could
actually get-- I mean,

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.520
it's an app.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.920
You'd have to download the app.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.177
But then it would just be
really easy for the associate

00:16:08.177 --> 00:16:09.760
to just sort of drag
a bunch of things

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.460
that they think that you
might be interested in.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.250
And then you could
drag a bunch of things

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.380
out that you're
not interested in.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.215
It just really facilitates
a great experience.

00:16:23.926 --> 00:16:24.800
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.280
I'm actually working on a
story about this right now.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.600
And I think Gilt does a
really interesting job

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.510
with this stuff.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.329
They have a ton
of people working

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:36.370
on their personalization.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:40.835
They have a huge team of
engineers working on it.

00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:44.050
And I think that they've
actually done the best job.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.910
You know, they
think about climate.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.420
They think about where you are.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.930
They think of your size.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.550
And they really try
to whittle it down.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.600
So you get an email that
is only the products

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.660
that you'd actually want.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.521
Does it always work?

00:16:56.521 --> 00:16:57.020
No.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.480
But they're doing
interesting things with.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.710
And I think also it
can help in the buying

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.339
process for a lot
of big retailers.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.010
The way that
retailers buy things

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.660
is kind of very-- they
look at past data.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.990
And now they'll be able
to look current data,

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.599
and say, oh, people
across the internet

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.329
are buying green
shirts or whatever.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.960
Maybe we should
order or we should

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.220
get some green shirts
made, things like that.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.180
So I think there's a
lot of different ways

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.190
it can be applied.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:33.040
Some of them, it might
not be worth all the time

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.000
and effort, the end result.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.200
But I think,
especially if you're

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.450
a big, big multi-brand website,
to be able to kind of figure

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.130
out what's available in
people's sizes, in the things

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.850
that they'd already
like, is exciting.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:53.390
And the better that they get
at it, the more-- I guess,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.000
the less people
will even notice,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.337
or, hopefully it will
result in better sales.

00:17:58.337 --> 00:17:59.545
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.780
LISA GREEN: OK.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.120
So what about shifting
gears a little bit?

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.270
What about social?

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.840
What platforms do you think
are really making a difference?

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.100
I think that what
we see is brands

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.115
are really going after
kind of every platform.

00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:18.990
They're on Pinterest.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.630
They're on Instagram.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.950
They're on YouTube.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:20.820
They're on Facebook.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.632
And in fact, their marketing has
every little icon next to it.

00:18:24.632 --> 00:18:26.090
Which ones do you
guys really think

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.720
are actually having an
influence, driving purchase?

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.540
And as a brand,
which ones do you

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.990
feel like you are best
able to sort of communicate

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.153
your own messaging from?

00:18:35.153 --> 00:18:39.090
And from where you guys sit,
which brands-- what's working

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.097
and why?

00:18:42.097 --> 00:18:43.555
STEVEN ALAN: I mean
for us, I would

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:46.880
say Instagram is probably
the most effective.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.050
Because it's just so visual.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.840
I think that we can sort of
connect the dots with Instagram

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.230
better than anything else.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:00.080
And then with Instagram, goes
to Twitter, goes to Facebook.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.560
So it's very strong.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.800
We're about to launch another
app called Spring, which

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.390
will be-- I think
it's going to be very

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.760
significant in
the fashion space.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.620
Because it will actually be
a shoppable visual platform.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.765
So I think I'm
excited about that.

00:19:19.765 --> 00:19:22.974
BRETT HEYMAN: For us also,
Instagram's the most important.

00:19:22.974 --> 00:19:25.140
Being a small brand, and
just communicating directly

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.000
with the customers,
anytime I post a picture

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.290
that people like that,
I have so many people

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.720
asking if we'll ship to Mexico?

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.260
If we'll ship here,
and how much bags are.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.218
So I can directly interface
with the customers.

00:19:33.218 --> 00:19:36.146
And I get so many screenshots
of an Instagram post

00:19:36.146 --> 00:19:37.520
sent back to our
customer service

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.540
saying we want to
order this bag.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.581
Where do we get this bag?

00:19:39.581 --> 00:19:40.312
So it's great.

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.520
And then if there were ever--
if we want to do sales,

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.000
or now launching the website and
promoting sales on the website,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.740
we use Facebook.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.260
And I feel like that customer
is much more into what

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.860
your sales are,
what deal can I get.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.276
It's much more commerce-driven
than the visual, Instagram.

00:19:53.784 --> 00:19:54.700
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: Yeah.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.649
I would say Instagram too.

00:19:56.649 --> 00:19:58.190
And I also think
that Spring is going

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.902
to be a game changer, maybe.

00:20:02.902 --> 00:20:04.610
I don't know if you
guys know what it is.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.190
But as I understand it-- and I'm
getting a walk-through tomorrow

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.150
actually, of the app.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.740
But I've seen it in
its early stages too.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.780
It's like an Instagram feed,
but you can click to buy.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.660
And it's really, really
beautifully designed,

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.630
and really intuitive.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.600
So, I don't shop
online that much.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.540
That one makes a
lot of sense to me.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.140
So I think that--
and every major brand

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.460
is signing up with them.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.224
So I think that will be a force.

00:20:31.224 --> 00:20:32.640
But other than
that, yeah, I think

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.770
Instagram is such a
great way for brands

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.040
to present exactly the
image that they want.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.520
But then also you
see Style Bloggers,

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.680
and I think, what is
it, Like To Know It?

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.050
LAUREN SHERMAN: Like To Know It.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.966
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: I did
talk to a few bloggers.

00:20:46.966 --> 00:20:48.780
They are seeing commissions.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.145
So I think it's working too.

00:20:50.145 --> 00:20:52.667
It's another way to make
Instagram shoppable.

00:20:52.667 --> 00:20:54.250
That one seems like
more effort to me,

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.333
like, you have to sign up.

00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:57.130
And then more steps.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.560
But I think, when somebody
sees something on a girl

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.018
that they think looks really
cute, and they want the dress,

00:21:02.018 --> 00:21:03.600
it's a good way to get it.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.850
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah, I agree.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.820
Instagram and Spring-- I'm
also really excited about.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.530
I think, if anybody's
going to be able to do it--

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.930
what companies like
List and I'm trying

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.030
to think of what the other
ones are called, and Fancy,

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.690
have tried to do with fashion
and have not been able to.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.760
I really think Spring might
have a chance to do it.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.220
Especially because it's--
they're doing partnerships.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.826
It's not affiliate-based
as I think I'm correct?

00:21:31.826 --> 00:21:33.850
STEVEN ALAN: What do you mean?

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.400
Partnerships as opposed to?

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.810
LAUREN SHERMAN: As opposed
to just a feed, API.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:38.755
STEVEN ALAN: Oh, no.

00:21:38.755 --> 00:21:39.480
It's total partnerships.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:39.675
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:21:39.675 --> 00:21:40.660
So it's not an API.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.000
So it's just very interesting.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.730
And I think that when that
launches, if it takes off,

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:49.920
it's going to be huge.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.857
Or it will flop it.

00:21:50.857 --> 00:21:52.940
But I have a feeling it's
going to be really good.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.280
LISA GREEN: So it'll
be good, or not good.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.524
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:21:55.524 --> 00:21:56.940
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: But you
create the imagery, right?

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.540
STEVEN ALAN: Yeah.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.140
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: So
every brands creates--

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.380
like, they have
complete control.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.213
So I think that that's
part of the reason it

00:22:02.213 --> 00:22:04.290
will be so successful.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.460
LISA GREEN: So, in
that vein, do you

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.810
think that there's a danger of
kind of commercializing what

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.960
consumers feel like is
somewhat organic at this point?

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.040
So, in the same way, like
maybe, if I think about it

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.480
from a video aspect,
should brands

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.090
be making their
videos more shoppable?

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.980
Should there be this sort
of seamless interaction

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.680
between a beautiful brand
video that you could actually

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.570
click to buy?

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.460
Or do you think--
because it sounds

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.710
like what you guys are saying
is, Instagram's awesome.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.750
And it'll be more awesome
if you can buy from it.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.760
So do you think it's
the same with video?

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.306
LAUREN SHERMAN: I don't think
many people watch fancy brand

00:22:39.306 --> 00:22:39.805
videos.

00:22:39.805 --> 00:22:41.074
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: [INAUDIBLE]
actually launched today.

00:22:41.074 --> 00:22:42.795
Cinematique, did you see that?

00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:43.670
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.400
They've been doing stuff
on [INAUDIBLE] for a while.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.690
But it could work.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:51.590
And it's interesting.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:56.430
But I think what sells are
YouTube people, like vloggers.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.527
I think that they can really
sell product via the web.

00:22:59.527 --> 00:23:02.840
And I think on the
really high end, I mean,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.710
I think occasionally
it does work.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.897
And there are certain
viral fashion videos

00:23:08.897 --> 00:23:09.730
that have done well.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.000
And maybe if they had click
to buy on them-- like,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.100
Rachel Antonoff does
some really cool ones.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.176
If they had had click to buy,
maybe it would have done well.

00:23:17.176 --> 00:23:18.550
But I think that
that's something

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.640
that bigger brands
haven't figured out yet.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.140
STEVEN ALAN: I'd
heard the other day

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.740
that I think there was
15,000 people on YouTube that

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.230
have a greater
following than Vogue.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.670
LAUREN SHERMAN: Oh yeah.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.240
STEVEN ALAN: It
was just amazing.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.740
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah, and even
if people are watching things

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.550
on Vogue-- I mean, Leah
could speak to this more

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.070
because I haven't been
editing a site for a while.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.530
But it's really hard to get
people to shop via editorial,

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.300
when you're a really big name.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.500
If you're a blogger,
it's easier.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.350
Because they have a
closer connection.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:24:00.430
But to get someone to buy
something via a story,

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.850
it's not really why people are
going to editorial websites.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.060
I don't know that's changing.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.340
Do you think it is?

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.950
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: No.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.710
I think it's easier online.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.440
Because throughout the day, we
have smaller market stories.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.010
And they're much more focused.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.740
Or maybe one is really centered
around an editor who functions

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.180
in that way more like a blogger.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.960
Because then you sort of
might follow that editor

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.415
on their social
channels and feel

00:24:24.415 --> 00:24:25.540
a more personal connection.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.062
So if they pick the product,
maybe wear it themselves,

00:24:29.062 --> 00:24:31.020
you might be more inclined
to buy it than maybe

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.410
if you just saw like a
roundup of like 100 boots.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.950
But you might get a sense of
the direction you want to go in.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.120
I still think it offers
guidance, but not

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.140
in the same way of an immediate
sort of drive to sale.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.750
And then this thing that-- I got
a walk-through of Cinematique

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.060
which makes shoppable videos.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.520
And it launched with
Net-a-Porter today.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.990
And I still, I mean as
someone who runs a site,

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.240
it's hard to get
people to watch videos.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.880
Like, we don't have a user's
attention for very long.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.900
And so the videos
have to be short.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.560
And I think, it's
also just going to--

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.900
you have to change the way users
interact with video, to let

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.440
them know like, oh, you
can hover over the video

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.910
and click things in.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.310
And I think that's
just not-- it's really

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.550
going to have to
be a behavior shift

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:21.010
to let people know
that that's possible.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.187
LISA GREEN: Cool.

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:23.770
I'm going to open
it up for questions.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:24.950
I can keep asking them.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.830
But I don't if anybody in
the audience has anything.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:31.720
You can just raise your hand
if you've got any questions.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.419
Oh, OK.

00:25:33.419 --> 00:25:35.460
AUDIENCE: What do you
think is the next big thing

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.298
in e-commerce in
regards to shopping?

00:25:38.298 --> 00:25:42.555
Or what would you
like to see next?

00:25:42.555 --> 00:25:44.990
LAUREN SHERMAN: I
think that beauty

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.970
is something has a
lot of opportunity.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.030
There's a ton of
opportunity via YouTube

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.130
and beauty, which is
already happening.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.330
But I think that the beauty
space-- a lot of beauty brands

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:01.170
have a weird rule that if you
don't have any brick and mortar

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.620
store, you can't sell
their stuff online.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.410
And someone explained to me
why that is the other day.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.800
Because every beauty person I
meet, I ask them why that is.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.960
But they're really
strict about it.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.640
So a lot of beauty sites that
don't have brick and mortar,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.270
they don't have a
lot of big brands.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:23.100
And I think that that's
going to start-- I mean,

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.680
Amazon has everything.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.440
Because they pool from--
it's not regulated.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.760
And obviously you guys
know how that works.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.370
But I think beauty
is a huge space.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.520
It doesn't-- as much as people
say you need to try on product,

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.091
people have been shopping via
Avon catalogs for 100 years

00:26:43.091 --> 00:26:43.590
or whatever.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.510
I don't think that
that's a barrier.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.030
And I think there aren't
that many big players.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:49.790
There's Amazon.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.420
There are the bigger websites.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.140
And there is Sephora.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.590
But there isn't a
ton in that space.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.190
And that to me, that's
what I'm looking at,

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:03.950
at different e-commerce
opportunities in there.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.870
And I also think just the
closer connection with in-store.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.450
I mean, there was
some survey that

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:15.580
said that people still
prefer to shop in-store.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.580
I haven't looked
at the data enough

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.030
to know whether or
not it was BS or not.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.010
But I think that people
are using the web.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.920
Regardless, every
purchase is made with web.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.436
So just the closer the
connection is between the two,

00:27:30.436 --> 00:27:34.632
the better off the
retailer is, I think.

00:27:34.632 --> 00:27:38.290
LISA GREEN: You guys have
anything about e-commerce.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.620
STEVEN ALAN: I would just--
I think when 3D-- I mean,

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:47.610
that's going to be revolutionary
in shopping, I think.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.920
And just quality
imagery in general.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.880
When we photograph things,
it's always just the lighting

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.100
and being able to
really see color.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.770
So I think as
technology advances,

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:02.017
that's going to really
help with things like that.

00:28:02.017 --> 00:28:03.600
LISA GREEN: One of
the other questions

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.558
that I have which, I
haven't gotten to ask yet,

00:28:05.558 --> 00:28:08.390
which seems like a right to
ask it is, so if Google could

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.950
design the perfect product for
fashion brands, what would that

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:12.970
look like to you guys?

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:16.140
What's missing in this space
that you think you really

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.470
need to drive your sales,
or to promote your brand,

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.989
or that you really think
is missing to make fashion

00:28:21.989 --> 00:28:24.030
more exciting, more
accessible, more Interesting?

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:27.770
Leah?

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:28.874
I'm gonna call on Leah.

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:30.790
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: That's
a really big question.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.415
LISA GREEN: OK.

00:28:31.415 --> 00:28:33.121
Brett?

00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:35.370
BRETT HEYMAN: I'm sticking
with virtual dressing room.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:35.675
LISA GREEN: That's right.

00:28:35.675 --> 00:28:36.660
You nailed it.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.580
BRETT HEYMAN: It's
applicable for beauty, too.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.270
Uplighting your face,
what colors work?

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.228
I just feel like that's
going to be everything.

00:28:44.888 --> 00:28:47.440
STEVEN ALAN: I think
checkout, too, is a big deal.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.350
I mean obviously,
like Amazon checkout,

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.470
it just makes it so easy.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.410
But I think just
having this sort

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.520
of seamless one-click
ability to do

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.710
that, I think it'll
help with that.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.210
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: And making
returns as easy as possible,

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:04.430
too.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.805
I mean, I think that's the
number one thing that stops me

00:29:06.805 --> 00:29:09.390
from shopping online is because
I know that, if I get it,

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.264
and then I wait too
long, I'm screwed.

00:29:11.264 --> 00:29:11.930
And I've got it.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.460
So I tend to only make
purchases when I really

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.050
know that it's
something like-- brand

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.633
that I love, the
size of that fits me.

00:29:18.633 --> 00:29:20.009
And I know all
these things work.

00:29:20.009 --> 00:29:22.091
STEVEN ALAN: And you were
saying in the beginning,

00:29:22.091 --> 00:29:24.440
you were saying about
checking different sites

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.384
to see who had it
at a lower price?

00:29:27.384 --> 00:29:29.800
I would think that if there
was an app that actually could

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.250
do that for you, where
you just automatically

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.080
have whatever the sites
that you would check.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.391
And it would just tell you, OK.

00:29:37.391 --> 00:29:37.890
Buy it.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.570
It's cheapest.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.720
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: And you would
have a definitive answer.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.595
STEVEN ALAN: So they do
it with air fare now.

00:29:42.595 --> 00:29:46.040
So it seems like, if they do
with airfare, they could do it.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.057
LISA GREEN: We have--
there's a particular brand

00:29:48.057 --> 00:29:50.390
that we work with who's in
the sort of accessible luxury

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:50.890
space.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.550
So their goods are about
$400, kind of in that range.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.790
And what we've found
that's really interesting,

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.480
that their shipping is
actually quite expensive.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.549
But for some reason, they
are still making sales,

00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:04.090
even though their
product is actually

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.800
sold by other wholesalers.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.416
What do you guys make of that?

00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:09.915
We're trying to
figure out, is there

00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:12.380
a reason why you think
consumers might still

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.140
prefer to buy brand-direct
versus from Shopbop

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:20.740
or Bloomingdale's
or Steven Allan?

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.380
How do you guys
sweeten the deal?

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.380
How do you get people to
buy something from you,

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.410
even if it's not
necessarily price?

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.244
Like, why buy it
from StevenAlan.com.

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:30.910
STEVEN ALAN: Well, I
mean, I don't know.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.120
I guess with anything,
if I'm buying a product,

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.960
and it's from the source,
then I would think maybe it's

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.950
in better condition.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:40.602
It's not coming off of
some shelf on a store,

00:30:40.602 --> 00:30:41.810
where they're wrapping it up.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:46.440
And if there is a problem,
that I can call that company.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.680
And they'll certainly
stand behind their product.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.370
Whereas if you're
selling another product,

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.920
you can only stand
behind it-- well,

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.003
you could stand behind it.

00:30:54.003 --> 00:30:56.990
But it's not always the same
as if you're buying it direct.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:02.229
I mean, I just-- actually
it doesn't relate.

00:31:02.229 --> 00:31:03.520
I was just thinking of pillows.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.130
Because I'm buying pillows.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.950
But I can't think of
the analogy that I

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.241
wanted to think of, so, anyway.

00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:10.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:10.462 --> 00:31:13.560
BRETT HEYMAN: I just, for
me, I shop on Net-a-Porter

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.390
because it's very expedient.

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.330
Like it's fast.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:17.329
It's same day.

00:31:17.329 --> 00:31:19.370
That's something we offer
in New York on our site

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.010
and would love to roll it out
eventually at other places.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.780
And you mentioned Spring.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.113
We just had our Spring training.

00:31:24.113 --> 00:31:27.700
And they're only offering one
mode and method of shipping.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.264
I think everybody wants things
so fast that there's not

00:31:30.264 --> 00:31:31.930
like-- you know,
normally you check out.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.600
You have ground, expedited,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.210
And Spring is only
offering expedited.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.960
So I just think--

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.310
STEVEN ALAN: It's also free.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.060
BRETT HEYMAN: Yes.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.712
LISA GREEN: It's free expedited.

00:31:42.712 --> 00:31:44.870
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah,
I think the big reason

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:46.730
would be selection.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:51.080
So assume that retailer may
have one or two things on-- you

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.867
can go to Edie Parker and
get probably everything

00:31:54.867 --> 00:31:56.450
that you've done
that season, plus all

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.590
the personalization stuff.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.048
Whereas, if you go
on Net-a-Porter,

00:31:59.048 --> 00:32:00.800
there are probably
four SKUs or something.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.380
I think that's a
big part of it is

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:07.460
that, I like to shop at
individual websites a lot.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.280
Because it's usually
every single product

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.530
that they've done that season.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:16.070
And when it's not,
I think, oh, you

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.840
didn't buy that for yourself?

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.090
And now I have to
go-- So you know,

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.640
so I think that
that's a part of it,

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.900
too, is just there's usually
a much bigger selection

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.825
on individual sites.

00:32:25.825 --> 00:32:27.950
LISA GREEN: What about the
same day delivery thing?

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:31.160
I mean, you guys hopefully,
maybe have bought something

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.780
using Google Shopping Express.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.690
But So we recently
launched it in New York.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.900
It's been in the Bay
Area for quite awhile.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.872
And we've got it in
West L.A. as well.

00:32:39.872 --> 00:32:42.080
It's this idea that you can
not only get it same day,

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.820
but you can actually schedule.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.510
Very similar to what you
do with Net-a-Porter.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.690
It's subscription-based.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.610
And right now, you get
six months for free.

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:50.824
So go home and try it out.

00:32:50.824 --> 00:32:52.990
But what do you think about
that for fashion brands?

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.720
Because currently it's very
focused on everyday essentials.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.776
It's Walgreens, Target,
Costco, Fairway.

00:32:58.776 --> 00:32:59.400
Help me people.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.870
What else am I missing?

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.170
L'Occitane.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.830
Costco.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:04.560
Toys-R-Us.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.140
Yes, how can I forget?

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.420
I'm using it all the time.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.810
So what do you think
about the likelihood

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:14.500
of fashion brands getting into
this space and the ability

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.770
to deliver goods same day?

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:17.740
Why would they say yes?

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.605
And why wouldn't they do it?

00:33:18.605 --> 00:33:19.680
STEVEN ALAN: We've tried it.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.560
We did it in holiday.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.680
We did same day delivery.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.630
We had messengers delivering it.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.338
But I'm not sure.

00:33:23.338 --> 00:33:25.240
I don't know what
would be involved

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.310
in doing it with Google.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.110
Like, I don't know what the
costs would be for the company,

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.106
and how the whole
thing would work out.

00:33:32.106 --> 00:33:33.230
So it would be hard to say.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.140
LISA GREEN: So let's take
it from-- because I'm not

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.330
going to sell you the
product right now.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.300
So let's take it from the sort
of consumer perspective, right?

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.360
Do you think that that's
something consumers

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.485
are really looking for now?

00:33:42.485 --> 00:33:44.820
Or do you think that we've
got another year or two where

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.280
people are still happy
with two-day delivery

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.192
or whatever it is?

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:50.150
STEVEN ALAN: I think it's
always good to offer.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.750
I mean, all things
being equal, I

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.136
think it'd be nice
thing to offer.

00:33:55.136 --> 00:33:57.560
LAUREN SHERMAN: I would use it.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.670
I think we are in a bubble of
a world where it's like, oh,

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.159
I can't go get that bag that
I really want for this wedding

00:34:05.159 --> 00:34:05.700
this weekend.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.770
Because I don't
have enough time.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.920
So if someone could just
get it to me by Friday,

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.860
that'd be great.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.050
And I definitely
pay extra for stuff.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.850
So I think that people--
there is a need for it.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:20.190
But it's just just a matter of
money and logistics in general.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.639
When you're here, it's easy.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:24.230
But if you're in
Idaho or whatever,

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.925
and you need a bag next
day, it's, you know,

00:34:27.925 --> 00:34:29.170
it seem kind of impossible.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:30.160
STEVEN ALAN:
Another thing too, I

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.326
was thinking about before
when you were asking about

00:34:32.326 --> 00:34:34.480
the-- just when we're
talking about the fact

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.850
that your selection is so much
better in a single branded type

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.575
store.

00:34:40.575 --> 00:34:41.949
It reminded me
of, there's a site

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:44.840
in Japan called Zozotown,
which is interesting

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.210
because they have all
these individual stores.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:51.030
But it's kind of like a virtual
shopping mall, in a sense.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.179
And people have
tried to do it here,

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:55.570
but I don't know
of anyone that's

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.220
really been effective
doing it here.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.065
But it's pretty interesting.

00:35:02.065 --> 00:35:04.440
LISA GREEN: It's essentially
what Google Shopping Express

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.611
is, just so you know.

00:35:05.611 --> 00:35:06.110
It is.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.310
It's all these different stores.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.470
You're buying directly
from the store.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.430
But it's being delivered
to you by Google.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.947
So that's the--

00:35:11.947 --> 00:35:14.530
STEVEN ALAN: So all the stores
are linked on Shopping Express?

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:14.950
LISA GREEN: Yes, so
it's basically a mall.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:15.460
You should go.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.293
Google.com/Express .

00:35:16.293 --> 00:35:17.279
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:17.279 --> 00:35:17.945
STEVEN ALAN: OK.

00:35:17.945 --> 00:35:18.380
I'm going to check it out.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:18.970
LISA GREEN: But just
so you guys know,

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:21.280
it's basically a mall where
you can buy from all this--

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.610
they're all local stores.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:24.010
They're stores
you would go out--

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.385
LAUREN SHERMAN:
I definitely have

00:35:25.385 --> 00:35:26.860
bought stuff via
Google Shopping.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.880
Because I buy pretty
much everything online.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.302
So I've definitely
done it before.

00:35:30.302 --> 00:35:33.050
And I use it to
search for products.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.090
LISA GREEN: Yeah.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.580
Other questions from--
wait, I'm gonna go.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.680
Betty Ann?

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.222
I'm just trying to
diversify the room here.

00:35:43.222 --> 00:35:45.206
AUDIENCE: I'm Betty Ann.

00:35:45.206 --> 00:35:47.438
I manage our Fashion and
Lifestyle Partnerships

00:35:47.438 --> 00:35:48.678
on Google [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:48.678 --> 00:35:50.662
And I've actually worked on some
capacity with most of you guys,

00:35:50.662 --> 00:35:51.287
on the channel.

00:35:51.287 --> 00:35:55.126
I just wanted to quickly ask
about [INAUDIBLE] and iBeacon

00:35:55.126 --> 00:35:57.606
technology, and what your
thoughts are on that.

00:35:57.606 --> 00:35:59.962
You mentioned a lot of
mobile and the features

00:35:59.962 --> 00:36:05.046
in mobile, but what are you
guys thinking about [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:05.046 --> 00:36:06.150
STEVEN ALAN: Cautious.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.441
I mean, for me as a retailer
, just because I feel like

00:36:08.441 --> 00:36:12.915
there's always that-- am I
invading your space by--?

00:36:12.915 --> 00:36:14.540
But on the other
hand, I feel like it's

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.670
going to be so prevalent.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.670
And it's going to be so
common in the future.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:20.840
And so it's just a
question of doing it

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.402
in the appropriate way for me.

00:36:24.894 --> 00:36:25.810
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: Yeah.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.920
I mean, Elle is working
with iBeacon as well.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.200
I think it's the same thing.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.330
Like, I still
don't quite get it.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:31.871
I'm like, OK.

00:36:31.871 --> 00:36:33.420
So I just walk by something.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.520
And if I have the thing,
it pops into my phone.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.940
But yeah, I think it
would be about feeling,

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.800
walking the line of not
being too intrusive.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.340
But if it's offering a
service, I think, everyone,

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.150
no one wants to-- You know,
it's those extra steps

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.880
that stop you from
making a purchase,

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.020
or getting something done.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.460
So if iBeacon makes something
like that more seamless,

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.369
I think it's really helpful.

00:37:00.369 --> 00:37:01.702
LISA GREEN: You have a question?

00:37:01.702 --> 00:37:02.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.580
Just wanted to follow up on
a thought that I was having.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.760
When you mentioned
people price shopping

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.964
between different
sites, what you've

00:37:09.964 --> 00:37:12.130
seen over the last-- probably
more than five years--

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:15.095
but an increase in
collaborations between stores

00:37:15.095 --> 00:37:17.250
and designers
[INAUDIBLE] the sense.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:21.320
[INAUDIBLE] Even bigger,
luxury retailers like Barneys,

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.230
they all have their
own exclusives.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.436
Which in a way,
promotes their brand,

00:37:25.436 --> 00:37:28.340
that they have all these things,
but it also prevents people

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.680
from comparison shopping.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.090
So do you see that
becoming more prevalent?

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:34.520
More stores trying to
wake up with labels

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.100
and do direct
collaborations to keep

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.330
the customer at that store.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.480
STEVEN ALAN: Definitely.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.650
I mean, I think that as
much as you can do that.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.260
Sometimes it's a little
tricky for some retailers.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.070
Because let's say
you have one store.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.430
And you want to
collaborate with a brand.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:54.220
Usually the brand needs to
reach a certain minimum quantity

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:54.880
to produce.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.820
So let's say it's 200 units.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.654
And that could be
huge risk for you,

00:37:59.654 --> 00:38:01.320
even though you have
exclusive products.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.060
So, it's definitely a balance.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:08.191
But I think that the more
you can do that, the better.

00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:09.962
LISA GREEN: As a brand,
I mean that sounds

00:38:09.962 --> 00:38:11.670
like a bit of a
challenge, to be creating

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.837
a unique product for every--

00:38:12.837 --> 00:38:14.336
BRETT HEYMAN: It's
such a challenge.

00:38:14.336 --> 00:38:16.510
And every market, every
important retailer,

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:18.690
now more and more demands
their own exclusives.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.590
They want their own colors.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.214
They want-- they
don't want you to sell

00:38:21.214 --> 00:38:22.785
that bag to anybody else.

00:38:22.785 --> 00:38:24.035
It's really, really difficult.

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:27.040
And I would just say in a-- I
love all of my retail partners

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.050
but-- I've noticed that,
especially with my brick

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.939
and mortar retailers,
they are very, very

00:38:31.939 --> 00:38:32.980
specific about what they.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.250
And they'll design something
based on what we design.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:36.340
And I'm happy to oblige.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.730
Because I'm a small brand.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.460
But season after
season, I noticed

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.640
that those are the
bags that are still

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.140
on shelves at the
end of the season.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.810
Like, I don't think
the customer cares

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:48.782
as much about exclusive to
x store as the store does.

00:38:48.782 --> 00:38:49.970
STEVEN ALAN: Totally.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:51.940
And I think that a
lot of times buyers

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.120
want to be designers too.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.660
And it's sort of like,
what if we did this?

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.480
And we put the-- And
it's kind of like,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.577
are you sure about that?

00:38:58.577 --> 00:38:59.410
It's like, oh, yeah.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:00.100
Definitely.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.840
And we're going to buy it big.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.406
A lot of times it's like
a big-- especially a store

00:39:04.406 --> 00:39:05.954
chain or something like that.

00:39:05.954 --> 00:39:07.370
And it's like you
kind of know it.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.244
And then they get it.

00:39:08.244 --> 00:39:10.630
And exactly what you said,
they're stuck with it.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:12.730
And then you're like,
why did I do that?

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.110
I should have just
told them not do it.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.990
And, but that happens sometimes.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.340
And it doesn't really
merchandise back

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.430
with the collection.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.704
It's sort of like
this one-off thing.

00:39:23.704 --> 00:39:24.840
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: Yeah.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.520
I think you do see
more and more of them.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.160
But they only work when
they're really good.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.630
And then they go.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.870
And then you see it on
all your social channels.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.250
Like, the message gets out.

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:42.320
Like, Lauren just wrote about
Everlane with Langley Fox.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.012
But I think, and you
know, Barneys does a bunch

00:39:45.012 --> 00:39:46.220
that I think are really good.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.432
But--

00:39:47.432 --> 00:39:49.557
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah, but
whether or not those ones

00:39:49.557 --> 00:39:53.456
that they just did one
with the NBA player.

00:39:53.456 --> 00:39:54.075
Russell--

00:39:54.075 --> 00:39:55.205
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: Russell-

00:39:55.205 --> 00:39:57.630
LAUREN SHERMAN:
Russell West-- yeah.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:00.300
I just wrote a story about
NBA player style for Leah.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.280
I obviously know a lot about it.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.130
But I don't know
if those will sell.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.160
They did one with
Jasmine Soule who's

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.310
a fashion consultant
who's super cool.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.330
And everybody in fashion's
obsessed with her.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:10.830
And they

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:11.755
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:11.755 --> 00:40:15.160
I don't-- I mean, they probably
didn't make a lot of it.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.320
But I think, the
one that Everlane

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.590
did with Langley Fox
who's an Illustrator.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.590
And she's Ernest Hemingway's
great-granddaughter

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:25.010
or something.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.760
Who cares?

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.280
The shirts were amazing.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.940
And I bought three
of them immediately.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.880
But it was cool.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.100
She is cool.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.705
And I was like, well, I
would like to look like her.

00:40:33.705 --> 00:40:34.620
She's really cool.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:39.340
She's-- but, it was more about
the product being really good.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.700
And I think that's--

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.660
I love Steven did
with Katie Ermilio.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:49.320
And it's completely different
price point and different kind

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:49.920
of customer.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:55.500
But I happen to really like
both brands, so I got something.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.513
So I think it has to
be the right thing.

00:40:57.513 --> 00:40:59.638
AUDIENCE: It's either really
awesome, or clearance.

00:40:59.638 --> 00:41:00.560
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.084
Totally.

00:41:02.084 --> 00:41:04.075
LISA GREEN: Did you
still have a question?

00:41:04.075 --> 00:41:05.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.090
So I work with a
company I won't name

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:13.928
that's a global brand, household
name, where you can walk out

00:41:13.928 --> 00:41:16.344
of here and see a million
dollar billboard with their name

00:41:16.344 --> 00:41:16.812
on it.

00:41:16.812 --> 00:41:17.750
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: This
is a fun guessing game.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:19.833
AUDIENCE: And they still
don't believe in digital.

00:41:19.833 --> 00:41:23.306
And so, for all of
you, I'm not an expert

00:41:23.306 --> 00:41:25.764
in the fashion industry
like Katie is here.

00:41:25.764 --> 00:41:26.264
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:26.264 --> 00:41:29.570
I work with a bunch of
different [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.194
So I'm just wondering,
for each of you,

00:41:31.194 --> 00:41:33.444
you've seen-- you've been
in the industry a long time.

00:41:33.444 --> 00:41:40.068
[INAUDIBLE] more
watershed [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:40.068 --> 00:41:44.012
digital [INAUDIBLE] that could
be more organic stuff, paid

00:41:44.012 --> 00:41:46.500
media, online catalogs,
whatever it is.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.327
For you, what was
your watershed moment,

00:41:48.327 --> 00:41:50.410
where you saw and realized
how important online is

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:51.910
for the modern shopper?

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.470
STEVEN ALAN: I mean,
one thing in regards

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:59.890
to what you were saying-- I
mean, with online as opposed

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:02.400
to print, obviously,
you can track it.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.226
So if you're a business and
you're going to advertise,

00:42:05.226 --> 00:42:07.350
and you're going to take
out an ad in the magazine,

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.474
it's just sort of like, OK.

00:42:08.474 --> 00:42:09.690
Well let's hope for the best.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:11.410
It's like throwing darts.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:13.710
But online, you're
actually seeing it.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:17.530
You're actually seeing
the monetization

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.640
of what you're doing.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.610
And I think in the
future, more companies

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:24.930
are going to look
at more the latent

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.890
demand of what's happening.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:29.980
In other words, let's say
you're a retailer, a designer.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.010
And you have
product on the site.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:36.990
And you have buy 100 smalls,
100 mediums, 100 larges.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.720
Right?

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.990
And you sell all the mediums.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:41.029
So all you know
is, well I should

00:42:41.029 --> 00:42:42.070
have bought more mediums.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:43.690
Because I sold out.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.650
But I think in the
future more and more

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:47.900
companies will start
looking at that data

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.110
not as, well, I
sold 100 mediums.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:54.400
But 1,000 people clicked
on medium to buy it.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.770
And I only had 100.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.410
So not only did I
underbuy, but I really

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:03.540
should start to think about
just how I bought it in general.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.639
I don't know if that--

00:43:07.639 --> 00:43:09.680
LISA GREEN: it's hard to
believe that we're still

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.500
talking about people not
believing in online as just

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.600
a communication channel.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.825
Is that why we're
silent, I think?

00:43:15.825 --> 00:43:17.200
LAUREN SHERMAN:
I've had to write

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.520
a bunch of stories of brands
going online, and brands--

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.230
why aren't brands still online?

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:25.560
And I got online because
that's where I got a job.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.000
And what are you going to do?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.341
I wanted to work
at a Teen Vogue.

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:31.590
And I got a job at Forbes.com.

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.960
And it ended up
being great for me.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.540
But I was not excited to work
in at a financial website.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.750
And then I realized that,
oh, 30 million people just

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:42.550
read my story.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:46.310
And I'm getting emails from guys
in India asking about-- like.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.540
So I think that's
when you just realize

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.910
the power of the web and
the influence the web

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.850
has over print.

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:56.730
I mean, print still
has influence.

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:57.740
And it's still smart.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:03.390
And I'm assuming that the brand
is at a very high price point.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.090
OK, then I don't understand it.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:05.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.970
Like, if you're
Chanel or Celine,

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.960
which are the only ones
that I can think of.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.770
I mean, they don't
really need to.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:16.390
Because A, maybe they
will need to someday.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:19.560
But they sell a
ton of-- they sell

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:25.720
enough handbags to send
a 5,000 people to Dallas

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.030
for their $500 million
show or whatever.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:34.310
But I think that
once you see the--

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:35.980
are they not selling
online at all?

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.667
Or they just don't want to spend
on digital advertising online?

00:44:39.667 --> 00:44:41.000
AUDIENCE: They sell [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.400
LAUREN SHERMAN:
But they don't want

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.530
to spend on digital advertising.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:44.770
Is that the--?

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:45.733
Well.

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:48.325
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:48.325 --> 00:44:49.200
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.370
I mean.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.570
I think you really just
need to see the power of it.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:56.060
Like what Steven said
about the 100 SKUs.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.390
And then 1,000
people click on it.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.844
You see how important it is.

00:45:00.844 --> 00:45:02.760
And if they're still not
getting that, I mean,

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.218
I don't know what
their business is

00:45:04.218 --> 00:45:06.860
going to look like
in five years.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:11.820
But it's not going
to be-- I think

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:16.690
that they need to see its
power to appreciate it.

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:18.490
STEVEN ALAN: Also,
it's such a great tool.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.780
I mean, for me, it's
all about the product.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.690
It's about really building
this amazing product

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:25.870
and being able to
articulate that message.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:29.350
So I feel like it's
enabled me as a designer

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:34.910
to sort of reach a much
broader appeal than I could

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:38.370
with just having stores and
let's say, if I was taking out

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.750
an ad in a magazine
or something.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:45.060
You can really kind of dig
deeper and deeper on stuff.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.270
LISA GREEN: We've got time
for one last question.

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.589
If anybody has it?

00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:52.583
AUDIENCE: I'm curious to know.

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:55.078
So we've said a lot
in favor of online.

00:45:55.078 --> 00:45:57.074
And I'm the typical
online shopper.

00:45:57.074 --> 00:45:59.569
I buy everything online.

00:45:59.569 --> 00:46:03.062
Do you see a counter-argument
against being fully online?

00:46:03.062 --> 00:46:04.808
Do you think there's
still a place where

00:46:04.808 --> 00:46:07.054
you need to have brick
and mortar partners?

00:46:07.054 --> 00:46:09.050
And you need to have
your own storefront?

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.545
Or do you think you
could very easily

00:46:11.545 --> 00:46:14.206
have your entire brand,
product line, on a website

00:46:14.206 --> 00:46:15.537
and communicate solely online?

00:46:15.537 --> 00:46:20.028
Or do you think it needs
to be kind of both?

00:46:20.028 --> 00:46:21.971
STEVEN ALAN: I mean, I
think it could exist.

00:46:21.971 --> 00:46:22.470
Certainly.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:23.928
I mean, there's a
lot of companies.

00:46:23.928 --> 00:46:27.300
I was talking to this
guy the other day.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.730
And the business he picked
was the sexy business

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:32.240
of mattresses.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:32.870
Which is like--

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:33.703
LISA GREEN: Pillows.

00:46:33.703 --> 00:46:34.210
Mattresses.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:35.790
STEVEN ALAN: Yeah.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:36.950
It just happens.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:38.500
I just happened
to meet this guy.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:42.270
And he decided he was going to
start a mattress company called

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.470
Casper.

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:44.585
Casper-- beds.

00:46:44.585 --> 00:46:46.070
Or Casper mattresses.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.700
And basically it's all online.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.580
And he's competing
with Sleep-Ease

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:55.037
and all the other-- I mean,
it's a huge, huge business.

00:46:55.037 --> 00:46:56.620
And I just thought
it was interesting.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.540
Because you can't see it.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.340
So it's something that--
the mattress of all things.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.170
You want to-- you lie down.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:04.950
You do your test
and all that stuff.

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.580
So here's an example
where they're

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.600
selling a product that
traditionally has always

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.520
been a touch product.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.836
And very successful with it.

00:47:14.836 --> 00:47:15.336
So anyway.

00:47:20.166 --> 00:47:22.942
BRETT HEYMAN: I know for me,
my product is so tactile,

00:47:22.942 --> 00:47:24.650
that even though we're
doing well online,

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:26.750
I think there's still a
great benefit to people

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.730
feeling the acrylic and feeling
the confetti in it and all

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:30.810
the textures.

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.650
And I mean, this is
obviously a young room.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:35.540
But there are people in my
mother's generation and people

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.250
who are very supportive
who are still not

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:39.330
comfortable buying
luxury online.

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.400
I mean like, Amazon,
Google-- one thing.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.315
But luxury products-- they still
need to touch and feel and try.

00:47:45.315 --> 00:47:47.270
LAUREN SHERMAN: I
think menswear, too.

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:50.610
I think guys really
want to try stuff on.

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:52.737
Or see it.

00:47:52.737 --> 00:47:54.070
I was on Everlane the other day.

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:55.470
And my husband
was like, I really

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:56.720
want to try those polo shirts.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.940
But I just wish there was
somewhere I could go look.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:02.990
That's why I mean, Bonobos--
that's a whole other thing.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:04.830
Whether or not I
believe in that product,

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.413
I'm not going to
talk about right now.

00:48:06.413 --> 00:48:10.600
But I do you think the idea
of going into the store

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.640
and at least being
able to see it.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.840
And he said that to
me just off-handedly.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.770
And I think for
men, because they

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:21.040
tend to buy a bunch of the
same things-- is that right?

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:21.750
Yeah.

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:24.990
That they need to sometimes
to see it just once in person,

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:26.990
so they can just keep
buying it again and again.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.650
STEVEN ALAN: Yeah.

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.925
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: They don't
like going into big stores.

00:48:29.925 --> 00:48:31.633
STEVEN ALAN: I don't
think it's necessary

00:48:31.633 --> 00:48:34.860
to have as many stores
as maybe in the past.

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.820
I think terms of building a
brand, you would think, OK.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.380
Well you need to have all these
stores in all these cities.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.220
And I think now-- I
mean, it's definitely

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.440
important to have stores
in all these key cities.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.580
But, they're kind of
supplementing that experience.

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.920
So it really is a place to
sort of discover, touch.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.620
And it's OK.

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:57.620
I think the more and more
it's seen as something that's

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.380
completely OK to
go in and not buy

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.963
something and just
kind of look at it.

00:49:00.963 --> 00:49:05.344
And it's sort of like
this place to explore.

00:49:05.344 --> 00:49:06.260
LISA GREEN: All right.

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:10.280
I'll leave my final
question-- I don't need that.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.986
So we're frighteningly
already in August.

00:49:12.986 --> 00:49:14.610
And so we're kind of
hitting that slope

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:16.560
into fall and then holiday.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.960
If each of you could
just pick one big trend

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.711
that you're expecting to see
with the online, digital,

00:49:22.711 --> 00:49:24.960
retail revolution, what do
you think it's going to be?

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.245
And we'll start with Brett
and go down the line.

00:49:27.245 --> 00:49:29.230
BRETT HEYMAN: Just fast.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:30.230
Getting everything fast.

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:32.692
That's all I keep hearing.

00:49:32.692 --> 00:49:34.025
STEVEN ALAN: I think technology.

00:49:34.025 --> 00:49:37.100
I mean, I'm seeing a lot
more technical fabrics

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.620
than I did before,
performance-based fabrics.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:45.970
I think people are kind of more
and more curious about that.

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:47.772
LISA GREEN: Leah, you're up.

00:49:47.772 --> 00:49:52.230
LEAH CHERNIKOFF: Yeah,
I think speed certainly.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:55.076
And I mean, because--
I don't know.

00:49:55.076 --> 00:49:57.000
I do think people wait
till the last minute.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.480
I know I do.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.100
So there's that.

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:05.492
And then if I were to name of a
product, I think the jumpsuit.

00:50:05.492 --> 00:50:07.456
Yeah.

00:50:07.456 --> 00:50:09.550
LAUREN SHERMAN: Yeah,
I think that people

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.960
are just more and
more interested.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.260
And I think stores
and retailers are

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.030
going to try to
do more and more.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:18.490
They're going to experiment
more with stuff in-store.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.360
I know a couple of stories
that are opening here

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.360
in the fall that
are really trying

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.890
to make the store
experience immersive.

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.550
Maybe they're going
to go too far.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:33.540
But people are definitely
experimenting a lot

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.600
with that type of
thing too, and bringing

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.896
that whole multi-channel thing
into Omni channel, or whatever.

00:50:39.896 --> 00:50:40.960
I hate that word.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.002
But you know what I mean.

00:50:42.002 --> 00:50:43.584
LISA GREEN: Well
thank you guys again.

00:50:43.584 --> 00:50:45.120
I hope everybody enjoyed it.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.870
And we appreciate you
guys taking the time

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:47.920
to come down here.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.970
[APPLAUSE]
