[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:08.280
MARK PETRUZZI: Thank you
all for coming today.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.370
And as you might guess
from hearing my background

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.620
as a personal
consumer, I certainly

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.990
spend a lot of my time trying
to practice what I preach

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
and reducing my footprint and
shopping with the environment

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.720
and human health more in mind.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.330
Just as an example, my
two boys have recently

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.880
become very, very interested
in how their hair looks

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.410
and how they smell.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.060
And so, of course,
that means dad

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.490
has to help them shop to
find personal care products

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.073
that I'm comfortable
with them putting

00:00:34.073 --> 00:00:36.540
on their person, for
whatever purposes

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.600
in middle school and elementary
school that they're now being

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.311
so interested in having that.

00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:42.810
And it takes a
little longer to shop

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.820
with dad, because I
tend to read more labels

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.220
and look for more
ecolabels because

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.510
of what I do for a living.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.390
But finding more
sustainable products

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.844
is not always that easy.

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:55.260
Unlike when you
go to a restaurant

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.780
and you see the letter grade
right there very clearly

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.210
telling you the sanitation
rating for that restaurant.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.040
Or if you're buying an
electrical appliance

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.110
of some sort where you can
go to the end of the plug

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.820
and look for the
little hologram sticker

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.403
to tell you that
that's been certified

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:10.860
for electrical safety, sometimes
it takes a little bit of work.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.570
And how do you know
if something really

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.690
is as green as it's claiming
it is or as you want it to be?

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.950
So, one of the ways that we do
that in other areas of our life

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.080
is by asking trusted
third parties.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.184
Particularly when we're
shopping with our values

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.850
or spending a lot of
money on something.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.210
So, cars-- buying a car is a
good example-- buying a diamond

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.850
engagement ring is another
one, and buying a house.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.950
So if you're buying a
diamond engagement ring,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.010
you're spending a couple of
months' salary on something.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.020
The jeweler says this
is a great stone,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.660
but you want that third party
certificate that tells you it's

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.504
the right cut,
carat, clarity, and--

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:46.420
what's the other one--

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.420
I forget the fourth C.
It's been a while since I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.590
bought my engagement ring.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.250
But same thing when
you buy a house.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.860
The bank is going to want to
do an independent appraisal

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.235
to make sure it's
worth what they

00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:56.430
think it's worth with their
third party appraiser.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.510
You're probably going
to want to get a home

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.010
inspection from a third party.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.540
Because the seller says
it's a great house.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.748
We've never had any problems.

00:02:01.748 --> 00:02:04.800
But occasionally you
do find some things.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.320
And then our 2005
minivan recently

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.419
died, so we had the lovely
experience of buying

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.700
a new used car for our family.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.460
And nobody really loves
to go car shopping.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.940
So luckily, you can use
a trusted third party.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.420
You can buy a
certified pre-owned

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.880
which has gone through
an extensive checklist

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.067
to give you that comfort.

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:24.150
If you're buying something
out of the classifieds,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.649
maybe you bring your Uncle Frank
who's really good with cars

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.100
or you bring your mechanic--
a trusted third party--

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.750
to make sure the car really
is what you think it is.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.374
Because you're spending
a lot of money.

00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:34.770
So this is something that
we're very used to doing.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.170
But what about the smaller
purchases or purchases

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.510
now where we're shopping
with our values for health

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.400
or environmental reasons?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.690
And that's where third
party ecolabels can help.

00:02:46.412 --> 00:02:48.120
So today we're going
to talk a little bit

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120
about a network of ecolabels
from all around the world that

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.170
can really help you identify
what "green" really means.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.990
And about a party that
we're having in just a few

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.740
short weeks here to celebrate
the first annual World Ecolabel

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.340
Day.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.690
Now, I can't guarantee
that your boss is

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.439
going to give you that
day off, but please

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.900
feel free to advocate for that.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.960
It's the first one, so there's
no historical precedent.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.390
But we're really celebrating
the power of certified green

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.140
products to build that trust
with consumers who want to shop

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.270
and look for more
sustainable products,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.820
the power of third party
ecolabels to protect against

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.460
greenwashing or false green
claims-- which unfortunately,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.170
there's still a
lot of out there--

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.180
and the power to provide
superior environmental

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.090
performance.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.990
And we'll talk about all of
these as we go through today

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.810
But the Global Ecolabelling
Network is that organization.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.669
And they've been
linking consumers

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.710
to a world of environmentally
preferable products

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.744
now for a quarter of a century.

00:03:39.744 --> 00:03:41.160
And that's very
exciting, and I've

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.020
been privileged to
be a part of that.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.080
So each one of these
little red pins

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.550
is one of the programs
that's a member of the Global

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.470
Ecolabelling Network.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.346
And currently there
are 27 ecolabels

00:03:51.346 --> 00:03:53.220
from all around the
world representing nearly

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.349
60 countries and territories.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.890
And new programs are joining
all the time, which is exciting.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.617
As new programs
emerge, we want to make

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:01.950
sure that they're among the
brotherhood of credible ones

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.390
and not necessarily
the fluffy ones.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.570
So these members are all
third party sustainability

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.900
certifications that award
their seal of approval

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.510
only after their rigorous
environmental standards have

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.110
been met.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.930
That's the only way you can
get these seals of approval.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.290
So these certification labels--
or ecolabels, for short--

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.460
are based collectively on
about 1,500 different standards

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.620
that these 27 programs
have developed

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.650
for a wide range of product
and service categories.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.879
And they can be found on
over 600,000 products sold

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:32.670
all over the world.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.751
This idea, however,
of certifying products

00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.000
that meet some sort of a
higher environmental standard

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.340
is not a new one.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.690
The Blue Angel Program
in Germany, for example,

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.170
is the oldest member of the
Global Ecolabelling Network,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.730
and they've been doing
this for over 40 years.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.150
So this idea has been
around for a while.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.770
We're just continuing
to educate folks

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.870
on which are the good
guys that you can trust.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.080
The European Union ecolabel,
the official certification

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.710
for the EU members, sometimes
called the EU flower

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.860
because of the look.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.385
There's nearly
4,000 companies that

00:05:08.385 --> 00:05:10.760
have received certifications
from the China Environmental

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.710
Labeling Program for their
products and services.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.130
And the two US-based members
of GEN, Ecologo and Green Seal,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.680
are specified in the procurement
guidelines of more than half

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.527
of the 50 US states for
things like cleaning products,

00:05:23.527 --> 00:05:24.610
paper products, and paint.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.950
Now, according to the
International Organization

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.400
for Standardization, which
is also known as ISO,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.730
these type of lifecycle
multi-attribute GEN member

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.910
labels are referred to
as type one ecolabels.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.820
And a type one ecolabel,
as defined by ISO,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.000
is a voluntary, multiple
criteria-based, third party

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.210
certification that identifies
environmentally preferable

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.840
products when compared to other
products of the same type using

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.730
a lifecycle basis.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.390
Got it?

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.650
Pretty straightforward there.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.070
So in contrast to vague, green
symbols that a lot of products

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.010
have on their labels these days
or logos that manufacturers

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.720
create for their own
products and put on

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.150
as part of their
marketing, these labels

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.010
are only found on
products that have

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.170
met these rigorous
environmental standards

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.960
and proved that they meet them
through this unbiased third

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.760
party.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.680
Now if you shop
anytime recently,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.080
you know there are
hundreds of green labels

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.760
that you will see
on retail products,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.740
but also on hotels,
on restaurants,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.930
and cleaning services.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.850
The Ecolabel Index,
which is a website that

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.850
lists ecolabels that are
out in the marketplace,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.810
currently lists 463
different ecolabels

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.730
in over 200 countries.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.582
Having so many
logos and seals is

00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:40.790
part of why we're here today.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.890
Because it makes it
very difficult to know

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.110
which ecolabels you can trust.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.560
So what makes the ISO type one
Global Ecolabelling Network

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.481
members different?

00:06:49.481 --> 00:06:51.980
And that's what we're going to
talk a little bit about today

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.570
to give you some
tools to help you sort

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.236
through the hundreds
that are out there.

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:58.652
Because there certainly are
not hundreds of good ones.

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:00.110
So here are some
of the highlights.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.700
The first one is
the certification

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.320
has to be based on a standard.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.940
We all remember
standardized testing

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.410
from our high school days.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.030
Everybody takes the same test.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.830
Everybody gets a uniform score.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.290
Colleges and universities
can know SAT score

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.600
from one person to the
next, it's comparable.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.510
So the same thing when it comes
to environmental standards.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.400
It's a detailed
list of requirements

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.310
that the product or service
has to meet in order to receive

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.570
that third party certification.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.360
This is important
because the manufacturer

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.443
needs to know exactly what
their product has to do

00:07:28.443 --> 00:07:30.097
to get that seal of approval.

00:07:30.097 --> 00:07:32.180
But also from a consumer
standpoint or a purchaser

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.880
standpoint, if you see
that ecolabel on a product,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.430
you need to be able to find
out exactly what that product

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.990
or service had to do to
get that seal of approval.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.240
So there has to be a standard.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.690
Now, developing the standard has
to be an open and transparent

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.350
process.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.810
It has to be inclusive,
so that the public is

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.570
welcome to give input as
you go through the process.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.900
Anyone who has a care or
information about that product

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.530
should be invited
to participate.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.530
So this can be the
manufacturers of the product.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.200
It can be government agencies
who regulate the product.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.270
It can be consumer
advocacy organizations.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.624
It can be academia that have
done studies or research.

00:08:07.624 --> 00:08:09.040
There's a lot of
universities that

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.474
specialize in one type
of product or another.

00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:12.640
Public health organizations.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.140
Consumer organizations.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.000
Anybody that has a
stake in that product

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.980
should be invited
to be a stakeholder.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.480
And if you haven't
ever gone through

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.240
a public standard development
process, it's a very fun thing.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.250
It makes for excellent bedtime
reading-- all the background

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.420
documents, things like that.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.836
If you're having
trouble sleeping,

00:08:27.836 --> 00:08:30.174
I highly recommend
standard development.

00:08:30.174 --> 00:08:31.840
But this standard,
as you're developing,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.309
it has to address key
environmental impacts.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:37.309
And what that means is it has
to address significant impacts

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.018
over the lifecycle
of the product.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:41.059
If you're looking at the
lifecycle of the product

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.225
and only addressing things
sort of on the outer edge

00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:45.830
or the fringe, it's not
really a meaningful standard

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.630
that's going to affect some
change in the marketplace.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.960
And so this
lifecycle perspective

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.640
is everything from
the raw material

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.370
extraction-- the mining, the
harvesting of raw materials--

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.110
how the product is manufactured.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.130
How is it packaged?

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.190
How do you use it?

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.830
How do you service
or maintain it?

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.621
And then at the end of
its life, how do you

00:09:02.621 --> 00:09:04.850
recycle it or safely
or effectively

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.230
dispose of it in some way?

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.820
So anything that is within that
lifecycle that's a key impact

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.530
should be included in that
environmental standard.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.930
And if you just focus on one--

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.940
like recycled content,
which is a frequent one

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.080
that you may see--

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.940
you may be missing
other impacts that

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.030
have bigger human health
or environmental issues

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.990
in the marketplace.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.450
But manufacturers are
certainly happy to sort of tout

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.494
the one good green thing
about their product.

00:09:28.494 --> 00:09:30.410
But when you start asking
lifecycle questions,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.157
it often becomes a very
quiet conversation.

00:09:33.157 --> 00:09:35.240
So when you want to know
that somebody is actually

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.460
looking at all of
these lifecycle impacts

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.582
of the products and
services that you're buying,

00:09:39.582 --> 00:09:41.540
and once you start thinking
about these things,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.400
it's almost impossible
to turn it off.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.327
As my kids and
wife will tell you,

00:09:45.327 --> 00:09:46.910
it takes a lot longer
to shop with dad

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.970
because I look at things
a little bit differently.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.300
So the standard also has
to consider the functional

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.530
performance of products.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.122
And this is important because
so many green products

00:09:57.122 --> 00:09:58.580
over the years have
been introduced

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.112
that did not work as well.

00:10:00.112 --> 00:10:01.070
And people bought them.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.850
And they tried them.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.930
And they were frustrated.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.520
And they sort of wrote off
the whole idea of we're

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.750
going to buy green products.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.990
So we want to continue to try to
bust that myth that if you want

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.940
to be a conscientious
consumer, you

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.410
have to sacrifice performance.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.040
Because that's
just not the case.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.950
Now, just like any
other purchasing,

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.320
you may have to try two
or three brands that

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.380
meet your softness preference
or your color preference

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.540
or the availability in
your local marketplace.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.910
But it's not just
because it's green

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.420
that it's not going to work.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.180
And if you have to
use more of a product

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.560
or if you're
dissatisfied and you

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.660
throw half the product away,
that's not very sustainable.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.190
And as I said before, if you
buy something and your laundry

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.680
doesn't get clean, or you have
to put seven coats of paint

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.630
on the wall-- and it
was a green product--

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.620
you're going to
be pretty grumpy.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.820
And you're going to
tell lots of friends.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.070
So we're still trying
to get past that hurdle.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.710
Ecolabelled products have to
meet functional performance

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.540
requirements that
they work as well

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.906
as their conventional or
non-green counterparts.

00:10:52.906 --> 00:10:54.530
Otherwise, they're
not really an option

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.400
for most purchasers
and consumers.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.710
Now the standard also has
to be publicly available

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.710
so that you can find
out, as we said before,

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.080
what that product had to do
to get that certification.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.630
The label is really meaningless
if you can't find out

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.670
what the criteria were in order
to get that certification.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.910
This is one of the first
clues when you start diving

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.260
into the world of ecolabels.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.210
If you can't find
out the criteria

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.430
upon which that
certification is based,

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.971
that usually is an indication
it may not be that robust.

00:11:22.971 --> 00:11:25.220
And you want these standards
to be publicly available,

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.084
so that it's not a
black box with some sort

00:11:27.084 --> 00:11:28.500
of mysterious set
of requirements.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.230
You put a product in one
end, and out the other

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.670
and come to the certification.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.269
Or even a gray box, because
that does call into question,

00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:35.810
where are they
getting their funding?

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.435
How are they issuing
the certification?

00:11:37.435 --> 00:11:39.690
Is that label really meaningful?

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.727
So the standard also needs
to be updated regularly

00:11:42.727 --> 00:11:44.810
because the marketplace
changes from time to time.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:45.770
There's new raw materials.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.820
There's new developments.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.730
So what's leadership
today in 2018,

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.640
two or three years from now
may not be leadership anymore.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.920
So the standards have to be
updated on a regular basis

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.881
to keep up with recognizing
environmental leadership.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.340
Earning the ecolabel
also has to be voluntary.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.370
We have sort of a good
baseline regulatory framework

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.130
out there for every product
has to meet in order to be sold

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.597
legally in the marketplace.

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:12.430
But this is about
environmental leadership--

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.620
going above and beyond
just minimum compliance

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.940
with regulations.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.730
And so this is part of how
companies can demonstrate

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.190
their leadership by
achieving these third party

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.750
certifications.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.250
But in order for
this to really make

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.260
a difference in the
marketplace, the standard

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.621
and the certification also
have to be attainable.

00:12:28.621 --> 00:12:31.120
So if you set the standard so
high that only one product out

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.100
of thousands can meet
it, that's not really

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.637
going to move the
needle very much.

00:12:34.637 --> 00:12:36.220
And if you set it
too low, same thing.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.390
If everybody gets it, it
doesn't really mean much.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.590
So you're trying to find
the sweet spot of leadership

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.900
in today's marketplace,
given the raw materials

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.710
and manufacturing that's
available to us in 2018.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.590
And the manufacturers
when they are

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.052
looking to get
this certification,

00:12:51.052 --> 00:12:52.510
it needs to be
affordable for them.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.900
It can't be so high that only a
few large companies can get it.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.370
You really want to get that
critical mass of products.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.400
Especially when it comes
to business procurement

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.950
or institutional procurement--
where they have a minimum bid

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.199
requirement to where they
have to get multiple vendors

00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:06.195
to solicit bids--

00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:08.320
if there's only one company
with the certification,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.806
that doesn't really help.

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:13.180
One of my former colleagues
at Green Seal used to say all

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.402
the time that one of the things
that she loved about her job

00:13:16.402 --> 00:13:18.610
was that when she worked
with a company to go through

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.160
the process of certification--
even when they had to make

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.120
changes--

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.700
that oftentimes the
company might have been

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.150
a little frustrated doing it.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.390
But once they did it and
had that green product

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.829
and got it launched with
the third party ecolabel,

00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:32.620
they were very rarely
ever going to go back

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.210
to the way they
did things before.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.270
So achieving these credible
third party certifications

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.400
actually brings about
meaningful, lasting change

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.490
in the marketplace.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.300
Which is what these are
as voluntary market tools.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.260
It's not a regulation.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.430
You don't have to do it.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.950
But we're trying to identify
those leadership products

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.160
and get more people
to buy and use them.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.690
So lastly, the
ecolabel needs to be

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.480
awarded using independent,
third party verification.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.590
And this is probably
the most important part.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.200
You can have a
great standard that

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.080
was developed through an open,
public, transparent process.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.630
It hits lots of key,
significant, environmental and

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.850
human health impacts
over the lifecycle.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.850
But if they're not doing
verification in a credible way,

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.830
then that really means
that ecolabel doesn't

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.580
have much meaning behind it.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.240
And so what does this
verification mean?

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.090
Well, this often looks at
things like the full product

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.670
formulation, working up
and down the supply chain

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.590
to get additional disclosures
from all material suppliers.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.269
You may or may not be surprised
to find out how many companies

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:29.560
sell products where they
don't actually know everything

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.030
that goes into their product.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.130
So obtaining those
additional disclosures

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.140
is a part of the certification.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.790
Interpreting test
results-- if there's

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.400
performance testing required
or biodegradability testing,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.440
making sure that those
test results meet

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.314
the criteria and the standard.

00:14:43.314 --> 00:14:45.730
Inspecting the manufacturing
facility-- that was something

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.960
I used to love to do.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.682
Putting on safety glasses and
hard hats and ear protection

00:14:49.682 --> 00:14:51.640
and making sure that the
companies are actually

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.250
manufacturing what they
told you on paper that they

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.270
were manufacturing.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.890
And that the batch
records match up.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.500
And that they bought the right
quantities of raw materials

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.900
to make the right quantities
of finished products.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.910
And then reviewing
product labels

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.110
and marketing literature.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.110
So you've looked at all of
their performance claims,

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.940
environmental claims,
human health claims.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.106
But somehow, some way,
sometimes the marketing folks

00:15:12.106 --> 00:15:14.070
get a little excited
and there may

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.150
be things in their
literature that were not

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.032
substantiated by the
review that you did

00:15:18.032 --> 00:15:19.240
as part of the certification.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.940
So making sure that there's no
unsubstantiated human health

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.950
or environmental claims
for which that company

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.780
didn't have data to support it.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.180
Because at the end of the
day, that third ecolabel

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.270
represents trust to the
consumers relying upon that.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.270
So for a service like a
restaurant or a hotel,

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.040
it's a lot of stuff
back of the house.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.540
Looking at purchasing records.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.619
Talking to staff.

00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:40.660
Reviewing the training
that they've been through.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.750
And utility records,
service schedules,

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.240
menus to make sure
that they're actually

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.630
serving the items that are
more sustainable food than not.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.500
And all of this
sometimes takes weeks--

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.860
sometimes months-- but
it's important in both

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.320
the lengthy and
validating process.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.470
Because ultimately the
ecolabel has to get it right.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.699
Otherwise, there's
no trust behind it.

00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:04.240
So these are the
types of things that

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.060
are hallmarks of the ecolabels
who are members of the Global

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.069
Ecolabelling Network.

00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:09.610
And most of our
members will tell you

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.220
they love to say they do all
of the scientific research,

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.032
the inspection, and
the review for you.

00:16:14.032 --> 00:16:15.490
So all you have to
do when shopping

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.960
is look for the ecolabel.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.250
Who wouldn't want that?

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.480
Now, this is a similar map.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.760
But these are the actual
logos for the member

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.397
labels of the Global
Ecolabelling Network.

00:16:26.397 --> 00:16:28.730
And they represent some of
the most credible third party

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.690
certifications
available worldwide

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.401
for products and services.

00:16:32.401 --> 00:16:33.900
And now you know
how to look for it,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.330
and now you know which
ones to look for.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.700
But GEN also has
affiliate members

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.470
who are not
ecolabels themselves,

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.710
but who are organizations who
support the important role

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.560
that credible third party
ecolabels can use in purchasing

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.907
and operations.

00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:50.240
And Google is actually an
affiliate member of the Global

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.900
Ecolabelling Network.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.500
So we need ecolabels
like this because people

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.500
care about their health.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.470
They care about their kids.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.730
They care about the planet.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.402
But they really
want confirmation

00:16:59.402 --> 00:17:01.860
that what they're buying is
what they think they're buying.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.619
And this is a role that
these credible environmental

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:08.829
standards and
certifications can provide.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.240
Now, when we talk about
the lifecycle of a product,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.819
it's also nice to link that
these lifecycle criteria also

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.550
are related to these bigger
campaigns that we find

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.630
and issues of our day.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.359
So ecolabels that consider
the lifecycle of a product

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:26.460
can help address climate
change, overflowing landfills

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.014
and poisoning of groundwater
from improper disposal,

00:17:30.014 --> 00:17:31.680
the overwhelming
amount of plastic waste

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.330
that we keep hearing
more and more about,

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:39.660
the destruction of habitat
and natural resources.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.490
And considering
the lifecycle, it

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.180
varies depending on
product to product.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.050
But these are sort of the major
buckets that the lifecycle look

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.176
always includes.

00:17:47.176 --> 00:17:49.050
So when we talk about
reducing the extraction

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.150
and use of fossil
fuels, some of that

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.340
is pretty obvious when you
think about the products'

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.186
manufacturing.

00:17:54.186 --> 00:17:55.560
That you're mining
raw materials.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.180
You're transporting
those raw materials.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.980
There's some sort of chemical
or mechanical process

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.195
in making the product.

00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:02.940
There's packaging that
takes energy to create,

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.160
transportation to get
that packaging to market

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.280
with the product in it, and
then ultimately the product use.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.350
And sometimes for things
like laundry detergent,

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.390
it's actually use
at the consumer end

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.030
that has way more impact
than the manufacturing

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.785
of the product.

00:18:15.785 --> 00:18:17.160
So you've seen a
lot of campaigns

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.734
recently about washing
with cold water detergents.

00:18:19.734 --> 00:18:21.150
And that's because
the temperature

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.110
of your wash water--

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.960
that energy and energy
required to heat the water--

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.340
is one of the biggest impacts.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.770
Not so much creating the
bottle of laundry detergent.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.250
So GEN members collectively
have saved tons of fossil fuels

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.740
from being burned through
the criteria in many

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.300
of those product standards.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.370
Now The Blue Angel,
specifically in Germany,

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.830
certifies all sorts of air
conditioning equipment.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.035
The Eco Mark in Japan and
Nordic Swan certify biofuels.

00:18:44.035 --> 00:18:45.660
And Good Environmental
Choice in Sweden

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.160
certifies green electricity.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.530
So there are lots of
options for looking

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.470
for certification specific to
carbon emissions and carbon

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.190
footprint.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.530
But it's embodied or included
in a lot of the products

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.130
standards.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.480
It also means looking and
avoiding toxic chemicals.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.540
19 of the 27 GEN
ecolabels currently

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.130
have standards for
cleaning products--

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.380
one of my favorite categories.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.380
Probably my kryptonite.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.461
I could talk about cleaning
products on and on and on--

00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:13.960
but they have standards that
certify green cleaning products

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.626
and those standards
include restrictions

00:19:15.626 --> 00:19:18.070
on things like carcinogens
and reproductive toxins

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.590
and asthmagens, which is a
growing thing for schools

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.180
and universities.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.846
Green Seal in the
US also requires

00:19:23.846 --> 00:19:25.720
that their cleaning
products be concentrated,

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.220
so that you're
not shipping water

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.830
all over the country with the
additional plastic bottles

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.844
when those concentrated
cleaners can be diluted on-site

00:19:32.844 --> 00:19:34.510
where they're actually
going to be used.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.301
And that reduces the
transportation impacts

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:39.100
and packaging as well.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.440
When you consider the lifecycle,
it can mean reusing materials.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.710
So the Nordic Swan
ecolabel has a standard

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.690
for remanufactured
toner cartridges.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.640
And there's more than
12,000 different models

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.300
of toner from 13 different
manufacturers last year that

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.950
have the Nordic Swan ecolabel.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.572
There's probably some
in your printers today.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.030
Considering lifecycle
can also mean

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.120
reducing waste from packaging.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.540
Ecolabelled products
and services

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.430
prevented tons of
plastic packaging

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.960
from going to the landfill.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.634
Now, single use
plastics, when you

00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:10.050
talk about hotels
and restaurants,

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.600
that's one of the areas that
are a part of the criteria.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.210
And it also looks
at how the packaging

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.590
is done for the actual products
themselves-- to be minimized,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.220
to contain recycled
content, to be

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.780
recyclable or compostable at
the end of that product's life.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.730
So while they're not
packaging-specific,

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.960
every product standard
has some criteria

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.990
to speak to the packaging
and the impacts.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.980
And especially with
plastic packaging

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.580
being such a hot
button today, that

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.580
could mean less plastic
ending up in our oceans,

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.080
which we keep seeing lots
and lots of commercials.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.460
Forests is another area.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.670
Ecosystems in forests, the old
growth habitats, the life cycle

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.770
means protecting these areas.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.170
The China environmental
labelling program prevented

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:53.370
thousands of tons of new paper
pulp in 2017 by the criteria

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.660
in their paper standards.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.889
So whether the paper is
in packaging materials,

00:20:56.889 --> 00:20:58.930
whether it's in paper
towels and tissue products,

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.070
whether it's in copy paper, all
of these GEN member standards

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.500
for paper products have
a lot of requirements

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.300
that speak to virgin fiber.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.490
If it's going to be used,
where it must come from.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.770
And preferring recycled
fiber in many cases

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.142
because there are fewer impacts
coming from that fiber source.

00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:15.600
So if you think
about all the paper

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.665
that you come into
contact with every day,

00:21:17.665 --> 00:21:20.040
there are many, many, many
opportunities to first, reduce

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.110
that amount of paper--

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.726
refuse the receipts and paper
statements from your bank.

00:21:24.726 --> 00:21:26.850
But when you do have to
buy paper products, looking

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.070
for ones that have
a credible ecolabel

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:33.264
is one way to
reduce the impacts.

00:21:33.264 --> 00:21:35.430
Now, GEN ecolabels are also
relevant to the circular

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.860
economy-- something important
here at Google and lots

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.710
of other folks--

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.710
to businesses that are
focused on green building

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.390
as a corporate social
responsibility.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.542
So every wall that
has paint on it--

00:21:45.542 --> 00:21:47.250
paint is something
that's found in almost

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.960
every type of facility.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.510
Many GEN members have
standards for virgin paint

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.650
and for recycled paint.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.607
Because no matter how hard you
try, when you're done painting

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:57.190
there's always a
little bit left over.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.920
Sometimes a lot left over.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.920
And having that used latex
paint sort of hanging around

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.120
isn't necessarily the
best use for that.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.960
So using leftover
paint to make new paint

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.880
and then having a
credible certification

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.740
can help people feel
better about buying

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.110
remanufactured paint
that actually performs.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.350
And they're not suspicious
that it contains

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.220
lots of strange things.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.660
So it can help to
close that loop.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.060
Even though many of the products
in the marketplace today

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.320
are still very linear--

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.034
from raw materials to disposal--

00:22:24.034 --> 00:22:25.950
the criteria in a lot
of these GEN standards--

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.370
by looking at packaging and
end of life and recyclability

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.600
or reuse--

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.376
are encouraging our steps
toward a more circular economy.

00:22:34.376 --> 00:22:36.000
And, of course, we're
very happy to see

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.880
many, many green building rating
systems include GEN member

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.000
ecolabels as criteria
for products and services

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.180
being used within
the green buildings.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.840
So how do you, as a consumer,
find these ecolabels

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.860
when there's lots and
lots and lots of websites

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.090
that claim to be--

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.280
here's a list of the
best ones to look for.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.430
But a lot of those, like
everything else, are marketing.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.710
And so when you're
shopping, first just

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.914
start paying attention
to ecolabels.

00:23:01.914 --> 00:23:03.580
This is one of my
favorite things to do.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.038
Look at the products, look at
the labels that are on there,

00:23:06.038 --> 00:23:08.320
and then start to think
about some questions that you

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.270
can ask or check and look up.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.830
Is it an actual certification?

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.740
Or is it just a logo
created by the manufacturer?

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.390
If it is an actual
certification,

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.890
can you find the standard?

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.560
Do you know why that
product was awarded that?

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.200
If you can find the standard,
how was the verification

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.490
that it met the standard done?

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.490
Is it just the company claiming
we claim we meet the standard?

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.574
Or is it done by an
actual third party?

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:31.240
Once you start thinking
about these sort

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.460
of few fundamental questions
when you see those labels,

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.100
you'll get a good
feel for whether they

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.520
tend to be on the credible side
or the not so credible side.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.070
So, yes, we're asking to do
a little bit of homework.

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.720
But because you vote
with your wallet

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.050
and you're sending that message
every time you make a purchase,

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.280
it is really important.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.590
And you can send that message
to your favorite products

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.740
and services, as well.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.030
If they don't carry one of
these ecolabels already,

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.400
you can ask them, could
you get this certification?

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.409
Would you consider posting
it on social media?

00:23:59.409 --> 00:24:01.450
There's been a lot of good
ways to get response--

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.050
not just from your
cable company--

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.370
to companies responding to
why they don't have that.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.950
It is something that you as
a consumer do have a voice

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.080
and can ask more of.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.500
You also have a lot of
influence about what others buy.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.970
And this was one of my
favorite areas of opportunity.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.700
So most of us may
recycle and practice

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.130
sustainability at home,
places like Google,

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.360
definitely at work.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.980
But you're not home now.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.870
And because we spend
a third or more

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.540
of our days outside
of the home, you

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.270
can really think about
asking some key questions

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.650
of the places that you visit.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.280
So I know my kids and your kids
may be at daycare or school

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.110
right now.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.420
You'll go to the
gym later or maybe

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.760
you already went this morning.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.770
You might go out to a
restaurant for dinner.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.400
Maybe take a trip this
weekend and stay at a hotel.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.350
So when you are at
these places, feel

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.440
free to ask what are they
doing about sustainability

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.360
and what green
products do they buy.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.010
Now, my colleagues
will tell you I

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.430
am notorious for taking pictures
when I see signs advertising,

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.190
"We proudly use green products."

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.060
I look under the sink
in the restrooms,

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.950
and I look for
ecolabel on the bottle

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.774
of hand soap in the restroom.

00:25:08.774 --> 00:25:10.190
The roll of toilet
paper often has

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.510
a label with an ecolabel on it.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.020
So if you start to look for
these things, like I said,

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.231
it's hard to turn it off.

00:25:16.231 --> 00:25:17.480
But you can make a difference.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.310
If you don't see it,
you can ask questions.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.768
Hey, have you ever thought
about purchasing green products?

00:25:21.768 --> 00:25:24.120
Or tell me more about
this product that you buy.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.620
There are some
greener alternatives.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.110
Especially if you
come from a place

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.140
where that's just
standard business practice

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.352
in your day to day life.

00:25:31.352 --> 00:25:33.560
So tell them that you want
them to use green products

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.143
and check back with
them periodically.

00:25:35.143 --> 00:25:38.150
Because they may need
continued nudging.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.090
A personal example of this is
my CrossFit gym back at home.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.180
In the restrooms they have
little tiny 99 cent bottles

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.460
of liquid hand soap they
were buying at the drugstore,

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.120
which, of course, they
kept trying to refill.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.910
They didn't last very
long because there's

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.800
lots of chalk dust
and perspiration

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.390
to wash off after workouts.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.120
So I finally-- after
a few conversations,

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.400
which they probably thought
were a little strange at first--

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.290
got them to switch over
to a bulk hand soap

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.660
dispenser with foam
soap, which actually

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.800
has 1,400 uses worth of
soap in it versus 100 or 200

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.150
in the little bottle.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.280
Because foam soap comes
out pretty lathered,

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.570
it actually takes less
time to wash your hands.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.930
It takes less time to rinse
the soap off your hands.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.414
So there's less packaging.

00:26:16.414 --> 00:26:17.330
They're saving energy.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:18.290
They're saving water.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.040
And they don't have
to change out the soap

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.100
and refill it as often.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.840
So, small victory at home.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.360
Every time I go in
CrossFit, wash my hands,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.250
I look at that little label
and I know I did a good thing.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.610
So we have that same
opportunity in the places

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:32.589
that we patronize.

00:26:32.589 --> 00:26:34.130
To start asking
these questions, they

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.755
may think you're a
little odd at first.

00:26:35.755 --> 00:26:36.756
But they'll get over it.

00:26:36.756 --> 00:26:38.130
And the more
ecolabelled products

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.464
you buy, the more times you're
asking for these things,

00:26:40.464 --> 00:26:42.630
the more we're going to see
them in the marketplace.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.659
And that's a good thing.

00:26:44.659 --> 00:26:46.450
So meanwhile, we're
going to be celebrating

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.880
on the 25th of October with
events around the globe.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.380
GEN members are getting out,
educating manufacturers,

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.640
consumers, retailers in
their own country and region.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.160
And I'd like to play for
you just a couple of clips

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.280
from longer videos that some
of the GEN members have done.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.280
So we're going to see some
promotions from Environmental

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.480
Choice New Zealand, the
Vitality Leaf in Russia,

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.960
the Singapore green label,
and the Thailand green label.

- World Ecolabel Day is
coming up this October.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.000
It's the day when we focus
on products and services that

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.140
carry ecolabels, badges that
say the products or services are

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.335
environmentally preferable.

00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:08.470

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.560
The environmentally
friendly products

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.020
is basically a product that
doesn't destroy nature,

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.213
like recycling.

00:28:14.213 --> 00:28:17.865
- Do you know certified
Green Label products?

00:28:17.865 --> 00:28:18.730
- Yes.

Green Label product

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.520
is a product that has
received a Green Label

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.690
for not destroying nature.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.710
- To celebrate the
World Ecolabelling Day,

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:35.145
use environmentally
friendly products.

00:28:35.145 --> 00:28:37.650
Don't forget Green Label.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.319
Hurray!

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:41.360
MARK PETRUZZI: All right.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.776
And now, so here
are three reasons

00:28:42.776 --> 00:28:45.140
why I spend so much time
shopping for green products

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.330
and looking at the products
that we eat and use

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.750
and put on our bodies.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.027
And, of course, they're
sports and they're

00:28:51.027 --> 00:28:51.860
used to this by now.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.460
But when we are shopping, I take
the time to explain to my kids

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.537
why we're buying this
product over that product.

00:28:57.537 --> 00:28:59.370
And explaining, usually
it's something like,

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.287
well, one has ingredients that
Daddy doesn't really like.

00:29:02.287 --> 00:29:03.620
But they're pretty good with it.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.350
And I also point out-- now,
obviously the one of them

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.967
looking at product
labels, that one--

00:29:07.967 --> 00:29:09.050
we're not quite there yet.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.910
But we're working toward that.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.610
And just educating
them to be consumers

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.220
that think about these things.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.870
Hopefully some of it
is going to stick.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.250
And it's certainly
easier if I can just

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.990
tell them when they're shopping
look for this logo on products.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.531
And in fact, for
many years, they're,

00:29:23.531 --> 00:29:25.350
Daddy, your logo's
on this product.

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.410
In fact, one of my
favorite examples

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.210
is the Subway chain
of restaurants.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.910
In all 25,000 Subways
in North America

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.760
has a Green Seal certified
hand soap in their restrooms

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.830
and behind the sink for
the sandwich artists

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.970
to wash their hands.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.560
So we come from
a sporting event,

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.559
we hit Subway to get a
healthier sandwich for dinner,

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:44.850
and the kids all go in the
bathroom to wash their hands

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:47.000
and they see the Green
Seal on the little window

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.930
in the soap dispenser.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.627
And it warms my heart.

00:29:49.627 --> 00:29:51.710
So finding that once you
get them trained to start

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.494
looking for it, it is possible.

00:29:53.494 --> 00:29:55.910
And, of course, for my daughter,
for every serious picture

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.285
we take she has to take one
that's a not serious picture.

00:29:58.285 --> 00:30:03.250
So that's her go to
not serious face.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.630
So at some point we hopefully
won't need as many regulations

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.730
about the safety of products.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.650
We hopefully won't
need as many ecolabels

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.240
to guide people towards safer,
greener, healthier products.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.990
And GEN members might
all be out of a job.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.230
But that's OK.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.470
But just in time for
World Ecolabel Day,

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.680
you now know a little bit more
of how to look behind the label

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.265
and find out what
green really means.

00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:26.640
But if you want
to find out more,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.130
certainly visit
GlobalEcolabelling.net.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.890
Check out the ideas and tools
for celebrating World Ecolabel

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.461
Day at WorldEcolabelDay.com.

00:30:34.461 --> 00:30:36.750
And we hope you'll be inspired
to be a little bit more

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.360
of a green product
sleuth and help us create

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.261
a more sustainable world.

00:30:42.261 --> 00:30:47.031
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:47.031 --> 00:30:52.130
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about
the third party certifiers.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.560
Is there an audit process to
see that they're keeping up

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.150
standard as to doing the process
of reviewing a product that

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.100
meets the standards.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.030
MARK PETRUZZI: Yes.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.060
There are-- what we in
the certification world

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.100
call-- standards for
standards and standards

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.890
for standard developers and
standards for certifiers.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.054
So earlier Richard
mentioned in my bio,

00:31:13.054 --> 00:31:14.720
one of the things
that happened recently

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.020
was the United States
Environmental Protection Agency

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:22.250
led an effort that
came up with 67 draft

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.640
guidelines for credible third
party standards and ecolabels.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.540
And those guidelines were
divided into four sections.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.520
So any label that the
federal government

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.090
was considering using would have
to meet these 67 guidelines.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.781
So the first section was how
you develop your standards.

00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:38.780
That's a pretty key one.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.730
And there are a number
of other standards

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:43.700
that sort of were embodied
in their questions.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.550
Then there was a section on
how do you do your verification

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.170
and conformity assessment.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.950
In some programs the label
who developed the standard

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:53.300
does the certification.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.540
In some, there are programs
who just develop the standard

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.660
and then other third parties
can do the verification work

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:04.010
provided they meet accreditation
as the certifying body.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.105
Then the third section was the
credibility of the program.

00:32:07.105 --> 00:32:08.480
Where did they
get their funding?

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.800
Who's on their
board of directors?

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.258
Are there any
conflicts of interest

00:32:11.258 --> 00:32:13.309
in operating the program?

00:32:13.309 --> 00:32:15.350
And then the fourth section,
which is potentially

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.140
the most interesting,
are the standards

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.700
environmentally effective?

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.730
That is, if you buy something
with that ecolabel on it,

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.740
are you actually getting
the benefits that they

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.030
say you're going to get?

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.180
So that speaks to addressing the
key, significant environmental

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.460
impacts and making
sure that it's not

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.509
a label that is sort of
dancing around the edges

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:35.300
but not hitting to the
heart of the matter.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.210
So yes, there are standards
and accreditations

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.280
that standard developers
and third party

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.540
certifiers have to meet.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.360
And these are embodied in
membership requirements

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.730
for the Global
Ecolabelling Network.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.320
In order to join,
you have to prove

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.705
that you meet all of those.

00:32:50.705 --> 00:32:53.770
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about forestry certifications.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:58.200
So you mentioned it, but just
to make sure I caught it.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.860
So for like FSC certified wood,
is that part of the Global

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.190
Ecolabelling Network.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.010
Why or why not?

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.540
Or other forestry
certifications.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.240
MARK PETRUZZI: Right.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:07.864
Great question.

00:33:07.864 --> 00:33:09.340
Thank you.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.710
The GEN member
ecolabels tend to be

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:15.310
for programs that cover multiple
types of products and services.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.560
And within the
forestry space, there

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:21.010
are six, eight or
so labels that just

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.750
certify sustainable
forestry in some way,

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.530
shape, or form whether that's
virgin or post-consumer.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.920
Some of them actually do put
a certification on products.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.996
But none of them,
to my knowledge,

00:33:32.996 --> 00:33:35.620
would be able to be a member of
the Global Ecolabelling Network

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.591
because they only
focus on forestry.

00:33:37.591 --> 00:33:40.090
And just like there are labels
that just focus on indoor air

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.919
quality or just focus
on sustainable flooring,

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:45.460
in order to be a
GEN member, you have

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.880
to have standards for multiple
product and service categories.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.610
But it is also a really
relevant question,

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:55.000
because these same
questions about how do they

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.209
develop their standards?

00:33:56.209 --> 00:33:58.000
How do they do their
conformity assessment?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.250
Are they addressing the
key impacts of forestry

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.186
within that space of
six or eight labels?

00:34:03.186 --> 00:34:04.810
Some are better than
others, and that's

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:08.610
been the topic of much debate
in the green building community.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:09.719
So, yes.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.389
And the nice thing about these
key fundamental principles

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.159
is they can apply to
a single attribute

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:19.719
program, a multiple criteria but
applying to a single category

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:22.570
program, or a type
one ecolabel that

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:27.020
addresses life cycle across
multiple product categories.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.960
So that's planting
the seeds of these

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.880
are the questions to
be thinking about when

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.630
you look behind that
label wherever it fits.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.550
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about furniture.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:41.210
I haven't seen a lot of
ecolabels or see any.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.260
Maybe I didn't pay
attention enough.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.300
Can you tell me more
about the furniture?

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.010
Is there an ecolabel for the
office furniture or any type

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.339
of furniture products?

00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:52.130
MARK PETRUZZI: Yes.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.139
There are a few.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:58.280
Many furniture products have
gone through indoor air quality

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.790
certification for emissions,
where the chair or the table

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.380
is put into a chamber.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.210
The chamber is closed,
and they actually

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:08.990
measure what is offgassed in
terms of multiple compounds.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.590
Greenguard is probably the
most well-known for that.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.730
But there is also--

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.930
for institutional furniture--
the Business and Institutional

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.050
Furniture Manufacturers
Association--

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:23.000
BIFMA-- has a
program called Level

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.390
that is for institutional
office furniture.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.920
And they have
hundreds of products

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.270
that have been certified
at three different levels

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.720
in the Level rating system.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.460
But there are some
certifications.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.980
But most of it is
for institutional

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.620
and office furniture.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.670
There is the Sustainable
Furnishings Association

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:47.540
for retail furniture that
has some of the furniture

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.300
companies as members.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:56.000
But that hasn't been as visible
as the BIFMA Level program.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.770
But yes, it's a growing
area of concern.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.520
And also that's a market where--

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.940
in addition to the emissions
from the foam cushions--

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.710
things like flame retardants
and brominated compounds

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:11.230
have been sort of a
campaign-specific thing

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.330
because these products are
used in schools and offices.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:18.200
And we're exposed to them
a lot of hours of the day.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.140
AUDIENCE: You mentioned funding.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.230
And I'd be really concerned
if the people getting

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.040
the certifications paid for it.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.540
But at the same
time, I know there's

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.470
no way that I could pay for it.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:34.570
So what's the current thinking
around seemingly hard to solve

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:35.900
problem?

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.660
MARK PETRUZZI: Some
of the GEN members

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.420
are government-sponsored
programs.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.200
So there is some endowment
and funding coming from that.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.720
Some of them do take
a fee for service

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.060
where there is a fee for
getting the certification.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.770
And this is why the question
about the accreditation for how

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.900
they operate is so important.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.343
Usually it's a fee-- the same
fee charged to everybody--

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:02.600
initially.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.180
And then there may
be a license fee

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.950
that's based on the
sales of the product.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:09.821
So if you sold 100 products,
at the end of that term of 12

00:37:09.821 --> 00:37:11.320
months or whatever
the term was, you

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.750
would owe a fee for the use
of the Ecolabel on that.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.180
So unfortunately,
fees are definitely

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.730
a part of it to keep the
organization running.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.880
But then for a lot of
the nonprofit labels--

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.347
because of the 501(c)(3)
IRS tax classification--

00:37:26.347 --> 00:37:28.930
they're not allowed to have any
direct financial relationship.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:32.170
So they may just charge
a flat fee and that's

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.124
irrespective of how
many units actually

00:37:34.124 --> 00:37:35.290
get sold in the marketplace.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.290
So whether the company sells
one or they sell one million,

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:41.290
the fee is an evaluation fee
to determine whether or not

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.420
you meet the standard and
get the certification.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.269
But it's not directly linked
to the success of that product

00:37:46.269 --> 00:37:47.060
in the marketplace.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.218
So there are a variety of
different funding models.

00:37:51.218 --> 00:37:54.880
and it is a challenge because
the marketplace really

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.130
needs to show the value for
this in the business case.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.494
And the business case
is often the companies

00:37:59.494 --> 00:38:01.660
see that marketing benefit
of having the third party

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.680
certification.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.200
So paying for it helps
to keep the lights on

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.360
and the doors open
for the ecolabel.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.370
AUDIENCE: So there
was a slide where

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:13.340
you showed all different
ecolabels, not all of them

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:18.100
part of GEN. As a
consumer, most consumers

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.270
aren't super knowledgeable
of what ecolabels

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:24.340
are part of GEN.
Is there a trend

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:28.690
that it's going to become
more easy for consumers

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:33.370
to know what valid
ecolabels are or how--

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.320
Because most consumers
wouldn't spend time

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.050
to research all the
different ecolabels

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.400
before going to the store.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.026
Right?

00:38:40.026 --> 00:38:40.900
MARK PETRUZZI: Right.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.066
And that's a great question.

00:38:42.066 --> 00:38:44.060
And that's part of why
this education campaign

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:47.540
and having the first annual
World Ecolabel Day is something

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.540
that GEN thought of.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:53.980
Because yes, even people like me
that have been immersed in this

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.680
don't study all
463 on the website.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.280
But I've got the tools if I see
something at the grocery store

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.200
that I haven't seen
before, I'll whip out

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.400
my phone I'll start looking.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.899
OK.

00:39:03.899 --> 00:39:06.880
What is this green tree logo
that I've never seen before?

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.520
And usually within a few
clicks on that mobile website

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.140
I can-- oh, at
the bottom it says

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.740
funded by the such and
such industry association.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.040
Or I can see that
we at Company X

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.071
think this is our company
environmental program.

00:39:21.071 --> 00:39:23.320
We put this on all our
products to show our commitment

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.111
to the environment.

00:39:24.111 --> 00:39:26.620
So you can tease
out pretty quickly

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.162
if it's a credible label
or not, but it is going

00:39:29.162 --> 00:39:30.370
to take a little bit of work.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:34.300
And without somebody coming in
and policing the marketplace,

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.360
the EPA effort to identify
the good ones for use

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.340
in federal procurement,
Google's efforts

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.520
by being an affiliate member of
GEN to say, hey, as a company,

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.440
we only want to
use ecolabels that

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.330
meet our strict guidelines.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:47.530
That sends a signal.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.560
But it also, for the
time being, requires

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.810
consumers taking a
little bit of effort

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:59.112
to determine whether or
not that smells fishy.

00:39:59.112 --> 00:40:03.880
AUDIENCE: And do you all have
an app or anything like that?

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.630
MARK PETRUZZI: No.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.171
I don't think the
Global Ecolabelling

00:40:06.171 --> 00:40:08.290
Network has an app yet.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:10.765
That's probably on their
wish list for funding.

00:40:10.765 --> 00:40:12.850
AUDIENCE: Just curious
about your knowledge

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.350
of the prevalence
of fraud with some

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.335
of these certified products.

00:40:15.335 --> 00:40:16.751
I was working on
a startup before.

00:40:16.751 --> 00:40:20.197
We were looking into
organic agriculture fraud.

00:40:20.197 --> 00:40:22.780
There have been large scandals
with some products people tried

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.940
to pass off as
certified organic.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.650
But curious about
the other products,

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.339
as well, how prevalent that is.

00:40:28.339 --> 00:40:29.630
MARK PETRUZZI: It is a problem.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.080
And that's one of
the 67 guidelines

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.020
that I mentioned that
EPA had put forth--

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.570
and even in the ISO standard
and the GEN requirements--

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.740
policing and enforcing your
ecolabel is super important.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.840
And all the time I
spend at Green Seal,

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.420
a big portion of that
was spent on enforcement.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.630
And having the products that
are Green Seal certified listed

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:53.540
on our website was the
first step in that.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:57.010
Because consumers, especially
the institutional purchasers--

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.080
a company would come
in and make a pitch.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.500
We'd like you to
buy our product.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.390
We're Green Seal
certified-- they would

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:03.930
verify that on our website.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.410
And if it wasn't on our website,
we would get a phone call.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.191
Hey, Company X was
just in my office.

00:41:08.191 --> 00:41:09.440
They said they were certified.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.240
I can't find them
on your website.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.700
Now sometimes they
were just super excited

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.440
we hadn't posted it
on the website yet.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.780
So they were
legitimately certified.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.150
But maybe they were
but two years ago.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.040
And we terminated
their certification,

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.680
but they had an old
paper with the old logo

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.510
or something on it.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.180
So yes, there are
requirements that the mark has

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.450
to be legally protected,
registered as a certification

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:36.380
mark, that you do have to take
steps to police and enforce it.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.120
Usually that hierarchy
would be something

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.100
like they would get
a phone call from me.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.860
If that didn't work, they would
get a phone call or a letter

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.767
from our CEO.

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:46.100
If that didn't work, then
they would get a lovely letter

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.740
from a four name
law firm saying,

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.320
you are using a registered
certification mark

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.370
without license.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.930
Cease and desist or else.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:55.790
And sometimes it came to that.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:42:00.440
We would even police and enforce
registration of domain names.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:05.690
Because a manufacturer having
Green Seal dot whatever,

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.120
that wasn't actually Green
Seal, but was somehow

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.340
promoting their products
or leading people

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.580
to think under that
pretense that they were.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.580
That's a misuse of
our name and mark.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.557
So yes, it's a
never-ending battle.

00:42:17.557 --> 00:42:19.390
Yes, some of them are
going to slip through.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:23.240
But every time I read one
of those I'm like you.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.570
I think, oh, that's not great.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.420
But it's great that
it comes to light

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.360
so they can hopefully implement
better controls over it.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.110
And it speaks to the value that
companies want to misuse it

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:36.680
because they know they will
be able to sell more or reach

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.630
a target audience that--
if they don't have it--

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.250
they may not be able to sell to.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:43.700
So it shows that
there's a value for it.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.180
But yes, eternal
vigilance is the price

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.500
of ecolabelling I guess.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.560
SPEAKER: Thank you, again, Mark.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.310
And thank you everyone
for your questions.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.360
We really appreciate your time.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.230
So let give it up for Mark.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.271
MARK PETRUZZI: Thank you.

00:42:55.271 --> 00:42:58.480
[APPLAUSE]
