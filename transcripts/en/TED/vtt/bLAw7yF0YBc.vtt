00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:17.151
For the past 24 years,
I have been a firefighter

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.108
in Huntington, West Virginia.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.863
As firefighters, my team and I
are tasked with saving lives

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:27.466
and property

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.006
from such disasters
as car wrecks, house fires

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.894
and also life-threatening
medical emergencies.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.877
I am a woman leading a department
in a male-dominated profession.

00:00:42.393 --> 00:00:43.956
And 10 years ago,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.847
I decided to increase my medical knowledge
and I received a nursing degree.

00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:52.212
That was because it became clear

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:55.569
that the next big threat
facing not only my city,

00:00:55.593 --> 00:00:57.744
but other cities around the country,

00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:00.117
was not the one-and-done disaster,

00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:03.743
where you can ride in
like the cavalry, as a firefighter,

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:08.635
put out the fire and leave,
feeling like you have made a difference

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.222
and everything is OK.

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:17.270
The next big disaster in my city
was and is the long, debilitating

00:01:17.294 --> 00:01:20.997
and lethal disaster
known as opioid addiction.

00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:24.376
We now call this a health epidemic,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.972
and we have replaced the name "addiction"
with "substance use disorder."

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:31.387
To give you some perspective

00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:35.268
of how significant
this epidemic has become,

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:41.395
in 2017, in my county of 95,000 people,

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:45.276
we saw 1,831 overdoses

00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:49.783
[and] 183 deaths from overdose.

00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:55.766
This is the job of my firefighters,
as well as other agencies,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.235
to respond to that.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.441
(Coughs)

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:00.615
Excuse me.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:07.516
So, watching this epidemic
unfold for several years,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.207
I developed some insight.

00:02:10.342 --> 00:02:15.067
For this disaster, we need to redefine
our job as a first responder.

00:02:15.682 --> 00:02:18.428
We need to be more than just the cavalry.

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:21.291
We need to do more than just save a life.

00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:25.085
We need to find ways to rebuild that life.

00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:28.204
And it's going to take
a lot of people to do that.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.013
And that is exactly
what we are trying to do

00:02:31.037 --> 00:02:33.037
in Huntington, West Virginia.

00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:37.507
Now, let me give you some insight
as to what we do.

00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:43.393
First, this is what happens
when somebody overdoses.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.526
Imagine you are somebody who is suffering
from the brain disorder of addiction.

00:02:50.542 --> 00:02:51.923
You are fragile.

00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:54.335
You're embarrassed, you're ashamed.

00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:57.732
And you overdose.

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:02.069
Maybe a friend
or a family member calls 911.

00:03:02.593 --> 00:03:04.506
And then all of a sudden,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.011
you are awakened by five or six
total strangers in uniform.

00:03:11.363 --> 00:03:12.997
And they're rubbing your sternum,

00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:15.069
and they're saying, "Wake up, wake up!

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:17.493
You overdosed, you could've died."

00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:20.490
Now, would you not be defensive and angry?

00:03:20.514 --> 00:03:22.247
Because I know I would be.

00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:24.302
And on top of that,

00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:26.969
those strangers gave you
a dose of naloxone,

00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:29.477
which has sent you into withdrawals,

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.453
or what is better known
as "dope sickness."

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.061
Dope sickness makes you feel
absolutely horrible.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:40.175
Some say it's like the flu, times ten.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:44.853
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, body aches.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.562
So not only did we,
as strangers, wake you up,

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:53.538
but we also made you feel really sick.

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:59.365
So in turn, you, the patient,
are not going to be very kind to us.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.132
And you're going to refuse
further medical treatment.

00:04:03.863 --> 00:04:07.617
OK, well, then that's going to frustrate
the heck out of us,

00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:09.022
and we're going to be mad,

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:12.779
because you're ungrateful
that we just saved your life.

00:04:14.062 --> 00:04:19.446
This is not a good dynamic here.

00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:25.488
What we are dealing with
is a brain disorder

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:27.584
that changes your thinking.

00:04:27.608 --> 00:04:30.602
It convinces you
that you don't have a problem.

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:36.780
So, this might have been not only
the first time you've overdosed,

00:04:36.804 --> 00:04:40.490
it might have been the third,
fourth or fifth time

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:43.410
that we, personally, have revived you.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.423
This is not a good situation.

00:04:48.903 --> 00:04:50.291
Second,

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:54.751
first responders do not receive
much education

00:04:54.775 --> 00:04:57.243
on what substance use disorder is.

00:04:57.665 --> 00:05:00.244
Neither does the medical community.

00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:05.714
We're not trained how to deal with those
suffering from substance use disorder.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.683
I am trained to put out
many different types of fires.

00:05:10.707 --> 00:05:13.545
I am trained to save a life in the moment.

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.871
But I am not trained to deal
with the intricate interaction

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:20.066
between first responders,
the health care community,

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.490
social services

00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:25.814
and the wider community that is necessary
to save a life long-term.

00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:28.688
Thirdly,

00:05:30.228 --> 00:05:32.490
and this hits home.

00:05:33.173 --> 00:05:36.839
As a first responder,
I consider myself the cavalry.

00:05:37.284 --> 00:05:40.276
We're knights in shining armor.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.482
We want to swoop in, do our job
and leave feeling satisfied

00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:47.085
that we've made a difference
in somebody's life.

00:05:47.498 --> 00:05:49.315
But that just doesn't happen

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.734
when we're dealing with somebody
with substance use disorder.

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:57.154
We leave feeling frustrated and useless.

00:05:57.612 --> 00:06:00.301
We deal with the same people
over and over again,

00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:02.287
with no positive outcome.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.602
And you know what?

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:09.395
At some point, I realized
that it is up to us as first responders

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:10.847
and as a community

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:12.495
to solve this problem,

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:15.990
to find better ways to deal
with those that are suffering.

00:06:17.185 --> 00:06:23.571
So what I did is I started
observing more on overdoses.

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:27.206
I started talking
and listening to my patients.

00:06:27.609 --> 00:06:31.886
I wanted to know
what led them to where they are.

00:06:32.244 --> 00:06:34.886
What exactly are they experiencing?

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.529
What makes their situation worse?

00:06:37.553 --> 00:06:39.820
What makes their situation better?

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.101
I began experimenting with my words

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.776
and paying attention to my own actions

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.818
and how it affected those of my patients.

00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:53.451
The education that I have received

00:06:53.475 --> 00:06:58.074
and continue to receive
on a street level in Huntington

00:06:58.098 --> 00:07:00.980
has been both eye-opening
and life-changing for me.

00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:08.363
So, in Huntington, West Virginia,
we have come together as a community,

00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:10.806
and we are changing the way that we treat

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.354
those that suffer
from this horrible disease.

00:07:16.165 --> 00:07:20.490
We have started many programs,
and it's making a difference.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.617
I'll tell you about just a few of those.

00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:28.144
Last year, we started
a Quick Response Team,

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:31.093
QRT for short.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.646
The team consists of a paramedic,

00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:36.384
a police officer,

00:07:36.408 --> 00:07:40.762
somebody in the recovery community
and somebody in the faith community.

00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:45.188
As a team, they go out
and visit people who have overdosed

00:07:45.212 --> 00:07:48.116
within 72 hours of that resuscitation.

00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:49.595
They talk.

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:50.784
They listen.

00:07:50.808 --> 00:07:53.174
They build a rapport with that patient,

00:07:53.198 --> 00:07:55.295
and they offer them treatment options.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.761
Right now, about 30 percent
or up to 30 percent

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:09.155
of those that the Quick Response Team
have reached out to

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:11.312
have accepted some form of help.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.752
And the wonderful thing about this

00:08:14.776 --> 00:08:18.450
is the first responders
who are involved in this team,

00:08:18.474 --> 00:08:21.624
they actually feel
like they can make a difference.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.860
Positive change where there wasn't any.

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:27.837
This year --

00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:33.084
(Applause)

00:08:33.108 --> 00:08:39.283
This year, we opened a free-standing
specialty clinic, called PROACT,

00:08:39.307 --> 00:08:42.574
for those suffering
from substance use disorder.

00:08:43.165 --> 00:08:45.431
It's a one-stop shop, if you will.

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:47.458
A patient comes in,

00:08:47.482 --> 00:08:52.181
they're immediately assessed
by somebody who's an addiction specialist.

00:08:52.538 --> 00:08:55.140
They work with them
to provide treatment options

00:08:55.164 --> 00:08:58.664
based on their own needs,
individual needs.

00:08:59.514 --> 00:09:01.545
This does several things for us.

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:06.625
It gives first responders a place
to either take or refer our patients

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:09.442
who are no longer
in a life-threatening situation,

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.942
that have refused to go to the hospital.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.918
And it also clears up

00:09:15.942 --> 00:09:19.927
the overwhelmed emergency rooms
in hospitals that we have.

00:09:21.204 --> 00:09:23.347
The third thing
that I want to tell you about

00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.976
is very dear to me
and very important to my team.

00:09:28.247 --> 00:09:32.402
We recently started
a first responders self-care program.

00:09:34.437 --> 00:09:35.596
More and more ...

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:42.673
first responders are experiencing
compassion fatigue and PTSD.

00:09:44.728 --> 00:09:49.839
It is not uncommon for the average
firefighter in Huntington

00:09:50.934 --> 00:09:56.409
to deal with or see
up to five young deaths per month.

00:09:57.712 --> 00:10:01.239
These are their friends,
these are their classmates.

00:10:01.824 --> 00:10:07.364
So this much-needed program
will not only recognize their hard work,

00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:09.341
it's going to give them a voice.

00:10:09.365 --> 00:10:11.650
It's going to provide them with training

00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:15.143
that will help deal with the stress
that they are under.

00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:18.473
And it will give them
more mental-health options

00:10:18.497 --> 00:10:20.297
that they desperately need.

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:25.332
We now have yoga classes in fire stations.

00:10:25.356 --> 00:10:27.275
(Laughter)

00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:30.831
(Applause)

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:34.386
We've also provided on-duty
massages, which is fabulous.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.871
(Laughter)

00:10:35.895 --> 00:10:38.568
And we have some off-duty programs
that we've started,

00:10:38.592 --> 00:10:42.397
like cooking classes for first responders
and their significant other

00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:43.929
and pottery classes.

00:10:44.771 --> 00:10:48.286
So a couple of months ago,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.389
I walked out on the apparatus floor,
where I had some firefighters.

00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:55.413
And half of them had had a massage,

00:10:55.437 --> 00:10:58.231
and the other half were getting
ready to have a massage.

00:10:58.818 --> 00:11:03.131
And I saw 10 firefighters
who were bantering

00:11:03.155 --> 00:11:06.191
in a very positive, relaxed manner.

00:11:07.286 --> 00:11:09.420
And I hadn't seen that in years.

00:11:10.453 --> 00:11:15.921
And that relaxed state is trickling down
to the community, to the citizens.

00:11:16.954 --> 00:11:20.701
So a couple of weeks ago,
I had a neighbor overdose.

00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:22.507
Twenty-two years old.

00:11:22.914 --> 00:11:26.613
So of course, I hurried down
to help my firefighters and my neighbor.

00:11:27.578 --> 00:11:31.524
And what I witnessed
was my firefighters being supportive.

00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:34.282
Talking in a non-judgmental way.

00:11:34.768 --> 00:11:37.149
I watched as one of my firefighters

00:11:37.173 --> 00:11:39.947
showed the father
and another family member

00:11:39.971 --> 00:11:43.220
how to provide rescue breaths,
should this happen again.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.577
And left him with a bag valve mask.

00:11:46.236 --> 00:11:47.736
Positive change.

00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:49.847
Positive change.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.735
Did I happen to mention

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:56.084
the two things that firefighters
dislike the most?

00:11:56.965 --> 00:11:59.712
The way things are and change.

00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:05.994
(Laughter)

00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:09.946
You know, I recognize that there have been
drug epidemics before.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.170
And I've seen what crack
can do to a community.

00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:16.424
A lot of our critics think

00:12:16.448 --> 00:12:21.744
that this new compassionate response
that we're doing in Huntington

00:12:21.768 --> 00:12:24.572
is because of race.

00:12:24.596 --> 00:12:29.669
That because the overdoses are happening
so much to the white community.

00:12:30.392 --> 00:12:32.551
And I understand that criticism,

00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:35.301
because we as a country messed up.

00:12:36.115 --> 00:12:40.020
And we treated black people poorly
during the crack epidemic.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.535
We can't forget that.

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:44.424
And we must do better.

00:12:45.538 --> 00:12:48.643
But right now, what I know
is people are dying.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:56.378
And we in Huntington deal with people
suffering from substance use disorder

00:12:56.402 --> 00:13:01.410
of every color and every background,
on the streets, every day.

00:13:02.696 --> 00:13:07.323
The job of a first responder:
prevent unnecessary deaths.

00:13:08.252 --> 00:13:09.402
Period.

00:13:10.847 --> 00:13:11.997
So ...

00:13:13.715 --> 00:13:16.517
Obviously, I'm a stubborn
firefighter and nurse.

00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:22.209
And I refuse to believe that there isn't
a way around every barrier.

00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:24.791
One of the barriers that we have

00:13:24.815 --> 00:13:27.749
dealing with the opioid
epidemic is stigma.

00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:31.021
So ...

00:13:32.783 --> 00:13:37.482
We in Huntington, West Virginia,
are showing the rest of the country

00:13:37.506 --> 00:13:40.236
that change can happen.

00:13:40.776 --> 00:13:44.308
That there is hope
dealing with this epidemic.

00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:49.376
Our current overdoses are down 40 percent.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:56.800
(Applause)

00:13:57.878 --> 00:14:01.172
Currently, our overdose deaths
are down 50 percent.

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:06.175
(Applause)

00:14:06.199 --> 00:14:08.762
This epidemic is far from over.

00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:13.609
But each and every one of us
has a part to play in this epidemic.

00:14:14.188 --> 00:14:17.633
Just by listening
and being kind to somebody,

00:14:17.657 --> 00:14:22.373
you have the ability
to make a difference in their lives.

00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:23.990
Thank you and God bless.

00:14:24.014 --> 00:14:29.487
(Applause)
