do see that I would like to see some
higher resolution artwork for the static

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000
higher resolution artwork for the static
 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.670
higher resolution artwork for the static
artwork the font is definitely blurry

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680
artwork the font is definitely blurry
 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.680
artwork the font is definitely blurry
here on the on the transformer prime and

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:43.690
here on the on the transformer prime and
 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.450
here on the on the transformer prime and
that's one of the very the number font

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:45.460
that's one of the very the number font
 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.650
that's one of the very the number font
here at the bottom and that's I think

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:46.660
here at the bottom and that's I think
 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.939
here at the bottom and that's I think
that's intentional i think that's

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:47.949
that's intentional i think that's
 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.050
that's intentional i think that's
actually got it because look at the

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060
actually got it because look at the
 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.790
actually got it because look at the
number front of the top I know I know

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800
number front of the top I know I know
 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.469
number front of the top I know I know
but it's still it's a combination of

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479
but it's still it's a combination of
 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:54.240
but it's still it's a combination of
both blur and and I mean there is

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.250
both blur and and I mean there is
 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.589
both blur and and I mean there is
definitely I think yeah there's a little

00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599
definitely I think yeah there's a little
 

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:57.570
definitely I think yeah there's a little
bit of blue mada bloom on it I know but

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:57.580
bit of blue mada bloom on it I know but
 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.860
bit of blue mada bloom on it I know but
I would still like to see it a little

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:58.870
I would still like to see it a little
 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.450
I would still like to see it a little
higher res definitely with some of the

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:00.460
higher res definitely with some of the
 

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.339
higher res definitely with some of the
text but overall the presentation looks

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:02.349
text but overall the presentation looks
 

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:03.870
text but overall the presentation looks
really nice in this category of games

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:03.880

is actually from a from a navigation
perspective there's there's a lot of

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399
perspective there's there's a lot of
 

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.710
perspective there's there's a lot of
stuff that are still missing especially

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720
stuff that are still missing especially
 

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.210
stuff that are still missing especially
when you're in the in the tutorial

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:43.220
when you're in the in the tutorial
 

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.329
when you're in the in the tutorial
there's a lot of problems and and it's

00:16:46.329 --> 00:16:46.339
there's a lot of problems and and it's
 

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:48.910
there's a lot of problems and and it's
all kind of let's see if we can actually

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920
all kind of let's see if we can actually
 

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.129
all kind of let's see if we can actually
so let's I think we're not going to be

00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:51.139
so let's I think we're not going to be
 

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:52.660
so let's I think we're not going to be
in this tutorial level here so I'm not

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:52.670
in this tutorial level here so I'm not
 

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.799
in this tutorial level here so I'm not
good you're not going to get to see all

00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:53.809
good you're not going to get to see all
 

00:16:53.809 --> 00:16:55.389

00:16:59.209 --> 00:17:00.519
actually the same game with just a great
presentation and I think this actually

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:00.529
presentation and I think this actually
 

00:17:00.529 --> 00:17:02.799
presentation and I think this actually
shows kind of what it takes what what

00:17:02.799 --> 00:17:02.809
shows kind of what it takes what what
 

00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:04.600
shows kind of what it takes what what

motions the animation the sliding in and
 

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.290
motions the animation the sliding in and
out the crispness of the graphics yeah

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:11.300
out the crispness of the graphics yeah
 

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.530
out the crispness of the graphics yeah
it's all just really really high it's

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:14.540
it's all just really really high it's
 

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.640
it's all just really really high it's
very well done for what it is I mean

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:15.650
very well done for what it is I mean
 

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.350

is what we're really watching is a
computer simulation I the outcome of

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.720
computer simulation I the outcome of
 

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.900
computer simulation I the outcome of
which is known as soon as it starts yes

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:49.910
which is known as soon as it starts yes
 

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.030
