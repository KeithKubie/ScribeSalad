00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's go through each one of them.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Writing "potato" may be fun, but it does not involve any sort of if-then-else processing,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
so it won't show off our defect.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The expected answer is that the web page shows potato,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the answer we'll get is the web page shows potato.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So this is not a good test case.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Over here, if x is less than y write "tomato", else write "eggplant".

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We need a little more in this test case like values of x and y,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but this is the right idea.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's say that x is something like 0 and y is something like 1.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We then expect it to print out "tomato" but because we've made this bug over here,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it will print out "eggplant" instead.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So the observed behavior will differ from our intuition

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
or from our specification of what should really happen,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so then we know there's a mistake.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Over here return 2 + 3.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Again there's no conditional control flow, so this is not a very good test for us.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Finally, over here factorial does involve an if

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in determining whether or not the program terminates.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This is a very good test because almost immediately, factorial of 5,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we're going to see, oh, is 5 equal to 0?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's not. Bug. We'll return 1.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We won't actually make any recursive calls.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We'll get the wrong answer really fast.

00:01:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So this is a good test case for us.
