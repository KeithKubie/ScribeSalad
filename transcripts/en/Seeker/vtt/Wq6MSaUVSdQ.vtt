00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.820
They are everywhere in every city pooping
on our statues and ledges; they're eating

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.820
trash, they're annoying rats with wings, squabs,
sky ratsâ€¦ or just, ugh get out of my way

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.890
BIRD.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:29.490
I'm going to ruin every pretty bird-releasing
ceremony you've ever seen; they're releasing

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.000
sky rats.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.800
Pigeons are part of the Family: Columbidae
and within it there are over 300 species;

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.880
including both pigeons and doves!

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.860
The names are used interchangeably!

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.250
These birds are so successful they've spread
across the entire planet (except the Sahara,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.809
Antarctic and high Arctic).

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.059
The first mention of them pigeons appeared
in Mesopotamia.

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.030
Ancient humans eventually domesticated them
and kept them for food, just like the chicken.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.690
Because of their monogamy and two-parent family
units, the dove and pigeon were used in religious

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.940
ceremonies and to represent deities like Ishtar,
Venus, the Holy Spirit, or Aphrodite.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.420
Once they'd been domesticated, we learned
homing pigeons could be used in bird races

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.860
or to carry messages.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.000
Europeans brought the rock pigeon with them
to North America where it interbred with the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.799
native pigeon and spread EVERYWHERE.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.180
That native was the famous Passenger pigeon.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.600
They were likely the most numerous bird in
the world in the 1800s -- with 136 million

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.210
breeding adults in one site in Wisconsin alone
-- adding up to BILLIONS over the whole country.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.450
Accounts by Native Americans and European
naturalists say the sky could to turn dark

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.619
for hours while these birds migrated.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.480
Of course, now the passengers are all extinct
from our hunting and feeding practices, thanks

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.480
humans.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.310
The Rock pigeon we still see in our cities
carries some of its DNA, but it's mainly a

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.360
feral mix of the original European rock pigeon
variety.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.799
These birds are still good for racing and
speed.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.740
They're adept fliers and evade predators even
in New York City; which is why you rarely

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.860
see dead ones.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.610
Yes, stray cats get them, but so do the owls,
falcons and hawks that live in Eastern and

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.810
Midwest cities looking for the tasty, juicy,
birds; which breed year-round.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.130
Even we eat them!

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.119
If you see squab on a menu, that's pigeon,
friends.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.379
So after learning all about them, I now want
to put pigeons forth as a superbird.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.299
THESE THINGS ARE CRAZY COOL.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.040
For example, pigeon navigation isn't well
understood, but a 2013 paper in the Journal

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.480
of Experimental Biology posits it has to do
with infrasound, or extreme low frequency

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.349
sound waves generated by the ocean and reverberating
through our planet.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.939
Using these pervasive sounds, the researchers
believe, pigeons can make a mental map of

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.109
their surroundings and find their way home.

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.809
And, this month, a new study in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences explored

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:45.650
this superbird, finding their flying is some
of the best in the bird world.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.760
They can avoid cars and predators and when
captured with high speed cameras they found

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.419
the simple pigeon could hold their wings up
to slide through small spaces; OR they can

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:59.469
tuck them in to barrel through holes and protect
their body in case of miscalculation.

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:04.290
During his research into the "Origin of Species,"
Darwin studied and bred pigeons, exploring

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.279
their variations and adaptations through selective
breeding.

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:12.269
Today, researchers at the University of Utah
are doing the same with genome sequencing;

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.319
probing how they contain such diversity!

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.790
Mourning doves, Jacobin, passenger, Red Capuchin,
King pigeons, rock pigeons... (that's the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.639
one you see in the city); they're all closely
related.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:33.709
If we bred them like we do dogs we'd see AMAZING
colors and patterns.

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.709
Pigeons are frickin' awesome.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.459
When I started researching this piece, I was
seriously calling them skyrats.

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.459
But not anymore.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.540
Superbirds all the way.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.540
But what do you think?

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.379
You gonna look at these little birds differently
now?

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.189
Something else people spend a lot of time
ignoring is abandoned buildings, but I love

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:53.189
them.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.029
These neglected places aren't just ruins waiting
to fall down, but pieces of our history!

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.189
They're important to understanding how we
got here.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:07.180
So, in this new show Abandonment Issues I
go explore them.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:19.250

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.340
It's the first episode, but there's more to
come!

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.259
Tell me 
what you think!
