1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.490
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.740
Siberia is always been an interesting place in Russia.
No,
no,
no.
Have you,

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.460
did you do up there?
1990?
Yeah.
Uh,
right before communism fell.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.840
I was there for three weeks.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.460
Well before communism fell off was a in power.

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.140
Whoa.
Yeah.
Uh,
it was the spy.
Yep.
Privy of the cat dealer.

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:24.900
You'll get pulling my Abdul's though.
Wow.
That's pretty good.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.860
Would you say I said hello?
Uh,
I don't understand.
Please and thank you.

9
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.090
That's just the words I remember.
Uh,

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.460
it was just program founded by Dwight d Eisenhower in the four days of the,

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.180
it's called people to people where the,

12
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.720
they send the youth of America to other countries to hang out with that youth to

13
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:44.700
promote world peace.
And that's all it is.

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.300
And certain kids from high schools are selected and they go,

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.850
you got to Washington DC first for three,
you know,
for three days.
They,
they,

16
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.050
they debrief you and then you go to another country and ours was Russia.

17
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.580
It was awesome.
I had a great time.
Wow.
Yeah.
And,
uh,

18
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.090
I told Bert Kreischer that too.
You know,
cause he has the whole machine story.

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.020
I said,
I feel like I can't tell my Russian story because you've,

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.280
you've owned it so much with your machines toy that if I do anything about this

21
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:13.950
that it's going to look like [inaudible] you too,
Huh?
Yeah.

22
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:18.390
You got in Russia story do you should tell it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
People want to hear it.

23
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.680
They'll understand.
They don't think you're,

24
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.830
I kind of got in trouble because I was trading illegally on the black market

25
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:26.160
over there will be done on purpose.
I didn't know is doing it.
Um,

26
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.420
because you as look full story right.
Cause a cop and like tell me more.

27
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.250
That's kind of what happened.
This dude I was talking to,

28
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:38.570
it was after like a function that we were at,
you know,
where they,

29
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.690
you would go to the,
some,

30
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.050
some towns I'm village and they'd come and they'd greet you with bread and salt

31
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:46.350
and they would dance around and then you would just eat with them and hang out

32
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:50.260
or whatever.
And,
um,
so I was just talking to this kid,
you know,

33
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:53.340
and they speak perfect English,
you know,
we're the ones that don't speak Russian.

34
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.760
So this kid is trying to teach me Russian cuss words and I thought he's pretty

35
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:58.050
cool.
It's before the Internet,
you know.

36
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.830
So I have a bunch of these ink pans that my mom gave me from the phone company

37
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.420
where she works.
She goes,
just give them,
make pants.

38
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:05.330
They live anything with English,
riding on it,
anything American,

39
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.950
they're going to love it.
Bubblegum,
jeans,
ink pens.
So I was like,
yeah,
dude,
let's,

40
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:13.540
uh,
let's be pen pals.
So exchanging addresses,
you know,
like,
oh,

41
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.070
keep in touch with you,
why not?
And I give him a pen and it gives me his address.

42
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.030
And what I don't know is this dude's already kind of in trouble with cops over

43
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:23.430
there for trading illegally on the black market.
I had no idea.

44
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.620
And this cop just grabbed both of us,

45
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.840
the drags us into the hotel and no one saw me from my group get grabbed by the

46
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:34.320
way,
because I was off doing my own little thing that this dude,
right,
uh,

47
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.670
learning Russian customers.

48
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.600
So I'd go into his office in this hotel and they're just cussing each other in

49
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:43.650
Russian.
And I don't know what the hell is going on.
I'm like,
dude,
what is this?

50
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:46.630
Am I a big trouble here?
I mean,
you know,
he goes,
if this little shits,

51
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.440
I'm not to worry about that.
This is bullshit.
Then they scream some more.

52
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.450
Now the cop doesn't speak English.

53
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.760
And so he's basically my translator disguise to the cop.
I'm like,

54
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:58.680
Hey man,
I'm with this group.
You know,
I don't know what's going on.

55
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.350
And so he kicks that kid out,
the Russian comp,

56
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:03.850
and now it's just me and this Russian cop.

57
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.150
And I'm looking at him and he's looking at me and he looks at my bag with all

58
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:10.530
these ink pens and he's like,
he goes like this.
He's like,
what was,
you know,

59
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.490
let me see.
You know,
I'll call you want a pen.

60
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.130
So I handed him a pen and he looks at it.
Is that going to cool?

61
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:19.090
It puts it in his desk and it goes away and it comes back with this big ass

62
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.230
Russian pendant,

63
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.280
sickle and hammer thing with wings coming out of pretty cool looking thing.

64
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.280
It is handed it to me and he goes like this.

65
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.320
So he technically arrested me for trading and then he traded with me.

66
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.270
Yeah.
1990 is when that happened.
That was pretty crazy.

67
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.780
It was fun to see all that shit though.
Right before it fell.

68
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.010
Did you see like lines in this treat for food or anything crazy like that?
Yeah,

69
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.740
I'm not crazy.
Well,
yeah,
we,
I saw linens.
Uh,
we went to Red Square,

70
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.420
Square Lenin's tomb.
Um,

71
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.840
we went to some smaller little donkey villages.
Uh,

72
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:59.350
went swimming in the Nepa river right close to where to Nobel was like 50 miles

73
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:02.500
from Chernobyl.
So,
um,
but yeah,

74
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:06.880
there was definitely tell it was definitely some poverty going on here and
there,

75
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.760
but not,
not to the extreme that you hear.
You know,

76
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.990
I didn't see like these lines around buildings or for toilet paper or anything

77
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:18.070
like that.
But you know,
that's what it was.
Communism was on its way out too,

78
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:22.570
so it wasn't in the worst part of it,
but it was definitely an experience.

79
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:26.900
I was 18 when I went over there.
There's a picture of me in Red Square and I'm,

80
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.330
I got acid washed jeans,

81
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.010
I've got a bugle boy t shirt on and I'm wearing a fanny pack with deck shoes and

82
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:36.910
I'm just doing like this.
So that was fun,
man.

83
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.320
Yeah,
that's gotta be a hell of a flight too.
Right?

84
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.090
How long does it take to get the ride?

85
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:46.180
We went to Germany first on a layover there for like three hours,

86
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.670
Frankfurt and then Gow so young.

87
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:52.180
I couldn't even tell you how long that thing was.
It's been a long time.

88
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.390
Probably seven now.
That is an interesting country to me.

89
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.090
It's always been an interesting country because it gets so fucking cold there.

90
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.720
They're hard people.
