00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:11.410
Hmmm I have a weird craving for liver and
fava beans...

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.690
Hey hungry fans, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.310
Cannibalism: if you’re a Hannibal fan you’re
not squeamish around the subject of people

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.310
eating other people.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.090
But it’s one of the biggest taboos in human
history.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.770
But not in nature.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.090
Sometimes it’s a family affair.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.930
Mothers eat babies, babies feed off mom: a
"mom eats dad".

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.230
Other times it’s warring factions of the
same species, like chimps in Gombe National

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.480
Park who ate neighboring group’s offspring
as described in a study published in the journal

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.480
Nature.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.230
But why don’t humans do it?.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.870
Well simply put: it's not socially acceptable…
there’s no real reason why we don’t.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.970
But come on, just the thought of it is just…
repulsive.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.100
And with good reason, it can cause nasty diseases
like prion disease, which we know of as CJ

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.780
or mad cow disease.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.310
Prion disease is caused from a misfolding
of protein molecules in the brain.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.620
Which can happen for a variety of reasons
like a fluke of genetics or eating contaminated

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.620
meat.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.490
The misfolded proteins will spread until the
brain is basically transformed into a "sponge”

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.490
riddled with holes!

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.329
It eats away at memory, causes seizures, and
it’s ultimately fatal.

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.740
While incredibly rare now, prion disease might
have been more common.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.000
And this is where things get interesting.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.810
Prion diseases might be rare now thanks to
cannibalism.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.880
You see researchers found that another tribe
in Papua New Guinea has a genetic mutation

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.069
that protects them from prion disease.

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.920
The tribe used to practice funerary cannibalism.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.920
Where members of the tribe would eat the remains
of the deceased rather than burying it.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.280
The men would eat the “best” meat, the
meaty muscles, while women and children ate

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.670
less good meat, the brain.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.180
Not surprisingly, they were devastated by
an epidemic of what they called “kuru”,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.180
a prion disease.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.810
At it’s peak in the 1950s, the epidemic
killed 2 percent of the population every year.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.590
As the tribe became westernized the cannibalism
stopped and kuru began to fade into memory.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.200
But those that were left behind developed
a genetic resistance to prion disease according

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.219
to a study published in the journal Nature.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.229
The study found that this resistance is the
result of a mutation where the body produces

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.300
an amino acid valine rather than the more
common glycine.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.310
This change prevents proteins in the brain
from producing the misfolding prions.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.049
But a similar mutation might have happened
before, often.

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.670
A study published in the journal Science showed
a different mutation in the same tribe that

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.611
also prevented prion disease in another way.

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:28.890
But more shockingly, they found widespread
evidence of this mutation.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.209
It was found in most humans from Europe to
Japan.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.209
The researchers suggest that most early humans
practiced some form of cannibalism and probably

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.760
suffered massive epidemics of prion diseases.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.000
And hence, why a large portion of the world’s
population has some projection from these

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
diseases.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.620
But protection from disease isn’t the only
um… benefit to cannibalism.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.310
In a study published in the Journal of Human
Evolution, researchers found that 800,000

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.799
years ago, our ancestors did, the killed and
ate the young of neighboring tribes as part

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.030
of a territorial defense strategy.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.730
As the young of neighboring group wanders
far from home, they might attack and kill

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.299
the young as a kind of warning to the other
group.

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.129
This sort of defense strategy can be seen
today in some populations of chimpanzee.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.200
But defense and warfare isn’t the the only
reason for cannibalism.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.280
Simple hunger might drive people to dine on
their neighbors.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.200
Another study published The Journal of Human
Evolution suggested that eating a group member

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.540
can help conserve energy.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.129
One of the lead authors of the study told
Discovery News "The body can give one day

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.540
off from hunting, which was always dangerous
at that time”.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.249
And I mean a human body contains a lot of
calories.

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:39.800
According James Cole, a professor on human
origins at the University of Brighton puts

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.140
the calorie count of a whole human body at
about 81,500 calories.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.690
So uh yum.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.530
So that’s fun news, eh?

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.170
Now as you watch Hannibal you can be proud
that it celebrates your heritage.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.469
Oh man, nope.

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.469
Still extremely disturbing.

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.700
While you might be grossed out by cannibalism
some new moms are eating their placentas.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.430
To get the whole sticky scoop, check out this
video right here.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:11.530
So there you have it folks.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.079
Humans… ate other humans.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.190
We love to break down the weird stuff here
at DNew, so if you’ve got any weird questions

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:28.230
floating around that brain of yours, leave
