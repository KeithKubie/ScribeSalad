00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.550
&gt;&gt; My name is David Kuria from Nairobi, Kenya,
a social entrepreneur for [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:16.270
On public environmental issues and I think
really the -- the failure to

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.640
reach a consensus from the Copenhagen conference
last year, [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:33.520
our globe and our economic development.
In particular for Africa where the mitigations

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.140
and the challenges of
mitigations in Copenhagen with the impacts

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.019
of climate change are
intermost.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.880
And we have seen this things happening especially
the extended droughts

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.840
and really coping up with the expected downfalls
which are really to

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.210
Africans citizens unmanageable.
And we have seen really lots of deaths emanating

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.690
from the poverty of
the effects of climate change, loss of income

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.500
and poor people and I
think it's the [INAUDIBLE] governments global

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.291
leader which we think on
the future of the climate change.
