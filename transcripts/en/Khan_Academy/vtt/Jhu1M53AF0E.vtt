00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.840
All we have left to do is
evaluate this integral,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.990
which is really an
exercise in kind

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.580
of evaluating trigonometric
integrals more than anything

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:07.810
else.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.476
But it never hurts
to get that practice,

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.220
so let's just do
it step by step.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.880
So we see sine cubed theta.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.150
No obvious way to directly
take the antiderivative of sine

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.680
cubed theta.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.950
But if we had some mixtures
of sines and cosines there,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.950
then we could start essentially
doing U-substitution,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.460
which at this point you
probably can do in your head.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.793
So what we could do is we
could write this is a product.

00:00:28.793 --> 00:00:30.700
So we can write this
as the sine of theta--

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.241
so I'll do this part
right over here.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:38.516
This is sine of theta
times sine squared theta.

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:40.140
And sine squared
theta can be rewritten

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.390
as 1 minus cosine squared theta.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.830
So this is the same thing
as sine of theta times

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.080
1 minus cosine squared theta.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.530
And if we multiply
this out, this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.950
gives us sine theta minus sine
theta cosine squared theta.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.810
And this is much easier
for us to integrate,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.976
although it looks like a
more complicated expression

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:07.360
because it's easy take the
antiderivative of sine theta.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.000
And now it's easy take
the antiderivative of this

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.274
because we have the derivative
of cosine theta sitting

00:01:12.274 --> 00:01:12.940
right over here.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.050
So this is going to be
cosine cubed theta over 3.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.310
So, essentially, we're doing
U-substitution right over here.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.600
But I'll save that for second.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.540
Let's rewrite all of
these in a way that's

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.850
easy to take the
antiderivative of it.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.480
Cosine squared theta, we know
this is a common trig identity.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.680
That's the same thing as 1/2
of 1 plus cosine of 2 theta.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.790
And once again, this
is a much, much easier

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.170
to take the antiderivative of.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:46.800
So I'll write plus 1/2
plus 1/2 cosine of 2 theta.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.330
And now, all of this
is actually quite easy

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.560
to take the antiderivative
of, and so I'll just

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.600
rewrite it again.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.610
So minus 4 cosine theta plus
4 cosine theta sine theta

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.240
minus cosine theta sine
squared theta d theta.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.900
I just was able to sneak it in.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.259
And so that's our integral
between 0 and 2 pi.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:12.800
So let's just take
the antiderivative

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.790
in every one of these steps.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.810
It's starting to get
a little bit messy.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.500
I'll try to write a
little bit neater.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.850
The antiderivative
of sine of theta

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.125
is negative cosine of theta.

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.020
If you take the derivative
of cosine theta,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.050
you get negative sine theta.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.633
Then the negatives
cancel out, and you

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:29.840
get that right over there.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.410
Then over here, we
have the derivative

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.600
of cosine theta, which
is negative sine theta.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.230
So we can essentially
kind of treat

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.580
this-- we could kind of
make the substitution that u

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.280
is cosine theta.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.280
That's essentially what
we're doing in our head.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.220
So the antiderivative
of this is going

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.620
to be equal to plus
cosine cubed theta over 3.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.400
And then the antiderivative
of 1/2 with respect to theta

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.920
is just going to
be plus 1/2 theta.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.780
The antiderivative of
cosine 2 theta-- well,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.120
we want the derivative of
this thing sitting someplace.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.480
The derivative of this
thing over here is 2.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.090
So if we put a 2 here, we can't
just multiply by 2 arbitrarily.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.390
We'd have to multiply
and divide by 2.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.330
So we could put a 2 here,
and then we could also--

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.320
but we'd also have
to divide by 2.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.104
So then that would become a 4.

00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:20.270
And we haven't changed this.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.470
Notice, this is now
2/4 cosine of 2 theta,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.859
the exact same thing as
1/2 half cosine 2 theta.

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.400
But this is useful because now,
the way I've written it here,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.572
we have the derivative of
2 theta right over here.

00:03:29.572 --> 00:03:31.030
And so we can just
say, well, we'll

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.680
just take the antiderivative
to this whole thing, which

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.030
is going to be sine of 2 theta.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.730
But we still have the 1 so that
the antiderivative of this part

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.302
right over here is
the sine of 2 theta.

00:03:40.302 --> 00:03:41.760
And then we have
the 1/4 out there.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.959
So plus 1/4 sine of 2 theta.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.750
And then the antiderivative
of cosine theta

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.760
is just sine theta,
so minus 4 sine theta.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.400
Antiderivative of
this right over here,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.790
we can kind of pick whichever
way we want to do it.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.210
But we could say, well, the
derivative of sine theta

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.210
is cosine theta.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:10.560
So this is going to be the same
thing as 4 sine squared theta

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.799
over 2.

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.090
Or instead of saying over 2,
instead of writing that 4,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.290
I'll just divide the 4 by
the 2, and I will get a 2.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.406
So let me erase that and
put a 2 right over here.

00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:25.780
And you can work
it out yourself.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.029
If you were to take the
derivative of this thing right

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:30.105
over here, it'd be the
derivative of sine theta.

00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:31.480
If you'd just use
the chain rule,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.330
which would be cosine theta,
and then times 4 sine of theta.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.700
So that's exactly what
we have right over here.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.550
And then we have this last part.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.482
The derivative of sine
theta is cosine theta.

00:04:45.482 --> 00:04:47.440
And so once again, just
like we've done before,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.100
the antiderivative
of this whole thing

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.580
is going to be negative
sine cubed of theta over 3.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.690
And we need to evaluate
this entire expression

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.250
between 0 and 2 pi.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.820
So let's see how it evaluates.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.200
So first, let's evaluate
everything at 2 pi.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.590
So this evaluated at
2 pi is negative 1.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.080
This evaluated at 2 pi is 1/3.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.250
This evaluated at 2 pi
is just going to be pi.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.620
This evaluated at 2 pi is
0, because sine of 4 pi

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.310
is going to be 0.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.094
This evaluated at 2
pi is going to be 0.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.760
This evaluated at 2
pi is going to be 0.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.593
And this evaluated at
2 pi is going to be 0.

00:05:31.593 --> 00:05:33.540
So that's a nice simplification.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.374
So that's everything
evaluated at 2 pi.

00:05:35.374 --> 00:05:36.790
And from that,
we're going to have

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.300
to subtract everything
evaluated at 0.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.670
So cosine of 0, well, that's
going to be once again 1.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.940
And we have a negative
sign, so it's negative 1.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.967
Then you're going
to have plus 1/3.

00:05:47.967 --> 00:05:49.300
And then you're going to have 0.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.670
And then all these other
things are going to be 0.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.930
And so if you
simplify it, you get--

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.400
this is going to be equal to
negative 1 plus 1/3 plus pi.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.110
And then we have plus
1 plus 1 minus 1/3.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.585
Well, that cancels with that.

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:09.090
That cancels with that.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.150
And we deserve a drum roll now.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.857
It all simplified
just like when we

00:06:12.857 --> 00:06:14.690
use Stokes' Theorem in
like the four videos.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.860
Actually, I think it
was a little bit simpler

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.440
to just directly evaluate
the line integral over here.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.002
We got it simplifying
to just pi.
