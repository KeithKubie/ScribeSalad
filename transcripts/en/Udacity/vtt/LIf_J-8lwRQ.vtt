00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.460
It's time to look back at updating our
forecast view in phone landscape mode.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.860
What we have now with a huge app bar,
gives the user almost no context

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.270
to use the list, and the list contains
a huge amount of white space.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.160
The design that we have for
the forecast landscape you eliminate,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.900
is most of the app bar.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.840
Placing it underneath
the scrolling list.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.870
We're going to fix the width of
our forecast list at 360 dp.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.180
This isn't as bad as it might sound,
since the whole goal for

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.125
this is to eliminate
interior white space.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:36.495
And this guarantees that the interior
white space is constant.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:40.095
We're eventually going to pad
the top of the list by 16dp.

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:42.315
But we'll save that for later.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:45.515
We're going to do these changes
inside of the forecast fragment,

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:47.765
inside of the layout land directory,

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.995
because the next code pull moves
the app bar layout into the fragment.
