00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.970
- [Interviewer] How does
voter turnout in midterms

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.750
compare to presidential elections?

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.050
- Traditionally, midterm
elections have been years

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.870
in which the voter turnout is much lower

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.340
than a presidential
election, and particularly

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.410
in recent history where the
American political scene

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.720
has been really dominated
by the president.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.290
We can start that really
with John F. Kennedy,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.460
when he became a celebrity president

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700
and really everybody increasingly

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.600
has just sort of seen
American political activity

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.710
originating and swirling
around a president.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.410
And so if they're
interested in the president,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.190
well, they turn out for
the presidential election.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.560
But in the off-year
elections, in the midterms,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.810
well, the president's
not really on the ballot

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.930
even if some people tend
to see the elections

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.280
as a referendum on his presidency.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.330
So people turn out in lower numbers.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.000
We've also seen a trend, and
it may be upturned in 2018,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.463
but a trend where Republican
voters, who tend to be older,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.910
participate in the voting
in midterm elections more

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.900
than younger voters, who
tend to vote Democratic,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.630
or voters of color, who vote

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.400
for the Democratic Party as well.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.820
That's always been one of
the challenges for Democrats,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.380
to get their team to turn out

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.213
and vote in these midterm elections.
