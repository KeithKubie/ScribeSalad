00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's see, to get from start to finish we need to make progress in both the east-west direction

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the north-south direction.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is my straight line distance.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I can think of it as being composed of east-west progress and north-south progress.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If I can find the legs of this triangle,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I should be able to find this third leg.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's see what we can do.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
First it travels east at this speed for this duration.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
After leg one it's moved 30 km eastward.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In fact, why don't I keep track of this in some sort of table--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
progress east and progress south.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For this first entry we make 30 km of progress east and 0 south,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because I'm heading exactly east.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In the next entry, I'm going exactly south at 20 km/h for 1 hour,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which means 20 km south and 0 east.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In the next entry, I go 15 k/h for 3 hours, which is 45 km east and 0 south.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What about this last entry? I'm going northeast 8 km/h for 1 hour.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That would be hypotenuse of 8, but this side actually has both an east component 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and a north component.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Well, northeast means I'm exactly between east and north,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
so this angle is 45 degrees.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In fact, I can see that cos 45 is going to be equal to this eastward progress--

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'll call this E--over the hypotenuse of 8.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The eastward progress will be 8 cos 45, which is 5.7 km,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and the southward progress will be identical--wait. I won't be identical.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It will be negative. We're not going south here. We're going north.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It'll be negative 5.7 km.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We can get that by looking at the sine of this angle.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, let's keep track of total progress south.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That would be this leg of the triangle here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Well, I'm south 20 but then north 5.7, so this leg has a total length of 14.3 km.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This leg has a length of 30 + 45, which is 75, plus 5.7, which is 80.7 km.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I can do the Pythagorean Theorem to find this side.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I find a straight line distance of 81.96 km.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
That's probably too precise. I should probably just say 82 km.
