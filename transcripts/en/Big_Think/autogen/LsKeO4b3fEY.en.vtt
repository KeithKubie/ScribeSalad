00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:12.950
Our business focuses us on diversity because
we all work in a sport that was deemed too

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.260
black to thrive and actually even survive.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.599
People forget, but there were articles, “The
Dark Clouds Over the NBA…”

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:31.289
I literally – when I was executive vice
president Larry sent me up to a newspaper

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.580
and the television guy said, “You don’t
get it, Stern.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.340
You guys are just not going to make it.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.909
This is a white country and you have a black
sport.”

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.410
So we developed chips on our shoulder early
on.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:55.820
If you worked at the NBA in the 70s you had
to be a believer that America was a good country

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.270
and that we had something to teach rather
than to be afraid of.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.290
A sport that, you know, could have Willis
Reed from Louisiana and Grambling and Bill

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:17.580
Bradley from Crystal City, Missouri and Princeton
on a championship team, hmmm, that says something

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.610
about a sport that has something to teach.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.530
That’s about talent.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.890
We sort of rallied around the notion that
if you came to an NBA game it didn’t matter

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.430
where you sat, you know, whether you were
in the nosebleed section or at court side,

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.300
your opinion counted regardless of your race.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.870
And if you were on the court, your talent
counted regardless of your race.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.900
You got game, you play.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.610
If you don’t have game, you don’t.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.860
And so this was a subject of some discussion
at the NBA always on an ongoing basis.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.490
And it has ramifications throughout our whole
business.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:02.090
When I was required to act when Ron Artest
ran into the stands in Detroit and there was

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:11.470
a big brawl, et cetera, the talk radio that
weekend – the words "thugs" and "punks"

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.000
was uttered what seemed to be about a million
times.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.700
I’m sure it was less but we all know the
code words.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.100
And so we tend to be particularly protective
of our players in that regard and I think

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.890
it makes us conscious of a lot of different
things having to do with the racial discussion.
