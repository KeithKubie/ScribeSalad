00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.480
This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Square Space.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.160
The Moon is pretty hard to miss when it’s
up at night. It’s big and bright and really

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.610
very pretty. Even cooler, it’s the closest
astronomical object in the Universe to us,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.700
and arguably, the one we know best.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.180
I hate to break it to you, but we humans are
pretty egotistical. Even though there are

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.800
over 160 known moons of decent size in our
solar system, we call ours THE Moon, with

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.200
a capital M, like it’s the only one, or
the most important one.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.640
And I guess to us it is the most important
one. It’s only the fifth largest moon in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.130
the solar system in absolute size, but compared
to Earth it’s pretty big; fully a quarter

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.000
of the diameter of the planet. That’s a
way bigger ratio than for any other moon orbiting

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.690
a major planet in the solar system.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.350
By the numbers, the Moon is about 3470 kilometers
in diameter, and on average about 380,000

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.990
kilometers from Earth. That means it looks
pretty big in our sky, but probably not as

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.079
big as you think.

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.240
When the moon rises, it can look huge and
looming on the horizon, like you could fall

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.439
into it. Ah, but that’s not really the case;
it’s easy to show it’s the same size on

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.079
the horizon as it is high overhead. Yet people
think it looks twice as big when it’s on

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.490
the horizon! This is the well-known Moon Illusion,
and it’s due to two factors: how we perceive

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.770
the sizes of objects, and how we perceive
the sky.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.009
We don’t really see the sky as a hemisphere
over our heads, but more like a flattened

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.119
bowl, with the horizon farther away than the
zenith. So when the Moon’s on the horizon,

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.789
our brains are convinced it’s farther away.
But if it’s farther away, it must be physically

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.109
bigger to appear that size, right? So our
brain interprets the Moon’s size as HUGE.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.499
It’s an illusion, but a convincing one.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.599
In fact, the Moon is about the same size as
a small pill held up at arm’s length! Our

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:56.859
satellite is a lot smaller than you think.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.599
The internal structure of the Moon is roughly
similar to the Earth: It has a solid, iron

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.499
inner core; a liquid outer core, a thick mantle,
and a crust of lighter material on top. The

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:10.800
core is small, probably 350 kilometers in
radius, and still hot, though not as hot as

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.569
Earth’s core. The lower mantle may be a
thick fluid, but unlike Earth’s mantle the

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.849
upper part is solid.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.620
The easiest part of the moon to observe is
its surface, so of course we know the most

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.989
about that. The near side, the side we see
from Earth, is divided into two distinct types

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.680
of regions: highlands, which are heavily cratered,
and maria—Latin for “seas”—which are

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.840
darker and smoother.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.280
The craters in the highlands are from countless
impacts over the eons from asteroids and comets.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.720
Rocks from these regions have been dated to
be well over 4 billion years old — nearly

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.680
as old as the Moon itself!

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.739
The maria, on the other hand, don’t have
nearly as many craters. They’re younger,

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.709
but that’s relative; rocks from those areas
appear to be roughly 3-3.5 billion years old

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.000
on average. The maria are made of darker,
basaltic material, which means they probably

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.299
formed from lava flooding older areas.

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.469
For most of human history, the far side of
the Moon was hidden from us, but in 1959 the

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:06.530
Soviet Union flew the Luna 3 space probe around
the Moon, photographing the far side for the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.689
first time. Everyone expected it to look a
lot like the near side, but shockingly, it’s

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.189
vastly different: There were almost no maria!
That’s weird; the near side is covered with

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.579
them. And not only that, observations from
subsequent lunar probes showed the crust on

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.560
the lunar far side is thicker than it is on
the near side as well.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.109
The Moon is starting to stack up mysteries.
Why is it so big compared to Earth? Why are

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.349
the near and far sides so different? It turns
out the composition of the crust has a lot

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.889
of similarities to Earth, but also a lot of
differences as well. Why?

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:42.200
It turns out the answers to these questions are all
related to how the Moon formed 4.5 billion years ago.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.459
A lot of ideas have been proposed to figure
out how the Moon formed, but the best one

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.409
going these days is called the Giant Impact
hypothesis. When the solar system formed,

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.650
there were a lot more objects orbiting the
Sun than there are now. These ranged in size

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.400
from grains of dust up to objects the size of planets,
and that meant there were lots of collisions.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.520
No doubt the Earth suffered many such impacts.
But one happened late in Earth’s history,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.740
relatively speaking, roughly 50 million years
after things started to settle down. A Mars-sized

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.640
planet, given the unofficial name Theia, slammed
into our young planet, but it wasn’t a head-on

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.800
impact; it was a grazing collision.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.310
The impact was colossal, blasting a huge amount
of material from both planets into space.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.860
Most of it came from the outer layers of the
Earth, since the collision was a grazing one.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.580
This material rapidly coalesced into the Moon,
and that explains why there’s some but not

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.030
total similarity in composition to Earth;
it used to be part of the Earth. But some

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.270
of it came from the other planet, too. And
we may even have some evidence of it; some

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.240
rocks from the Moon show a peculiar ratio
of different kinds of oxygen atoms, called

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.340
isotopes. It’s possible some of the more exotic
isotopes of oxygen came from the other planet.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.480
Actually, this idea has been around for a
long time, ever since the Apollo missions

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.620
in the 1970s. There’s a lot of evidence to support
 it, too. But a new twist on it goes farther.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.680
When the Moon formed from the debris of the
collision, it was close to Earth, probably

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.440
20,000 kilometers away. The collision was
so violent that it completely melted the Earth,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.800
and the Moon was molten too. Tidal forces
rapidly synchronized the Moon’s spin and

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.270
orbital period, so that one face always pointed
toward Earth. If you were on that side of

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.229
the Moon, the Earth would dominate the sky, appearing
80 times larger than the Moon appears in our sky today.

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.949
And the Earth was hot. It hung there like
blast furnace, and would’ve seriously heated

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.400
the near side of the Moon. The far side would’ve
been much cooler. The material on the near

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.250
side would’ve vaporized, and a lot of it
would have condensed on the far side. Over

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.470
time, this created the thicker far side crust
we see today.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.020
Then there was another seriously terrifying
event: the Late Heavy Bombardment, a period

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.819
of intense collisions with comets from the
outer solar system, probably triggered by

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:54.110
the movement of outer planets. This rain of
millions of comets left scars on all the inner

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.030
worlds, including the Moon. That’s when
most of the highland cratering occurred.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.699
Some of these collisions were massive, carving
gigantic craters on the Moon. Later, lava

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.959
bubbled up through cracks in the Moon’s surface,
flooding these craters, creating the maria we see today.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.310
Ah, but the far side’s crust was thicker.
Impacts there couldn't get as deep, and it

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.340
was harder for lava to break through and bubble
up. That explains why there are so few maria there.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.259
This idea that the Earth cooked the Moon and
formed the crustal anomaly is pretty new,

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.300
and is still being argued over. There are
also competing hypotheses about this, as well.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.199
As we gather more evidence, we’ll eventually
get a better understanding of just why the

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:31.639
Moon’s crust is so weird.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.530
After all that, I have to say: it’s a little
unfair to divide the lunar surface today into

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.699
just highlands and maria. For example, craters
are pretty diverse. Some are small and simple

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:47.800
bowl shapes. Others are huge, dozens of kilometers
across and more, punctuated with a central

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.479
peak, a mountain in the middle that formed
as material from the gigantic impact that

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.970
formed it splashed back up in the middle.
Double craters are common too, probably formed

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.949
when binary asteroids hit the Moon. There
are also crater chains: long lines of small

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:06.340
craters that may have formed when a nearby large
impact splashed out long streamers of material.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.540
Rays are common from big craters, too. These
are extremely long “splash marks” pointing

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.979
radially out from the impacts, probably formed
when plumes of material were ejected. Some

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:19.789
of the brightest are from the crater Tycho
in the Moon’s southern hemisphere, and they

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:24.580
stretch for 1500 kilometers. The material
is a bit more reflective than the surrounding

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.039
terrain, so they appear bright in contrast,
and are one of the most outstanding features

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:30.879
visible near the time of the full Moon.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:36.039
And there’s so much more! Long, sinuous
rilles like dry river beds wind their way

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:40.859
across the surface, actually the sites of
ancient lava flows. There are lava tubes as

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.060
well, where the top of a lava flow cooled
and formed a tunnel through which lava could

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.500
flow for long distances. Sometimes the roof,
as it’s called, collapses and forms a skylight,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.719
and we can see into the otherwise hidden tunnel.

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:58.319
There are also cliffs, mounds, ancient and
quite dead volcanoes, even mountain chains!

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:02.219
There’s no tectonic activity on the Moon,
but mountain ranges formed at the edges of

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:07.250
giant impacts, where the huge forces unleashed
pushed up the rocks at the crater rim.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.930
And new observations show there’s something
else on the Moon, too: Water. Deep craters

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.479
near the Moon’s poles have floors that never
see sunlight. Comet impacts can distribute

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:20.520
water all over the Moon, but most of it is
destroyed by sunlight. But it can collect

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.259
in these dark craters, and studies show there
could be over a billion tons of water there

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:30.610
in the form of ice. That would be a huge boon
to colonization; water is heavy and really

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.920
expensive to transport from Earth. If it’s already on
the Moon, that makes it a lot easier to put people there.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.520
And that’s in our future, I have no doubt.
We’re starting to get serious about going

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.960
back to the Moon; NASA has plans of returning,
and other countries like China and India are

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.120
looking Moonward as well. It’s not a matter
of if, but when. And it could be soon - so

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.420
soon that, I’d bet, there’s a really good
chance the next person to step foot on the

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.400
Moon is already alive. Perhaps some teenage
student in some country is just now taking

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.840
an interest in science, math, engineering
- an interest that will one day will lead

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.800
to another giant leap for humanity.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.040
Today you learned that the capital-M Moon
is a lower-case-m-moon. It’s big compared

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:15.400
to Earth, and is thought to have formed when
a small planet impacted Earth at a grazing

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.740
angle. It’s heavily cratered, and has huge
flood plains on it called maria. There’s

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.300
water there, too, just waiting for us to thaw
it out and drink it.
