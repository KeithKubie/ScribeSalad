00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.469
So you see up here, it says we're
viewing data for all sessions.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.400
A session indicates a period of
continuous use for your app,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.690
and it's a key concept
in Google Analytics.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.030
So if you use your app for
awhile, say for a few minutes,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.930
and then you put it down, let's say

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.090
looking at dinner suggestions makes
you hungry so you go get an ice cream.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.560
And then you eat your ice cream.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.420
It takes you about ten minutes.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.440
And then you go back to your app.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.160
And let's say you've been away
from the app for ten minutes.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.180
So when you go back to the app,
you're actually in the same session.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.380
It's all been considered
one continuous session

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.120
because it's been less than
30 minutes of continuous use.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.590
Even though you actually stopped
using it for ten minutes.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.680
But let's suppose now that
you take a longer break.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.910
And you go for a much bigger ice-cream.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.080
This is going to take you longer to eat.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.110
But, again, even though you ate the
whole ice cream, you're still hungry so

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.760
you're going to go back to your app.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.330
Now, let's say you were gone from
your app this time for 31 minutes.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.870
In this case, when you go back to
the app, you're going to be in a new

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.560
session, because the default period
of time for a session is 30 minutes.
