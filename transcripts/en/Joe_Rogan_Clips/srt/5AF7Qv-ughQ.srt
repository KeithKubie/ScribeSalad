1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,590
Happen. The Joe Rogan
experience. Yeah, it's,

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:06,780
it's tragic.
The things the words are going to do.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,630
I was going to be in the military
when I was a kid. That was one of my,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,950
I want to be in special forces.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,720
And Are you looking at me now being a
transgender guy with that? But yeah,

6
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:16,351
that was where it was.

7
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:20,880
I know Trump wouldn't have let me in the
post is right now if I applied to write

8
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:25,000
the second. Um, but yeah,
so I follow everything. I,

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,280
I kind of run my life on, on the
military and that sounds a bit weird.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,590
I run my career on a military thinks
it's quite difficult to, you know,

11
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,110
any career, putting it together.
Kind of weird. What's your next move?

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,160
What's you'll you like strategize and that
yell? Yeah, strategy up. That was due.

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,490
I planned 50 years ahead. Really? Oh yeah.
Well if you think about it, you came out,

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,320
I came out as transgender 34 years ago.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,640
That's not the first good thing that an
agent wants to hear. Your transgender,

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,200
that's 85. This is such a hot thing.
This is even now, they would say, okay,

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,980
well it's got a little better than
it was for five, 10 millennia.

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,260
This a little better now. But it's still
not the hardest ticket that everyone's,

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,440
we welcome transgender guys in
here for this, that the other,

20
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,610
it's not the top of the list.

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,830
And I've also got boy mode and girl mode
and I do drama dramatic films in boy

22
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:11,080
mode.

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,000
And then I'm touring and Gilman and doing
standup and I campaign for politics in

24
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:17,460
go mode and I just,
how do we do that?

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,290
I just switched change, you
know, take off heels, flat shoes.

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,850
Yeah, because if you were
just talking, like if you,

27
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:29,490
you didn't have makeup on and he
didn't have the heels and the nails,

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,290
you just seem male. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, it's a, it's,

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,550
I think it's genetically and
built, you know, there's some,

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,320
I think there's quite a lot
of people maybe who were, um,

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,090
uh, the, the way that light, they live
their lives live their own personality.

32
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:49,890
They're not particularly male
or female, I feel. But I felt,

33
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:53,430
I've always felt since I was four or five,
I want to express this side of myself.

34
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:56,670
And it's built in. I
think it's genetic. Um,

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,890
and if you analyze masculine and feminine,
if you really get down to it, you see,

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,600
I, I find it impossible to come up with
anything that was particularly masculine,

37
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,473
particularly feminine,

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,800
except for the ability to build muscle
mass is easier for men in inverted

39
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,860
commerce. That's it. But you know,
great football is soccer players,

40
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:16,710
men and women in athletics, runners,
men, women, strong character,

41
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:21,570
men's wheat character. Sure. Men
and women, um, mathematicians,

42
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:25,080
whatever, whatever it is, there's
nothing that you can really say, ah,

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,890
that is earning good shot with a gun.
No. Anyone could do that. It's a,

44
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,630
we're all humans and so, and we get
fixated by the masculine feminine wisdom.

45
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,020
It's a tiger tiger attacking you and
trying to kill you. You don't go,

46
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:39,660
now is this a girl to girl, boy
tech? We don't care about it.

47
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,430
And they don't care either the Tigers.

48
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,460
So you've always felt like you gravitated
towards feminine things toward no,

49
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,890
gravitate towards both. I had, I
gravitated towards playing soccer.

50
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:52,290
I was in the first team for
two years when I was a kid,

51
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,460
was planning to do officer training corps
and then go marines or Paris and then

52
00:02:56,461 --> 00:03:00,670
get into special forces RSAs which be
the equivalent of your Delta Force.

53
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,770
Um, and that was a distinct pleasure and
you're a lot about that. And I thought,

54
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:07,960
which war they're going to send me to
actually which one they sent me to it and

55
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:10,510
it could be the idiots that I'm at
school with or send me to the wrong war.

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,350
World War Two was very clear.
And then after that, every
other words kind of hazy.

57
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,750
Uh, but there's all this
feminine side girls' side.

58
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,950
I'm not sure how to do it. The, the
articulate, even after 34 years,

59
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,510
it's difficult to articulate,
but I wanted to express that. Um,

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,500
and if I look more like a woman than I,
you know, it would be much easier. But,

61
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:37,280
um, yeah. So I decided to do that in
85 when it wasn't cool. And I go, man,

62
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,180
I've had a lot of fights in the street.
A lot of people screaming abuse at me.

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,350
I'm taking a couple of people to
court or just report it and police.

64
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:48,190
And then we went to court
and uh, yeah, and you fight,

65
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:51,550
you fight your fights instead of
going to do a military fighting thing.

66
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:56,200
I've done, I've done, I said, this
might be wrong for me to say this,

67
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:00,260
but I say I've done special forces,
civilian division, you know,

68
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,850
fighting people's to skew that people
see and outperforming four languages.

69
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:08,050
I've run over 80 marathons. I'm going
into politics next year. And uh,

70
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,950
and yeah,
and I came and the transgender thing is,

71
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,190
it's in a better place
than it was back in 85.

72
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,651
Well,

73
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:20,651
it certainly now I think because of
probably Caitlyn Jenner and the movement

74
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,700
that you're,
you're seeing for,

75
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:25,970
to accept people that want to do
whatever and anything you want to do.

76
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,130
Yeah, it is. We're more accepting
of each other. We do see three more.

77
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,680
Um,
what's the word?

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,630
Begins with a t the more open,
more allowing. There's a welfare.

79
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,620
It was just walked out of my
head. But anyone that would, um,

80
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,040
but uh,
yeah,

81
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,460
and at the same time people are getting
around doing more killings and stuff at

82
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:50,500
the say well there's more people.

83
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,190
There's just sheer volume of humans
at the end. The population growth is,

84
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,890
and saying this took us something like
200,000 years to get to 1 million and

85
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,230
then it's taking this and our six 50
years to get to seven and a half billion,

86
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,543
which is scary.

87
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,510
Yeah.
When I was a kid,

88
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,870
I think the United States population
was less than 200 million.

89
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,370
Now it's 300 million
global was whatever it was.

90
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,890
Now it's seven plus bordering eight.

91
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,380
Yeah. Several often people when
I came out, I think it was 6.5,

92
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,480
I think that's just running away.

93
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:26,480
And one of the weird things
is if we are having less wars,

94
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:30,650
if we're getting better health to people,
then more kids are around.

95
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:34,610
And some people in, in, in I suppose lower
income backgrounds in around the world,

96
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:38,090
they will say, well we need
to have six kids. Cause that's
what, you know from, uh,

97
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,560
from water much money. Yeah. That's
what we do. But as economics get better,

98
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:45,320
people have less kids in that.
Hopefully that should calm down.

99
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:47,060
There should be a butting me.

100
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,640
I think they feel that it'd be a
leveling off of the population,

101
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,070
the theory that they believe that
industrialized nations and Westernized

102
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,490
Society, when people start
having two careers, um,

103
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,590
you know,
and then two career households,

104
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,670
people are less likely to have a bunch
of kids. Yeah. So as people do better,

105
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:09,430
they have less kids. Yeah.
Yeah. So I'm, I'm a guy. I,

106
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,900
I'm a glass glasses.
Two thirds full person.

107
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,130
That's real actually instead of a
glass is half full, half empty person.

108
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,780
So you're optimistic.
I'm a big,

109
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,170
I couldn't be here in
the hills with the nails.

110
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,770
I'm planning to do this
and got a film coming out.

111
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,500
Then I'm touring the country and
then I'm going to politics as well.

112
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
When you first started wearing women's
clothes and dresses and makeup on stage,

113
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:35,630
did people think it was a gimmick?
What did they think they did?

114
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,180
I decided not to go on
women's clothes just,

115
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,990
and I should say that family and close, I
would just wear dresses. Right. You know,

116
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,790
like women can wear trousers or pants on.
We used to call the high men's pants.

117
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,480
That pan is faggot. So,
um, but yeah, they felt,

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,450
I first started talking about it
and not wearing anything. Again.

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,060
Look kind of boy like and male like,

120
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:58,580
and then you were talking about
it like I had the first check.

121
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,370
This is my first ever joke. I had this
about two years before I did it. I said,

122
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,720
look, you don't stand up. Um,
so if you're from a minority,

123
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:08,890
it's kind of a good thing.
So if you, in standup terms,

124
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:13,280
so if you're from a low ink, come back
round, you'd say, rich people, God,

125
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,760
they're so easy for them to
show or what music man. Ah, man,

126
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,580
if you're an ethnic background,
you say white papers. Oh, I bet.

127
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,060
So if you're a white male,
middle class, stand up. Useless.

128
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,680
So thank God I'm a transvestite.
That was my first love.

129
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,610
And everyone thought he's making jokes
about something that he's not and they

130
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,170
wouldn't believe.
Me and journalists were going,

131
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,620
I don't know why he's doing this
because he's doing pretty well now,

132
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:40,460
but there's this idea, is this a joke?
So I thought I better wear addresses,

133
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,400
you know, put your makeup on. And
then they said, okay, he's doing this.

134
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:45,290
He is serious but he looks a mess

135
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,690
kind of baby elephant thing I was doing
okay gotta get your weight under control.

136
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:53,660
You could have better haircut than
that and you just got to fail a lot.

137
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,950
And there's a humiliation period.

138
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:58,730
I mean this is the weird thing about
coming out that it's kind of humiliating.

139
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:02,260
People say you look at people say
horrible things. What they say, uh,

140
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,650
what the fuck is that?

141
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,920
Somebody said to my face right there
as I was walking out of a restaurant,

142
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,060
so I thought that's not very nice. And
you have to be able to deflect it and go,

143
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:15,170
well you're obviously a scumbag,
so fuck you man. So I mostly men,

144
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,110
yes, and occasionally women,
k occasionally women. But
yeah, I mean, you know,

145
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:24,590
it's low. If people have low, lower
character, they are less a character.

146
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,140
She's a strong character in yourself.
You don't get live in that live.

147
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,840
What the hell? You know people, okay.
It doesn't look quite look together,

148
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:33,860
but you know, life's tough enough. But
if, if you want to put someone down,

149
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,680
you raise your own status by
doing it and they will do that.

150
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:40,280
And so I have stood in the street
and people have unloaded, you know,

151
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:44,300
swear words ineffective to me and I've
just, I rung you and the violin and viola,

152
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:49,210
they got what you'll fuck?
Oh fuck you. And among, and
there's literally, you know,

153
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,820
two or three of them or one of me just
screaming at each other and I just won't

154
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:55,920
back down. Now that this happened
recently, it was nine months ago,

155
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:59,610
someone outside my house in, in
London, just having a go at me.

156
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:03,320
So he knew who you are as well. They
did. They knew exactly what they knew.

157
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:08,040
Who I live with it we're going to do, your
house is on the hell. Is this awesome?

158
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,030
And I want to speak because of
the way you dress. Well it was,

159
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,330
he added that into it. There was
a, there was a altercation over,

160
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,810
I was just packing my car cause I was
just driving home to see my dad and

161
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:21,680
somebody said, you gotta give me
a ride in your car. I said, oh,

162
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,440
am I someone heckles me like that in
the street. I just come back with,

163
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,290
you will never have a ride in my car.
I have to give you one African.

164
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,300
So that happened. And then this guy
went off and yeah, this and that.

165
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,110
And the other one is just screaming at me.
And so I'm shouting back at him,

166
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,300
giving him word for word. And then I went,
I said, who is that idiot? And they said,

167
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,510
oh, that's this guy. He's a known, ah,
he's a nutter, you know, he's just,

168
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,310
he does this. I went, all right,

169
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,660
maybe I should mention it because
he said he's going to do my og.

170
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,060
I mentioned it to the police
two weeks later. Same thing.

171
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,510
Who's shouting at me? Oh, it's
the same decade. So I felt right.

172
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:00,270
Next time I go by now, he knows
where you live. Well, he always did.

173
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,270
He was right in front of the house.
That's always fun, isn't it? Yeah. Well,

174
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,690
and he said, we're going to do your
house when you're away, you know?

175
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,360
So this was the, that was
his opening gambit. Do your
house when you're away. Yeah.

176
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm letting the, letting you know
there are a coward. Yeah. Well it was,

177
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,030
it was a very positive, he didn't run
a PR company. That's kind of terrorism,

178
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,580
right? They're trying to strike terror
in you when you're away. Well, yeah.

179
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,020
Well that is, yes. That
is the hatred thing is,

180
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,290
did you think about just going out
there and fucking them up? I don't,

181
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:28,921
they don't quite,

182
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,390
that I would have liked if I've gone
through the military thing of a Gulf,

183
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:34,200
that I would learn how to do that,
you know?

184
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:39,201
And I've never have craft my God myself
up to the thing I do need to grab my gun

185
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:42,380
was half out,
but I haven't got there.
