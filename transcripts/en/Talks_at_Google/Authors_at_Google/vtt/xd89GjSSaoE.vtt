[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:05.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.470
SPEAKER 1: With that very
humbling introduction

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.330
let's get a round of
applause for Bobby Braun.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.720
BOBBY BRAUN: Wow.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.980
I'd like to meet that guy.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.320
He sounds really impressive.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.520
Thank you.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.670
First of all, thanks to
Google for hosting all of us

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.100
here today.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.840
The campus that you're building
here in Boulder is beautiful.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.170
And we're all very happy
to have you in our city

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.380
and in our state.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.240
As was said, my
name is Bobby Braun.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.190
And I'm the dean of the
College of Engineering

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.580
and Applied Science at the
University of Colorado Boulder.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.090
We are among the fastest
growing engineering colleges,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.300
and we're actually one of
the most diverse colleges

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.070
of engineering in the country.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.890
And that's something that we're
really proud about because it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.880
allows us to reach out and
partner more with industry

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.420
in our state, including Google.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.790
I'm a Mars guy.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.170
I guess, maybe, a
Martian in my blood.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.450
And I've worked on a
number of NASA missions.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.400
And typically, I work with
engineers and scientists

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.430
on what it's like to build
and send spacecraft to Mars.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.630
But today I'm here with a really
interesting group of people,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.260
people who I've had
the pleasure to work

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.190
with for a number of years now
in what's been a groundbreaking

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.410
television series
put on by National

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.930
Geographic with executive
producers Ron Howard and Brian

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.530
Grazer.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.050
And I got to tell you,
working with these people,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.690
it's been like a family.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.930
And for me as an engineer,
perhaps the best thing

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.742
has been working with--

00:01:47.742 --> 00:01:48.825
not with other engineers--

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:49.325
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:53.175
--but with artists
and film studies

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:58.170
folks, actors, writers,
and big thinkers

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
from across the spectrum
that have been part

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.230
of this innovative docudrama.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.560
How many of you have seen any
of the episodes, season one

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.669
or season two?

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:10.759
That's a good number.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.100
It's a good number.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.380
Season two is
going on right now.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.260
We just last night-- episode
four was premiered on Nat Geo.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.890
They're showing on
Monday nights, 9:00 PM.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.300
You can catch up with those.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.645
And you can actually
see episode five and six

00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:30.460
that have yet to come out.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.460
Tonight on our
campus at CU Boulder,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.860
we'll be premiering
episode five.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.940
You can see it on campus a
week before it will actually

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.280
be shown worldwide.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.200
So that's what we're
all here today.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.600
We're here for this
event, and then

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.420
for this evening's
event in Boulder.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.790
I'm here today
joined with a number

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.860
of the members of the show
in various capacities.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.720
Going from my--
going down this way--

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.774
I always mess that up.

00:03:03.774 --> 00:03:04.940
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Your left.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.350
BOBBY BRAUN: Well, it's my left.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.350
But it's their right.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.940
Let's do it that way.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.210
The person who corrects
me the most in my life

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.600
is actually Stephen
Petranek, who over the years

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.220
has been a great friend.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.220
Stephen is a co-executive
producer of the series.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.180
And in fact, the series
is based on a book

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.230
that Stephen wrote years ago
about how we will actually live

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.900
and settle the planet Mars.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.760
He's really the creative
genius behind the whole series,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.920
if you will, through his book.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.780
And it's wonderful to have
you here in Boulder today.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.740
Next to him is
Antonia Juhasz, who

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.420
is an expert in oil
and energy policy

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.990
and has written numerous papers
and given numerous forums

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.670
on those topics.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.300
In this series,
she's a big thinker.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.910
So this is a series, right,
that goes back and forth

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.830
between the present
and the future, right?

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.280
So we talk about what's
happening in our world today,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.010
and then we flash
forward from that

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.090
into how that might portray
into a human settlement of Mars

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.310
in the future.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.130
Antonia has been wonderful
in providing insights

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.680
about climate and
energy and policy,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.280
international policy
issues here on the Earth

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.530
and how those might--
those same kind of issues

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.850
might play out on Mars.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.830
And then next to her is actually
an award-winning writer,

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.420
Leonard David.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.760
Who, if you're in the space
community like I am, Leonard

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.410
needs no introductions.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.230
But Leonard has
written a book that

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.490
is a companion book to the
National Geographic series.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.110
If you're interested, you can
pick one up on the back table

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.560
there.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.640
But Leonard's book is a great
companion to the series.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.730
It provides wonderful
context about past, present,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.180
and future Mars exploration.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.650
And so we're here today.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.191
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:08.050
to watch the trailer
from season one,

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.480
just to bring you up to
speed about what happened

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.700
two years ago during season one,
which took place in the 2030s.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.670
Then we're going to show
the trailer for season two.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.620
Before I do, there's
two other folks

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.200
I definitely want to
introduce very quickly--

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.900
in the audience, who will be
speaking tonight on campus.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.860
And they're actors in
the Nat Geo series.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.260
And that's Sammi Rotibi--

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.910
maybe, Sammi, you
want to stand up--

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.221
--and Evan Hall.

00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:39.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.750
And as someone who's
consulted on the show

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.760
and worked with
some of the writers

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.470
and actors in the
production of the show,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.160
you know, they've
been fantastic.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.420
These guys-- it's just
their roles are so--

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.330
it's amazing how well they've
suited into these roles.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.680
I know they each have an
engineering background,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.180
and you know, you have
multiple engineering degrees

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.150
from CU Boulder.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.810
I'm just kidding.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.970
But from watching
you all on the show,

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.870
I mean, one would
think that you did.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.996
And it's actually amazing.

00:06:14.996 --> 00:06:17.162
SPEAKER 2: I spoke to you
before the season started.

00:06:17.162 --> 00:06:17.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.269
BOBBY BRAUN: Yeah.

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:20.810
So it's been a lot
of back and forth,

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.036
getting ready to do that.

00:06:22.036 --> 00:06:23.410
But that's what's
made this show,

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.060
I think, so unique is that it's
a scientifically honest show.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.300
It's a scientifically
accurate portrayal

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.910
of what the future
might look like

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.010
based on what's happening
right now in space exploration.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.920
So what we do is
jump into the clips.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.410
The first-- this is season one.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.076
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:47.560
- Mars will be risky, dangerous.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.812
But it'll be the greatest
adventure ever, ever

00:06:50.812 --> 00:06:51.520
in human history.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.140
- Funny thing about Mars--

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.860
it feels like Earth.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.494
But it is more hostile to
life than any place on Earth.

00:07:00.494 --> 00:07:00.993
- Ignition.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.970
- In the absence of gravity,
lots of things can go wrong.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:10.720
- It's an unknown.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.290
And you're basically allowing
yourself to be an experiment.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.160
- We're coming in too fast.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.640
- Warning-- landing hazard.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.526
- [INAUDIBLE] just firing.

00:07:20.526 --> 00:07:23.358
- Hang on!

00:07:23.358 --> 00:07:23.858
- Ben?

00:07:23.858 --> 00:07:26.250
Can you hear me?

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.960
- The question is, will
you be able to survive

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.000
during this crucial
time of arrival?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.410
- Ben, we're losing him.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.856
We're losing him!

00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:39.040
- These people are
putting their bodies

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.240
at risk for us,
for the human race.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.000
- When we get to Mars, we need
protection from radiation.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.050
- Unmanned aerial vehicle ready.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.290
- We'll use a fleet of
drones to find a lava

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.060
tube with the conditions
we need to deploy

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.267
a small domed habitat.

00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:54.850
- And that little
foothold will become

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.990
humankind's first real
home beyond the gravity

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.080
well, Olympus Town.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.270
- If I push this
modification any farther,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.860
we risk overloading the
entire electrical system.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.840
- We don't have
a choice, Robert.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.780
- Fire!

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.130
- What did you do?

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.070
[SCREAMS]

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.870
- If the topography is
right and the ice is there,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.400
we can justify deployment.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.159
- I hope you're not
scared of the dark.

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:21.910
[LAUGHS]

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.580
- If there was water on
Mars, couldn't there possibly

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.890
be life?

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.055
- There's [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:30.055 --> 00:08:32.950
We're home.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.220
- Medical lab is
now operational.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.059
- The greenhouse is complete.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:40.059
- We at MMC feel that
we're ready to go faster.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:44.049
Phase two expansion will be
overseen by the very best.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.460
Our dream is now a reality.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.527
- They don't know Mars.

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:50.110
You guys up for a
welcoming committee?

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.997
Base commander, Hana Seung.

00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:53.830
- Within two months,
we'll have enough power

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.404
to double the size and
capacity of your facilities.

00:08:56.404 --> 00:08:58.070
- It's a little too
ambitious right now.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.010
- You don't go to
Mars without ambition.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.093
- I don't think we're going
to get a chance to get

00:09:02.093 --> 00:09:05.230
that reactor back online.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.780
- If you got a dust storm
that lasted for a month,

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.010
you'd be in big trouble.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.830
- This storm has been
raging for months.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.542
They call it a season.

00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:14.800
- I can't do my job.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.846
- Who is going to have
a real problem in space?

00:09:16.846 --> 00:09:18.220
Ultimately, there
are some people

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.150
who are going to have
a really hard time.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.380
- The swarm is
getting to everyone.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.860
Are you missing home?

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.590
- I'm OK.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.820
- He lives for his work.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.198
And he can't do it.

00:09:28.198 --> 00:09:28.876
Darling?

00:09:28.876 --> 00:09:30.785
- This is Paul Richardson.

00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:32.000
- What is he doing?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.028
- Greenhouse air
lock compromised.

00:09:34.028 --> 00:09:34.694
- Seal the door!

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.940
- As we buried our friends,
the fate of the mission

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.980
was back on Earth.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.040
- If you send astronauts
to Mars and they die there,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.974
public opinion will prohibit
you from ever doing it again.

00:09:52.974 --> 00:09:55.140
- It's a time to be strong,
to make a statement that

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.280
says we're here to stay.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.200
- Seven of the world's
most beloved scientists

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.310
and astronauts are dead.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.268
You're not going to
influence my recommendation

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:02.550
to the committee.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.990
- When we thought it could only
get darker, there was light.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.990
- We have been talking
about life on Mars forever.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.400
- Looks like
[INAUDIBLE] crystal.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.654
Javier and I found something.

00:10:15.654 --> 00:10:18.320
- Just think about what it would
mean if you found a single cell

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.610
microorganism.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:26.170
- Today marks the end of an era
and the beginning of a new one.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.570
- It would be so exciting
to wake up in the morning

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.760
and think that that's
what's happening.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.760
- There is life on Mars.

00:10:40.852 --> 00:10:42.290
- They're here.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.981
- Commander, incoming debris.

00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:44.480
Commander!

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:44.944
Are you OK?

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:45.443
- Get down!

00:10:50.007 --> 00:10:51.465
- I have big plans
for this planet.

00:10:51.465 --> 00:10:53.610
- We're not scientists,
for God's sake.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.580
We're miners.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.622
- With the advancement of
sciences comes industry.

00:10:57.622 --> 00:10:59.580
- We need to hook up your
water and your power.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.080
- Sorry?

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.310
- [INAUDIBLE] says is becoming
irrelevant on your watch.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.730
- Mars, private enterprise--
yes, it's inevitable.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.640
- When we talk about
what we're doing on Mars,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.470
we're really talking
about what we

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.750
think is OK to do
here on this planet.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.710
- What's that saying?

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:15.670
Drill, baby, drill?

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.510
- I myself have struck a
deal with Lukrum Industries.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.050
Give the miners what they want.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.340
- Yes, they're doing a job.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.100
But they also are creating
lives for themselves.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.560
- I came here for the adventure.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.340
- I'm pregnant.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.850
It's not like I planned it.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.350
- No.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.970
You just plan to leave.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.530
- If we go to Mars, you
don't want any surprises.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.170
- If this baby is born on Mars--

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.810
- It could never leave here.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.380
- [INAUDIBLE]
talking [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.840
- Technology and workers
will be pushed faster

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.981
than they should be pushed.

00:11:41.981 --> 00:11:42.730
- Let me help you.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.520
- And those errors have
disastrous consequences.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.540
[SCREAMING]

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.540
- Coexistence may prove
just as challenging

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.790
as it does on Earth.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.890
- Do you see something?

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.480
- Only what we're looking for.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.646
- If you think I'm going
to let you and your company

00:11:56.646 --> 00:11:57.231
[INAUDIBLE]!

00:11:57.231 --> 00:11:58.897
- You're one crazy
bitch, you know that?

00:11:58.897 --> 00:12:00.210
[SMACK]

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.055
- If there's a place
you've never been,

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.180
there's a scientist who
wants to know what's there.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.520
- Companies want access
to new territory.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.190
At the same time, we
have a counter movement

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.740
that says we're not going
down without a fight.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.570
- Mars is for those
willing to accept

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.460
a much higher level of danger.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.934
- Solar flare.

00:12:17.934 --> 00:12:19.350
It's taken out our
electrical grid

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.760
and our entire communications.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.830
She could freeze to
death before we find her.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.520
- We've disrupted
the environment,

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.900
creating new conditions
where diseases can spread.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.250
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.210
- What do we got?

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.430
- Something at the site
has been making them sick.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.750
- Stop the drilling.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.720
- When governments are
hiding an outbreak,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.470
that's when the virus
is actually winning.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.337
- I want to know the truth.

00:12:42.337 --> 00:12:42.920
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.800
- You'd be walking
straight into the source.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.284
- I'm the only one who
knows this science.

00:12:47.284 --> 00:12:48.200
- She's not breathing!

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.164
I need help!

00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:52.130
- He's dead.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.460
- It's my opinion that this
colony requires new leadership.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.230
- Lukrum colony disengaged.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.050
- Olympus Town--
pull the cord or not?

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.450
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.070
- People would lie,
cheat, and steal

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.160
to make sure that the mission
was successful, even if that

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.630
cost a lot of human lives.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.410
- I take orders
from my commander.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.650
- You do your job,
and I'll do mine.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.850
- They've taken advantage
of us at every turn.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.200
And you've let it happen.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.030
- Will we make mistakes on mars?

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.530
Yes.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.720
[SCREAMING]

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.680
- We have nothing
to show for it.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.180
- You see something that
has unimaginable wealth.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.340
And you want to go get it.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.190
- And we're getting water today.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.130
Initiating final prep
before detonation.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.000
- Lukrum's within hours
of reaching water.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.700
- Space exploration is
where we solve problems that

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.050
have never been solved before.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.720
- Are you OK with
what he's doing?

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.424
- Go.

00:13:40.424 --> 00:13:42.844
- I came here to find life.

00:13:42.844 --> 00:13:44.780
But not at the expense of it.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.860
- Nothing is a clean slate.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.246
We impose ourselves
on everything.

00:13:49.246 --> 00:13:52.870
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.959
- The future of humanity is
very much in the solar system.

00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:58.000
What kind of civilizations
are we going to build?

00:14:06.856 --> 00:14:08.830
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.800
BOBBY BRAUN: So what
you saw there was just

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.590
a brief recap of
season one, which

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.460
was all about the
initial settlement,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.640
the scientific undertaking
that that initial settlement

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.200
was about, basic survival
in that settlement.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.500
And then, in season
two, the expansion,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.600
the inevitable expansion as
industry comes in and some

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.360
of the personal challenges
and conflicts that

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.090
arise between science objectives
and industry objectives.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.910
Many of which play out in
this world all the time--

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.590
that we are, you
know, portraying

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.140
in the future on Mars.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:56.650
And so with that as kind of
background, we could start Q&amp;A.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.080
And so I actually have
a question prepared

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.660
for each of the panelists.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:07.000
But you are welcome to
ask questions as well.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.197
I might give you
a little heads up

00:15:09.197 --> 00:15:11.530
that we're going to be asking
the audience for questions

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:12.890
in just a minute.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.810
But let me start--

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.768
we'll just go this way.

00:15:14.768 --> 00:15:17.470
Let me start with you,
Stephen, if that's OK.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.220
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
Depends on the question.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:19.970
BOBBY BRAUN: Yeah.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:20.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.730
We'll talk about
terraforming later.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.969
STEPHEN PETRANEK: All right.

00:15:23.969 --> 00:15:25.510
BOBBY BRAUN: But
let's start out just

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.200
by talking about what
it's like for you

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.700
personally to see this
creation put together

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.610
by this wonderful team of
actors, and writers, producers,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.700
all based on that relatively
small book that you wrote--

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.020
very important,
but small in size--

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.520
book that you wrote.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.520
How does that feel?

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.550
And how do you
think the portrayal

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.689
has gone in terms of accuracy?

00:15:54.689 --> 00:15:56.230
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
Well, I have a mic.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.420
Good.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.830
Well, it was a big shock.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.690
I've been a science
journalist my whole life.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.410
And I've never been
kind of buffered up

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.290
against the Hollywood syndrome.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.770
So when we first got involved
in this project and the book

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.144
was first optioned
by RadicalMedia,

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.810
there were all kinds
of twists and turns

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.020
that were kind of crazy,
like getting SpaceX

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.710
to cooperate with
us, which was a very

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.980
difficult problem initially.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.870
And then, seeing how this
concept of storytelling

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:39.310
was far more important to
anyone on the West Coast

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.190
than the facts were to anyone
on the East Coast, where I was.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.350
So there was kind of this
thing going on between us.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:51.430
And my role quickly became
not just explaining,

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.420
as was Bobby's role,
initially, in the show,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.090
not just explaining
to the filmmaking

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.440
people and the
actors and so forth

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.020
what the real facts
were about being

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.089
on Mars and the kinds of
scenarios you could have

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.005
and you couldn't have.

00:17:05.005 --> 00:17:07.839
For example, I will
never forget a phone call

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.859
from the director
in the first season.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.829
And we were talking about
actually leaving Earth

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.180
and going to Mars and the trip.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.710
And they said, OK,
somebody's gotta die on this.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.799
How are they going to die?

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:22.340
So I gave them,
like, five scenarios.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.020
And my favorite scenario
was that a small meteoroid

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.150
would pass through the rocket.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.740
And they said no,
we don't like that.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.952
And then I gave them a
couple other scenarios.

00:17:31.952 --> 00:17:32.910
No, we don't like that.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.993
And I gave them a couple--

00:17:33.993 --> 00:17:35.150
no, I don't like that.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.830
And it was, like, well,
wait a minute, you know?

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.720
What kind of
scenario do you want?

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.400
And they would
give me one, and I

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.650
would say that isn't
physically possible in space.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:53.800
So initially, there was a lot
of conflict and buffering,

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.300
trying to come up--

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.540
trying to get the people who
wanted to do the storytelling

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.544
and were very good at it to
adapt to the physical realities

00:18:03.544 --> 00:18:04.210
of the universe.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.200
But in the end, it
worked out great.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.930
And one of the things
that really surprised me

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.370
was that both the
actors and the directors

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.410
were really eager to learn.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.829
Like, when I first met the
initial group of actors,

00:18:20.829 --> 00:18:22.620
every single one of
them had read the book.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.000
Some of them had read the
book two or three times.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.920
And the book served
as kind of a primer,

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.530
because it kind of laid
out all the facts of what

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.290
it would be like on Mars, what
it would be like getting there.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.740
What if, you know, it's
very science-based and very

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.760
fact-based.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.630
And they really absorbed that
and wanted to learn that.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.300
So it's been a lot of fun.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.710
And I've learned an awful lot.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.100
You know, I thought, as a
journalist and as a writer

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.300
and as an editor--

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.410
and you know, I used to be
kind of a writer's editor

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.690
who worked with really
long form kind of stories

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.190
that you would--
the kind of stories

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.740
you would see in "The New
Yorker" or "The New York Times

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.510
Sunday Magazine."

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.450
I thought I knew
everything that I was ever

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.290
going to need to know
about storytelling.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:14.970
And this new dimension, which is
visual, taught me an awful lot.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.700
And it taught me an
awful lot about scene

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.390
setting in words, as
well as in visuals

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.340
and carrying
through a storyline.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.960
So I'm very grateful for
the whole experience.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.550
BOBBY BRAUN: Thank you.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.210
Thanks.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:34.365
Antonia, first of all, welcome
back to Boulder, your hometown.

00:19:34.365 --> 00:19:35.615
ANTONIA JUHASZ: I'm from here.

00:19:35.615 --> 00:19:36.410
It's nice to be back.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:36.830
BOBBY BRAUN: That's great.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.090
ANTONIA JUHASZ: Yeah.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.550
BOBBY BRAUN: You play a
extremely important role

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:44.480
in season two as one
of the big thinkers.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.130
And in fact, your
insights in the show,

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.330
you know, personally, I
have found fascinating,

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:55.280
the drilling on Mars, drilling
on Earth kind of parallels

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.610
and challenges in that vein.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.900
Can you talk a little
bit more about how

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.920
you view what we're doing
today, presently, to the Earth

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.510
and on the Earth--

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.645
how you view that playing
out in the future on Mars?

00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:13.520
ANTONIA JUHASZ: Yeah.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.390
It is great to be home.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:15.440
I live in San Francisco now.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.250
But I grew up in Boulder.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.960
So it's really great
to be back here

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.450
and see the brand new campus
and thanks for all of you

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.600
for being here.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.455
So as you saw in the previews,
what's really exciting--

00:20:24.455 --> 00:20:27.080
one of the things that's really
exciting about the show is I do

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.560
think this model is
entirely unique and a just

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.110
revolutionary way of
storytelling-- which

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.780
is the hybrid of the
documentary and the drama.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.640
So they're interlaced,
as you saw.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.560
You've got the dramatic
series in the future on Mars.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.760
And then you have
the documentary.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.510
And you go back and
forth between the two,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.960
and both sets become
characters, in a way.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.782
You want to know, I
think, not only what's

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:51.740
going to happen to the
characters in the drama,

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.930
but what the next big
thinker is going to say.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.670
Because you also become
invested in them,

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.800
because they're carried
through this storyline,

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.940
the documentary
storyline, as well.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.790
But in the first
season, the documentary

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.880
is basically about the
science of getting to Mars.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.370
In the second season,
the documentary

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:13.070
is really about what are
the unforeseen consequences

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.470
that we've treated as
unforeseen consequences

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:20.030
on Earth that have led us to
a devastation of our ability

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.830
to cohabitate with this planet?

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.280
And will we follow
those same failures

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.450
as we go to the next planet?

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.030
And trying to learn
those lessons--

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.250
and that's basically,
from my perspective,

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.100
or at least my role in the
documentary, my role is about--

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.170
is looking at the failure of
resource extraction on Earth

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.410
and will the failure of
resource extraction on Earth

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.380
be carried forward?

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.840
And the failure of resource
extraction on Earth

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.842
is really well-embodied
in oil extraction.

00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:51.800
And so that's sort of
the tool that's followed.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.300
In season two, as
you saw, Greenpeace

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.960
is followed as they
go head to head

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.920
with oil drilling in the
Arctic, with the outcome of oil

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.220
drilling in the Yamal
Peninsula of the Russian Arctic

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.140
and in the drilling platform
in the Norwegian Arctic.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:15.770
And I think what is really some
of the crux of the storyline

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.680
and how I have
summarized the two

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.970
seasons from my own perspective
is the first season is looking

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.390
at will Mars kill the
humans that go there,

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:30.050
and the second season is
will the humans kill Mars.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:34.670
And that is looking at
what's going to happen when

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.960
and if this major
industry comes.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.900
And the depiction of the
industry in Lukrum Industries

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.470
is really incredibly spot
on-- in the way it's written,

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:54.020
in the portrayal of the actors,
in the difficulties they face

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.390
and the decision to--

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:01.760
as Jeff, who's the actor
in the clip, says--

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.815
"drill, baby, drill",
quoting Sarah Palin.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.410
And I think that the
lessons are really

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.930
well-embodied in
both sets of stories.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.940
One of the critical
issues that's

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.000
raised, is there life on Mars--

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.200
one of the big challenges that
happens with oil drilling,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.364
and what one sees over
and over and over again

00:23:23.364 --> 00:23:25.530
with oil drilling, the
history of the last 150 years

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.760
of oil drilling, is the
drilling goes first and only

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.430
afterwards do we
then learn, oh, wait.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.950
There was this really
critical natural resource.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.800
There was this group of
people who lived here.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.230
There are all sorts of
consequences that only get

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.690
thought of as an afterthought.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.470
And one of the best examples
of that in Arctic drilling,

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.890
which I think is a good parallel
to what could happen on Mars,

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.990
is something that seems
really inconsequential,

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.130
and that's phytoplankton.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.050
It just looks like a seaweed.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.820
But it turns out
that phytoplankton,

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.960
if you destroy it--

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.240
it provides 50% of the oxygen
we need to live on the planet.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.010
So treating it as a sort
of inconsequential thing

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.980
is one of the reasons why we're
facing the problem that we're

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.340
facing right now.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.380
And so trying to
learn the lesson,

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:17.220
which is maybe consider
the consequences first,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:24.850
the long-term consequences
first, and just go in--

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:30.727
go in second with the blind
pursuit of the resource.

00:24:30.727 --> 00:24:31.810
BOBBY BRAUN: That's great.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:32.530
Thank you.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.870
Thank you.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:38.860
Leonard, so great for you
to be here today, Leonard.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:46.010
So our interaction dates back
to actual spaceflight missions,

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.510
right?

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:51.330
And I'm typically used to seeing
Leonard David articles written

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.011
about InSight or
about Mars 2020.

00:24:54.011 --> 00:24:56.260
LEONARD DAVID: He's so happy
I spelled his name right.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.411
BOBBY BRAUN: Mars-- all the
way back to Mars Pathfinder

00:24:59.411 --> 00:25:00.600
in the '90s, right?

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.340
So I'm very interested in your
opinion of this show, which

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.920
is a portrayal of
a future mission,

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.550
because I know that you've
very accurately covered

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.607
so many existing missions.

00:25:13.607 --> 00:25:14.940
Can you comment on that briefly?

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.180
LEONARD DAVID: Well, you know,
I think one thing that strikes

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.630
me, the drill, baby, drill
thing-- before I forget--

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.120
that's also a Chris McKay line.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.650
He's a Mars scientist.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:29.040
And he wants to drill
subsurface to look for life.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.970
So it's-- and the
atmosphere is changing.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.090
I love that subtitle.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:41.160
Because this morning I got
up, and I looked at InSight.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.880
We just landed on
Mars a few days ago.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.120
OSIRIS-REx pulls up at
an asteroid yesterday.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.230
The Japanese space agency
has another asteroid mission

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:59.250
that's also on target.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.200
Three people left the
Earth the other day

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.380
to head to the Space Station.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:09.480
SpaceX just hurled out 60-some
satellites out of one rocket

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.100
and then flew the booster back.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.040
And I think that's
atmosphere changing.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.810
I've never seen so much
activity in the last week.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.660
And something's going on here.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.520
And it's not just NASA,
but it's a global effort.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.250
And when you think about
what's coming from Mars,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.010
we have Mars 2020.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:38.020
The NASA super cute
Curiosity Rover--

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.520
that will take off in 2020.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.480
China is going to launch a
Mars mission, a robotic Mars

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.830
mission, same time period.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.828
UAE-- they're going to be
launching a Mars orbiter.

00:26:52.828 --> 00:26:55.960
And it's absolutely
incredible what's happening.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.430
And Mars is-- it's dangerous.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.130
It's destiny, you know, for me.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.390
I've always felt that Mars was--

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:09.310
from a kid, covering
early Mars missions,

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.770
Viking particularly in 1976--

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.450
that was just a thrill.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.470
The first pictures come back.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.050
Of course, you're
looking, you want

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:21.060
to see rabbits running
around out there or whatever.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.830
And I just remember that
one guy, I think it was--

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.080
I can't remember his name now.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.220
But he-- there's rocks!

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.860
They have rocks on Mars!

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.740
OK.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.620
Not quite rabbits, but it
was good enough for me.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.620
But yeah, the future is now.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.750
I just I really--

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.830
honest to God, the
last week and a half,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.780
how many things have happened?

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.750
Unbelievable.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.210
BOBBY BRAUN: It's true.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.250
I mean, it's a whole new era
of space exploration right now.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.290
In the US, it's not only
the government, right?

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.870
There's companies that are
doing things on their own.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.240
It's incredible.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:07.240
So let's see what kind of
questions you all have for us.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.754
Anybody want to go first?

00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:11.420
AUDIENCE: Less of a
technology question,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.010
but I was just curious where you
do the majority of your filming

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:19.230
and how much is CGI versus how
much is actual physical sets?

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.320
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
There's $15 million

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.080
worth of sets in
Budapest right now.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.670
They're all packaged up.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:31.000
They were in a
container building,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
as typical of Hollywood
sets, that you could have

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.110
parked about seven 747s in.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.870
We built the largest
green screen ever

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.590
in the history of movie making
so that we could go to Morocco

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:49.360
and photograph where NASA rovers
are tested because it actually

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.420
looks like and is a lot
like the surface of Mars.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.850
Then project that on the
screen and have the actors

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.490
in front of that screen.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.390
It's kind of remarkable
stuff that they've done.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.940
They built full-size sets.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.090
For the first season when I
was walking through the sets,

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.450
I mean, you really
can begin to think

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.770
you're on Mars in
just a few minutes

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.250
because things are so realistic.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.590
Down to there was
a little container

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:18.200
in a hallway in the sets in
the first season on Mars.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.080
And I picked it up
and looked at it.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.420
And it was this container
that supposedly something

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.040
had been brought to Mars in.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.650
And it had, like, six different
labels on it, you know,

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.557
approved by inspector
such and such in Houston

00:29:30.557 --> 00:29:31.390
and stuff like that.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.340
I mean, down to the level that
the camera would never pick up,

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.170
these sets were so
elaborate and so exacting

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:41.620
because it allows the
actors to get into the role

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.530
and really feel
like they're there.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:48.340
So we unfortunately lost
our spot in Budapest.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.480
Budapest has now become a very
popular place to make movies,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.930
and many movies that you
think are British or American

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.420
are actually made in
Budapest these days.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.420
And we're probably going
to move to Bucharest

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.230
for the next season, if there's
a next season, because it's

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.470
cheaper to make films there.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.600
But it's pretty elaborate
stuff, you know?

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.290
It's the stuff of making
real movies as opposed

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.830
to just a documentary series.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.340
So the investment in this
has been extraordinary.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.827
I think for the first
season, the sets were--

00:30:20.827 --> 00:30:22.660
there were $5 million
dollars worth of sets.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.150
And for the second season,
they added another $10 million

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.010
for the sets.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.230
And the second season,
the sets are just huge

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.680
compared to the first season.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.150
And I think if there's a
third and a fourth season,

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.180
it will grow in that way.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.560
LEONARD DAVID: Who
decides on that?

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.820
How does that happen?

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:40.930
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:42.400
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Vice
presidents at Fox.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.275
ANTONIA JUHASZ: Yeah.

00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:45.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.380
BOBBY BRAUN: There's a
question in the middle there?

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.920
AUDIENCE: So we've been
imagining Mars colonization

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.960
for years and years and years.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.220
Thinking about today, what
things, challenges had we

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.870
anticipated before that we're
now better able to deal with?

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.920
And what new challenges
have we discovered that we

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.590
didn't foresee back then?

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.570
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
That's probably for you.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:08.819
BOBBY BRAUN: Well, I'll start.

00:31:08.819 --> 00:31:10.990
But you can always add in.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:17.170
So I would argue that we've made
great progress in determining

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.270
how to land big things on Mars.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:25.250
So this is an area that I've
worked in most of my career.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:28.990
And if you had asked
me 10 years ago

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.795
how we were going to land humans
on Mars, I would have said,

00:31:31.795 --> 00:31:34.720
you know, I don't know.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.910
There were a lot of ideas
out there 10 years ago

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:37.990
or even 20 years ago.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.630
There were a lot
of cartoon drawings

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.400
that showed how
one might do that.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.080
But none of that
technology had been proven.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.650
And recently, actually
here on the Earth,

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:54.320
we've done a lot to
prove those technologies.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.450
So one example
would be when SpaceX

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.060
returns these first stage
boosters that they've

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.560
done successfully over
30 times now, way up high

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.500
in the atmosphere when they're
bringing that booster back,

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.400
they call out something
called an entry burn.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.070
And that burn takes
place supersonically

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.290
in Mars-relevant conditions.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:18.670
Because you're up
so high, you're

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:23.350
up around 100,000 feet or higher
when that burn takes place.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.540
And what they're
doing is they're

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:30.890
firing their jets in opposite to
the direction of the velocity.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:33.162
So opposing free stream.

00:32:33.162 --> 00:32:34.870
And that's something
that actually people

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.070
have talked about a lot.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.160
But until SpaceX had
a need to do that,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.130
no one had ever done that
in Mars-relevant conditions.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.660
And as I've said,
they've done it--

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.910
for a big piece of
hardware, they've

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:48.614
done it 30 times or
more successfully.

00:32:48.614 --> 00:32:50.530
You don't see that because
it happens so high.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:54.430
You see the booster coming
down right on the drone ship.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.740
And that's exciting, too.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.830
But for those of us that
are focused on Mars,

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:04.570
we care about what happened at
40 kilometers or so altitude.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:06.620
Also, through the
robotic program--

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:11.890
I mean, I started my career
by landing Mars Pathfinder

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.000
on the surface.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.310
It landed a little rover
called Sojourner that

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.610
was about the size of a baby.

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.050
It was 11 kilograms in mass.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.960
And you know, Mars
Science Laboratory is

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.150
the size of a small car, right?

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:28.460
It's a nuclear powered
car with a laser on it.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.890
Right?

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.390
That we landed in 2012--

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.000
and by the way, in
2020, we're going

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.350
to land much more accurately.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.130
We're going to land
basically in a football field

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:44.360
instead of in a 20
kilometer safe zone.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.470
So that kind of
accuracy is required

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.750
to build up a base camp, right?

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.840
In the series, you see that
there have been many landings.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.880
And in order to build
up this base camp

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.300
those many landings have to
happen in close proximity

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.630
to each other to get all
that hardware together.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.390
And that's a technology
that we're improving.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:10.580
I think our ability to
keep people alive, frankly,

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.030
and to keep them safe so that
they can live, play, and work

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.270
in space, both in the
microgravity environment

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.429
of space and on
another planet, has

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.290
been greatly advanced
by what we're

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.230
doing on the International
Space Station today.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.489
Leonard mentioned the three
astronauts that just went.

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:29.300
But they joined three others
that are already there.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:35.060
And we've had people
from our planet in space

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.120
continuously since 2001.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:38.929
Think about that.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:43.880
Not the same people,
but I mean, that's

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.880
a remarkable achievement
for our planet.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.400
And it's not just
Americans, right?

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.940
There are international
astronauts included in that.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.489
And to think that we've
lived off of our world

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.610
continuously, some
small subset of us

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:04.190
have done so continuously
and safely since 2001,

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:07.160
that tells you something about
the reliability of the system

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.520
the crew systems needed
to keep people safe,

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.700
about food processing, about
water processing, radiation

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.810
shielding.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.450
All of the kinds of
technologies that you see

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:21.286
played out in this series,
they're happening today.

00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:23.035
And then the last piece
that I'll mention,

00:35:23.035 --> 00:35:24.620
and I'll see if you
want to add to that--

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.010
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Correct.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.390
BOBBY BRAUN: --is really--

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:30.290
correct-- is just the
advancement of industry,

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.240
frankly, in this country.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.490
It's one thing
for our government

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.570
to be talking about sending
humans back to the moon.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:42.320
It's a great, exciting
thing to repeat

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:46.260
something like the Apollo
missions from the 1960s.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.030
It would be a fantastic
achievement for our country.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:53.270
But what really impresses
me and gets me going,

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:57.260
gets my juices going, is
the industry capabilities

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.290
in this country at
places like SpaceX,

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:04.580
or you know, right here in
Colorado at Lockheed Martin,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.500
or what's going on with Blue
Origin or Virgin Galactic,

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.800
all of these companies
that are on their own

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.590
contributing to
the space economy.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:19.790
Planet Labs, that is
basically building

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:23.950
almost a real-time
Google Earth, right?

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:27.110
You know, it's remarkable
what's happening in space today.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:32.240
And I think that capability is
required for us to efficiently

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.405
and cost effectively go to Mars.

00:36:36.405 --> 00:36:38.780
STEPHEN PETRANEK: I think from
a technical point of view,

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.120
one of the most interesting
things about going to Mars

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.660
is that most of the technology
that you needed to do this

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.120
has been available
for at least 30 years.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.350
I'd like to say 40 years,
but probably 30 years.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.230
There's a device on the
new Curiosity rover that's

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.980
going up in 2020 called MOXIE
that will split the carbon

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.400
atom off the CO2
atmosphere of Mars

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:07.190
and create enough oxygen for
one human being to breathe

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.630
consistently, for example.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.570
That machine is
supposed to be scaled,

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.180
is designed to be scaled
up by a factor of 100.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.790
I think NASA originally
wanted that machine

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.120
so that they could have
an oxidizer on Mars

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.889
to make rocket fuel for a
return trip in the future.

00:37:23.889 --> 00:37:25.430
But in fact, that
machine is probably

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.380
going to turn out to
be the machine that

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.459
makes the oxygen that people
need to breathe on Mars.

00:37:30.459 --> 00:37:32.000
I'm not quite sure
what they're going

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.440
to use for the rest of the
inert gas, the other 78%.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.610
That is still a
technical problem.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.110
But what's amazing
is that all this

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:46.040
stuff-- you know, we made this
decision to stay in Earth orbit

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.377
a long, long time ago, as
the Apollo program was coming

00:37:49.377 --> 00:37:51.710
to an end and we decided to
build a space shuttle, which

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.360
is supposed to be
cheap and reusable

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.770
and turned out to cost about
over a billion for each flight.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.470
And we have not
kind of reached out

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.480
and extended what
we're capable of doing.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.210
We haven't gone back
to the moon, which I

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.501
think would be kind of a waste.

00:38:06.501 --> 00:38:09.680
But we haven't taken
a bold step like we

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.770
did in the Apollo
program and decided

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.780
to let's just go to Mars.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.400
And yet we've had
this capability

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.470
to do this for so long.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:21.080
And to touch on one other thing
that both Leonard and Bobby

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.340
have touched on.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.260
Space is the next big business.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:27.950
It isn't an accident that you
see all these things happening

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.640
in the last week or so.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.580
The Russians have
committed to going to Mars

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.930
and putting a human on Mars.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.990
The Chinese have committed
to putting a human on Mars.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:38.400
Both the Russians
and the Chinese

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.210
have committed to put
humans on the moon again.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.750
NASA has committed just recently
to putting humans on the moon

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.220
again.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:51.060
And yet, as Bobby says, there
are all these private companies

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.800
that could actually
do it maybe even

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.930
before any of these
governments could do it,

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:58.050
companies like SpaceX, which
actually intend to do it

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.040
before a government does it.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.460
This is the next big business.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:07.680
Lassoing the SLS launch
system and the Orion capsule

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.530
that NASA has built, one
of the original things

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.270
they wanted to do
with that literally

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.300
was to go out and find a
near-Earth asteroid and lasso

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.420
it and bring it back and put
it in orbit around the moon

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.780
so that commercial companies
could practice mining it.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:22.770
That's real!

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.960
That's real technology
that we have now

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.600
that we're capable of doing.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.920
It's just going to be mind
blowing how this stuff expands.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.150
And it's expanding a lot because
of the commercial aspects

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.900
of space.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.519
It's really going to
be a big business.

00:39:39.519 --> 00:39:42.060
ANTONIA JUHASZ: I think that's
the perfect place to chime in.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.660
I think that what is
happening very rapidly

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:51.210
is the movement towards securing
ownership of resources, who's

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.800
going to own the resources.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.130
And the only existing
international architecture

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.572
was the moon treaty--

00:39:58.572 --> 00:40:00.030
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
'67 space treaty.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.490
ANTONIA JUHASZ: Outer
space 1967 treaty.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.016
And the goal was to not
have a militarized space.

00:40:05.016 --> 00:40:06.390
That was the goal
of that treaty.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:07.860
It was a peace treaty.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.080
Now it's being written,
our attempts-- there's

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.910
already national
legislation that's

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.980
happened in the United
States and other attempts

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.340
that are being written
to define ownership

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.740
of what you would mine
in space, who owns it,

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.109
who gets to profit from it.

00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:22.650
And that's all being
driven right now

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.320
by private companies, period.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.630
And that is a
similar model, which

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:31.110
is will the private companies
gain ownership of asteroids

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.870
and the rights to mine
asteroids and other planets

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.060
and what they get there
and how they do it?

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:40.230
And will a regulatory regime
only catch up afterwards,

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.530
after it's happening?

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:44.100
And if that happens, are
the unintended consequences

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.490
of mining asteroids
being thought

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:50.460
through by the people who are
intending to do the mining?

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.350
Or will that be an afterthought?

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:55.900
So Osiris-REx,
one of its goals--

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.340
this is the mission that
Leonard just mentioned--

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.077
that just yesterday
successfully--

00:41:02.077 --> 00:41:03.660
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
Got to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.530
It does--

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:05.070
ANTONIA JUHASZ: Got there.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:06.300
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
--recovery [? route. ?]

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.758
ANTONIA JUHASZ:
One of its goals is

00:41:07.758 --> 00:41:10.740
to determine the viability
of asteroid mining.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.210
That's one of the intentions.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.890
And so for someone
like me, who has

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:20.940
spent her career looking at
this sort of the industry

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.890
goes forward and sort
of regulation's attempt

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:26.040
to follow afterwards, and what
the consequences of those are,

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.500
thinking about it now for me
in this entirely new realm

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.270
which is all of space.

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:34.620
And what the unintended
consequences could be

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.030
is truly profound.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:39.270
And trying to
encourage the public

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:43.230
to participate in this
process as much as industry

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:48.562
is before the cat gets much
further out of the bag.

00:41:48.562 --> 00:41:50.270
LEONARD DAVID: There's
some kind of line,

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:52.500
and I don't think
I came up with it.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.870
I stole it from
somebody, probably.

00:41:54.870 --> 00:42:00.360
But you do the peaceful
uses of outer space.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.630
And then somebody
says, the useful--

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.360
how does this go?

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.930
Now I can't remember
what I'm talking about.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:07.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.205
OK.

00:42:08.205 --> 00:42:09.887
Useful pieces of outer space.

00:42:09.887 --> 00:42:10.762
ANTONIA JUHASZ: Yeah.

00:42:10.762 --> 00:42:11.400
That works.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.040
LEONARD DAVID: And
that's interesting.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.030
One little, quick short story.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:17.340
I used to go--

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.840
every time there
was a Mars mission,

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.820
I'd go to JPL ahead of time,
go talk to all the engineers.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:28.780
And one time I went in there,
and this was on Pathfinder.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:35.510
The head guy goes and puts me in
his office and shuts the door.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:40.010
And he says, if this fails, how
will you guys report on this?

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.730
And I said, well, how is
this really going to work?

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.170
He said, we're using airbags--

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:45.900
airbags.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.200
OK, let's see how that one goes.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.660
But that mission
was the first time

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.700
I ever heard of
co-location, which

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.890
is what you folks do here.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.540
And that was why it succeeded.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.680
They had people co-located
in the same buildings

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.790
to talk to each other.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:07.210
People that were working
on a parachute for a month

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:10.650
would all of a sudden be going
over to another part of--

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:12.290
the wheels of the rover.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:17.360
Each person learned more
about their spacecraft.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.800
But that was called co-location.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.140
And then I went back
a couple years ago,

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.510
before Curiosity landed.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.290
How are you going to land that?

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.900
Oh, a sky crane--

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.390
it'll be dropped
down on a tether.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:30.950
And you're going--

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.760
I'm still buying
drinks on that one.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.370
Because I--

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:34.268
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:34.268 --> 00:43:35.226
BOBBY BRAUN: All right.

00:43:35.226 --> 00:43:36.570
I can't wait to [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.173
LEONARD DAVID: That
is not going to work!

00:43:37.173 --> 00:43:37.596
BOBBY BRAUN: Yeah.

00:43:37.596 --> 00:43:38.096
Yeah.

00:43:38.096 --> 00:43:41.330
LEONARD DAVID: And that
to me, that partnership

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:45.680
that has to develop between
people in these missions

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.220
to make things happen
is baton passing,

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.320
space age baton passing.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.310
And each person
contributes to the whole.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.730
And it's pretty
amazing to watch.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.590
AUDIENCE: What work needs to
be done before we can actually

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:03.775
send humans to Mars?

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.050
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Not
much of anything--

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.900
it's a problem of money.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.630
Musk estimates that
it's $36 billion--

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:17.620
$35-36 billion to land
the first humans on Mars.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.000
He doesn't have $36 billion.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.690
If he did, I think he'd
probably start launching

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:25.060
cargo missions this year.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.680
You need about
three cargo missions

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.870
to land successfully on Mars.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.700
Bobby and a lot of
people from NASA

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:34.780
think the first cargo landing
that SpaceX attempts on Mars

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.460
will probably fail.

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:39.970
And they think that
they will learn--

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:41.440
BOBBY BRAUN: Not probably.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.910
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
Well, a lot of--

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:44.740
a lot of people that
I've talked to at NASA

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.369
seem to think it
will probably fail.

00:44:47.369 --> 00:44:49.410
BOBBY BRAUN: If you're
going to state my opinion,

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:50.470
I'm going to jump in there.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.780
STEPHEN PETRANEK: All right.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:51.280
All right.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.800
BOBBY BRAUN: So what I've said
is that if you need three,

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.676
you should send four.

00:44:54.676 --> 00:44:55.675
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Right.

00:44:55.675 --> 00:44:57.610
BOBBY BRAUN: Just before
you send the humans.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.170
Because one of them may--

00:44:59.170 --> 00:44:59.420
STEPHEN PETRANEK: May.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.253
BOBBY BRAUN: --fail.

00:45:00.253 --> 00:45:00.940
Go ahead.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.830
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
But anyway, there's

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.830
a lot to be learned from
those failures, extraordinary.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:09.550
I mean, you probably learn, if
you have a successful landing

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:13.640
and part of it is luck, that's
not a learning experience.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.690
If you have a failure and you
learn a lot from the failure,

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:20.050
and then you don't make
the same mistakes again,

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.430
things work a lot
better in the future.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:27.040
So what I suspect is going
to happen is that, as soon--

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.610
if Tesla becomes as
successful as it should be,

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:34.750
if Musk is able to launch
7,000 communications satellites

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:39.060
and offer you data and voice
for $9.95 a month and capture--

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.460
there are 10 billion
Wi-Fi connected devices

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.260
on the planet, more
than there are people.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.590
If he gets a fourth of that
or a fifth of that population,

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:50.500
two billion, and he gets
$10 a month from everybody,

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.920
he's going to quickly have the
money to launch people to Mars.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.290
So this is really a
money problem and not

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.060
a technology problem.

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.880
Just as we threw money
at Apollo in the '60s,

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.770
4% of the GDP of the United
States went into that program.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:09.637
Now about 1/16 of the GDP of the
United States goes into NASA.

00:46:09.637 --> 00:46:11.470
If you were to throw
those kind of resources

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.450
into landing people
on Mars, there

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:16.300
would definitely be people
on Mars within 10 years.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.010
AUDIENCE: So Elon
Musk has recently

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.200
said that SpaceX
will land people

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.910
on Mars in the next six years.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.390
What are your thoughts
on that timeline?

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.310
As a subquestion,
what do you think

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.410
is a more realistic
timeline for that to happen?

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:32.680
STEPHEN PETRANEK: I think
they're kind of different.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:37.800
When I originally wrote my
book, Musk told me 2024, 2025.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.220
And I said come on.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.330
And he said, look.

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:43.780
If we haven't landed
people on Mars by 2030,

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.390
I will be deeply disappointed.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:48.310
And he meant deeply
disappointed,

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:51.910
the kind of failure
that he doesn't accept.

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:55.210
He recently walked
back his statement

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.400
on when the first
humans would be on Mars.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.866
He recently said--

00:46:58.866 --> 00:47:00.490
I don't think many
people noticed this.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:04.360
But he was asked in an interview
when the first people would

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:04.990
land on Mars.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:08.980
And he said the thing he's been
saying recently, which is 2024.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:12.160
And then he said,
well, at least I'm

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.730
certain we'll have a
cargo mission by 2024.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.710
And that was a real walk back.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.360
Because he said
I'm not sure we'll

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.020
have people on Mars in 2024,
which is what he's been saying.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.400
But I'm sure we'll
have a cargo mission.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.250
So give it a couple years.

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.650
Maybe the first cargo
mission is 2026.

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:32.200
Next cargo mission is 2028.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.940
Then 2030 you have
a cargo mission.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.640
And maybe simultaneously
you have two rockets going

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.020
and you have a crew landing.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.890
That would be the estimate that
I would give you right now.

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:46.810
LEONARD DAVID: There's
a catch-22 in all this,

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:50.120
and it is the life
on Mars question.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.660
There's going to be,
probably, some new information

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.520
about methane detection on Mars.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.860
And that's going to be a very
interesting possible connection

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.566
for biology.

00:48:01.566 --> 00:48:02.940
The other thing
that's happening,

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.310
and there's a lot of concern
about planetary protection

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:10.510
and the coordination of
international groups.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:14.020
And Elon tossed his
Tesla out there.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:17.020
And that was not a happy moment
for the planetary protection

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:24.380
people, although it didn't get
near Mars or some flew past it.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.900
But there was a problem.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.350
And there is a real--

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.510
I think there's going
to be a headlong battle

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.420
between planetary
protection people

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.870
and the life detection people
and privatization of Mars.

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:40.480
So I'd watch that one.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.950
That's going to come.

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:45.220
And we'll see.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.190
But the lawyers thing
is the greatest.

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.600
It's a head on collision.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.190
It's just going to be wild.

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.530
I mean, it's the Wild
West sort of thing.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:57.760
But I think that's
going to be another one.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.200
I've just finished writing up.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.840
And I had to go talk
to a lot of lawyers.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.110
And you can have
the rolodex of pro,

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.280
con, no, we shouldn't
do this and that.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.630
So we got some
real issues coming.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:13.180
ANTONIA JUHASZ: I mean, I
think the other issue that

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.810
is being addressed in two
separate questions instead

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:20.500
of one is this issue of where
the Outer Space Treaty was--

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.560
a peace treaty was the intention
of it-- was a peace treaty.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.242
And how significantly more
advanced at this point

00:49:26.242 --> 00:49:27.700
weaponization of
space-- and money,

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.320
when you're talking
about money--

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:36.040
the US defense space
budget, so the space budget

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.440
of the defense
industry, not NASA

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.560
was $45 billion dollars the
last time it was identified,

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.900
and that was in 2015.

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.540
So there's a lot of money there.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:52.880
And then where and how is
the overlap being discussed

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.920
as we move much more
quickly towards Mars

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.740
and the amount of money
that's needed to do that?

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.290
And where the money
currently resides,

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:04.990
which is in the defense
industry and weaponization--

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:08.540
will there be a marriage?

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:13.860
That many people who for a long
time sought peace in space,

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.807
you know, have fought to prevent

00:50:16.807 --> 00:50:18.890
LEONARD DAVID: That's why
we need the Space Force.

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:19.280
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.650
ANTONIA JUHASZ: That's why
we have the Space Force.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.191
BOBBY BRAUN: Let me
just-- before you

00:50:22.191 --> 00:50:23.930
jump on that, one
second-- so I'd just

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:29.660
add that when you try to
define a timeline for when

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.580
the first humans
will be on Mars,

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.150
it depends a great deal
on what the strategy is

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:36.690
for those humans.

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:40.700
So it actually wouldn't
be that hard to just send

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.780
a couple of humans to Mars, have
them be there for a few weeks,

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.380
you know, a la Apollo, and
then have them come back.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.860
And we could certainly, as
a country, if we chose to,

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.215
we could do that in the 2020s.

00:50:54.215 --> 00:50:55.840
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
But we would probably

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.910
do an Apollo 8 kind of
thing and go into orbit

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:00.800
and come back and
not actually land.

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.300
BOBBY BRAUN: Well,
we could do both.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.258
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Yeah.

00:51:03.258 --> 00:51:06.800
BOBBY BRAUN: But in the series,
what we've chosen to do,

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.600
if you notice, it's many of the
same astronauts from season one

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.300
are still there in season two--

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.980
Sammi, as an example.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.940
And so if you're thinking
about the first humans going

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:23.570
to settle Mars, which is
the way SpaceX and Elon Musk

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:27.110
talk about this, there
are many more cargo ships.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.330
There's much more of a
base camp environment that

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:32.630
needs to be built up and
a lot more infrastructure.

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:35.870
And so in my view, you're
talking about the 2030s

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.750
by the time you would
send those humans because

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.810
of all the emplacement
of the infrastructure

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.950
that has to go first.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.330
LEONARD DAVID:
One good thing was

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:49.190
when I got the word
to do this Mars book,

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:53.310
I was at a conference
at Johnson Space Center.

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:56.180
They brought in all
these scientists.

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.340
And for the first
time in one room,

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.770
people sat around and
talked about where do we--

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:01.590
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
Where do we land?

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:02.720
LEONARD DAVID: --yeah,
where do we land,

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.280
and where can this base be?

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.920
And then the exploration
zones were being drawn out.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.630
I mean--

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:09.390
BOBBY BRAUN: There's been
real discussion of this.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:11.140
LEONARD DAVID: Yeah,
this is moving ahead.

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.100
BOBBY BRAUN: There's
a question back here.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.516
AUDIENCE: So I
apologize if you're

00:52:14.516 --> 00:52:16.340
fed up with this question.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.740
Were you influenced at
all by Andy Weir's book,

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.240
"The Martian" in the series?

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.040
And then vise
versa, do you think

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.500
he was influenced by your work?

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.772
And what did you
think of the science?

00:52:27.772 --> 00:52:29.480
STEPHEN PETRANEK: I
have a personal story

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.090
about that, which is in--

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:35.330
my book came out in
2015, in July of 2015.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:42.450
In April of 2015, I had been
asked to do a TED talk on Mars.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.450
And I did this talk.

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:47.550
I've done two other TED talks
on the main stage with TED.

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.210
They were both greeted by
wild applause, and people

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.460
standing up and everything.

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.790
And this one was treated
with polite applause.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.540
And I walked off the
stage, and I thought,

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.490
what the hell happened here?

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:00.170
Jeff Bezos had a
dinner that night

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:04.160
in which he basically tried to
criticize every single thing I

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.530
had said about
people going to Mars,

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.680
and how this was a PR
campaign by Elon Musk

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.350
to gain more attention
for Tesla and so forth.

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:16.010
And the people who ran TED--

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:18.380
the guy who runs TED is
a close friend of mine--

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:21.560
said we're not putting
your talk up online.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:26.270
And then in September,
"The Martian" came out.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.840
So my book came
out, wasn't selling.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.570
"The Martian" came out.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:35.330
I had sat down with
Charlie Bolden when

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:38.450
I was writing the book and
talked about NASA's plans

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:40.340
for humans landing on Mars.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:43.010
And he took me to one
of the 10,000 pages,

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:46.550
obscure pages of NASA that
said in big bold type,

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:49.490
NASA has no plans
for a human mission

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:53.290
to Mars, right there
on their website.

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:54.680
"Martian" comes out.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.230
All of a sudden, my book
starts selling like crazy.

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:00.260
TED decides to put
my talk up online.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:03.560
Charlie Bolden appoints a
director of a manned mission

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:04.130
to Mars.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:06.560
Didn't have any staff, but--

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:13.700
so that's how much influence a
Hollywood movie had on society.

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:17.810
It actually convinced people
that this was a possibility.

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.430
If Matt Damon can
do it, we can do it.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:23.600
ANTONIA JUHASZ: And
there is a dance remix

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.737
of Stephen giving the TED talk.

00:54:25.737 --> 00:54:27.230
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Oh, God.

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.820
BOBBY BRAUN: And
I'll also point out

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:31.594
that Andy participated as
one of the big thinkers--

00:54:31.594 --> 00:54:32.510
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Yes.

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.100
BOBBY BRAUN: --in season one.

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:38.307
So he was a part of the first
season of the Nat Geo series.

00:54:38.307 --> 00:54:39.890
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
And I should mention

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:42.650
that he's gone through kind
of a metamorphosis, too.

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:48.470
He was very defensive
initially about the facts that

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:50.360
were inaccurate in his book.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:53.270
Like 300 mile an
hour wind on Mars

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:55.899
is not going to drive
a piece of an antenna

00:54:55.899 --> 00:54:57.440
through your spacesuit
kind of thing.

00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.600
In fact, you could walk through
a 300 mile an hour wind on Mars

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.100
easily.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.400
It would be like a three
mile an hour wind on Earth.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.210
And he was very
defensive about that.

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:09.590
And then he got
involved in season one.

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:12.410
And you know, some
of us were kind

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.140
of beating up on him
about that kind of stuff.

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.970
And then season two came around.

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:18.900
And we beat up on him some more.

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:22.450
And now he's very open about
what was wrong in the book.

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:23.700
BOBBY BRAUN: He's a great guy.

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.726
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
He's a great guy.

00:55:24.726 --> 00:55:25.600
BOBBY BRAUN: Yeah.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.099
All right.

00:55:26.099 --> 00:55:29.420
So I'm told that
we're out of time.

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:34.150
But I want to thank you all
for joining us here today.

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:37.970
I'd highly encourage you
to check out the series.

00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:39.440
Season two is continuing.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.410
You can check out
episode five next Monday

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:45.350
at 9:00 PM on the
Nat Geo channel.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:46.730
And I want to also--

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.690
in addition to
thanking our panelists,

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:49.714
I want to thank Google--

00:55:49.714 --> 00:55:50.630
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Yes.

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:51.560
BOBBY BRAUN: --for welcoming us.

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.330
Thank you very much.

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:53.496
STEPHEN PETRANEK: Thank you.

00:55:53.496 --> 00:55:55.680
[APPLAUSE]
