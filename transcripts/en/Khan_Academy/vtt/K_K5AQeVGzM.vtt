00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.827
- [Instructor] We are
asked, "How does the current

00:00:01.827 --> 00:00:04.417
"going through R1," so, this resistor,

00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:06.260
"when the switch is open,"

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.327
this switch, "compare to
the current through R1

00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:11.130
"when the switch is closed?"

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.590
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.240
Alright, so let's just think
about the two scenarios.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.560
So, we can view the current as this,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.750
right over here, this
current that we care about.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.440
We could either measure it there

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.460
or you could measure it right over there,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.780
and let's first think about the scenario

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.410
where the switch is open.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.690
So, our current when our switch is open

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.890
is going to be equal to the voltage

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.280
across the resistors, and
that's going to be our 12 volts,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.500
12 volts,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.740
divided by the equivalent
resistance of these resistors.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.120
When the switch is open, essentially,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.220
we just have R1 and R2 in series,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.940
and so this is just gonna be R1+R2.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.520
If you have two resistors in a series,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.800
their equivalent resistance is just

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.000
the sum of the resistances.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.290
Fair enough.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.980
Now, let's think about the situation

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.320
where the switch is closed.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.393
Closed.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.880
So here, our current at
this point of our circuit,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.850
or the current going through R1,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.100
so I sub closed,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.200
is, once again, it's going
to be equal to 12 volts,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.820
the voltage across the resistors,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.600
but what are we gonna divide by now?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.510
When we close the switch, what happens?

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.880
Well, these lines where
we see no resistors

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.340
in circuit diagrams, that's
assumed to be resistance-less,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.520
so all of the current will
actually flow that way.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.800
So, by closing this switch,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.570
you're essentially removing
R2 from the circuit.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.380
The current will just go through R1,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.000
and then follow the path of
least resistance, literally.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.830
And so, in this situation,
our current is going

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.310
to be 12 volt divided
by, you essentially just

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.710
have one resistance, divided by R1.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.590
So, when you closed the circuit,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.000
you've essentially taken a resistor out,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.070
and so if you took a resistor out,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.480
you're going to increase the current,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.340
so you could just write it as,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.590
the current when the switch is open

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.650
is going to be less than,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.080
is going to be less than the current

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.290
when the switch is closed.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.400
Once again, why is that?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.420
Well, just look at the denominators here.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.640
When the switch is open,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.570
you're dividing by a larger number

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.130
than when the switch is closed.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.270
Or, another way of thinking about it,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.520
when the switch is open, the
R2 resistance is factored in.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.430
When the switch is closed,
the R2 resistance essentially

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.770
becomes a non-factor and
you have less resistance,

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.663
which would mean you
would have higher current.
