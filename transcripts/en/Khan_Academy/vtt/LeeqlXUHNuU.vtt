00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:04.885
Interviewer: I'm here with Marcos.
What is this an experiment we're doing?

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:06.349
I was like hey instead
of having pictures on our

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:07.905
website, maybe we should
have videos of people.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:09.048
Marcos: Nice. Nice.

00:00:09.048 --> 00:00:10.221
Interviewer: So, what do you do here?

00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:11.844
Marcos: I'm a designer
here at the Khan Academy.

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.354
That actually goes two different ways.

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:16.466
One, I'm kind of doing
my software design, and

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.138
that's kind of touching on the
exercise framework that we have.

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:21.724
Right now I've been focused
a lot on trying to make

00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:23.810
more interactive exercises
easier to develop.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.429
There's a framework that
I'm building for that

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.218
I'm [open sourcing] at the same time.

00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:30.639
Interviewer: What do you mean
by more interactive exercise?

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:33.935
Marcos: Right now a lot of
our exercises present to you

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:36.809
with a question. It's like, what
is the sum of blah blah blah?

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.839
Or, complete the square.
It ask you this very simple

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.954
one step computation. A lot
of stuff that I'm looking at

00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:44.744
is how do you make exercises
that let you follow

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.959
a larger kind of narrative
of problem solving.

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:50.741
In that case it would be
like, let's say you are

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:53.189
this tall here, and your
shadow is this feet long.

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:57.652
Your friend is over, maybe,
35 nautical miles away, and

00:00:57.652 --> 00:01:01.528
his shadow is this long.
Giving that what do you

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.104
expect the circumference
of the earth to be?

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:03.784
Interviewer: Oh yeah.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:06.654
Marcos: You're recreating like
the greatest ... doing all the

00:01:06.654 --> 00:01:10.704
scientific discoveries.
Their not very hard if

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:12.490
you know the basic concepts in there.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.870
You just need someone to
guide you along the way.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.882
A lot of what I've been
thinking about is developing

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:19.915
a framework and actually
developing a framework

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:20.948
not just thinking about it.

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:21.859
Interviewer: Right. Right.

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:22.915
Marcos: For making that happen.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:25.373
Interviewer: You'r background
is pretty interesting.

00:01:25.373 --> 00:01:28.848
You started off at MIT. CS major?

00:01:28.848 --> 00:01:30.537
Marcos: Math with CS.

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:31.261
Interviewer: Math with CS.

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:32.836
Marcos: People call it diet 6.

00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:35.895
Interviewer: Diet 6. 6 is
of course computer science.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.237
Marcos: 6 is computer science.

00:01:37.237 --> 00:01:39.928
Interviewer: It's kind of the math
... computer science really is math.

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:45.504
Then you decided that that was not enough.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:48.005
Marcos: I think I was pleasantly surprised

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.453
with how that had gone.
What I was really focused

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:53.079
on at the time was the
[unintelligible] in the context

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.587
of making text books. Text
books [unintelligible]

00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:59.206
dining out or whatever. I
still believe. I want to

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:00.921
make a really good text book.

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:05.339
Interviewer: We got text books
here and some science books.

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:07.604
Marcos: I actually ended
up doing after teaching

00:02:07.604 --> 00:02:10.630
web design for about a year
and a half was applying

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.520
to design school. The whole
purpose behind that was

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.064
to make a really awesome text book.

00:02:16.064 --> 00:02:17.726
Interviewer: I didn't
realize this. This didn't

00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:20.102
even come out in the
interview. You wanted to

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:21.850
re-event text books?

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.475
Marcos: Yeah. Yeah. I
wanted to actually make

00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:26.226
the coolest text book.
Like after being in design

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:27.836
school making handmade books for example.

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:30.439
Like 4 x 6 little book
would be really sweet.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.246
I was like really excited
and jazzed about this.

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:37.393
Then as I started in
2007 to 2009, it was you

00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:39.282
have the iPad, iPhone,
all these technological

00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:41.683
advances just happen
while I'm in grad school.

00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:43.685
I will have to rethink this a little.

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:45.114
I got this design degree.

00:02:45.114 --> 00:02:46.292
Interviewer: From [Risty].

00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:47.299
Marcos: From [Risty].

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.727
Interviewer: That's a serious
design school. That's around there.

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:51.957
Marcos: I had did my
grad program in design.

00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:55.201
I got a lot of the basics.
I learned all of the

00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:57.153
fundamentals hypography, design, layout.

00:02:57.153 --> 00:03:00.727
I got really attuned to
that, and then focused

00:03:00.727 --> 00:03:03.943
my energies again thinking
about how do I create

00:03:03.943 --> 00:03:08.727
reusable design systems. I
ended up being my thesis was ...

00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:10.344
Interviewer: How many
CS majors were there?

00:03:10.344 --> 00:03:14.523
Marcos: Actually, when I
left there was 1 and a half.

00:03:14.523 --> 00:03:16.482
Interviewer: 1 and a half. (laughing)

00:03:16.482 --> 00:03:19.149
Marcos: It's an up and coming thing.

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.751
Interviewer: Yeah. I think
that's a good combination.

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:23.855
In fact, I think, probably,
design should be a critical

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:25.556
part of more engineers.

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:29.038
Marcos: Yeah. Exactly.
What I noticed, at least,

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:33.001
there was a lot of similarity.
The Christopher Alexander design

00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:35.896
patterns thinking. That
system thinking, actually,

00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:37.818
is massive in graphic design.

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:38.516
Interviewer: Yeah.

00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:42.309
Marcos: It was also huge
in the design pattern

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:46.481
movement in [Seasia]. There's
a lot of happy medium there.

00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.481
Interviewer: Why did
you decide to come here?

00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:51.089
How did you even find out
about what were doing?

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:53.096
Marcos: I saw a lattice
multiplication video.

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:56.857
I was like this is
ridiculous. I was watching ...

00:03:56.857 --> 00:03:58.149
Interviewer: In a good or bad way?

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.560
Marcos: At first I saw
it and I was like I have

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.021
never heard of lattice multiplication.

00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.553
I saw this massive list
of links. Somebody had

00:04:05.553 --> 00:04:08.241
a link to it. I was a
little skeptical. For some

00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:10.651
reason I finished watching
the video, and I'm

00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:11.843
like well that's interesting.

00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:14.007
Interviewer: This was one of our videos.

00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:15.550
Marcos: This was one of your videos.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.161
Interviewer: It was a good ridiculous.

00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:18.553
Marcos: Yeah. It was a good ridiculous.

00:04:18.553 --> 00:04:20.341
First, I was incredibly
skeptical. I was just like

00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:23.119
no, no, no. I done my little
concentration education

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:25.933
at secondary school, and
I was like I don't know.

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:29.178
You find yourself actually
finishing the video,

00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:31.705
and you're like oh.
There's something here.

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:34.034
There's actually something
there. I didn't actually

00:04:34.034 --> 00:04:35.943
see you guys again for a year and a half.

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:40.395
I was working at CMU and doing
my own thing at that time.

00:04:40.395 --> 00:04:42.108
Interviewer: What was your own thing?

00:04:42.108 --> 00:04:44.781
Marcos: I was doing freelance
work at the same time.

00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:47.683
I was also working with the HCI Institute.

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:49.733
Interviewer: CMI is Carnegie Mellon.

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:52.537
Marcos: Yeah. Carnegie Mellon.
Human-Computer Interaction Institute.

00:04:52.537 --> 00:04:53.184
Interviewer: Okay.

00:04:53.184 --> 00:04:57.199
Marcos: With Laura Dabbish and
Rob Kraut an amazing group.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.310
Their doing a really
interesting work with team

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.846
team based dynamics online.

00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:04.420
Interviewer: What were you doing?

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.017
Marcos: I was actually staff designer, and

00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:09.118
then doing some CS work from the side.

00:05:09.118 --> 00:05:10.933
It's like doing a lot of
re-factoring with code based

00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:12.354
and making sure that
we could re-producively

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:17.185
preform these experiments
on these couple thousand

00:05:17.185 --> 00:05:18.449
Facebook users every week.

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.460
Interviewer: Okay.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.298
Marcos: We were running
these massive experiments

00:05:21.298 --> 00:05:23.853
until I learned, even though
I wasn't doing the straight up

00:05:23.853 --> 00:05:26.600
experience design, I kind
of osmosed a lot of that

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.884
stuff while I was there.

00:05:27.884 --> 00:05:30.816
Interviewer: I interrupted your story.

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:32.772
How did you find out
about what we're doing?

00:05:32.772 --> 00:05:35.111
Marcos: I started seeing
... I think Ben came ...

00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:37.224
Interviewer: We have 9 Ben's. (laughing)

00:05:37.224 --> 00:05:40.360
Marcos: 9 Ben's. So, Ben
Kamens did a prety good

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.298
job posting out [unintelligible]
every once in a while.

00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:45.694
Then, I was like man this
is totally changed from the

00:05:45.694 --> 00:05:48.397
time I saw it. The first time,
I think, it had all ready

00:05:48.397 --> 00:05:51.355
gone through that one design
aeration. It was pretty interesting.

00:05:51.355 --> 00:05:53.025
Then I saw you guys were
actually posting for jobs.

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:55.531
I was like this is
perfect. What could be more

00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:59.350
perfect than this? I just
threw my hat in the ring.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.014
The rest is history. (laughing)

00:06:02.014 --> 00:06:03.209
Interviewer: The rest
is history. (laughing)

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:11.597
Hopefully for the future
too. What we're hoping to do

00:06:11.597 --> 00:06:14.805
here? Has it been surprising?
Has it been just as you expected?

00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:17.823
Marcos: I think, actually,
when I first got here,

00:06:17.823 --> 00:06:19.331
I think I even wrote that in my cover.

00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:23.163
I don't know what I
will do when I get here,

00:06:23.163 --> 00:06:25.520
but I'm really excited to do stuff here.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.159
I had no idea that I'd be
working on interactive exercises.

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:30.891
I think that a good glimmer in my eye.

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.295
I though straight out of design school.

00:06:33.295 --> 00:06:34.916
Straight out like a year and
a half out of design school.

00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:37.585
I thought I would probably
be doing business cards,

00:06:37.585 --> 00:06:39.995
logos, kind of stupid stuff.

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:45.072
Interviewer: Really. You were
capable of more than business cards.

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.166
Marcos: Of course. I'm capable.

00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:49.419
Interviewer: That's where my
design skills were. (laughing)

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.829
Marcos: In my mind I
kind of expected to spend

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:54.583
a couple of months doing that.
I ended up just diving on in.

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:57.832
Thinking about new features.
Thinking about ways to make the

00:06:57.832 --> 00:07:01.623
site more friendly, and
overall, it was a huge

00:07:01.623 --> 00:07:04.336
mind-shifting, like the
terminal of like impacting scale

00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:08.732
and the ability to do something
really cool in education.

00:07:08.732 --> 00:07:12.916
It was like we did this
thing with David, one of

00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:15.911
our awesome interns, and
it was how can we make

00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:19.866
this [sweep] more fun.
We play with this very

00:07:19.866 --> 00:07:23.032
simple visual forms and
like what happens when

00:07:23.032 --> 00:07:25.250
you loose [street] bar.
What does that feel like?

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.218
A lot of these are very
designish things that

00:07:29.218 --> 00:07:30.975
we're probing, but we
ended up coming up with

00:07:30.975 --> 00:07:33.337
a very ... and he actually
deserves most of the

00:07:33.337 --> 00:07:35.920
credit. He came up with
a very stunning model

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.219
for making that a more
interesting and more

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:42.997
appropriate way of engaging
and measuring our proficiency.

00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:45.898
Interviewer: Deep design
questions got to measure.

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:50.469
Marcos: Does it feel better
to drop down to something

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:54.004
like to drop down to arbitrary
amount and start over again?

00:07:54.004 --> 00:07:56.304
Does it feel better to
drop to a percentage

00:07:56.304 --> 00:07:58.670
which represents our actual belief, and

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.005
how far you're doing? Which of these ...

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:03.647
Interviewer: How doing means you
actually belief in how your doing.

00:08:03.647 --> 00:08:06.755
Marcos: Exactly. A lot
of that your questions of

00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:09.699
would it feel better as
your gaining proficiency?

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:13.169
You have a moving indicator.
Something that kind of

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:17.365
moves along and animates. It was born out

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:20.425
of these playful ideas.
It actually ended up

00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:23.357
evolving into something that
was very more metro rigorous.

00:08:23.357 --> 00:08:26.621
Then like back and forths
that we were having

00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:28.227
initially when we sketching it out.

00:08:28.227 --> 00:08:31.058
Interviewer: Where do you hope this goes?

00:08:31.058 --> 00:08:35.474
Marcos: I think, recently,
I've been spending

00:08:35.474 --> 00:08:38.638
a lot of time thinking about
the interactive exercises,

00:08:38.638 --> 00:08:42.865
and I actually feel like
I'm going closer to my

00:08:42.865 --> 00:08:44.560
original idea for this text book.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.981
I mean it sounds kind of
silly, but it feels like

00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:50.614
what I'm doing and the
work that I'm working on

00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:54.849
gets me closer to designing
these portable text books.

00:08:54.849 --> 00:08:57.014
Which I mean not portable,
because we have phones

00:08:57.014 --> 00:09:00.313
iPad's, and whatnot, but
things that are engaging

00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:02.596
that are light weight, and that'll let you

00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:05.399
dive in at any level. At your own risk.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.696
Interviewer: Do things that
text books couldn't do?

00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:08.604
Marcos: I think text books
are capable of a lot.

00:09:08.604 --> 00:09:11.927
I'll be honest. Maybe
we disagree. (laughing)

00:09:11.927 --> 00:09:13.777
Interviewer: (laughing) No. No.

00:09:13.777 --> 00:09:16.892
Marcos: I firmly in the
power of the text book.

00:09:16.892 --> 00:09:20.146
I think for the things
that ... for the reactive

00:09:20.146 --> 00:09:22.788
exercises we can pull
off and for the ability

00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:26.144
to ask questions that are experimentally.

00:09:26.144 --> 00:09:29.678
You can place a little
experimental test bed

00:09:29.678 --> 00:09:32.748
in one of these exercises,
and I think that's powerful.

00:09:32.748 --> 00:09:35.761
I think it's huge right,
being able to see a whole.

00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:38.624
I got the answer. What
happens if I have done this.

00:09:38.624 --> 00:09:42.402
Seeing that there's an
exercise that is able to

00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:44.231
adapt to that way of
thinking. I think that's huge.

00:09:44.231 --> 00:09:46.698
Interviewer: Right. That
would have been hard

00:09:46.698 --> 00:09:47.942
with a traditional text book.

00:09:47.942 --> 00:09:51.988
Marcos: Yeah. You end up having
to build this scalpelling,

00:09:51.988 --> 00:09:55.275
basically in paper, which
again totally fine. Right.

00:09:55.275 --> 00:09:58.850
It's the time you can loose
being unable to explore

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.781
and play with tweaking values.
I think that's awesome.

00:10:01.781 --> 00:10:03.346
Interviewer: Very cool.
