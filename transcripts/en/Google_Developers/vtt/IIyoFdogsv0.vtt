00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hello,
and welcome to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.770
YouTube Developers Live.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.850
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.270
I would like to introduce my
special guest, Florian Dejako,

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.610
from Elgaoto Systems.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.670
How you doing, Florian?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.120
FLORIAN DEJAKO: I'm great.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.560
Hi, Jarek.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.440
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank
you for coming.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.930
And I understand we will talk
about live streaming and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.170
gaming today.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.120
So let's talk a little bit
about your company.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.600
Tell us what you guys do.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.400
How did you get started?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.720
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Yeah.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.700
We are Elgato Systems.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.020
We were founded in 1999,
in Los Gatos.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.260
That explains the. name we have
been working in software,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.200
for many years, before we
started to found the company.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.280
We are actually the original
developers of the Toast CD

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.670
recording software,
on the Mac.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
I remember that.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.540
FLORIAN DEJAKO: We started
Elgato Systems to create

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.920
exciting products.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.930
One of our first products
was EyeTV.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.630
EyeTV turns your Mac
into a TiVo.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.020
It is television viewing,
recording, archiving, editing,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.880
and so forth software
that lets you

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.280
watch television, edit--

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.850
basically, everything you would
want to do with a Mac,

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.420
but many more things you can't
even do with a TiVo.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.620
Over the years, we have
added features.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.790
We have added different
TV standards.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.900
We started out with just a
product for the United States,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.200
then we added Europe.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.520
Television-- there are
many different

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.960
standards in the world.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.970
And we like to think we
support them all.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.890
We have expanded to different
platforms.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.130
We are now running on
iOS, iPad, iPhone.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.120
We are also on Windows,
with a slightly

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120
different software offering.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.990
And Android as well.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.280
So when did you start working
with the gaming vertical, and

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.610
start offering the
gaming solutions?

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.190
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Yeah,
gaming is a very

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.780
interesting field for us.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.870
The interesting thing about it
is we did not find gaming,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.520
gaming found us.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.140
We were surprised about
the level of--

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.560
a lot of people were using our
software edition for EyeTV to

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.670
use it with hardware that was
made by another company.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.340
And a lot of software piracy
happened in that course, where

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.890
people were basically taking
our software, and using it

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.910
with somebody else's hardware
to make recordings.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.930
And we were wondering,
what are these

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.630
people actually doing.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.240
We asked our users-- the
ones who paid for it--

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.300
and found out a lot of these
people don't record set-top

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.820
boxes for satellite TV and
cable television, like we

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.350
intended, with the software.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.060
It turns out, a lot of them were
recording video games.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.260
They were connecting
the hardware to

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.630
Playstations and Xboxes.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.790
And the live recording feature
that was in EyeTV-- in the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.740
EyeTV software--

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.130
which is always recording, and
that lets you jump back in

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.060
time, and continue watching
later, and so forth was

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.330
extremely useful for
these gamers.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.730
They really enjoyed that they
could be playing for many

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:11.960
hours, and they were just
finally getting that one

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.960
achievement in the game, that
they were always hoping for.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.670
And with other solutions, they
would find out that, at that

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.370
point, they forgot to hit
the record button,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.420
and they missed it.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.160
With EyeTV, they could just
go back in time, start the

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.430
recording then, and
then, share their

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.260
results with their friends.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Great, great.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.720
So without further ado, can you
show us how that's done,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.942
with Elgato Game Capture HD?

00:06:36.942 --> 00:06:38.890
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Yeah,
Game Capture--

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:44.710
the device itself is a video
capture device, like we've

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.570
been offering to users
for some years now.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.340
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So it's a
little box that you attach to

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.020
your game console.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.090
FLORIAN DEJAKO: That
you attach.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.530
It basically plugs in between
your console and your TV set.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.530
Because we want to be able to
continue playing, obviously,

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.130
on the big screen TV.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.620
And it captures HDMI,
or component video.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.190
And it outputs HDMI
in full HD.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.940
And it basically lets you
capture the video signal, as

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.310
it passes onto your TV.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.370
So this is what we have set
up in the studio, right?

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.140
We have the Elgato box.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.930
We have a game here, running
on our iPad, with HDMI out

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.910
coming into the box.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.520
And then, the Elgato device is
actually connected to your mic

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.170
over USB, right?

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.610
FLORIAN DEJAKO: That is the
set up we have here.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.710
That's correct.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.430
On the Mac, or Windows, you run
the game capture software,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.190
which is running here.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.010
And that's already running.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.220
It's already recording
my game.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:54.630
And as you can see, there's a
lot of the functions going on.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.610
But why don't I start with a
demo of the game on the iPad.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes,
show us your skills.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.340
Can you up the volume a
little bit, so we can

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.240
hear the engine roar?

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.570
All right.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.950
And this is "Trial Extreme
3," right?

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.560
FLORIAN DEJAKO: "Trial
Xtreme 3."

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.810
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: By Deemedya.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.760
FLORIAN DEJAKO: And I'm new
to this, so bear with me.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: There's only
a million people watching you

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.025
right now, so no pressure.

00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:19.275
FLORIAN DEJAKO: No pressure.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.880
So I'm seeing a preview of
what you're seeing on the

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.169
iPad, in the Game Capture
HD player--

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:34.870
I guess that's what
you guys call it.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.120
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Yes.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.700
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That's
a nice trick.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.420
You can do it.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.171
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Ahh, made it.

00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:54.421
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Star.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:58.940
FLORIAN DEJAKO: And
there, I crashed.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Pretty good.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.620
Oh, no.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:06.900
OK.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.580
What happens next?

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.565
So now that you failed--

00:09:09.565 --> 00:09:11.000
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Now
that I failed

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.020
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --you gonna
show it to the world?

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.820
FLORIAN DEJAKO: --I can show
that I've been showing my

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.100
failure, live on YouTube,
already.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.590
So what you see, here, is
my YouTube channel.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.740
I was streaming live, from
Google Developers Live.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.660
There's a little
bit of a delay.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.710
So what you see is basically
that failed

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.970
run that I just made.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Got it.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.090
So this is basically the stream
that is generated by

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.260
your desktop software, right?

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.270
FLORIAN DEJAKO: That is right.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.440
I'm streaming, live to YouTube,
using the new YouTube

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.630
API version three.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:53.110
And we've been very excited to
work with YouTube, during the

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:58.530
beta phase of this feature,
and to bring

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.821
streaming to the masses.

00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:02.970
And here we go.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.510
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So just going
back to the player, can

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.580
you go back a little bit, and
tell us a little bit more

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.360
about-- you have a lot of knobs,
and a lot of functions.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.930
What do they actually do?

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.340
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Yeah.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.110
Game Capture software--

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.700
the user interface is primarily
split up into

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.620
sections, one for capturing,
and one for editing.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.870
And it also works,
on Macintosh and

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.810
Windows, the same way.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:36.910
We have the capture side,
that I'm showing here.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.890
At the top, I see information
about my current device.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.210
I see my game audio, which was
coming in from the iPad.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.390
I can also add a live
commentary.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.600
This is useful if I have a
microphone in my room, and I

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.790
want to talk to my friends.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.890
I want my friends to hear what
I'm saying, but my Xbox, or

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.040
PlayStation, is not actually
outputting that sound.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.260
So we are capturing it with
a separate microphone.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.000
And we just mix it
into the stream.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.070
As you can see, we are currently
live streaming.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.700
So the live streaming
section shows me

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.060
I'm on air with YouTube.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.970
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So this is the
part where you integrated

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.580
the live streaming API, right?

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:15.835
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Correct.

00:11:15.835 --> 00:11:18.230
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So if I just
hit the button, there, you

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.420
create the broadcast, and the
stream automatically,

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.440
programmatically.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.680
So the user never has to go to
youtube.com, and upload that.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.492
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Absolutely.

00:11:26.492 --> 00:11:28.570
That is correct.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.660
If you don't have a live
event scheduled

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.610
already, you get to stream--

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.220
just, we create an
event for you.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.390
And we stream to that.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:43.260
But we also support what a lot
of the more professional

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.660
gamers have been asking
us to do.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:52.060
We also support selecting a
stream, or an event, that you

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.430
already created on YouTube.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.570
So you can go to YouTube.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.280
You can customize your event.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.740
You can set up all the titles.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.820
You can give a thumbnail,
and so forth.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.200
And then, you just select it in
the Game Capture software

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.960
to stream to it.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.750
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So
the use case here--

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.650
I'm a pro gamer.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.110
I'm going to just
play my friends.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.005
And I can actually create the
event ahead of time, promote

00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:17.820
it, and then connect the Game
Capture HD to that event, and

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.930
start streaming, whenever the

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.500
tournament starts, for example.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.070
FLORIAN DEJAKO: That's right.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.360
FLORIAN DEJAKO: And at the same
time, we want to make it

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.130
easy for everybody to
use this feature.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.100
So if you didn't do the homework
of advertising your

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.890
stream, and you just say, I'm
ready to go, just stream

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.460
already, you can do
that as well.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.360
I can tag my video.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.760
I can catalog by which game it
was, that I was playing.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.060
I can give my recordings, or
my videos, a description.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.980
And I can obviously use tags
that tie into the YouTube

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.040
tagging system.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.610
That is the capture side.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:01.270
I can now switch to the edit
side, and you see my library

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.470
of previously recorded videos.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:09.800
And also, a little editor, which
you can use to mark your

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.400
highlight sections, and trim out
the bits did that you're

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.060
not so proud of.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.120
And when you're done editing,
you can export, and share,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.150
your video achievements with
your friends on YouTube,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.480
Facebook, Twitter.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.720
You can also do what a lot of
people do, is they actually

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.390
export to Final Cut Pro,
or iMovie, or Sony

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.180
Vegas, on the PC.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.230
And they add their own
introductions, and subtitles,

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.980
and so forth.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.730
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.330
So you can do both.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.830
You can live stream.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:48.160
And then, you can produce a
highlights reel, by editing,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.840
post processing, in your editor,
or in a pro editor, by

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.380
exporting that gameplay
into it.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.280
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Absolutely.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.350
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That's
really cool.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.900
And then, you mentioned that
you don't actually have to

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.240
hunt for that perfect moment,
because your software is

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.030
running continuously.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.010
So there is some kind of a
background recording function,

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.600
that is going on all the time.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.030
And you go back, at any time,
and just pick a clip.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.510
FLORIAN DEJAKO: That is right.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is that the
blue bar, at the bottom?

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.850
FLORIAN DEJAKO: The blue
bar at the bottom--

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.400
you can go back, and
you're recording.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.720
And if you want, you can--

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.680
a lot of this is just
the start screen.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.680
FLORIAN DEJAKO: That's what
we were doing here.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.042
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So
it's a buffer.

00:14:27.042 --> 00:14:28.490
FLORIAN DEJAKO: It
is a live buffer.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.340
We call it flashback
recording.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.570
We capture the last hour of
everything you played.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.570
And at any time, you can go back
in that time and say, I

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.110
want to start my
recording here.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.180
If you know you're going to be
good, you can just start

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.300
recording, and play.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:44.990
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yep.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.762
Like you.

00:14:46.762 --> 00:14:48.620
FLORIAN DEJAKO: I try.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:48.990
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.070
So let's switch gears, and talk
a little bit more about

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.340
the technology behind
all this.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.750
I mean, there's a lot
of pieces here.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.220
So tell us a little more about
how is the front end

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.360
implemented, why do you need a
box, what are the protocols,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.190
what are the APIs that
you guys have used.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.960
For our technical audience,
I'm sure this is all very

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.220
interesting.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.180
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Yeah.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.910
We obviously need hardware,
because otherwise, you can't

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:19.550
just connect a computer in
between your PlayStation and

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.950
your TV set.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.850
That's why we have this.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
So why can't I?

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.630
Aren't there just
digital signals

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.480
coming out of the HDMI?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.270
FLORIAN DEJAKO: The current
generations of consoles are

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:34.230
not really made for sharing the
content, by themselves.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.710
So the only way to capture that
video is to connect to

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.850
HDMI, or component.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:38.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.810
FLORIAN DEJAKO: And we encode
the signal, the

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.570
video signal, to H.264.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And this
is done by the box?

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.660
FLORIAN DEJAKO: That
is done by the box.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.155
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And it's some
kind of a chip, silicon,

00:15:49.155 --> 00:15:49.786
you guys built?

00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:50.940
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Correct.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.460
It is something we license,
from a company.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:16:00.610
And the encoded signal gets
sent to the computer.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:01.700
The computer records it.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.520
We play it, using our
own H.264 decoder.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:13.820
And we have all these features,
editing, live time

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.730
buffer, and so forth.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.070
And we decode it.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.220
We record it.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.840
We take care of only keeping
the last hour of your

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.640
recording, and so forth.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:34.770
We are very careful to make the
user experience the same,

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.740
on Mac and Windows.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.120
We have listened to what
the games have been

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.610
asking us to do.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.750
For instance, the live
commentary feature was

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:50.190
something that was created in
response to user feedback, as

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.320
well as the live streaming
feature.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.760
People have been asking
us to stream.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.550
And they're very happy
that YouTube,

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.040
finally, is opening up.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Right.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.730
For those of you that are
watching, Elgato was one of

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.920
the launch partners for
the new YouTube

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.690
live streaming API.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.800
And we have recently announced,
at Google I/O, that

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.170
we are opening up access to the
live streaming platform.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.300
So if you are a good gamer,
and you have 1,000 or more

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.140
subscribers, you can
apply for access.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.419
And then you can use YouTube
live streaming to show off

00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:19.050
your skills.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.050
And the device that you could
use to actually take care of

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.369
the encoding, and streaming,
is something

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.850
like the Capture HD.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.900
So why was it important for
you to have the same user

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.850
experience, on Windows
and the Mac?

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.380
FLORIAN DEJAKO: We have been
very successful with that

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.910
approach, with other video
capture products.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.020
And we find Windows users
appreciate good user

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.980
interface, just the same
as Mac users would.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:54.140
And also, in designing the user
interface, it was more

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.370
consistent to make
things similar.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.050
It goes so far that something
like our pop over window, for

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.710
instance, with detail
settings, we just

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:04.910
reimplemented that on Windows.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.830
Because that is not
a thing that

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.030
normally lives on Windows.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:08.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.410
FLORIAN DEJAKO: But we find
people click on a button once,

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.660
they see the little window pop
up, and they understand,

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.280
immediately, what's going on.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.880
So a lot of those elements
that are very

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.180
familiar to Mac users--

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.380
they work just the
same on Windows.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.810
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then, as
far as the YouTube API--

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.910
you're using the YouTube live
streaming API, that we

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.180
launched, recently.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.360
Are you guys doing straight
REST calls?

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.380
Are you using the
client library?

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.470
FLORIAN DEJAKO: On Mac and
Windows, those are not

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.060
implemented quite
the same way.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.840
On the Windows implementation,
we are actually

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.910
using the C# library.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.810
Thanks for making that.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.825
It works quite well.

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:49.150
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great, I'll
pass that on to the team.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.920
FLORIAN DEJAKO: And on the
Mac, we found that it was

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.020
easier to just create
requests by hand.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.150
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
I see, I see.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.530
So we do have an Objective-C
library that works quite well

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:01.670
on the Mac.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.720
Is that app implemented in
C, or is it Objective-C?

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.590
FLORIAN DEJAKO: The user
interface implementation is

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.290
dictated by the operating
system.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.390
We would love to use
Cocoa, anyway.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:17.230
But on Windows, we are using
C#, with Spotnet.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:22.210
And Objective-C, with
Cocoa, on the Mac.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.550
We have a common
core of library

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.150
functions that is in C++.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.980
We have a lot of expertise
with C++.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.940
We've been using it for
20 years, so it works

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.810
quite well for us.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:35.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.970
And then, one thing that we
always like to ask is, is

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.880
there anything that surprised
you while you were building

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.430
the product.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.260
Anything about the users?

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.380
Anything about the API?

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.280
Anything you are you willing
to share with our audience?

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.600
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Yeah.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.730
For us, Game Capture was,
really, quite a shift in the

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.830
direction of what the
company is doing.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.000
We have been making
these TV products.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.360
And many of the TV
users were--

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.890
well, they were our age.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.140
And a lot of the gamers--

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.870
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Meaning
very young.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:11.510
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Very young.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.980
So the gamers that we are now
working with-- they're really,

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.890
really young.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:22.930
And working with these kids
is a very interesting, and

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.370
exciting, change.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:29.940
A change in energy,
I would say.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:35.130
It's quite interesting to be
working with these people,

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:40.570
17-year-old people, who have
two million subscribers on

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:41.980
their YouTube channel.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.860
And it's also a very
interesting

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.350
way to market, obviously.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.790
Every time one of these guys
holds up our product, and says

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.280
that's what they use to record,
all their fans,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.560
obviously, hopefully want
to use the same.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:02.460
And yeah, it was surprising, and
quite pleasant to see how

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.150
the young audience is
appreciating this new system,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.030
that we introduced.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:07.460
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.300
So it sounds like you were
really closely working with

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.810
your customer, and really
changing the product to fit

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.540
their feedback.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.140
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Absolutely.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is that why
it looks so cool and shiny?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.800
FLORIAN DEJAKO: We listen,
and we follow

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.440
where the user is going.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.310
And thanks to all the
gamers who keep

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.430
providing the feedback.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.310
Keep it coming.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.240
And then, anything
about the API?

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.110
Anything that you feel
like went well,

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.030
and things that didn't?

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:38.550
Any features that we should be
looking into implementing?

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.580
FLORIAN DEJAKO: It's
a tough one.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.630
Germany, for us--

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.710
I'm German, as you
may have heard--

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.170
and our company has two
offices in Germany--

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.330
they can't actually
watch the streams.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.810
It would be great for YouTube
and the German authorities to

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.115
get pulling in the
same direction,

00:21:58.115 --> 00:22:00.800
and actually enabling--

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.030
opening up YouTube.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.480
And of course, all the copyright
issues that may be

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.840
attached to that.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:06.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.510
I'll pass that feedback
to our guys.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.320
You can pass it to the German
guys on your end.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.460
All right.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.530
Well, let me see if we have any

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.190
questions in our moderator.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.540
I see one that is relevant.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.710
I think it's addressed to me--

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.510
whether YouTube Developer
Relations is hiring.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.730
And yes, the answer
is we are hiring.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.680
To learn more, go to
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.080
Well, thank you very much for
taking the time to stop by our

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.130
studio, today.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.610
It's a really fantastic
device.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.290
I'm really happy to see the
early adopters of our YouTube

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.090
live streaming API.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.060
And I'm looking forward for
all the great footage that

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.020
we'll see on YouTube, thanks
to a product like yours.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:44.300
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Thank you.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:44.740
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank
you very much.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.920
And for those of you watching,
see you next time, next

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.490
Wednesday at 10 am, Pacific.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.750
Bye.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.000
FLORIAN DEJAKO: Thank you.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:24:09.877
