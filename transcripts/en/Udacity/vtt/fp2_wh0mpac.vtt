00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Norvig] 5 factorial to the 5th was 24 billion.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And if we assume we have a 2.4 gigahertz computer, which is fairly typical,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
then if all this could be compiled into 1 computer instruction,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
then it would take 10 seconds.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But of course that's ridiculous. You can't do all of that in 1 instruction.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If it was 100 instructions, then that would mean it would be 1000 seconds,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which is about 16 minutes, but that seems too little.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's probably going to be more like 1000 instructions to make it all the way through

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
doing all this and then checking the constraints,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and so that would be about 160 minutes.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And so an hour to 3 hours. Maybe we'll say 2 or 3 hours, somewhere in there.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It might be as little as 1 hour. We can't really tell because this is just an estimate.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But it's definitely going to be in the hour range and not in the minutes or day range.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In fact, I actually ran this program,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and we'll come back later and see how well this estimate of somewhere in there worked out.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let me just say because we've learned that this will take somewhere in the range of an hour,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
don't try to run it here in the browser by hitting the Run button

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because we timeout the calculations after just a few seconds, so it's not going to work here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You could type it into your own computer if you have Python running on your own computer,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
set it going, and see how it works.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But first we have to figure out how to do all the constraints.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So we already did constraint number 1, which was houses = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Now let's do constraint number 2, which is that the Englishman lives in the red house.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We want to write some if statement to check if the Englishman lives in the red house

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and if so, we go on; if not, we give up.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And so how do we check if it's true that the Englishman lives in the red house?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So if, and then I want you to fill in some expression here.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We'll just say that this is constraint number 2.

00:02:03.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Tell me what you could put in here.
