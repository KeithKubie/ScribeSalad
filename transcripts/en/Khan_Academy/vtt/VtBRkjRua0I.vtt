00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:05.639
Let T of [t], denote the temperature capital T in New York City measured in Celsius degrees

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.179
Or degrees Celsius when it's t, lowercase t, hours after midnight on a given day. The function is graphed below

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.829
The following table contains true statements. Match each statement with the feature on the graph that most closely corresponds to it

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.560
So once again this is capital t as a function of lowercase t's temperature as a function of time

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.539
So we see at time equals 0 the temperature is negative 3 degrees Celsius.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.058
And then as we go to

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.589
8 hours later, the temperature is at Zero degrees Celsius

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.220
and then it hits a, it hits at least a relative maximum point or at least from what we see it could even be a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.360
Global Maximum point but based on what we see, it's definitely a relative maximum point

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.780
14 hours into this measurement at time equals 14 and then the temperature starts to go down again.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.599
So let's see, so in other words it is t hours after midnight, so this is this is at midnight

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.680
This is going to be at 8:00 a.m.. This is going to be at noon and this is going to be at 2:00 p.m.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.099
And so on and so forth, but anyway. The feature, Y-intercept.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.639
So the y-intercept is right over here

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.059
And we see when lowercase t when time is zero, zero hours after midnight the temperature in New York City is

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.159
Negative 3 degrees Celsius

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.809
So it was negative 3 degrees Celsius, at the beginning of the day

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.100
Yeah, that's a true statement and especially if you consider the beginning of the day, the true beginning of the day is right at midnight

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.729
so

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.169
That's that one. The y-intercept tells us this true statement

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.389
So positive or negative interval and these questions are a little bit tricky because you don't have to use

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.399
It's the positive or the negative interval

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.149
It doesn't have to be both, so if either the positive or negative interval helps you with one of these other two statements

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.129
So let's see. It was getting warmer between 2:00 a.m.. and 2:00 p.m.. The temperature was above zero between 8 a.m.. and 8 p.m.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.040
So let's see. If we're talking about positive or negative intervals, so we're not talking about increasing or decreasing

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.749
We're talking about positive or negative intervals, so we have a negative interval

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.039
Sorry, we have a negative interval from time equals zero to time equals eight

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.660
What do I mean by negative interval is the temperature is negative. It goes, it's below zero

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.499
And then from, time, from eight hours from 8 a.m.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.679
To what is this this would be noon, this would be 8 p.m.. From 8 a.m.. to 8 p.m.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.589
Or the 20th hour if you're taking in military time, so to speak. We see that our temperature is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.950
positive and then it dips down to negative again.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.469
So a positive or negative interval tells us when our temperature was above or below zero.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.330
And we can see we have this positive interval where the temperature was above zero between 8 a.m.. and 8 p.m.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.039
So we're only using the positive interval this interval right over here where the function is positive?

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.349
That means that the temperature was above zero degrees Celsius between 8 a.m.. and 8 p.m.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:02:59.790
So once again we don't-

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.190
It's saying either the positive or the negative interval helped us make the statement. In this case

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.609
it was only the positive interval helped us make this statement, and then finally we have increasing or decreasing interval.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.160
And it was getting warmer between 2 a.m.. and 2 p.m.. It was getting warmer between 2 a.m.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.540
Which is right over here.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.010
So we see that the function is increasing as t increases so does the temperature, all the way to 2 p.m.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.760
And that, right of there, is an increasing interval. So once again

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.889
we're not using an increasing and a decreasing interval,

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.699
we're just using the increasing interval, the decreasing interval isn't helping us to make the statement,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.149
but the increasing interval is helping us. It's letting us make the statement. It was getting warmer between 2:00 a.m.. And 2:00 p.m.

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.499
From here to here or between 2:00 a.m.. and 2:00 p.m.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.939
We see that the function itself is increasing that is an increasing

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.060
Increasing interval and we got it, right
