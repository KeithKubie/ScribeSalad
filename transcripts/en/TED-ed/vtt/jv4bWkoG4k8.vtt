00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:12.960
Denis Diderot left a dungeon
outside Paris on November 3, 1749.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.412
He'd had his writing 
burned in public before,

00:00:15.412 --> 00:00:18.758
but this time, he'd gotten locked up
under royal order

00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:24.007
for an essay about a philosopher's
death bed rejection of God.

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:28.547
To free himself, Denis promised
never to write things like that again.

00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:31.442
So he got back to work 
on something a little like that,

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:32.829
only way worse,

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.821
and much bigger.

00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:38.941
In 1745, publisher AndrÃ© le Breton
had hired Diderot

00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:41.803
to adapt the English cyclopedia,

00:00:41.803 --> 00:00:45.631
or a universal dictionary 
of arts and sciences

00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:47.378
for French subscribers.

00:00:47.378 --> 00:00:50.141
A broke writer, Diderot survived
by translating,

00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:51.078
tutoring,

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:53.200
and authoring sermons for priests,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.229
and a pornographic novel once.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.800
Le Breton paired him with co-editor
Jean le Rond d'Alembert,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.597
a math genius found 
on a church doorstep as a baby.

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:05.491
Technical dictionaries, 
like the cyclopedia, weren't new,

00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:09.707
but no one had attempted one publication
covering all knowledge,

00:01:09.707 --> 00:01:11.133
so they did.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.667
The two men organized 
the French Enlightenment's brightest stars

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.818
to produce the first encyclopedia,

00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:22.585
or rational dictionary of the arts,
sciences, and crafts.

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:27.609
Assembling every essential fact
and principle in, as it turned out,

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.539
over 70,000 entries,

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.429
20,000,000 words

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.200
in 35 volumes of text and illustrations

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.390
created over three decades
of researching,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.548
writing,

00:01:40.548 --> 00:01:41.477
arguging,

00:01:41.477 --> 00:01:42.443
smuggling,

00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:43.565
backstabbing,

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:44.698
law-breaking,

00:01:44.698 --> 00:01:46.761
and alphabetizing.

00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:48.627
To organize the work,

00:01:48.627 --> 00:01:52.094
Diderot adapted Francis Bacon's
"Classification of Knowledge"

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:56.958
into a three-part system based 
on the mind's approaches to reality:

00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:57.710
memory,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.660
reason,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.244
and imagination.

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:02.955
He also emphasized the importance
of commerce,

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:03.889
technology,

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.300
and crafts,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.582
poking around shops to study the tools
and techniques of Parisian laborers.

00:02:10.582 --> 00:02:14.474
To spotlight a few of the nearly
150 philosoph contributers,

00:02:14.474 --> 00:02:17.150
Jean Jacques Rousseau,
Diderot's close friend,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.521
wrote much of the music section 
in three months,

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:23.171
and was never reimbursed for copy fees.

00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:27.126
His entry on political economy holds ideas
he'd later develop further

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:29.321
in "The Social Contract."

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:32.506
D'Alembert wrote 
the famous preliminary discourse,

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:35.142
a key statement 
of the French Enlightenment,

00:02:35.142 --> 00:02:37.685
championing independent 
investigative reasoning

00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:39.809
as the path to progress.

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.383
Louis de Jaucourt wrote a quarter
of the encyclopedia,

00:02:43.383 --> 00:02:45.210
18,000 articles,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.696
5,000,000 words,

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:48.603
unpaid.

00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:51.382
Louis once spent 20 years writing a book
on anatomy,

00:02:51.382 --> 00:02:53.804
shipped it to Amsterdam 
to be published uncensored,

00:02:53.804 --> 00:02:55.575
and the ship sank.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.121
Voltaire contributed entries,

00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:58.404
among them history,

00:02:58.404 --> 00:02:59.698
elegance,

00:02:59.698 --> 00:03:01.469
and fire.

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.621
Diderot's entries sometimes 
exhibit slight bias.

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:09.192
In "political authority," he dismantled
the divine right of kings.

00:03:09.192 --> 00:03:10.611
Under "citizen,"

00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:14.994
he argued a state was strongest 
without great disparity in wealth.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:20.297
Not surprising from the guy who wrote
poetry about mankind strangling its kings

00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:23.040
with the entrails of a priest.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.762
So Diderot's masterpiece wasn't a hit
with the king or highest priest.

00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:29.794
Upon release of the first two volumes,

00:03:29.794 --> 00:03:34.273
Louie XV banned the whole thing
but enjoyed his own copy.

00:03:34.273 --> 00:03:37.295
Pope Clement XIII ordered it burned.

00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:38.643
It was "dangerous,"

00:03:38.643 --> 00:03:40.104
"reprehensible,"

00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:42.155
as well as "written in French,"

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.957
and in "the most seductive style."

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:46.698
He declared readers excommunicated

00:03:46.698 --> 00:03:49.632
and wanted Diderot arrested on sight.

00:03:49.632 --> 00:03:52.303
But Diderot kept a step ahead
of being shut down,

00:03:52.303 --> 00:03:55.156
smuggling proofs outside France
for publication,

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:58.729
and getting help from allies
in the French Regime,

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.658
including the King's mistress,
Madame de Pompadour,

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:05.357
and the royal librarian and censor,
Malesherbes,

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:07.839
who tipped Diderot off to impending raids,

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:11.314
and even hid Diderot's papers
at his dad's house.

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:14.310
Still, he faced years of difficulty.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.797
D'Alembert dropped out.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.623
Rousseau broke off his friendship
over a line in a play.

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:23.422
Worse yet, his publisher secretly
edited some proofs

00:04:23.422 --> 00:04:25.699
to read less radically.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.015
The uncensored pages reappeared 
in Russia in 1933,

00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:32.466
long after Diderot had considered
the work finished

00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:35.325
and died at lunch.

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.321
The encyclopedia he left behind
is many things:

00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:40.798
a cornerstone of the Enlightenment,

00:04:40.798 --> 00:04:43.661
a testament 
to France's crisis of authority,

00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:48.043
evidence of popular opinions migration
from pulpit and pew

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:51.161
to cafe, salon, and press.

00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:53.217
It even has recipes.

00:04:53.217 --> 00:04:55.476
It's also irrepressibly human,

00:04:55.476 --> 00:05:00.045
as you can tell from Diderot's entry
about a plant named aguaxima.

00:05:00.045 --> 00:05:04.968
Read it yourself, preferably out loud
in a French accent.
