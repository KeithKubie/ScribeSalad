00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.000
Our first story has
serious global implications,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.767
the very survival of
the human species,

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:09.133
but it's about something
that really couldn't get

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.667
more personal--

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.066
fertility.

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:16.000
Researchers have recently found
staggering drops in male sperm

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.100
count in Western countries.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.467
The big question is, why?

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.066
Correspondent Tim Samuels
agreed to put himself

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.266
on the front lines
in New York to figure

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.100
out what's up down there.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.500
[music playing]

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.033
I'm Tim Samuels, in
New York, investigating

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.667
a crisis close to home--

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:42.967
the global spermaggedon.

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:45.700
[music playing]

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.967
An alarming new study has found
that between 1973 and 2011,

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.734
sperm counts in Western males--

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:56.600
men in North America, Europe,
Australia, and New Zealand--

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.066
dropped from an average of
99 million sperm per cubic

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.467
centimeter to just 47 million.

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:05.667
Theoretically, if
the trend persists,

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:09.867
by 2050, our sperm may
disappear entirely.

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:12.734
[music playing]

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:15.700
I'm here to add my sample
to the scientific pool,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.066
and I am deeply hopeful that
mine are still swimming.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.133
[music playing]

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:20.967
Hi.

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:21.934
I'm Tim.

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:23.033
Hi, Tim.
I'm Miriam.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:24.500
Hi, Miriam.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.033
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
This is about to get awkward.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:27.000
OK.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.367
Here's your specimen jar.

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:29.834
You can come right on in here.

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:32.667
You're provided with the
materials that you need.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.233
And once you're finished, you
give me a call at this number.

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:36.934
Is there a special word?

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:37.800
Thunderbirds are go?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.033
MIRIAM: Uh, you're done.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:39.867
OK

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:40.700
[chuckles]

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.934
OK?

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:42.967
Good?

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.266
- Yeah.
- I'll see you then.

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.100
See you on the other side.
MIRIAM: Bye bye.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.934
Cheers.

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:49.233
[music playing]

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:53.333
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER): With
Miriam analyzing my sample

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.734
upstairs, I'm turned
loose on the streets

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:59.433
to fret over my count and
the modern day phenomena

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:04.266
like stress and obesity
believed to lower it.

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:05.433
Don't get me wrong.

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.633
I take my fertility
very seriously.

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:11.233
To prep for this count,
I've been eating right,

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:15.667
exercising, managing stress.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:20.433
Recently, I even started
laying off the booze.

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:25.834
But troubling research suggests
little of this may matter.

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:29.400
Of the many factors contributing
to sperm count decline,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.500
there's one that's
especially hard to avoid--

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.333
plastics.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.467
More specifically,
a group of chemicals

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:41.834
found in many plastic
products called phthalates.

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:45.200
Phthalates are added to
plastic during manufacture

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.633
to make it soft and flexible.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:51.967
They're just wonderfully
versatile, amazing products.

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:56.133
It's just that they also
have the effect of altering

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:57.700
our bodies' hormones.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.767
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
Epidemiologist Shanna Swan,

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:02.467
who co-authored the
breakthrough fertility study,

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:05.000
also researches
phthalates' effect

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.300
on the hormone testosterone.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.900
Shanna's met me at
this 99-cent store

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.734
to show me how ubiquitous
these chemicals are.

00:03:13.734 --> 00:03:17.233
TIM SAMUELS: For me
handling a plastic bottle,

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:21.700
how does it get from
there to my testes?

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.433
The chemicals that
we were concerned about

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:29.433
are not chemically
bound to the plastic.

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:33.767
They are in the composition,
but they come out.

00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:35.700
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
Microwaving leftovers

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.100
in a plastic container
is a prime example.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.934
When heated, the
phthalates leach out

00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:43.500
of the plastic into the food.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.967
We're ingesting them,
we're absorbing them,

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:49.767
and we're breathing them.

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:52.400
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER): For
reasons not entirely known,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.333
once inside the body,
phthalates seem to inhibit

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.100
testosterone production.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.400
That's scary enough
when you're a grown man,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.266
but Shanna's research
suggests worse damage could

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:04.500
be done before we're even born.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.200
Your mother, when she was
pregnant with you, what she

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.800
drank, what she ate,
what she was exposed to

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.600
was actively affecting
your body within her body.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.500
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER): For
his sex organs to develop,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.633
the male fetus needs
testosterone in utero.

00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:23.500
[music playing]

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.633
When it's not there
at the right time,

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:30.066
in the right amount,
then he can be what we

00:04:30.066 --> 00:04:32.600
call incompletely masculinized.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.400
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
Translation--

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.867
his testicles may not develop,
and his penis may be smaller.

00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:42.800
SHANNA SWAN: And he will
have a low sperm count.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.934
That's extraordinary.

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:45.100
SHANNA SWAN: It
is extraordinary.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.533
[music playing]

00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:48.100
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
The fertility study

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.333
which Shanna co-authored
focused on Western men

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:54.867
because similar data is less
available in other countries,

00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:58.300
but that doesn't mean the
phenomenon isn't worldwide.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.500
If that trend
continues as is, does

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.900
it start to pose existential
threats to our species?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.100
I am not a seer.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.200
I can't predict the
future, but I can tell

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.700
you what doesn't look good.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.800
[music playing]

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.800
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
Our poor dwindling sperm.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.233
They're working overtime to
propagate the human race,

00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:23.533
but how much longer
can they keep up?

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:28.467
What would a post-sperm
world look like?

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:31.600
Looks like I picked the
wrong week to stop drinking.

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.800
Things are grim.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.467
I wouldn't deny it, but I'm
a little bit more optimistic.

00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:41.667
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
Bioethicist Arthur Caplan

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:44.934
sees a future in which we
ditch concerns about raising

00:05:44.934 --> 00:05:47.800
sperm counts and
focus on raising

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.633
actual sperm with stem cells.

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:55.133
It sounds a little nuts,
but you take the cell,

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:58.400
you put it in a dish, you put
the right chemicals around it,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.600
and lo and behold, you can trick
it into making sperm cells.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.233
TIM SAMUELS: So is the future
of reproduction in 20, 30 years,

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.567
you know, darling,
let's make a baby.

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:10.100
Rather than having
sex, hold on, I'm

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.367
just going to take
some stem cells,

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:13.967
reverse engineer them,
and try and select

00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:15.233
the sperm from there.

00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:16.600
I think sex always
will have a future,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.633
but it may get disconnected
from reproduction.

00:06:19.633 --> 00:06:22.200
Engineering a better
baby is the future.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.967
[music playing]

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.000
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
Sperm by design.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I'm ready to dive right in.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.333
[music playing]

00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:35.667
Engineered to have my
most desirable traits--

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:41.333
intelligence, stunning
good looks, athleticism,

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:44.066
ready to pair with
the perfect egg.

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:47.333
[music playing]

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.767
This technology
will be great when

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:55.066
it's ready in 10 or
15 years, but that

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:56.967
might be too late for me.

00:06:56.967 --> 00:06:59.367
So I'm headed back
to Weill Cornell

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:01.834
to learn how my sample fared.

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:05.266
[music playing]

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.834
It's a bit like being an
expectant expectant father.

00:07:12.834 --> 00:07:13.967
Tim, hi.

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.200
Peter Schlegel.
- Great.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.533
So we're going to
go right in here.

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:18.000
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
Weill Cornell

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.900
urologist Peter Schlegel
specializes in male fertility.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.200
OK, so we've got some results.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.567
Miriam is looking at
the sample right now.

00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:29.700
[music playing]

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.900
OK, so that's-- that's
my, uh, my chaps in there?

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.867
That is your sample on there.

00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:38.900
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER):
Time for the moment of truth.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.934
TIM SAMUELS: This is it?

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:43.500
Wow.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.900
This is-- it's mind-blowing
to see your individual sperm.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.333
Now, are they swimming
just erratically in circles

00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:53.767
or is there a pattern to this?

00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:55.533
Well, they never
ask for directions,

00:07:55.533 --> 00:07:56.767
which is part of the problem.

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.300
Yeah.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.834
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER): But
now for the potent question,

00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:02.100
how's my count?

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.500
PETER SCHLEGEL: The
concentration of sperm

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.200
in the sample is 87 million.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.867
The average man will have
60 to 80 million sperms.

00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:13.967
You're even a little
better than than average.

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:15.133
OK.

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:19.367
But is the assumption
that, had I

00:08:19.367 --> 00:08:22.000
lived 40 years ago, if
we'd been doing this,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.100
it would have been better?

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.600
Good question.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.767
Probably in the
previous generation,

00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:28.133
numbers were higher.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.000
[music playing]

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.266
TIM SAMUELS (VOICEOVER): OK.

00:08:31.266 --> 00:08:33.200
So thankfully, my
chaps can swim better

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.900
than I can, and
theoretically, seem

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.800
up to the reproductive task.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.834
Now, just the small matter
of finding an egg they

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:42.934
can call home.

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:43.934
