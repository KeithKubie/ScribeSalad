&gt;&gt; Larry: WHERE DID YOU COME
FROM?

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.850 line:85%
&gt;&gt; FROM THE MIND OF LAWMAKERS.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:54.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY THINK EVERYBODY ON WELFARE
LOOKS AND TALKS LIKE THIS.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:56.255 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT, SO YOU DON'T
REALLY SOUND LIKE THIS?

00:00:56.288 --> 00:01:01.828 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, IF I WERE TO KEEP IT
100--  THIS IS MY REAL VOICE.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.765 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
SO, WELFAIRY, HOW DO YOU

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:09.068 line:85%
FEEL ABOUT-- THAT'S HER NAME.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:11.904 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THESE

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:12.671 align:start position:0% line:85%
RESTRICTIONS?

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.808 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE A LOAD OF RAINBOW
CRAP.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:19.679 line:91%
IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD, IN KANSAS
THEY DRUG TEST YOU BEFORE YOU

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.447 align:start position:0% line:85%
CAN GET YOUR BENEFITS.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.849 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: DRUG TESTS?

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.584 line:85%
THAT DOES SEEM LIKE A NUISANCE.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:28.387 line:91%
IN ALL FAIRNESS THEY'RE PROBABLY
MAKING SURE DRUG ADDICTS DON'T

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.655 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET FREE MONEY.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:35.294 line:91%
&gt;&gt; EXCEPT IS COSTS $40 GRAND TO
GET THE TEST, AND ONLY 11 PEOPLE

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:37.597 size:88% position:44% line:85%
TESTED POSITIVE OUT OF 2700.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.167 line:91%
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TATTOOS I
COULD HAVE GOTTEN ON THIS WITH

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.401 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL THAT MONEY?

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.204 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I DIDN'T REALIZE WE
SHARED SO MANY COMMON INTERESTS.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:49.509 line:91%
SO YOU DISPELLED THE MYTH
ABOUT WASTING MONEY ON 

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.210 line:91%
PEOPLE ON DRUGS. BUT WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE PEOPLE ON WELFARE WHO

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.411 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE GAMING THE SYSTEM? IS THAT
FAIR?

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:56.149 line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY, WITH $25 A DAY, THE
ONLY GAME WE'RE PLAYING IS HOW

00:01:56.182 --> 00:02:00.219 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO MAKE THIS MUCH FOOD FEED THIS
MUCH PEOPLE.

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:01.721 align:start position:0% line:85%
<i> ( APPLAUSE ).</i>

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BUT, YEAH... TRUE,
TRUE.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:09.896 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT BUT, IN ALL FAIRNESS, YOU'RE
A FAIRY, RIGHT?

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.764 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M A WELFAIRY.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:14.901 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
I'M NOT JESUS!

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.336 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT EVEN IF I WERE, WE'RE NOT

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.672 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALLOWED TO BUY FISH.

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:22.341 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH TO
MULTIPLY.

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:23.476 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I GOT IT.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:24.377 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THAT WOULDN'T QUITE WORK.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.779 line:85%
SO WHAT'S THE TRICK HERE THEN.

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:30.216 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, LARRY, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT'S NOT ON THE BANNED

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:31.217 align:start position:0% line:85%
LIST ARE GUNS.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.084 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT!

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:36.455 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOLD ON A SECOND!

00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:37.023 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT CANNOT BE TRUE.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.157 align:start position:0% line:85%
WAIT, GUNS?

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.126 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUY
SEAFOOD, BUT YOU CAN BUY GUNS?

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.328 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES!

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:45.965 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WITH GUNS, YOU CAN
TECHNICALLY GET ALL THE SEAFOOD

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:48.100 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU WANT.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.270 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELFAIRY, NO, HOLD ON,
HOLD ON.

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:54.840 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELFAIRY, NO, NO, NO, GUYS,
WELFAIRY YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.809 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:59.212 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GOTTA GO, GOTTA GO.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.713 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT, WELFAIRY.

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:01.514 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OUT OF HERE.

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:05.351 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHY IS WELFAIRY NOT
GOING?

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:07.887 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAITE, DON'T LEAVE,
WELFAIRY.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.287 align:start position:0% line:85%
