00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.100
We all know that we should be eating healthier,
but does that mean we have to cut out our

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.350
favorite fatty foods?

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.350
What’s the answer?

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.090
The short version: Size matters.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.960
Hey everyone, this is Matt Lieberman filling
in for DNews.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.890
Researchers at Vanderbilt University have
released a new study that offers a new solution

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.650
to the age old problem of diet and portion
control.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.090
Now, dieting seems pretty cut and dry, in
principle.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.230
Don’t eat unhealthy food, eat more vegetables,
exercise regularly, shower, rinse, repeat.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.780
But more often than not, our draconian attempts
to cut out the pleasurable fats, salts, and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.790
sugars that our brains crave cause diets to
crash and burn in their early days, or just

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.790
make us miserable.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.370
However, the trick is to not “diet” at
all, but to shift the ratio of portions over

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.559
time via something the associate professor
of Management Kelly L. Haws calls vice-virtue

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:49.559
bundles.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.750
She and her colleagues discovered that all
people have something called a “taste-health

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.690
balance point” - namely, the proportion
of healthy to unhealthy foods in a single

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.100
meal that will leave that person satisfied
with their taste and nutritional choices.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.610
It’s different for everyone, and I’m sure
that more than one of you has already decided

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.659
that their balance point looks like a Big
Mac with extra lettuce on it.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.520
But here’s the thing: based on the study,
most people fall into a similar range.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.320
Namely, the perfect vice-virtue bundle has
about one quarter to one half vice foods,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.310
and half to three quarters virtue foods.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.150
The example they provide is a plate of french
fries and apple slices.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.369
For most people, their brains only need a
small portion of fries to satisfy the vice

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.290
appetite in their brain, while the apple slices
handle the rest of their hunger in a nutritious

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.290
way.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.840
The study goes on to theorize that vice-virtue
bundles could revolutionize the the fast food

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.790
industry, which has undergone changes as Americans
seek out healthier food options.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.110
By bundling their existing items that are
pure vice and pure virtue, they could create

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.159
new and attractive options at a relatively
low cost.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.990
So what can we take away from this study and
apply to our own lives?

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.009
By finding our taste-health balance point,
we can allow ourselves the fatty, greasy,

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.119
buttery foods that we love, in a portion that
maximizes our desire for healthier options.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.579
The delicious part?

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.270
Finding that balance one meal at a time.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.979
So what do you think about this study?

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.969
Do you know what your taste-health balance
point is?
