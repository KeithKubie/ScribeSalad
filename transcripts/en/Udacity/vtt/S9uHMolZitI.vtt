00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.436
Emotions can help us in the process of our ability to remember through both

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:07.780
genetic processes, as well as biochemical processes. In fact, when we

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.710
experience an emotional event, it can actually cause a change in our genetics.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.358
Such that they build proteins and strengthen synaptic connections between

00:00:16.358 --> 00:00:22.166
neurons. We discuss this in detail in Lesson 3. So proteins stimulate the

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:27.039
formation of new synapses and even new neurons. This results in our ability to

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.526
make memories last for longer periods of time. On the biochemical side, the

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:36.825
neurotransmitter, norepinephirine is important for the formation of memories.

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:41.832
Because it strengthens the synaptic connection between neurons. Remember that

00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:46.179
neuroplasticity is necessary for making the connection between synapses

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:51.732
stronger, and thus make an event more memorable. One other variable that

00:00:51.732 --> 00:00:56.860
affects our memory is sleep. Sleep can help us consolidate our memories.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.325
Remember, however, from information that we previously discussed in this

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:04.860
lesson, that our memories are not always perfectly correct. We know that

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.413
emotions can actually distort memories. In fact, it appears that emotional

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:14.684
memories tend to be less accurate in details than nonemotional memories.
