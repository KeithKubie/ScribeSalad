(music)

00:00:04.518 --> 00:00:07.417
Anne: American cinema was born in 1893.

00:00:07.417 --> 00:00:11.088
The first film that we know of was called

00:00:11.088 --> 00:00:12.934
The Blacksmithing Scene.

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:14.911
It's a 30 second black and white short,

00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:22.235
called in actuality a brief
recording of an event.

00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:24.980
20 years into the future in 1913

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.077
you begin to see the dawn of the narrative

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:29.735
film with the film Suspense directed

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:32.227
by Lois Weber and Philips Smalley.

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:36.037
It's the story of a young
mother and she lives

00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:40.223
in a very remote area
in a home that is also

00:00:40.223 --> 00:00:42.900
managed by their house maid.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.309
We look at this film for the complexity

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.163
of the story telling.

00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:50.394
We begin to see story
progressed through editing.

00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:52.420
One day the maid just decides to quit.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.281
She leaves the mother and the baby alone.

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:57.734
The husband is in the
city and he's working.

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:00.564
Then she takes the house
key and puts it under

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:02.870
the doormat.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.180
The camera cuts to the maid walking along

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.963
the desolate road.

00:01:10.963 --> 00:01:14.077
And a vagrant passes the
maid as she's leaving

00:01:14.077 --> 00:01:15.998
the house.

00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:18.582
You then see the vagrant
walk up to the house

00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:21.367
and pick up the key.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.990
The mother then looks out the window,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.820
sees the vagrant with the key.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.534
She knows that trouble is coming.

00:01:32.534 --> 00:01:34.595
What Lois Weber and Philips Smalley

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.340
did that's really fascinating in terms

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.913
of film production was to
create a superimposition

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:42.013
of a triangle on the screen

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:43.917
and in the center is the husband

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:45.797
who receives a phone call from his wife.

00:01:45.797 --> 00:01:48.413
You see the wife on one
angle of the triangle

00:01:48.413 --> 00:01:51.066
and then you see the vagrant
at the door with the key.

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.840
So what you're seeing is this simultaneity

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.107
of action that was
never experienced before

00:01:57.107 --> 00:01:59.358
by the audience.

00:01:59.358 --> 00:02:01.861
The story goes on and becomes a chase.

00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.952
The husband gets the phone call.

00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:06.454
He steals a car along the way,

00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:10.082
which then engages the
local police to chase him.

00:02:10.082 --> 00:02:12.592
So you have this suspenseful moment

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:14.709
in what's going on in the house.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.036
The mother is hiding with the baby.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:17.493
You have the vagrant walking through

00:02:17.493 --> 00:02:18.630
the house.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.496
He's eyeing the various
valuables in the house,

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:24.310
and you have the father who is
trying to come to the rescue.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.332
Ultimately the film ends up with the dad

00:02:27.332 --> 00:02:29.196
rescuing the mother and
the child and the vagrant

00:02:29.196 --> 00:02:33.288
being taken off to prison.

00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:37.288
Pretty advanced stuff for 1913.
