00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:02.195
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
we have the radical equation,

00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:07.146
the square root of three x minus seven

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:10.213
plus the square root

00:00:10.213 --> 00:00:13.517
of two x minus one

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:15.701
is equal to zero.

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:16.888
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:16.888 --> 00:00:18.639
and see if you can solve for x

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:21.899
before we work through it together.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.344
Alright, so one thing we could do is

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:25.913
we could try to isolate
each of the radicals

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:27.604
on either side of the equation.

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:31.518
So let's subtract this one from both sides

00:00:31.518 --> 00:00:33.903
so I can get it onto the right-hand side,

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:35.925
or a version of it on the right-hand side.

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:38.038
So I'm subtracting it
from the left-hand side

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:42.826
and from the right-hand side.

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:46.048
And so, this is going to get us,

00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:49.036
that is going to get us,

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:52.326
on the left-hand side I
just have square root,

00:00:52.326 --> 00:00:54.017
these cancel out so I'm just left with

00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:57.910
the square root of three x minus seven

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.812
is going to be equal to this,

00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:04.803
the negative of the square
root of two x minus one.

00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:08.516
So now we can square both sides.

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:10.720
And we always have to be
careful when we're doing that

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.621
because whether we're
squaring the positive

00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:14.232
or the negative square root
here, we're going to get

00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:15.469
the same value.

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.461
So the solution we might
get might be the version

00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:19.745
when we're solving for
the positive square root,

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.043
not when we take the negative of it.

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:22.483
So we have to test our
solutions at the end

00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:24.173
to make sure that they are actually valid

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:25.964
for our original equation.

00:01:25.964 --> 00:01:28.817
But if you square both
sides, on the left-hand side

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:32.354
we're going to get three x minus seven,

00:01:32.354 --> 00:01:34.528
and on the right-hand
side, a negative square's

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:35.785
just a positive, and the square root of

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:40.303
two x minus one squared is
going to be two x minus one.

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:42.920
Now let's see, we can
subtract two x from both sides

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.455
to get all of our xs on one side,

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:47.840
so I'm trying to get rid of this.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.436
And we can add seven to both sides

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:52.790
because I'm trying to get
rid of the negative seven.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.688
So add seven to both sides.

00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:58.304
And we are going to get,

00:01:58.304 --> 00:02:01.775
we are going to get
three x minus two x is x,

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:04.311
is equal to negative one plus seven.

00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:06.544
x is equal to six.

00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:08.929
Now let's verify that this actually works.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.710
So, if we look at our original equation,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.816
the square root of three times six

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:19.737
minus seven, minus seven, needs to plus,

00:02:19.737 --> 00:02:24.146
plus, the square root of
two times six minus one,

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:26.832
needs to be equals to zero.

00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:28.462
So does this actually work out?

00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:30.243
Three times six minus seven.

00:02:30.243 --> 00:02:33.681
So this is going to be
the square root of eleven

00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:36.813
plus the square root of eleven

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:38.081
needs to be equal to zero,

00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:39.550
which clearly is not
going to be equal to zero.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.905
This is two square roots of eleven,

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:43.776
which does not equal zero.

00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:45.137
So this does not work, and you might say,

00:02:45.137 --> 00:02:46.253
wait, how did this happen?

00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:48.004
I did all of this nice, neat algebra,

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:49.242
I didn't make any mistakes,

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:51.023
but I got something that doesn't work.

00:02:51.023 --> 00:02:53.136
Well, this right here is
an extraneous solution.

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:54.886
Why is it an extraneous solution?

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:59.293
Because it's actually the
solution to the equation,

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:00.803
it's a solution to the equation,

00:03:00.803 --> 00:03:04.183
the square root of three x minus seven

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:08.068
minus the square root of two x minus one

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:09.426
is equal to zero.

00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:11.388
And you might say, well,
if it's a solution to that,

00:03:11.388 --> 00:03:13.773
if it's the solution to
this thing right over here,

00:03:13.773 --> 00:03:14.829
how did I get the answer

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.641
while I'm trying to do
algebraic steps there?

00:03:16.641 --> 00:03:18.421
Well, the key is when we added,

00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:20.927
when we took this on the
right-hand side and squared it,

00:03:20.927 --> 00:03:22.828
well it all boiled down to this,

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:24.851
regardless of what starting
point you started with,

00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:26.441
due to the exact same thing
you would've gotten to that

00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:28.303
say, this point right over here.

00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:30.576
So the solution to this ended up

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:32.413
being the solution to this starting point,

00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:35.176
versus the one that we
originally started with.

00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:38.619
So this one, interestingly,
has no solutions.

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:39.902
And it'd actually be fun to think about

00:03:39.902 --> 00:03:41.268
why it has no solutions.

00:03:41.268 --> 00:03:42.386
We've shown, to a certain degree,

00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:43.719
the only solution you got

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.377
by taking reasonable, algebraic steps

00:03:45.377 --> 00:03:46.579
is an extraneous one.

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.302
It's a solution to a different equation,

00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:51.158
that gets, that has a
common intermediate step,

00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:53.385
but it's also fun to think about why,

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:57.730
why this right over here is impossible.
