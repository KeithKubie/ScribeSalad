00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:11.846
&gt;&gt;Okay, so, we're going to start
off the master chart right here,

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:13.256
and the narrator introduces the film.

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.796
"Ah, the Natural Selection Pet Shop."

00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:17.606
&gt;&gt;Shawn: When they first come
into my classroom, I tell them,

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:18.906
"This is not a classroom.

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.216
You are new hires of k9 Studios, and
that's what we call our studio here."

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:25.426
And that their grade is
really their paycheck.

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:29.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Shawn Sullivan teaches
beginning through advanced animation

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:33.986
as part of the artworks career
pathway at Sheldon High School

00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:35.776
in Sacramento, California.

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.676
&gt;&gt;Shawn: Animation is definitely an
area that covers all of academics.

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:42.186
To be able to create
something in the computer,

00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:44.076
you need to understand
plotting coordinates,

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.266
so X, Y, and Z coordinates.

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:48.916
Also, if you're creating
characters, understanding anatomy,

00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:52.576
muscle structure, not only
human but also looking

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:54.006
at animal science, as well.

00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:56.946
Physics is very important
in animation,

00:00:57.096 --> 00:00:58.626
making things moving believably.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.726
&gt;&gt;Student: What you want to
do with the sneeze is try

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:03.526
to make the rodent look more round...

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:06.676
&gt;&gt;Shawn: Also, what they're
learning is what they can take

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:10.246
to any job they do -- working
with teams, coming up with an idea

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:14.256
and sharing it with others, and
seeing it being finished and created.

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:14.323
&gt;&gt;Characters: Yay!

00:01:14.323 --> 00:01:22.596
&gt;&gt;Shawn: We spend a lot of hours
together, and I really focus

00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:25.906
on the concept of being a
family and working together.

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:29.126
If one person is not focused and
not wanting to do this project,

00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:32.686
it will fall apart, but if they all
believe in each other and all want

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:35.236
to help each other and make the
person next to them even better,

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:37.316
that's how you get a strong program.

00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:39.036
&gt;&gt;Student: I think I found
all the sounds we need.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.026
&gt;&gt;Shawn: In here, we just take
what their interests are --

00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:42.836
I like to call it "stealth
teaching" --

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:46.536
and using that to teach in the
direction that they want to go in.

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:48.756
&gt;&gt;So if you're doing
up close on this shot,

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:50.586
you know you have to
focus on his size.

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:55.216
&gt;&gt;Shawn: The key is being honest with
your students and sharing with them

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.626
and trusting when they have an idea

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:00.436
and guiding them, and
they respect that.

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:00.976
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:02.616
&gt;&gt;Juan Luis: Really,
I've been spoiled here.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:05.436
Like, no other kid can say, "Oh,

00:02:05.436 --> 00:02:08.186
I got to direct a class
making an animated film."

00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:11.086
That's an experience that a lot of
people just really think is great.

00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:13.366
When I went down to interview at USC,
they were really impressed by that.

00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:14.706
&gt;&gt;Just a little more theatricality.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.386
Can you call quiet on
the set real quick?

00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:18.786
&gt;&gt;Hey, quiet on the set!

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:23.026
&gt;&gt;Megan: You just get a lot of work
skills from it, just being punctual,

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:26.856
professional, and just really
getting a feel of, all right,

00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:28.126
do I really like this stuff?

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:29.766
Is this really what
I want to go into?

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:31.296
&gt;&gt;So, where's the edit at right now?

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:33.376
&gt;&gt;Megan: This really helped me decide

00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:34.866
on what I was going to
major in in college.

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:37.966
&gt;&gt;Shawn: Doing an academy
is really important.

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:41.576
It gives a chance for the students
to be around like-minded students.

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:44.186
Already having an idea of
where they want to go to school

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:47.956
and what they want to do for a
living is a huge step for a teenager.

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.456
It motivates them by looking
at other people working

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:52.946
on the same, similar concepts.

00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:55.226
It's a very powerful tool.

00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:57.886
&gt;&gt;Do you guys need anything else
other than just the main color shots?

00:02:58.156 --> 00:02:58.516
&gt;&gt;3D.

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:02.856
&gt;&gt;Megan: Deadline for this film is
this Friday, and, yeah, right now,

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:05.976
based on what I saw this morning, it
looks like we're going to make it.

00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:06.656
&gt;&gt;Okay, cool.

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:07.626
Thanks, guys.

00:03:07.626 --> 00:03:11.976
&gt;&gt;Megan: I'm going to
really miss this studio.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.496
