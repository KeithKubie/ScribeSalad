[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:07.380
WeDeliver is an on-demand
delivery platform

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.390
that enables all of your local
businesses to deliver to you.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.600
It's extremely costly
for a local business

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.160
to offer delivery service.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.930
And what we've done is,
we've taken the crowd source

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.040
methodology and applied
it towards delivery.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.840
So a local baker, a florist,
a high-end retailer,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.580
a dry cleaner even--
we allow them to now

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.930
have the ability to
get you product to you

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.890
more convenient and
efficient and really cheap.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.310
It's a really scary process,
because at that moment,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.620
you've got this idea.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.920
You really believe in it.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.730
And it's so easy for someone
to drop that on its head,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.290
by saying, no.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.070
And as entrepreneurs,
we have to be confident

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.760
that we want to be told no.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.910
You want to get to no
as fast as you can.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.070
And that was what I did.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.760
I went out and
actually asked them,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.920
would you use this, trying
to get them to say, no.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.260
And in fact, I increased
the level of friction,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.260
to try to get nos.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.085
So that can validate,
is this real.

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:06.270
Are they really saying this?

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.745
The answer was
yes, so that's what

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:08.870
we ended up coming up with.

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:13.085
When I look at
role playing, there

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:16.970
are these moments and in gaming
that you get experience points.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.830
And I think, every
startup that I created,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.490
I gained more experience points.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.770
And so I keep leveling up.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.270
And so that's the goal, to
keep leveling up in life.
