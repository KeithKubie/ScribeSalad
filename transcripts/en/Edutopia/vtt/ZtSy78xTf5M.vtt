00:00:02.046 --> 00:00:04.256
&gt;&gt;When you're playing a game
there's this natural inclination

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:05.986
as you become better and
better to start engaging

00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:06.936
in the world in different ways.

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:09.826
Now part of that is simply to recruit
other people to game with, right.

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:12.596
So, if you're playing something
like Civilization there's a point

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:14.336
at which you need to have
other players to kind

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:16.306
of push your understanding,
push your strategy,

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.476
same thing in Guild
or multiplayer games.

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:21.506
What I'm most interested in though
is this idea that when you play

00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:24.336
through a game world, let's say that
you're playing as a roleplaying game

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.896
and you're a character who's
shaped this entire world.

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:29.656
We are starting to see some evidence
that players after playing games

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:32.206
like this will start to kind of put
down the computer or look outside

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:33.946
and say, "Well, why are
things the way they are?

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:36.726
Why is the economic system or the
political system the way it is,"

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:38.106
if you've been playing Civilization."

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:41.586
So, what we want to do with
educational games are design games

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:44.676
that try to do that, but really
build them around critical,

00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:47.906
kind of current issues, and
then get kids to be motivated

00:00:47.906 --> 00:00:50.546
and have the skills to go out
and start to solve these problems

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:52.296
as a direct result of
having played the game.

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:02.286
&gt;&gt;I study video games and learning
and I'm particularly interested

00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:04.736
in how video games function
as learning environments,

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:06.546
how game cultures around
them function,

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:09.326
and then can we design learning
environments based on those ideas.

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:13.286
So, partly what we try to do
is design games for learning,

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:16.206
but then also design kind of
social organizations around them.

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:18.836
So, a lot of this is more than
just taking games and trying

00:01:18.836 --> 00:01:20.366
to stick them, say, in a
school, but it's really

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.526
to fundamentally rethink
how we do education.

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:33.436
&gt;&gt;One thing about games is they're
really good at peaking your interest.

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:36.946
They're really good at taking
a complex sort of subject area

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:40.546
and then giving you a hook into
it so that you find it intriguing

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:42.506
and you kind of maybe
see the puzzle in it.

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:44.426
And then they're really
good drawing people

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:46.536
in so they become engaged
and evolved.

00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:47.566
They're very immersive.

00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:52.576
&gt;&gt;The next thing that games do
that's really interesting is

00:01:52.576 --> 00:01:55.446
that they actually build skills,
you have to be good at a game.

00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:58.486
People who play games develop
pattern detection skills,

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:00.576
they develop problem-solving skills.

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.736
You don't get very far in
a game if you just think

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:04.596
about doing one sort
of solution path.

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:06.506
You've got to kind of step
back when you reach problems,

00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:08.906
look at what is the most
ideal kind of solution,

00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:10.226
and then given what
you're skills are,

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:10.976
what is the best way to go forward.

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:24.416
&gt;&gt;Kids in online spaces are really
having the opportunity to take

00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:27.656
on adult kinds of roles and
do a lot of complex sort

00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:28.826
of information management.

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:32.906
If you ever tried to organize a raid
and get a hundred people from all

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:36.326
over the world to show up at the
same time, on time, to be prepared,

00:02:36.676 --> 00:02:39.786
to have all the things they
need, to not mess up the group,

00:02:39.786 --> 00:02:42.766
to stay disciplined, it's really
a complex kind of activity, right.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:45.476
And there are 13- 14-year-old
kids around the world

00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:46.636
who are doing that right now.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.686
&gt;&gt;In games you have the capacity to
do all these kinds of things, right.

00:02:54.686 --> 00:02:57.636
So, you can get involved in this
guild and help write the charter

00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.236
and kind of develop the rules.

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:02.496
In schools, unfortunately, we
still have almost all of that

00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:05.016
on either the teacher or increasingly
the federal government, right.

00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:08.306
We don't say that, as kids, alright
let's build your own constitution,

00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:11.166
let's build a charter, let's
come up with your rules.

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.746
Kids generally aren't
running the school board,

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:15.706
and that's what's happening
in games, right.

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:18.496
Kids are, literally, they're
getting to participate

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:21.166
and shape their own social
futures, shaping the social future

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.896
of their organization, and
they're having a chance to do it.

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.836
&gt;&gt;I think to me most
interesting is when you see spaces

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:36.096
that are cross-generational, right.

00:03:36.096 --> 00:03:38.946
So, if you actually see guilds
where you have kids doing that,

00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:40.516
but then there's also
grownups there too.

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:44.006
And our society is really
bad about age degradation.

00:03:44.526 --> 00:03:47.646
We have to say all the ninth graders
can be in a room, not even ninth

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:48.886
and tenth graders can be in the room.

00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:51.626
We unfortunately, if
you're learning physics,

00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:53.906
there's one physics
teacher and 30 kids.

00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:56.326
What's great about games is that
there are all these matching

00:03:56.326 --> 00:03:58.346
of people of different
abilities, different interests,

00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:00.216
all working together in
this kind of ad hock way,

00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:02.796
which is how learning happens
everywhere except for school, right.

00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:06.036
That's how learning has always
happened before nineteen hundred,

00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:09.596
it's how learning will probably
happen from here on out.

00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:12.256
&gt;&gt;Listen to me, this
is a peace party.

00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:17.496
I want you to invite every man,
woman and child to our bueatiful city

00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:20.526
to protest and to rally against
taking away human rights.

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:22.146
&gt;&gt;When most people think about games

00:04:22.146 --> 00:04:25.136
and civic engagement they think
those two things kind of have--

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:26.626
nothing could have less
to do with one another

00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:28.126
than video games and
civic engagement.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:31.006
But actually there seems to
be a small, but important,

00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:32.096
relationship between them.

00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:35.086
And I think as educators we
can leverage what games do

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:37.296
and really foster civic engagement.

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:44.176
&gt;&gt;We have a game, for example,
called Citizen Science.

00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:47.086
And this is a game where you're
roleplaying as an average citizen.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.466
It takes place here in Madison.

00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:51.626
And what you do in the game is that
you come to learn that the lakes

00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:54.026
in this area are very
endangered, which in fact they are.

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:56.396
They may become eutrophic
in a few years to the point

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.726
where you can't swim in them at all.

00:04:57.956 --> 00:05:01.406
And so what you do in the game
is that you're a kid who goes

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:02.406
through a series of quests

00:05:02.406 --> 00:05:03.886
to understand what's
happening to the lake.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:06.416
And then if you go through it
right you actually change the lake

00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:07.186
and change the future.

00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:09.686
Now, our hope is that you play the
game, you put it down, and you say,

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:12.516
"Oh, well, why don't we
do something about it?"

00:05:12.516 --> 00:05:14.676
So, we've basically taught you how
to do everything you're going to need

00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:15.636
to do to change the lake.

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:18.446
We've taught you what the root
causes are, how the science works,

00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:20.816
who you have to talk to
to get legislation passed.

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:23.586
And so what we're hoping is that by
the end we'll have kind of a mass

00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:26.916
of students who are interested in
the topic, they feel empowered,

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:28.256
they have the skills, and then
they're actually motivated

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:28.976
to go do something about it.

00:05:37.076 --> 00:05:38.666
&gt;&gt;Something that we've been seeing
happening here that's really

00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:40.846
interesting is that a lot
of the media messaging

00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:43.086
and the organization is
being taken up, of course,

00:05:43.086 --> 00:05:45.686
by kids and they're using media
to do it, things like Twitter.

00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:49.536
And because the social events
and protests and rallies

00:05:49.536 --> 00:05:52.966
that are happening here have
largely been driven by grassroots,

00:05:52.966 --> 00:05:54.636
it's largely been driven
by participatory media,

00:05:55.046 --> 00:05:58.066
the mainstream media is not covering
it, so we have the largest rally

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.846
in the history of Wisconsin
last weekend.

00:05:59.846 --> 00:06:02.596
And at best Fox News had one camera.

00:06:02.676 --> 00:06:04.276
CNN cut away for about
ten seconds, right.

00:06:04.566 --> 00:06:06.096
And as people are realizing
that okay,

00:06:06.096 --> 00:06:09.336
the corporate-owned mass media is
not going to get our message out,

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:09.976
we need other ways to do it.

00:06:10.056 --> 00:06:13.226
&gt;&gt;Woman: I think I would try and
convince him to just negotiate

00:06:13.326 --> 00:06:15.546
and stop being so proud and stubborn.

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:17.766
&gt;&gt;Man: I'd tell him to listen
to the people of the state.

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:21.556
&gt;&gt;Man: If I had to say something, I'd
say, "As much as you want to deny it,

00:06:22.776 --> 00:06:24.736
these are your constituents."

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:29.016
&gt;&gt;Woman: I would tell him
he needs to stop and listen

00:06:29.016 --> 00:06:30.286
to the people of Wisconsin.

00:06:30.336 --> 00:06:30.976
Don't get me started.

00:06:31.046 --> 00:06:32.816
&gt;&gt;You see things like
mobilization and using Twitter.

00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:36.666
You see people sharing--
producing videos and sharing videos

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:37.666
to get their message out.

00:06:37.726 --> 00:06:40.866
That sort of instinct to do that
I think comes in part from growing

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:44.476
up with participatory media
like games, but now a generation

00:06:44.476 --> 00:06:46.246
of kids actually has
many of these skills

00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:47.326
and so they're starting to do it.

00:06:47.326 --> 00:06:49.346
And they're starting to
kind of fill that void

00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:51.296
where other media aren't stepping up.

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:57.396
&gt;&gt;A group of our students launched
a website because they realize

00:06:57.396 --> 00:07:00.926
that information was really hard to
get and it was not freely available

00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:04.316
in the capital, so they launched a
website overnight that let you know

00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:05.386
where the protests were happening,

00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:07.356
what was needed, anyone
could post to it.

00:07:07.356 --> 00:07:10.316
It was featured on CNN by
the next day, and, of course,

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.146
the capital had restricted access
to it because it was deemed

00:07:13.146 --> 00:07:14.826
to be perhaps a little controversial.

00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:17.136
And this is something, as a
gamer, people kind of actually do.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:20.856
They look and they say well where
are the weak spots, what do we need

00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:24.776
to fix, and they are inclined to kind
of jump in and apply their skills

00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:25.776
to try get something done.

00:07:30.196 --> 00:07:32.096
&gt;&gt;Well, a lot of the skills
are really related to design.

00:07:32.156 --> 00:07:34.206
Really good players, if
they're playing collaboratively,

00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:35.796
have to form teams,
for example, right.

00:07:35.796 --> 00:07:36.846
So, they have to design
their own team,

00:07:36.886 --> 00:07:39.376
they have to design their own kind
of team rules, they have to guild,

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:40.236
they have to write a charter.

00:07:40.236 --> 00:07:42.346
They have to build a website,
they have to recruit people.

00:07:42.656 --> 00:07:45.156
So, they're designing their
own sort of social systems.

00:07:45.156 --> 00:07:48.146
Now, the skills that go into
that involve a lot of things.

00:07:48.146 --> 00:07:50.916
So, one is information gather
and information management.

00:07:51.156 --> 00:07:54.196
So, when you're doing this kind of
gaming you're having to monitor a lot

00:07:54.196 --> 00:07:56.916
of information streams, choose
which ones you think are relevant,

00:07:57.336 --> 00:08:00.946
and then make decisions so to manage
your own information flow coming in.

00:08:00.946 --> 00:08:02.916
So, if you're playing something
like World of Warcraft,

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.716
having to customize your interface
to get the information that you need

00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:07.456
to do better is a fundamental skill,

00:08:07.496 --> 00:08:09.216
it happens in something
like Starcraft as well.

00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:11.706
It's very similar to doing
civic participation in the sense

00:08:11.706 --> 00:08:14.406
of what kind of information am
I getting, where can I get more,

00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:18.596
what don't I know, what are other, if
you have a strong feeling on one side

00:08:18.596 --> 00:08:21.876
of an issue, do you know enough about
what the other side, say, is doing,

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:24.086
do you know enough about
kind of what's happening

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:25.376
from different information sources.

00:08:25.556 --> 00:08:28.316
That's part of why I think
games are such a key piece

00:08:28.316 --> 00:08:29.796
of what we call a participatory
media,

00:08:29.796 --> 00:08:31.896
the idea that you are
actually shaping the content,

00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:34.446
shaping the experience,
helping shape the world.
