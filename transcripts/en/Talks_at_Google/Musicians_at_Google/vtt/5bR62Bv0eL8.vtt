are so sweet to me.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.658
I'm so glad I didn't

Do you know this is what
I absolutely love to do?

So y'all make me feel like
they're going to have to turn

00:00:17.563 --> 00:00:19.813
the lights out on us tonight
because I'm going to keep

00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:20.010

I love you, Ryan.

Ryan told me to keep singing
