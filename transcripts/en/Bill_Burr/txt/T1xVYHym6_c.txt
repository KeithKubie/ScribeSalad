Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Monday morning. Now it's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:00:12       Aw,

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       I'm just checking in on you. I am just checking in on. You've seen how your week's going. How's your week going? Oh yeah. Really? Oh, you don't say oh God bless you. God bless you. God Love Ya. God fucking love Ya. Um, I'm having a great week. Um, we just, today we did the table read for episode 10, the final episode of season four.

Speaker 3:          00:00:40       Doctor Dee Dee.

Speaker 2:          00:00:42       Um, that's it. It's fucking killed. And I think that we got, uh, coming together. This was going to look like it's an even better season than last season. Um, amazing writers' room this year. So I mean every year of course, but this year went to another level, so thank you to everybody helping out and all of a sudden the clouds is stat and a pot and old freckles. I'm going to have time to aroma size. You know, I docked out the, um, all things comedy we're doing, we're doing some business with the comedy central, made some standup specials, and then we have a, a sort of a premium blend type show that we, uh, been recording the last two days. It shooting at I should say. And then a, tonight's the last night. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:01:28       where the fuck is that? I always forget the name of that Damn Theater. Let me see here. It's on seventh AV theater. Seventh Av, Los [inaudible] Los Angeles. I did a standup show there before the terragon or something like that. Is that what it's called? You fucking asshole bill. Why the Hell Tara Gone Theater? That's it. The terragon theater. Um, does that it? No, that's not it. Hang on a second.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       The teragram ballroom, that's where the show is at tonight. And I'll be doing like a, like a half hour after all the young bucks go up there and they do their thing. Um, I'm going to close out the show with a half hour stuff. Most of it new shit since my last taping on my special. So, uh, look at me. I got this special behind me. I got the, this taping behind me. I got the fucking, my s my efforts for families kind of getting behind me. I've got to edit it for them, you know, help edit it for the next, I don't know how many months, but uh, yeah, it's all good. So I don't, I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do with myself. Maybe get caught up on my reading. Um, speaking of getting caught up, how about your Boston Bruins last night? How'd you like that? Well, if you didn't, you're from Montreal or Toronto. Everybody else. That's what I love about being a Bruins fan is around the league. People love us. I've never seen a team when less cups and have more hatred around the league. You know what I mean? You'd think we were actually successful and so we want one cup since 1972. Why don't you guys relax? All right. What do you fucking boots? Is there anything worse than listening to somebody complaining about, you know, physical play,

Speaker 2:          00:03:23       some of these fucking Toronto fans? I mean, I know Bruins fan is probably just as bad, but of course I don't look at that shit. You know, they lose game two and all of a sudden that they're putting out pictures of like the refs wearing Bruins jerseys. It's like, well, were they wearing Toronto jerseys in the first fucking game? You assholes. Um, if we lose the refs cheated pool, um, no, it was another, uh, heart stopping game where we, I forget what the fuck we were up. We went up like five, three years. I thought the game was fucking over and then all of a sudden they, they closed it to like, I dunno, four to three or something like that that my, my daughter came down. I missed a little bit of it. I, I've just been catching it in patch is a like patches of it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       Um, even though I'm emotionally all in because everybody in the house laughed at me when the Bruins scored. How about Marshawn sticking with that pass? Huh? I don't know. I think he gave it to, I think it was the to pasta knock first pass. Went into the Defenseman, skates a nice play, and then went right back on his stick and they gave my day all right there. Fucking Freddo. Um, loved it. And the shocker of all shockers, Tampa Bay losing four straight, give it up for your Columbus blue jackets dire right now they're going to have a long layoff in the big thing they gotta worry about. It's a let down. I mean, they gotta be flying. I after beaten this Jay, but last time I checked, you gotta Win 16 Games before your host hoists, Lord Stanley over your head. I'm an old white guy and I'm talking in Queen Shit. Cliches. Can't even say what I'm trying to say. I want to how long you could filibuster as a sports announcer. Just saying all that cliched stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       Maybe by going out there, I played like a team. Everybody was involved or tell you when you get all lined fire and good things are gonna happen. They went to the net and I'll tell you, that's where the goals are. Okay? You can't be out there on the perimeter. Nobody's ever scored from behind the goal except for Wayne Gretzky and you're not Wayne Gretzky. So I'll tell you why. Now you've got to get your fucking Canadian as Russian ass or whatever the fuck you are right in front of that Goddamn now. Cause that's where the goals are. Yeah, he's God. You have kids say they're on the wrong side of the puck. They trying to get on Instagram. Make it a fucking degree of difficulty. This isn't high dive. We're not high dive in here. We're playing hockey.

Speaker 5:          00:05:38       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:39       If I see one more fucking mascot and one of these Goddamn Marines, I'm going to throw a kid down on the ice mark. Oh, getting a lot of your anger route. Um, and I watched a little bit of NBA basketball or watch some of the, uh, the Boston Celtics, uh, and you know, great game there. We fucking won that game. But uh, I'd be honest with you, dude, I don't even know what the fuck goes on in the NBA anymore. I try to watch it, but uh, I have a theory on what happened to the NBA. All right. Sit down for this one. If you want to hear somebody who was picked last in gym class, tell you what, tell you what's wrong with the NBA. All right. I'm going big on this one. I'm going to say it all right. Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player of all time was also, uh, one of the worst things that ever happened to NBA hoop. Okay. The same way Eddie van Halen in 1978 with van Halen one was one of the worst things that ever happened to guitar playing in the 1980s. All right. And basically why I'm saying is when you have somebody of their level of talent,

Speaker 2:          00:06:48       just an absolute genius, they are so far beyond everybody else that when mere mortals interpret what they do, they get it wrong because they are limited by the talent that they were blessed with. So with Eddie van Halen, I know I've used him as a reference before. So many people that came after him, what they looked at Eddie and they would just like take guitar, Solo plays many notes as you can within whatever the four bars that you have. And then it just became noise. The whole fucking, it's some of these fucking guitar Solos. I mean, I know these guys could play, but like, you know, it's just like, it's almost like you ever get cornered in a party by some fucking coke head and there's, there's no back and forth. There's no conversation that just fucking punishing you. Yeah. That's what a lot of those soldiers were.

Speaker 2:          00:07:40       All right. And before Michael Jordan came along, you had to have a big man to, when you had to feed your big man and blah, blah, Blah and all that shit. And he came in with such a talent. He said, not only do I not need a big man, I'm going to jump over your big man and you fucking power forward and I'm going to sell dominate this game that the rest of my teammates are. Their nickname is going to be my supporting cast nine oh one he started, you know, passing the ball and everything. That's when he started to beat the Pistons. I'm not saying he was just totally doing it himself, but like all these people that came after him grew up, they wanted to be like Mike and then not Mike, but there's still play in that way. So everybody tried to fucking win and it didn't work.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       So the fallout of that, I believe, was then the pile on championship team, because Michael set the bar at six championships in the modern era. If you wanted to beat Mike or be as good as him, you had to win six. And people just weren't good enough to fucking do it. So they just had the pile on teams and it started with Colby and check with the Lakers, and then you had the big three in Boston and then the Miami fucking hate. And now you've got the, uh, the Golden State Warriors. If you watch it, I swear to God. And this, this fall out of that is you now have the person that's taken it beyond Jordan where it's like, not only do I not need my other teammates, I don't even like being coached. So you have somebody out there, you know, people always, oh dude, he's got like 21 points in the first half.

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       It's like, dude, the only fucking number that matters is the score went down by three. I don't give a fuck east east, this person is, I just see these guys, they turn their team into this one dimensional, an attack. It's like this guy's going to try to fucking beat the entire fucking team. Um, and somehow if you play team basketball, like the San Antonio Spurs, nobody pays attention. And I saw this thing on Instagram showing all these big stars that have since retired and they go, who do you miss the most? And of course everybody's picking Coby. I mean, he's probably, I don't know, I would say he's gotta be at least the top two, one on one fucking players of all time. Absolute beast. And then you combine that with his wanting to win and all of that shit. However, sitting right in the middle and nobody talking about them was fucking Tim Duncan.

Speaker 2:          00:10:04       And I might just be an old fucking asshole here. But what I liked about Tim Duncan is Tim Duncan could win with anybody where I felt like Coby could win, but he needed everybody. He needed like a zillion fucking free agents every fucking year it seemed they would just every three years they would clean house and he would get a fresh batch of some of the best people in the NBA to play with. Um, I don't know. So when I watched the fucking game now I, I'll tell you, when you got to declare his caliber, you know, he's going to have to get his touches. It's like, dude, fuck his touches. I was watching the game last night. Okay. And uh, what's his face, Reggie Miller. We go into the fourth quarter. I think we were up by like two points. He goes, you know, for the, you know, the rest of this game is going to be all Kyrie.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       Now maybe he was saying passing the ball or whatever too. But I dunno, I just hear that all the time and I've taught, it makes me feel so old. I'm, I sit there yelling at the TV like, Reggie, you don't believe that you didn't play that kind of ball. Even when you were fucking destroy in the Knicks, you still knew you had to play team ball. I know. I don't know. Whatever. Okay. I'm done with my old man rant. All right. But I think that that's, that is basically, like I said, I'm done and I'm still gonna go here. I think that that's what's happened with basketball and for an old guy like me, that's why I don't get it when I'm watching it, I'm like, oh my God, they're down by 10. And that guy came down, the court didn't pass it and just launched a three and throw up a fucking brick.

Speaker 2:          00:11:32       They're going to call a time out and put them on the bench and they don't. It's just how it's played now. So, but what I will say, there are things that are way better. Okay. Before I'm, I'm that fucking asshole. You know, giving you the global warming speech about professional sports. Um, in no time in basketball, have there ever been this many people over the height of six foot 10 that can hit a fucking three pointer like a guard. I mean it's, it's fucking unbelievable. So there are whatever they're out there are better things. Um, I will tell you though, uh, NHL has changed a lot since I was a kid and I actually, I like, I mean I missed the fights. I do miss two line passes in that type of thing. But it's, it's a fucking great game. It's still, you can't have one guy go out and try to just take over the entire fucking gay, by the way. How about a Vegan knocking out that fucking 19 year old can such a weird thing. He's 33. He outweighed the kid by fucking 40 pounds. The kid asked him to fight. What's he supposed to do? Jesus Christ again, the old two piece there.

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       I felt bad for that kid, but I also respect them having the balls. You know, 19 years old, you're playing in the NHL and you take on a 33 year old Russian. I mean, you got balls. I got to give them that. Um, I don't even know what that series is at right now, but um, hang on a second. Washington Post. Why the fuck does it say that? Since when the hell do I look at that? Maybe I looked at an article. Washington capitals. All right. Why would I want to go to Wikipedia? Why is that my default fucking thing every time. Don't enough people. Not Enough people. Go to your Goddamn site that you got to fucking directly right there. Um, all right. Washington capitals. The series is two games to one now. It is fucking wide open. Wide. Fucking open. Now the Tampa Bay is, is out of it is ever bet everybody's eyes fucking lit up. What a story that would be of the fucking,

Speaker 6:          00:13:42       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:42       Columbus blue jackets end up winning the east. Can you imagine that? I'm actually enjoying watching them. Wanting just to see fucking Twitter. Really smiling. I've never seen that guy smile so much of my life. When they went up two games to none, he was like the smile on his face. The way he was holding his hands together. He looked like he was watching his firstborn take their first few steps. And as a recovering angry lunatic, it's fun to see an angry guy like that show. Just pure joy. Um, I feel like in his head it, he felt like finally I drew up a game plan that my team heard and they completely fucking executed it to a t and it fucking worked. I mean, that's got to end. It's gotta be Nirvana for F for a coach. So that was definitely a definitely fun to watch. But I apologize to all the young people listen to this, be bitching about the game, but those are just my theories. Um, and as you get older, the more theories you have because it keeps that voice out. He had, that's guy guy. You're going to die soon.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       Keeps that out of your fucking head. Um, anyways, how many minutes have I done here? How many new meds at the time for the, the read already? Fucking penguins lose four straight. Now is that guy in the front office? Uh, Josh, Anna Myers, who's taping is set tonight, uh, from the goddamn comedy jam and the 500 podcast. He's a, he was telling me that, uh, the capital's last year, it didn't pay their fee, their front office guy, that GM and all he did was just lead them, you know, put together a team that led them to their first Stanley Cup in the history of the team and they don't pay him. They went a little Theo Epstein, dare I say

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       number that Theo Epstein ended up fucking 86 year curse and they started fucking with his money. He's like, I'm Outta here. And then, no, no, no, no, no, no. Then they paid him. Then a few years later he was gone. That guy, he's gotta be the greatest a front office guy ever. The guy ended almost a combined 200 years of curses and we wouldn't pay him. Speaking of which, how about your Boston Red Sox? My Gut, all I've been hearing is the stories. I haven't had time to watch. Yankees are kicking our ass and there in fucking last place. A little bit of a hangover from the world series party. Once again, it goes to Wikipedia. Like I don't know what the Boston Red Sox are. All right, I know what they are. They're a fucking last place team right now. We lose five to three from the new, from your New York Yankees and that, that game, I believe we're six and 13. I wonder, you know how many fucking assholes at new, at Yankee Stadium. We're too busy under the stadium. Eaton prime rib. I just have to say as a fucking baseball fan, that fucking uh, Roman feast that they have for everybody down behind home plate. It's just, it's the fucking worst. You're the New York Yankees. You have the most fucking world series titles. You have the most titles. Anybody in the four major sports and, and where are we? Where are your fucking fence?

Speaker 5:          00:16:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       Down there talking to fucking Rachael Ray. We have a fucking celebrity chef is down there cooking for him. Fucking watching the game to stay home. Stay home. You [inaudible] I actually got those seats one time I went to a game, but I mean, at least 10 fucking years ago. I forget how long ago that Steve has been around, but it feels like it was like 10 years ago, maybe eight years ago. And I sat down there, I just loaded up, got my food and got the fuck out there. And I watched the game and it was ridiculous. Like the Yankees of course, probably we're in first place. And to sit there you felt like they were like, you know, already mathematically eliminated. Um, I dunno, that's a sad thing. And they said, well, you know, that's how it is. It's like, no, it's just greed. It's greed by the fucking owners where that capitalism thing, well, you can't just be a fucking billionaire.

Speaker 2:          00:17:42       You gotta be a multibillionaire. Yes. And uh, to the detriment. I don't begrudge anybody, God knows on my tax rent, I don't progress as long as you pay your fucking taxes, um, but grudge anybody making any more money. But when it's detrimental to your product out there right now, that's when you got to take a step back and, you know, try to figure out what matters. Um, I dunno, I gotta I gotta fucking, uh, I guess sit down and watch the game. I have had a ridiculous urge now that I have a little bit of time off here. I mean, I'm going to Iceland during this toy that goes from Iceland, Israel, but I really have a, I have a couple few weeks off in May before it starts to get crazy again. And uh, I would love to go to a fucking Dodger's game. I think like an old man, you know, it fucking keeps score and have myself a fucking hot dog. I only wish there was a smoking section if I could just sit there and smoke cigars, God dammit. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:18:50       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:51       In hand with one of my cigar buddies like Bert Kreischer, you know, Brits always down to fucking smoke a stick. Josh, Adam Meyers, you know, um, be a hell of a thing or Mike binder who actually directed my latest special coming out. And when you guys see how fucking beautiful this thing is, you might actually forget this shitty material you're listening to and that's what we're going for. All right, let's do the advertising here. Butcher box, everybody. Oh, before I forget, I get to tell you the latest, cutest thing that my daughter did, right? The love of my life, the apple of my eye. Um,

You know, you sear it on both sides, up top and then you, you finish it in the oven with the heat thermometer did this, you don't overcook it, dry it out the fucking thing.

Speaker 2:          00:20:56       Worst thing ever. It's really involved and there's a couple of reducing of liquids and putting pork chops in a, in a, in a, in a, an aluminum tent.

Speaker 2:          00:25:44       Uh, go down there and say that you were there for the first, his first headlining gig down there. Um, last I talked to him, I think he was doing a bunch of radio down there. So I've been a lot of, you know, that he's, he's in town. Uh, but I was talking to him on the phone about, um, that whole theory that I had on like basketball because he was laughing, you know, he always laughs at me because, you know, he's like the fucking, and he's a kid to me, you know, wearing the Jordans and all that shit and I'm this fucking old man wearing a fucking Irish sweater.

Speaker 2:          00:26:16       Oh, I hate how true that is. And I was saying like, dude, I swear to God, they, they treat this stars in this, in the NBA, they treat them like hot chicks, you know, I guess they kind of do that in all leagues, but I dunno, I have no idea. Bill, please don't go back to your stupid theories about a game. You were never really that good at. You know what? Fair enough. Fair enough is my impression of a fucking Laker Fan. Oh yeah. Of Colby said bad. How come he also won an Oscar? Why does he have a fucking Boston accent? Bill? Let me do that again. MMM. Oh my God.

I still got another three minutes. Um, so anyways, tonight and we'd be down with that fucking theater. The ballroom there, the terragon ballroom a, is that what it's called? I gotta look up ballroom. Is Tara gone like a food? I Dunno. No, that's Tilapia. That's a fish. The fuck is terragon. The Terra Graham is Tara gonna Spice terragon spice. Yeah, it is. All right. Okay. I thought I was going fucking crazy. Oh, I bet a lot of terror gun's been putting in bags of weed before. Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:27:51       I wonder what it's good for. Tara gone is so good. If you have tingling in your ass, just rub a little bit. All right. Terragon is a, is a spices of perennial herbs in the sunflower family. I knew I didn't like them. It's a redhead. You don't like anything about the sun? Uh, it is widespread in the wild across much of your Asia and North America. America. What is your Asia, is that Europe infused Asia? Yeah, and his cult is that the Middle East and is cultivated for culinary and medical purposes. You know the amount of people, if you ask them what continent Middle East is in, um, they would not guess Asia. No, they would not. And then Turkey, I believe is half in Europe, half an Asia. I don't know bill, but we're all half listening at this point. Okay. You're going to fucking shit on the NBA and then give us what a geography lesson via a spice.

Speaker 2:          00:28:49       Nobody gives a fuck about. All right. Fair enough. Fair enough. Um, all right. Listen, God bless. All of you. Have a wonderful weekend. Let's go Bruins. Let's go. Celtics Red Sox. It's not too late to turn it around. I'm sure ESPN is already having the sky for it. Is it, is it too early to make a move? Uh, it's still snow on top of the green monster. Um, anyways, there's going to be a little break here. Enjoy some music and then they're going to be another half hour bonus material of a Thursday afternoon just before Friday, Monday morning podcast from a Thursday earlier this year or from seven years ago. Whenever the fuck I started doing this. I'm sorry if this podcast was a little bit off. I was icing my calves the entire time. Um, one of the things, I swear to God, I didn't realize how fucked up my God damn body is.

Speaker 2:          00:29:48       I'm still undoing 40 years. I'm talking, I'm 50. Yeah, 40 years. Cause I feel like the first 10 years it's like a brand new car and you can run around, do whatever. Somewhere in like my teens, I had my first threw out my back and I'm finally fucking getting this shit worked out. But uh, Jesus Christ, dude, I swear to God, my calves, the lady, she went to put her fucking elbow in it. I felt like I literally had like a softball size, like ball of Hornets in each of my calves. Like I was like popping up off the table.

Speaker 2:          00:30:26       She had to take like this candle thing. She like, like I didn't know what the fuck it is. Like she likes it, it heats it up and she has to hold it like a half inch away from the skin to like melt up, melt all of the fucking Gristle I've had from years and years of just, you know, nobody's stretched in the 80s you just worked out. I used to bench do all the dumb 80 shit right? And that's how I fucked up my shoulders. And then I would get on a bike and I would ride it for like 15 miles every single day, 18 on Saturday, and then I would take a day off on Sunday. We'll your shredded bill. Yes I was. I was shredded and a but I never stretched and now I'm paying the price for it. Now I look like a fucking bald freckled Mister Magoo limping around my house.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       I literally sit down for like 10 minutes watching TV and when I stand up, I feel like I've been, you know that feeling you have when you've been asleep for eight hours for all you are the old people out there of people beginning to feel old. I've said this before in the podcast and God damn, and I'm going to say it again before you get out of bed in the morning. All right, take your toes and pointed back at your knees. If you immediately feel a Charley Horse, just point your feet in the opposite direction and it'll release and you'll be all right. But pointed met your needs. If you can, I'm doing it right now. Oh, it feels great, right? You just leave it there for like, you know, a good 30 seconds, then go in the other direction. Point in the other way to get a Charlie horse that way.

Speaker 2:          00:31:53       Same thing. Just bring your feet back up and it'll go away. Hopefully. But I'm not a professional, so don't hold me accountable here. And then once you've done those two stretches, move your feet clockwise and counterclockwise and uh, and then get up. Don't get up. Cause what fucks you up is that first step, that first step of the day when you haven't stretched and well, what a way to start, you know, you know, like, you know when you get out of bed, you just take that first step, right? You wake up, your wife or husband or whatever, you know, you don't want to do that shit. All right, that's it. This is a very old podcasts. You know, if I keep podcasting like this, complaining about sports leagues and my physical ailments, I think my next big advertiser is going to be like Geritol did they still make that shit? They used to always have that on uh, the Lawrence Welk show. If you do like these ads for Geritol Geritol is that how you spell it? Chevre. Tall liquids. It's still exists. What is it for now? The one time I want, I want fucking Wikipedia to help me out. I think it's, it's spying on me. All right, well we're making him mad. Let it go to Google. Wiki.

Speaker 2:          00:33:07       Geritol is United States trademark name for various dietary supplements, past and present. Oh, see what they did was they changed with the time and I see, remember that I'm going to lunch. Well, good night. Sleep tight

Speaker 8:          00:33:22       and pleasant dreams to you is the whitest show ever. There is a wish and a prayer for every three become true. I swear to God. Z on the south end of the show. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:31       And uh,

Speaker 8:          00:33:32       two we meet [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:33:36       adios. Or of wealth. This is them like in a very like passive aggressive way. Like shouting out all the people that we had oppressed. Avi does a night, we had the, the, the Mexicans in there, the French and the fucking, the Germans right there. What do we do to the French, French and Indian war right there. I don't know about near America. There's, there's a, there's a, this it

Speaker 2:          00:34:01       America's like Tom Brady were like, he's beat every team in the league. I think at this point we've defeated,

Speaker 9:          00:34:08       we've defeated everybody. You know I'm cool. Of course I'm kidding.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       I'll tell you, you know what? I'm Manny Pacquiao. Fight his number. That patio, uh, uh, Floyd Mayweather fight. That should have happened for 10 years and it never did that. That's, that's the United States and Russia. I think by the time we get together, no one's going to give a fuck. That's my prediction. All right, old fucking bald. Freckled asshole. Thanks for cheering me up. Fuck all y'all. I'm sorry. All right. Enjoy the music and enjoy the bonus half hour. Have a great weekend and I'll see you on Monday.

Speaker 10:         00:35:04       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:35:07       hold on. It's built bird. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, April 18th, 2011 fuck. I almost said it perfectly. I was so focusing on saying 2011 clearly I fucked up April. Did you catch that? I say April, April 18th let me try that again. Build built our starts his podcast. Hey to hey, what's going on everybody? It's built bird is some money. Morty podcasts for April 18th, 2011 I can't say without slowing down like some second grader trying to read out of his book. Greenfield USA. Did anybody else read that one? I was talking to somebody the other day. That's the last geography class I had in the United States of America was in second grade. I read a book called Greenfield USA and I loved it. They talked about all the different goddamn states, you know, they talk about the heartland and they'd show us a little pictures, some farmer with the cow holding a bottle of milk and I remember thinking, Wow, I wish I lived on a farm and I had a cow.

Speaker 4:          00:36:12       You know, my little imagination running wild. Then they just cut it out and now look, look at Americans. You know, we can't find shit anymore. Someone was telling me the other day they found somebody, they were quizzing these college kids and kids were putting like Delaware, like where New Hampshire is. You know, that's like that to me that is a fucking deal breaker. Like if I, if I was dating a girl, right? Hottest girl on the Goddamn planet. And if she thought Delaware was where was where like New Hampshire was, you know, I w I would end that relationship within eight months because she's hot. I continue fucking her and then, uh, hopefully I'd get tired of her, but in the back of my head it would just be keeping this bitch doesn't know where the states are. Well, why, why would that matter? I mean, everybody has the talent.

Speaker 4:          00:37:06       Everybody has their good side and their bad side. Why did women just defend every fucking woman out there? Is it because there's more of you than there are of us? Is that what it is? You just gotta be constantly spinning broad shit in a positive way as you guys just sit there fucking battling with each other, Huh? Is that what it is? I don't know. Why is my head so fucking itchy this week? Um, are you supposed to wash your hair every day? I hear different things. You're not supposed to, are you? You're supposed to let your natural oils produce. Is that what it is? You know, walking around like some stinky European, you know, getting off your fucking awful peewee Herman Bicycle. What is it with Europe in those old bicycles? Is He, because you guys have such small roads over there, is that what it is that you guys can't progress in a bicycle kind of way?

Speaker 4:          00:38:03       You know? Is that why we win the Tour de France every year when we go over there and all those, you ever see the bikes that they ride? Even like the bikes that they ride in the Tour de France, the Italian bikes are terrible, horrible bikes. Just trying to get them going just in case I have any Italian fucking listeners over there. Bellissimo Mangia Mangia you know, bad. I want to fucking go to Italy and just gained 900 pounds. Evidently you don't because they haven't fucked with their food over there. I've been reading more and more about food. Basically what we eat over is, is it the closest thing to straight up poison? I don't even think we're fat, lazy fucks. I just think they're poisoning us. Um, like I guess the Pasta over there in Italy is like, I don't know. It doesn't gluten free. Whatever the fuck that means.

Speaker 4:          00:38:50       I don't know what glutenous but evidently you don't want a lot of it. Your Pasta and their shit over there. It's gluten free. I don't mean, I don't know if that means there's no gluten over there or the gluten they have is not oppressed like it is in this country. I don't know what it is, but all I know is those motherfuckers over there, you know, they just sit there, this eat spaghetti all day. They have conversations with the shit hanging out of their mouth. You know, using that tie is a napkin and everybody has a Ferrari. Isn't that what it is? You guys know what I did this week? You know what I did this fucking week? I actually went down and I finally decided I'm getting a second car. I decided, fuck it. I'm telling you, that shit over there in Japan really fucked with me. You know, considering I live on a fault line, all right, I realize I need to live for today and I also realize I need to be prepared in case some of that shit went down. So my first step in secure in my perimeter is all of them. Good old boys do down the south. Everybody makes fun of them.

Speaker 4:          00:39:57       Hey, we're all just fucking stupid rednecks, right? Those rednecks are the smartest motherfuckers on the planet as far as they are ready for. When the shit goes down, they're ready. All right? They got trucks, they got guns. They know how to kill Shit. Skin it, gut it, cook it, eat it, fuck it. They know how to do all of that. Laid out a head for the hills, man, they know how to do that. They live in the middle of fucking nowhere. The great thing about living in the middle of fucking nowhere is you don't have that many games on your schedule. You know what I mean? You live in the city. Okay? You got a full schedule of potential zombies and whatever coming over the fucking Goddamn rail trying to run up the stairs to your apartment. Okay? I don't care how many fucking bullets you got.

Speaker 4:          00:40:41       You're going to run out and eventually they're going to overrun. Yet they're going to take your shit and fucking have sex with your dead body. Jesus bill. Really? Yeah. Really? That's how it goes down in the apocalypse. Those rednecks, they live in the middle of nowhere. They got a big field all around their house. They got like 12 kids so they can all look out every fucking window. Who's kidding? Who? They can put four kids for their three windows right in each window on all sides of their little fucking outhouse, and there's no way to sneak up on them. Yeah, you got to crawl on your fucking elbows. You're not going to do it. You're going to leave him alone. They live in the middle of fucking nowhere. But when you live in the city,

Speaker 4:          00:41:23       that's when you got to get worried. You know, unless you're lucky enough to live in a gated community, gated community. You know, why did I say that? Pick up the papers. Pick up the papers. You know, the gated community, you know, either you're so famous or you've stolen so much from regular people that you feel the need to live behind a fucking wall. You know? Have you guys noticed that on Google maps that when you try to take the little guy and bring him down into a gated community, they won't let it do it? You know? Why are they so fucking special? What did they do?

Speaker 11:         00:42:01       You know,

Speaker 4:          00:42:03       have you guys do me a favor? Can, can you guys, my listeners now, you should not do this. You shouldn't do this. I'm not advocating doing this. Wink, wink. But, uh, why don't you sprays, paint something on the wall outside of gated community that just makes those people not feel so God damn comfortable. You know, I'm sick of them being Cousey smug counts. Just sitting in there thinking everything's going to be all right. Just do something. Don't do anything to any of them. Just spray paint something crazy like, hey fuckers, your next.

Speaker 11:         00:42:44       MMM,

Speaker 4:          00:42:45       where's the bailout? I Dunno what the fuck. Just write something that's vague that kind of includes all of them. So they don't know who's a target just so they're a little bit nervous when they're in there eating their gluten free pasta that they have flown in,

Speaker 11:         00:43:00       you know?

Speaker 4:          00:43:02       Oh, so anyways, so you know what I did? I went down to this, oh Jesus. What the fuck did I just do? Oh, I thought I just hit that you were at they raised button. No. So anyways, so I went down to this, this place where they specialize in old mustangs and I went down there and I was going to a, I was going to order one and just say fuck it. This is the year I want, this is what I want on it. Tell me how much it fucking costs and I'm going to book some road gigs and uh, do the level of Catholic guilt, even though I don't even fucking, I don't even believe in that shit anymore. I don't believe in it.

Speaker 11:         00:43:36       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:43:38       I Dunno if you go somewhere when you die or any of that type of shit, but I know all his fucking religious stuff. Other than the basics, the 10 commanded switch, you know, you really could have made one commandment. Just don't be a cunt, right? Isn't that what it's all about? Tapia can't. Don't take the Lord's name in vain. Don't disrespect your parents. Don't steal my shit. Don't fuck my wife. Don't want to fuck my wife. Don't be a content. What's wrong with you? Hey, look at me. Yeah, you, you're a cunt. Cut it out. That basically sums up the foundation of every, every religion and then it turns into guys, right? Buddha. I like Buddha. That's a good one. You know, some happy fat fuck just sitting there all jolly. Can't even see his dick and he's still happy. You know, there's something empowering about that. Jesus. I'm not into, you know, I, you know, and it's not even his fucking pot smoking, you

Speaker 12:         00:44:31       know, Goddamn hackey sack of vibe that he's putting out. You know, his God damn

Speaker 4:          00:44:40       rope made out of Ganja. It's not even that. It's, it's a, I hate the fucking martyr aspect of my religion. You know, I did it for you. I hate that shit. You know, somebody slaps you in the face, you turn the other cheek, do it again. Will that make you feel better?

Speaker 5:          00:45:00       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:45:01       the meek shall inherit the earth. It's just, it's just a blueprint for being a pussy,

Speaker 12:         00:45:09       you know, fucking can't stand it. And that is Jewish religion. I don't know shit about it.

Speaker 4:          00:45:17       I just know when you get really into it, you got to grow those curly Q Elvis side

Speaker 12:         00:45:22       burns and then you got to wear that little, uh, that little round thing on the back of your head, you know, and then wear the same shirt at the same pants every fucking day or the same style. You know, what are you fucking Albert Einstein or you over there working on theories of relativity. You're not, you're not. Alright, go get yourself an izod shirt. I had a little fucking color to your wardrobe. Can you, can you fucking have a little bit of fun? Um, what else?

Speaker 5:          00:45:50       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:45:50       Oh, then the Muslim religion. I don't want to get down on my knees every day at four in the after I'm fucking old. My knees hurt. I don't want to do that shit. I got to carry a yoga mat around everywhere. I fucking go and try and figure out, you know, which way is South East or whatever the hell hubspot I had, I want to do this. I don't wanna fucking do any of that. So I think that's pretty much co Scientology. That's the last one.

Speaker 12:         00:46:13       You know, that one I would actually join because it's just something funny about it, you know, being a fly on the wall, hanging out with that level of Weirdo. You know, I think they're the weirdest. I'd have all of them sign

Speaker 4:          00:46:26       ontologist just because the fucking religion, like all other religions were started. They'd seems way the fuck back in the day. So there's this vagueness that there's no proof that it's complete bullshit, you know? But l Ron Hubbard has a quote, if you want to make you want to become a millionaire, start a religion. He basically admits that he kinda just made all this shit up, said that he was the guy.

Speaker 12:         00:46:52       He did it in like the forties you know, and they're all sitting around there waiting for a fucking spaceship to show up. I just want to go down there and have a really fucking intense conversation with Tom Cruise, you know, and just see if I can get them going. You know

Speaker 4:          00:47:12       what I would do is I would just say that was a little confused about a certain aspect of my life, just to watch him go into fucking motivational speaker mode. You know, laughing maniacally, you know, Scientology, they got in all religions, they have those giant cavernous buildings. So when somebody laughs Menai maniacally, you get that, the fucking amazing acoustics, you know, I'll the same acoustic set or like a Jimmy page's stairwell when they recorded the drums for when the levee breaks, you know, good. Those drums sound. Just imagine somebody laughing in that fucking stairwell, you know what, should I add some reverb here and give you a maniacal laugh? That'd be too much fucking work. Um, anyways, so this is what I did, the suit. So I went down there to go a fucking, see if I could get a Mustang and the place was closed and then I'm driving back and I'm like, what's that a sign? Was that a sign that I shouldn't have done it? And it's like, no, Bill, that's a sign that you're a dumb fuck. And he didn't check to see what their hours were, so whatever, whatever. So this is what I did this week. All right. I did a lot of shit this week, by the way. Let me, let me, let me remember before I tell you that fucking story. Uh, I did Kevin James podcast this week and uh, that is gonna be, I say Kevin James. Kevin Smith. I did Kevin.

Speaker 4:          00:48:41       Oh, JJ. That's going to be one of these fucking weeks, isn't it? I did Kevin Smith's podcast. It's going to be uploaded today. Um, he does actually. He did. He didn't show up. He was sick. So I actually sat in for him, which was really nerve wracking because I, you know, mommy where like what? Like the ice capades when I saw him in 1976 at the old Boston Garden, I saw him in the late seventies. Actually, Dorothy Hamill didn't show up and we were all fucking upset and they had some other chick, a substitute and everybody fucking boots. So I was worried that these, these comic book Reading Psi Phi Fans, we're gonna boo me and they didn't. Um, and uh, fortunately, uh, Ralph Garman, his cohost fucking hilarious. He made me feel totally comfortable. I did the show with him and that, um, that podcast is going to be up today. All right.

Speaker 4:          00:49:38       See you getting to two podcasts from me today. All right. You're probably going to be completely second, ma'am. I am getting over exposed in the podcast world. I did Doug Benson's last week. I did, I did Kevin Smith's on Saturday EHRs today and on Wednesday I'm going to do the Sklar brothers. I'm making the podcast rounds people. I think I am becoming a fucking goto guest and the podcasting world. You know, like back in the day when somebody canceled all fuck, we need a guest back in the day and the tonight show who they go with. They, they, they bring in George Gobel, they bring in Burt Reynolds. Dude, that fucking cannonball run laugh, right? That's what are becoming in the podcast world. I did Joe Rogan's like fucking three weeks ago.

Speaker 12:         00:50:28       Who else am I doing? I think I'm doing Chris Porter's coming up. Ah, you know, I am just doing all kinds of free work here in the podcasting world. People, that's what it's all about. Speaking of which, speaking of which, um, I actually on the MM podcast page for the first time ever, we have installed a donation button. So if you want to stop listening to me cry like a cunt, if you'd like, you know, whatever. If you want to donate to the podcast, I'd really appreciate it. Uh, cause this is a ton of work. I do appreciate the fact that I do get to communicate to you guys, but you know, if you want to fucking donate or whatever works, we're starting to take this thing to the next level. I came up with the new Monday morning podcast logo, or actually at the real thing is I paid somebody to do it.

Speaker 12:         00:51:20       We got tee shirts and shit like that. We got some merchandise coming. So, uh, so that way the podcast can continue to be free. If you want to donate a buck, whatever you want to donate, five bucks, fucking six bucks, three 50, whatever the fuck you want to donate. If you go to Yemen podcast page, mm, podcast.com it's on the right hand side, just under the, uh, Twitter, Facebook buttons you'll see donate. Just click on there, uh, and go right through paypal, whatever. All right. Donation. Only just like a church. Can I guilt you guys? How can I get you like Jesus? And he said it under you with go fuck with yourself. Um, and what else? I really gotta get this shit out of the way. I have to make sure that I do treat my career like a business at some point here, so I do have to hire a couple of things here.

Speaker 12:         00:52:11       All right. Uh, my pop, my web guy said, remind everyone to follow you on Twitter. He made a list, a list here because I blow this every week. All right. Follow me on Twitter at Bill Burr. Uh, I believe that's my Twitter. Now. You know my fucking Twitter name. It's either add bill burr@billboard.com. I think it's just at Bill Burr B. U. R. R. A. I tweet, I talk about things I Twitter, I don't tweet. That's the masculine way. Let's see. Homophobic way of tweeting you Twitter. What else? Who also feel also tell them to feel free to hit the share button when you post videos on your Facebook page. Oh yeah. I'm trying to get my Facebook page, the fan page, trying to get those numbers up. Revet at 2,500 people since Tuesday. We're trying to keep that thing going. You know what people, I'm actually, for the first time in my career, I'm going to try to use the Internet to my advantage. See, up until this point, I really had no game plan. It was like, I'm just going to go on here. I'm going to say a bunch of stupid shit for a fucking hour. And you know, if people like it, they fucking like it man. And if they find it, they fucking find it. And I realized that, you know what, there's nine zillion podcasts

You know, at some point I would like to, uh, feel that if, you know, I don't know what if I was to lose my pancreas, I could still have a enough money squirreled away that I could, I could afford oatmeal for breakfast for the rest of my life. Isn't that what everybody wants? Don't you guys have, don't you have a number in your fucking head? What's your number? You know, if you guys watch breaking bad, you guys watch that fucking show. Do you know uh Eisenberg is Mr. White? His, his big numbers 600 grant. You can get 600 grand in cash squirreled away into the bottom of his house. If he kicks the bucket, his family's going to be okay. See, so I don't have a family. I got my girl. All right. And I got my dog. All right. But I plan on fucking living and I don't have a terminal disease like Mr. White. Actually he's in remission on that show. Sorry I'm getting a little fucking breaking bed.

You know, I already told you I could shoot a fucking deer as long as it didn't have any dear friends standing around or any little kids, doe's whatever it is. You know, I was kidding. Who if it was a really majestic looking one with a bunch of fucking, what do they call it? A 12 pointer or something. I couldn't shoot that either.

Isn't that how bears kill their fucking, their prey and they like picked up a stick. They start bashing it over the fucking head, like Hannibal Lecter. Um, anyways, that he finished hype and everything. Uh, I think that's it. Oh, and this week I'm also going to be at the PABST theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Um, there's only a little as only a few tickets left for that one and the Detroit show is sold out. So I want to thank both those blue collar towns that I'm finally making my way to.

Speaker 12:         00:58:10       Oh wait a minute. Didn't what's his face already do this Ricky Gervais based and he'd do that. Did he do his show? He used to watch that show. He was an extra, are you having a laugh? That's such a great fucking, that's the perfect, that's just, that's brilliant writing right there that they, I don't know if Ricky Gervais' came up, but I don't know who came up with that, but that is just so fucking, that is, that's just perfect Gad. Damn. That's just where might even funny. Right now. I'm just sitting here just fucking, not just, you know, you don't wanna do it right now. I am. I'm sitting right now on my bed, legs sideways on my bed, uh, laying on my side with my head in my head. You know, like I'm posing for playgirl magazine, you know, like the, the Burt Reynolds pose back in the 70s. Look at me, I think. I think I'm getting, I think I'm getting a fucking ego. Got An extra 2,500 friends on my Facebook page. I'm telling people to follow me on Twitter. Look at me. I'm not even being funny this week. I'm just hyping shit and a, we got to the New Lady, Bill Byrd Tank tops coming out. I can't fucking do this shit. All right, let's plow ahead here. Uh, let's get into the podcast, shall we?

Speaker 11:         00:59:18       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:59:20       I have so much shit to talk. I'm very 25 fucking minutes into this thing. Uh, let's try to blow through this quickly. My parents came to town this week, this weekend, came out here to visit. And uh, you know the deal. You feel like you're an adult. You feel like you're a man. You're a guy's guy. You're driving down the street. Yeah. Hybrid with your fucking arm hanging out the window and you made sure you put sunblock on so he didn't get cancer because you're a fucking fat, right?

Speaker 4:          00:59:48       You think he got the world figured out, then all of a sudden your parents show up and immediately you turn into a kid again, you, you want their approval. So, you know, I don't have any kids. I don't have anything to show that I am living for anybody other than myself. I am living a selfish artist's life. I play guitar, I play drums, I play hockey. I fucking tell jokes, fuck it, do whatever the hell I want to do. I just sit around all day staring at my both. It's great. It's fucking great. I don't know why the fuck you guys ever, I know. I get shows love. I don't know why you ever gotten married. I don't know why you ever had kids and then you fucking change yourself to your cubicle. I don't know why you did it, but evidently it's worth it because everybody I know has kids goes [inaudible] yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:00:36       I pluck a workout day and every morning my boss comes in and slaps me in the face with his tie and calls me a bitch. And I say, thank you sir. May I have another? Am I fucking hate my job? Or I tell you when I get home, when I get, Oh, and I just see my kid. Yes. Vag. Yeah, whatever they say all they fucking horse shit. And the thing is, is I know it's true. I know it's true. I know when I have a kid, I'm not going to give a fuck how I look anymore. You know I'm not going to moisturize.

Speaker 4:          01:01:12       I want to be walking around in old clothes and old fucking gym shoes. That's my biggest fear. If I ever become a parent, I'll just become a parent, you know, and just dress like shit and drive that old car. I don't want to do it. Why? Why? If you become a parent, why Jerry Seinfeld has Porsches, what am I talking about? See there's a smart fucking guy, you know, we made his dream come true. He made his half a fucking billion. He got a fleet of Porsche's and then he went down to the gym. He picked out some check. I don't give a fuck if you fucking engaged. Let's go, sweetie. I got half a billion dollars. Come over here, come over here and ride my rich cock, right?

Speaker 4:          01:01:53       Then he starts pumping out the fucking kids. Late forties early fifties people. That's if you're in your early twenties that's how you do it. That's how you do it. You make your million first. Then you grabbed some bitch by her fucking here. You drag her up the stairs and you say, listen woman, I know you want shiny shit. I can buy you shiny shit. All right, so make a decision. Go ahead and choose love. You fall in and out of it during the relationship. You know it's gonna wear off and that way you're going to be, you're going to be sitting there and some fucking house. I'm drab ass fucking house. Cheerio's in your hair. Bunch of little ones running around. And then what? Oh, you could choose me shiny shit. You want a nice shiny kitchen counter with the shiny fridge. You know, I'm 50 years old. I've been working for 35 fucking years. I have no dependents. I can buy you the shiny shit you want. So why don't you come over here and ride my half a century old cock.

Speaker 11:         01:03:08       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:03:09       You know, take my fucking dusty seaman, fertilize you, and then we'll have a couple of fucking kids you know, and you can be the one who plays with them and I'll just sit here and a fucking old sweater rocking back and forth going, I did it. I did it. Eaten pot, cookies, whatever the fuck I want to do. I don't give a shit. I have enough money for help. That's my game plan. People as I sit here in a one bedroom apartment, my early forties and sweatpants and a fucking tee shirt, I'm still holding on to that dream people. Anyways, the fuck was so my parents come to town. That's what the fuck I'm trying to tell them. It's what it's what really try to talk about here. If my parents come to town. Yeah. And uh, so I don't have any kids. I don't have anything to show him.

Speaker 4:          01:03:52       I'm driving a fucking hybrid. Nothing I'm doing is really that impressive. So, uh, what do I do? I just start taking them out to, you know that that was the only card I had the play. Look at all the cool places. I know where to go. That's all I have people, you double my age. I'm 84, 42 years of living on this planet. That's all I can show. My parents is places to eat. So I've been actually been doing really good with the hiking, taking my fucking awesome dog for hikes. And then I come home and I have a big bowl of fucking oatmeal, you know, and I have it the real way. I just have oatmeal like of prisoner of war. Just swap it right in the bowl, throw a little bit of raisins on it. That's the only fucking excitement I allow during my breakfast moment.

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       You know, all you fucks out there trying to lose weight. What do you do? You make something healthy and then you fucking had your drugs to it, don't ya? You sugars, salts, put a little milk in. There would have been a little cinnamon sugar. How, but I put a scoop ice cream on top of it. What'd you have for breakfast? I had oatmeal. I'm telling you it's my metabolism. No, it isn't. You cheat and fuck. Stop putting up the, the, the food steroids, India. Healthy food. You got to sit there and yet, you know what you gotta do is you got to get that fucking, you gotta get that, uh, that desire, that craving out of your body. You know, like you guys do. If you watch

Speaker 9:          01:05:18       my standup specials, you guys realize that, uh, I have a sweet tooth. I hate that about myself. Eh, but you know what it was? I fucking just stopped eating them and it took about a week. Every night he'd be driving home going, I want a piece of cake. What the fuck is, what is your, your, your birthday bill. The fuck's wrong with me. I want a piece of cake or like a pint of ice cream. I just wanted it. Right. But then after a fucking week, your body just gets that craving audio system. Now I don't want it anymore. And you know what's funny is now that it's out of my system, I walked into this place the other day and they had to go in and get this, this three bean salad. You know, cause I'm really, I'm trying to get the booze weight off, you know, cause I quit Busan but I just kept eating like an idiot.

Speaker 9:          01:06:02       I'm trying to make, get my head back down to the size it should be. Right. So I'm going in the order that, and I'm sitting there of course right in the front, they get like, you know, seven different kinds of cakes and all this shit. And because I wasn't craving sugar like it looked, it looked bizarre. It looks like clown food, all these bright colors and shit. Like why the fuck? Why would you even eat that shit? Um, you know, the week before or find it. And it had some, some bad food. I would have fucking bad my face pressed up against the glass trying to, you know, just one, eat half the cake, so whatever. So I've been doing great with, with my, my date and all that type of shit that my parents come to town. And uh, that's all I had. I was just like, I, you know, I just started taking them out. I fucking had, you know, a couple of cheeseburgers. I was eating a fucking grand slam breakfast last night at some fifties diner. Took him out to some French restaurant, eaten beef Borgen y'all

Speaker 4:          01:06:58       the Stewpot that looks like the jolly green giant made the shit. And uh, I'm at that age a couple of days, eaten bad again, like five fucking pounds. Now I've got a big doughy white stomach again. It's killing me. So anyways, this is how fucking hilarious my parents are.

Speaker 9:          01:07:15       They come out to visit me in Hollywood. All right.

Speaker 4:          01:07:22       Where do you think they want it to go? What? Tourist attraction. Go ahead, I'll give you a second to guess. What are you going to guest to go look at the Hollywood walk of fame? All those stars on the sidewalk, Mann's Chinese theater, Hollywood bowl, sunset strip. Go down and look at the paramount studios. Get their picture taken in front of the Hollywood sign. Now you know what they want it to go. They wanted to go to the Ronald Reagan library,

Speaker 9:          01:07:55       the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. How fucking awesome is that? You know,

Speaker 4:          01:08:01       you know the deal on it. Whenever you live in a city for awhile, if you live in Saint Louis, every time you come there, what are people want to go to? The fucking arch. You don't want to go there. You don't give a fuck. They want to ride that little stupid elevator up to the top. You don't want to do it, but you gotta do it. You live in New York. Douchebag wants to go

Speaker 12:         01:08:16       to the top of the empire state building. You don't want to do it. So my parents came out here and I'm thinking, Oh God, I gotta take him to the usual spots. And they said that they wanted to go to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

Speaker 4:          01:08:28       And I was like, that. That's in Hollywood.

Speaker 12:         01:08:32       They're like, no, no, no. It's, uh, out west west of, uh, la. And I was like, you know what? I'll fucking do that. I'll do that in a second. And I went out to him and I had a great God damn time. Uh, that's something you ought to do. You gotta go to a presidential library. It's fucking hilarious. Especially if it's a president where you were alive when all the shit that happened went down. So then you can go into their library because the libraries are hilarious. I don't give a fuck who it is. They are going to make that guy look, this is like the third library. I bet at the JFK. I've been to the Richard Nixon and I've been to the, uh, now the Ronald Reagan. None of these

Speaker 4:          01:09:11       where my ideas, I'm a, I'm a fucking moron. I don't want to go to these things. I've just always with people who want to go to this shit. And what I've noticed with the libraries is they just make the person seemed just like the greatest fucking person ever. Like, evidently Ronald Reagan was the greatest guy ever, which amazes me because I thought it was Richard Nixon. And before that I thought it was fucking JFK. They just, uh, you know, they had one part of it. They had this whole, you know, that whole just say no to drugs thing that they came up with was a miserable failure. I remember it. I remember that people used to make yes, well

Speaker 12:         01:09:51       just say no. Okay, well that solves the crack epidemic. When somebody asks you for drugs, just say no. Okay. Meanwhile, we're going to cut funding for anything that would help you get out of your financial fucking problem in the inner city. You know, and then the one viable commodity, the drugs which you either sell and make money or you take to fucking numb the pain of living in a goddamn war zone. Just say no to that. Just just say you don't want to do it. And then continue going to an incredibly unsafe, shitty school that we're not going to help to try to make anything better. So they, but in the library, it was just an absolute smashing success. And they was showing her just say no and her hugging some inner city children and the dress she wore, this is just the Nancy Reagan part and that they actually, you know, was the best part. They had an, they had to just say no board game, which I was trying to take a picture of, but the fucking security kept looking at me. You weren't allowed to take pictures and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. And I just wanted to see like, you know, I just wanna I wanna I gotta look that up on the Internet. I want to know what happens. How do you lose that game? Do you like slowly become a junkie as you play that game? Are they like know

Speaker 9:          01:11:13       if the end of the board game is there one gated community, nice neighborhood where you live with all the banker costs and then there's another one where you make the left turn and you just send some fucking slum that they cut funding to. Is that basically yet? Um, so having gone to that and then the, the Reagan thing was just like, you know, obviously I like to Shitty did where he strengthened our military, you know, and then the Russians tried to strengthen their mallets military, then they fucking went bankrupt. That was a great fucking move. Ended up being the worst thing for this country though. I think because you need an adversary, you need one. Cause if you don't, then you just become a greedy cont cause there's nobody stopping you from just fucking eating every piece of cake that's on the goddamn table. But anyways, so I haven't gone to the Reagan won. I now want to go to the Bill Clinton one because I want to see how they spin all that. Monica Lewinsky. I finger fuck some fat whore in the White House. I just got to see, cause they gotta address it cause he got impeached. He's only, only two presidents in history have ever gotten impeached. It's him and some other fucking guy. I forget the other guy. Everybody thinks it's fucking Nixon. But he did. Nixon resigned before that shit happened. He pulled a Manny Ramirez. I'm going to Spain, I'm out. See Ya. Um, but, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:12:33       I dunno man. It was really, it was as much as I'm making fun of Reagan and that type of Shit. Like, you know, I don't buy into Democrats or Republicans, they all serve the same fucking guys. It doesn't make a difference, especially at this point. But it was just interesting to see. Uh, I'd like, I, I'm still into the memorabilia, like the creepiest part of the Reagan library is you fucking go through it. And remember when John Hinckley tried to kill him, they, you walk into this one part, they go, this is the assassination part of the Ronald Reagan fucking library. And you walk in there and there's three screens all showing the exact same thing. And they go, it'll start in 10 seconds. And they just show the raw footage of Reagan walking out. And this guy squeezing up six fucking shots. You know, Brady got shot in the head.

Speaker 4:          01:13:23       Thank God it was a 22 or is he would've been dead. But, uh, uh, a DC police officer and the secret service officer all got shot. And then Reagan took one that ricocheted off the car and caught him. So it's just the raw footage. There's no like, uh, you know, like fucking Tom Brokaw go on tonight. Nightly News. [inaudible] good. What'd your checking to be? Sure there wasn't any of that. They just showed it like you was standing there was the creepiest shit ever. Just these walking out waving and then pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. And then everybody just died. [inaudible] the car fucking drives away and you're like, Jesus Christ. So then you walk into the next room,

Speaker 9:          01:14:07       which is like 10 feet away and there's no door. Okay. And now you're looking at the suit that Reagan wore when he got shot and there's a bullet hole right in the fucking, the coat decided the coat and then you know, the fucking assassination, the attempt, the raw footage is playing every 10 seconds. So now you're looking at the suit and then all of a sudden you just hear pop, pop, pop, pop [inaudible] here. And it just kept playing. [inaudible] it just was like, dude, what the fuck? And I, that was the only part of the library I didn't like. It's like a gut. Jesus Christ and I had to leave, but the best part of the library, and I got pictures of this up on the MLM podcast.com is they fucking had a air force one, a seven 57 the entire fucking plane. They had it in case within the building and you could go and you could go on the fucking thing and they had the place where the guys set with the, you know, the nuclear devices turn your key.

Speaker 9:          01:15:10       This is what blew my mind too when you got on the plane is, you know, now we're just starting to get the technology where US regular people can be on the Internet and use phones and shit. They had that technology on Air Force One back in the day when fucking Reagan, Carter, all those guys you could, you could pick up a rotary phone and call the Kremlin, whoever the fuck you needed to talk to on a goddamn rotary phone. So that means that their technology is at least 35 years ahead of us that, that, that would be the only reason why I would ever want to be president. I just want to see what, like Obama's cell phone looks like, the capabilities of it, you know, anybody was any of that fucking interesting. Um, all right, let's, let's move on here. Uh, real quick and then we'll start. I'm going to get into the whole fucking, ah, questions for the week. Uh, oh.

Speaker 4:          01:16:01       Coming up this next week, Tribeca Film Festival starts and, uh, me, Robert Kelly and Joe de Rosa have a movie that got selected, a short film called cheat. And somebody sent me an email about it. It said, uh, hey bill, how you doing? So Dude, just watch the trailer for cheap and man, I got to tell you, it looks quite good. It's really cool to see you, Bobby and Joe and even dumb fos doing something serious like this.

Speaker 9:          01:16:25       Is it going to make it, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:16:26       Run across theaters. Uh, what are the chances of it being on DVD sometime? Uh, this is the deal. It's just short film. So, uh, we'll probably try and put it in other film festivals, but,

Speaker 9:          01:16:40       um, we're currently

Speaker 4:          01:16:41       are writing a book, me, Joe and Bobby and uh, that's based off of the movie and the book will be out next year, beginning part of next year hopefully. And in the back of the book, um, the, the, the full movie will be available. So the, the, the movie itself cheat will come with the book and a, I can't tell you what it's about because I don't want to ruin the fucking movie. So I'm glad you think that it looks cool. And, uh, anybody in the New York area, please go onto the Tribeca that I don't have. Of course, as always, I don't have any information. I'll have it next week, next week. By the way, a, I'm going to Bobby and Joe de Rosa on my podcast the first time ever at, there's going to be three people on my podcast, a two guests at the same time. I'll see how I handled that.

Speaker 4:          01:17:24       I went out and I bought a third mic. People, I'm ready to do it. So, uh, what else? What else did I want to talk about? Um, oh, how about the Bruins? Huh? How about the Bruins? Digging themselves a fucking hole. I still have faith. I got to feel, and the Bruins are going to go into Montreal tonight. They're going to kick the shit out of those fake fucking Parisian motherfuckers up there. Um, you know what's annoying me? It's not even knowing me that we're losing to the Canadians, cause I know. I don't know why people were picking the Bruins to win the cup. I just was, was still missing at least two major pieces to have a championship run. But what's killing me is they're making Carey price look like he's Ken Dryden. Any isn't. He isn't. These are the first two playoff games. This guy is ever fucking one and his entire career.

Speaker 4:          01:18:16       All right. The last time we saw this guy in the playoffs, we beat them four games in a fucking row. What's going on now is the Canadians, they have their, their forwards in their defense when they're blocking shots, they, it, the Bruins, just a play in the dumbest fucking hockey tickets. Slap shots. There's nobody in front. He, you go, Carrie, is there enough ice between me and you see can get a nice bead on this puck. Fucking horrific. And I know a lot of Bruins fans of pissed that showered in play game too. They said he was dehydrated and everybody went, all these fucking European players are such pussies. Drink some Gatorade. I think that that they couldn't say that he was puking and shitting his brains out probably, uh, for 24 hours. I think he had what I had like a month ago. So hopefully he'll come back and it'll crunch another one of those pussy fucking Canadian players into the boards and then they can fucking make a goddamn federal case out of it. Um, I dunno, the series is not over. There's no fucking way. There's no way it's over. I have faith. We got to fucking win. We gotta win tonight. All right, that's it. And other than that, I've just been watching the, uh, these are my predictions. I think the lightning are going to be Pittsburgh. I think. Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:19:33       I think the Bruins are going to come back and beat the Canadian sets. My heart talking flyers. We'll beat the sabers. Who else? These are easy to. Troy's going to be Phoenix. Vancouver is going to be Chicago and a way. What route do you think San Jose is going to choke this year? Everybody. Do you think the kings are going to come back and beat him? I have no fucking idea. All right. Let's plow ahead here. My finals are the obvious. I think it's, I think the flyers.

Speaker 4:          01:20:03       No. What about the catalyst? She, the capitols of finally pushed through. I got a funny feeling. The rangers going to beat the capitals. I felt that even though they lost game one, I thought the Rangers were going to come back and steal game too, but when they did and they went up two games to none I, that's when I was like, ah, I guess the capitals are going to do it this year, but now that they won game three, I don't know. I don't know. There's a lot of pressure on the capital's lot of fucking pressure on those fucking cuts in DC. All right, let's plow ahead here. All right. Uh, very happy. Stay at home. Dad writes, dear bill, after listening to one of your recent podcasts and also watching let it go, I felt compelled to write in. I have major issues with stay at home moms complaining about how hard it is. Oh Gee, age. Perhaps this topic has played out, but I think my situation may bring a new light on the matter. I'm a stay at home dad. I'll spare you how I became a stay at home dad and just tell you that it's terrific. I love it. I do all of what you'd expect. Clean, do laundry, yardwork cook homework with the kids and pickups and dropoffs and have no problem with any of it. Dude, that sounds like a fucking vacation.

Speaker 4:          01:21:15       Wouldn't it be art hanging out with fucking kids? I know it sucks when that baby's, but once they become like, just like little people,

Speaker 11:         01:21:22       you know,

Speaker 4:          01:21:24       and plus all the technology that they have to fucking in case your children. You know what I mean? Just like put up those little barricades that you can make those little rubber rooms so they can't hurt themselves. And then you stick like the teletubbies on and the lady that's like, you know, Lsd for kids and they just sit in there tripping as you're in the other room, making yourself a little scotch. Um, anyways. Yeah, there's no boss. And every day is like fucking Saturday you get to hang at your house, she gets to sleep in your bone bed. I know the grass is always greener, but that sounds fucking awesome. Anyways, she says, I'm a pretty organized person, so the House always looks good and I've, oh, and I've always been a good cook. Now I'm an even better one. My, my, my wife comes home to great meals in a clean house and at the end of her day needs only to eat, relax, and hang out with our daughter.

Speaker 4:          01:22:13       Another child is on the way this July. What does your wife do for a living that she can, uh, support you? You guys live in Nice. That's even better if she's got some insane fucking job. One of the biggest problems with my situation is when she decides to reclaim one of the traditional female roles around the house. This happens periodically about once a month, usually less. It must be PR, uh, primitive genetic code that kicks in every so often. What it does, my world gets fucked. Suddenly I'm told nothing is where it should be in the kitchen and he and I and we need to organize it or that parts aren't good enough or that shit is too high on the shelves. I have a foot like a foot taller than my wife. You know what happened with this, this reading here, I was just thinking how well I was reading.

Speaker 4:          01:22:57       Now I'm in my fucking head and I'm screwing up. Just try to regroup here, Bill. All right or worse when she decides to go food come home was shit we don't need or we have never eaten before because she felt we should try it or worse yet when she decides to cook a meal, her cooking isn't bad, but when she cooks, I don't get the night off. My job is to show her where everything is, spices, dry goods, pots, et Cetera, and also to reach shit she can, when she's done, I spend the next day reorganizing everything to my liking. Dude, you gotta be like a broad there. You've got to claim the kitchen that don't go around moving things. I have everything where I need it just shoots. You'll get out of here, I'll do this. That's what you gotta do. Your problem is, is you're letting her in.

Speaker 4:          01:23:42       See Women can shoe guys out of the kitchen because we don't usually, most guys don't want to be in there and in the end we always try to keep it in a good mood. So maybe you'll blow us that night. You know, women, they don't have that kind of sex drive, you know? And plus they always have the option of bag and someone at work if they want to, you know, with absolutely no game whatsoever other than just fucking wearing some hoary shoes and hiking her skirt up that are even needed an open in line. You know, their lives are so fucking easy other than fucking having to squeeze a kid out. That's the one thing I'll give you those nine months of hell. But you get paid back. You get to tee off 12 to fucking 20 yards in front of me at the golf course. People hold doors for you. You don't have to pay for a movie. You show a little cleavage, you get free drinks all night. What the fuck are you broads bitching about? All right, plow ahead here. Um, so anyways, he goes, I don't go to her office rearranging Shit on occasion. On the occasions I dropped by. Oh Jesus. So don't laugh at me when I tell you certain things go in certain areas of the fridge and wide sneeze. Oh No, I do it. I totally get it. I'm not giving you shit.

Speaker 4:          01:24:46       He said, I used to complain out loud to her about it. Now I just grin and bear it on occasion. On occasion it happens. I figured it's better not to rock, rock the boat less. She wises up and sees how good I have it. Dude, you live in the fucking life. You know what you are, dude. You're basically retired and your wife is out there.

Speaker 5:          01:25:09       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:25:09       providing your your pension. I think that's phenomenal. I think that is absolutely phenomenal and I don't know why more women don't enjoy being stay at home. Mom said, I'm not trying to be as chauvinist pig here, you know? Okay. Those first few years suck without a doubt. But then you've got to understand once they, they, they go to school, all right, late. They take start going to school at nine and they get off at three. You got six hours in the middle of the day to do whatever the fuck you want to do and you know something. And that's one of those classic points that you bring up to women or stay at home moms and they freak the fuck out. And then they go, oh, you know, then they try to make those six hours difficult, like all the fucking shit they have to do. It's like, what do you have to do?

Speaker 12:         01:26:04       What exactly do you have to do? You got the kids dressed and you fed him. Now he's just fucking school. Someone else's watching the kid for the next six hours. What exactly is it that you have to fucking do laundry? Oh my God, that that's gotta be so difficult to separate whites from the darks. Stick it in a fucking machine and press a button and have it clean it for you. Where? Where is the, you just, if, if those six hours aren't enough for you, you're just creating work for yourself. You know, you can actually be sitting on the couch drinking a margarita as a machine washes the fucking clothes. It's not that big a fucking deal. It really isn't. Go out food shopping and you get to go out during the day when there's no traffic and there's nobody around. You go to the post office.

Speaker 12:         01:26:58       He just sort of putz around town. Your little Mayberry town. That's a fucking dream, you know? I Dunno. I just think that, you know, that just seems like a fucking awesome life. And then the kids come home and it gets loud or whatever, but they, your kids, you love them. You make them fucking sandwiches, you know? And then, then what? I mean, how much longer do they go? You put into bed by fucking eight. They get home at like, what, three 30 I just don't understand what, what, what, what the big fucking deal is. I just don't get it. I really don't get it. Somebody, please, if you don't understand, if every fucking day, that's another thing too. And the at the, at the end of all of that bitching, it's like, well, you didn't have to be a mom. You know? It's very easy. There's condoms, there's the pill, there's a whole bunch of prophylactics, all different kinds that you can choose from. You fucking chose the job and now you're bitching about it. What is your fucking problem?

Speaker 12:         01:28:05       Jesus Christ. If you want, you don't want to go food shopping, just go buy a jar of peanut peanut butter in a big giant jar of jelly, peanut butter jelly sandwiches. They you go bang. You could do that like three, four times a week. They don't give a fuck big glass of milk, some cheese and crackers. Why? You're overthinking it ladies. You're over fucking thinking that. I really don't. I don't think it's so fucking hard. I think you guys are full of Shit. You know what it is? Just like how this guy said at the end of his email where he's just sitting there grinning and bearing it and he doesn't want to rock the boat less. She wises up to see how good he has it. I think that that's why those stay at home moms. I'm not talking about working moms and talking about stay at home moms. I think that that's why they complain that much. Um, the only complaint there are aspects. I do understand the fact that you guys sit there and talk and Gugu Gaga talked the whole fucking day and you just want to hang out with an adult. At some point that would drive me a little bet shit. But you know, everything has its ups and downs and I just don't see the fucking downside is being that that steep with that job. I really don't. Um, anyways, sitting, they make it macaroni trees

Speaker 11:         01:29:24       get out,

Speaker 12:         01:29:26       taking them to the fucking playground and pushing them on a swing. I mean, how difficult is that? That's difficult. That's harder than sitting in a cubicle, having somebody coming over and telling you what to do. Did you ever think what's great about being a stay at home mom is you're your own fucking boss. Nobody's telling you what to do. Nobody's 10. Don't even fucking tell me your kids are telling you what to do. Okay? Get your Goddamn kids in order. All right. That's what they invented sticks for.

Speaker 11:         01:29:52       You know,

Speaker 12:         01:29:53       slap him around a little bit. You put the fear of death in them and then they shut the fuck up. That's what my mom used to do. She had a paddle. My Dad went to who was a member of a fraternity. He saved the paddle and we would decks. My mother would line all of us up and she beat the shit out of all of us. And you just be standing there in line waiting for the fucking beaten to come. Right. Then you'd always try to block it with your hand and fucking smashing knuckles and then she'd send us all the bed. That was like her break. She do that once a day and like the afternoon, that was her afternoon break. She'd send us to bed and then we'd go upstairs crying, all sweaty and crying and shit and sticky from whatever the fuck we just spilled. That caused her to kick the shit out of us. And then, you know, we'll be up there 10 minutes, then we just fall asleep.

Speaker 11:         01:30:41       That was it.

Speaker 12:         01:30:45       I ain't, what the fuck I'm talking about. All right. As Bill Promise. You say, Bill, I'm a senior in high school and have not been to any of my school functions. I've been there, sir. I've been there. I didn't go there. I went to my senior prom. I didn't go to any of the other ones. Uh, I was a fucking orange haired freak in high school. Um, and I didn't, I didn't even have the courage to ask anybody out. I just saw what was in the mirror and I was just like, I'm not going to do this to somebody else. Why would I put this on someone else? Um, I have never been to a school dance and only a few football games at my high school career. Dude, did I write this in a drunken stupor at that sounds like my high school career. Next week is the prompt for my school.

Speaker 12:         01:31:20       And I was wondering if I should go. I know people say I should go and it would always be a special moment in my life, but uh, will, it really is prom overrated dude. You know what? This is a fucking depressed individual. You know, dude, you want to go and now you're going to sit there. You're seeing order it. Dude, you're too fucking smart for your own good. He can sit there and you're going to break down the prom. How fucking stupid it is and the dumb songs and the Dj and how you never, you know, it's senior year. You're never going to see these people again your life anyways. Should I not go? Dude, you should definitely go get the up to ask somebody. It's a great exercise because someday you're going to see a girl that you're going to want to talk to.

Speaker 12:         01:32:05       You want to have a couple at bats? All right, so just fucking ask someone to the prom. Go get dressed up. Take the pictures, have a good time. Don't, don't do what you're doing, dude. You're, you're overanalyzing life. You're going to start pulling back from the herd and you're going to end up like me, some psycho babbling to himself and it takes you 20 years to get it right. Took me 20 years before he met Nia and I finally got it fucking right and I'm starting to function like a human being and thinking about having kids and having a dog. I'm telling you, man, I'm telling you. All right. It's, it's a part of growing up. It's a social thing. It's very important. I think it's very important to go to your prompts and your social events because that's what life is about. There's a great documentary out there on Hbo called his way.

Speaker 12:         01:32:59       I am really bad with names. It's about this really successful a Hollywood producer. And as I watched it, like I saw life lessons that I learned only recently in life. And I realized how backwards I had life when I was a loner because that's not what life is about. Life is about networking, hanging out with other people, laughing with other people, and becoming successful in life is all about your ability to connect with other people and a, so you got to start as young as possible, man, you still young. I would definitely do that then, you know, and uh, that's it man. I would definitely, I would debt, oh, he asked me some odd, did you ever go to a prom and wasn't magical? No, it wasn't. It should've been, but it wasn't because I was a Waldorf psycho and I apologize to the woman that I went with.

Speaker 12:         01:33:49       Um, I was just like you, I was sitting there, um, when I read the rest of us here, I was thinking about going, but then came to the collusion conclusion of going by myself would just be, oh, I was thinking of going by myself, but then came to the conclusion that going by myself would just be awkward. Yeah, dude, you don't want to do that. You're going to freak people out. People are going to feel bad for you. And then the mean people are going to teach you and it's just going to suck and then you're gonna want to come back like Carrie and kill everybody. It's just, it's a bad road. Um, she says, so if I don't go, what should I do? Dude, go. Just go. Definitely go. You want to go? I'm telling you. If he didn't want to go, you wouldn't be asking me.

Speaker 12:         01:34:30       Just definitely go. Just ask somebody. I know there's some girls left. Ask sooner rather than later. And you know what dude? Aim High. Who gives a fuck if she says no, fuck her. She probably just end up being some, some fatty at a reunion. One day. This is now when you want to go in there, just I'm telling you, you'd go there, psych yourself up. Aim. I ask a girl that you think is out of your league. You know, take it to the prom maker, fucking laugh and then see if you can a, you know, a little something might happen. Who gives it and if it doesn't, who gives a shit? Who gives a shit? Sunday when you see your dream girl sit there and Applebee's, you'll have the balls to go up to her cause you fucking talk to that cut in high school. All right, there's my advice. All right, let's move on here. Uh, number two friend is going to be a dad trying to get him to kill it.

Speaker 12:         01:35:22       Wow. Wow. Okay. Wow. We're already at an hour here. This is going to be a long podcast. A friend is going to be a dad dash trying to get him to kill it. Oh Jesus. Here we got bill. My friends got himself into a shitty situation recently. Gee, I wonder what this is. I'm really interested to hear if you have any advice for him. And what you have to say. I got a call from him about a month ago and said he was going to be a father. This is the last thing I expected to hear. He's 26 and pretty much just started getting laid. Are you fucking poor bastard? See? See this. This is another reason why you want to go to your prom, cause you don't want to be this guy. The Guy who first gets laid at fucking 26 doesn't know anything. I just fucking dumps his load in the first fucking stupid waitress.

Speaker 12:         01:36:11       He fights. This is a very sad thing to happen to one of your best friends. It really is. What Saturday is the girl? He knocked up. What's sad or is the girl he knocked up? Oh my God, this is depressing me. Uh, she's not someone you'd want to mother your child, let alone be attached to for the rest of your life. She's a nice enough girl, but a little off. She admittedly has some issues in her head and loves pills in weed. A little too much. Oh my God, what did this kid do? Let alone she is secretly married to someone.

Speaker 1:          01:36:45       What

Speaker 12:         01:36:47       Dude? Are you sure he didn't want to send this to Jerry Springer? I don't really know this story, but let's assume he is foreign and there is no love involved. Oh, an arranged marriage is that we have saying anyway. When I got the call, my friend,

Speaker 1:          01:37:04       uh,

Speaker 12:         01:37:06       you spelled the word wrong, I guess respectively repetitively was at the barn. And what word you're trying to say? That my friend was at the bar and yelling about how he wants to kill it. Um, I take it you're against abortion considering you're saying kill it or are you just trying to be funny? Uh, a day or so later when our buddies get the news, we all meet up with him to have a convince your friend to have an abortion dinner. Uh Oh, I see what you want. One of your buddies were down there talking about it. They want to kill. All right, so you're going to sit down with him to, okay. All right. Here we go. He now has given up and it's going to have it. He said he tried talking to her a few times about getting an abortion and she won't have it.

Speaker 12:         01:37:49       She wants to have the kid and every time he brings it up she hangs up on him or won't answer his calls and avoid him for days. So now in defeat he's going to have the poor kid. Well you know, that's one of the things there. It's not the guys choice, which is funny when they sit there and they say proach are you pro choice? You know that that's not for the guy. The woman decides unless you're really smooth talker. Um, I really think about having the kid will make her feel some sort of self worth and that's why she wants to have it so bad. My friend is a sweetheart and I have no doubt he'll be a good father, but it's situation sucks. We keep telling him that he'll be attached to this girl forever and he really needs to talk to her and that will even talk to her. And of course a bunch of us pushing her down a flight of stairs. Jokes followed God. Now he is going with her to get an ultrasound and stuff and won't even talk to us about it. I don't know how this stuff works, but she does, but she's about two months preggers and we think he has a month left to get rid of the thing. What can he do and what can we as friends do to help? Um,

Speaker 12:         01:39:03       uh, you know what guys? He's going to have the fucking thing. I would say, I would say leave them alone and just support him and tell him whatever he does, do not marry this woman. Okay. He fucked up. He got her pregnant. She wants to have it. He doesn't have a say in it. And uh, that's it. It's going down. It's going down. So

Speaker 9:          01:39:30       you know, he fucked up, you know, that's life. Do you know you fuck you? Sometimes when you fuck up, you don't get a do over, which is basically what an abortion is. Uh, she's not going for the duo over. She's like, Nope, this is the game plan and we're sticking with it. Just like the Rangers, even though people are breaking their fucking ankles, they're going to keep trying to block shots. All right? That's what she's doing. She wants to have the kids. So now he just has to go with it. And, uh, this is what he has to do. Never move in with her. Never marry her. Don't do anything like that. She's going to be a single mother. He's going to be a baby daddy. And, um, what he needs to do now is he needs to buy a fucking lifetime supply of condoms.

Speaker 9:          01:40:18       Uh, he needs to go out and find the woman that he's supposed to knock up in Mary. And in the meantime, support that kid. That's what he has to do because he busted a nut in her and she's keeping it so he's fucked. He's fucked when it comes to that. But his life is not over. He can, he only has to deal with this bitch for 18 fucking years. He has to deal with this kid for life. I think what he should do is the kids should be the priority. Um, he should come to some sort of zen realization that he's not going to convince this woman not to be a fucking maniac if she is a psycho, like you said. Uh, what I would do is I try to convince her not to smoke weed or take any pills during the fucking pregnancy. Um, and, and that's it.

Speaker 9:          01:41:03       I mean, his only other route is if maybe she wants to put it up for adoption, but it doesn't seem like she wants to do that. But, uh, he just needs to settle into the fact that he's having a fucking kid. But what you guys need to make sure is that this woman does not talk him into getting married and being legally, he, all he has to do is plate pay, child support. If he gets married to her now you talk in alimony and all that type of shit. And then when he wants to start his family with the fucking woman he wants to be with, that's going to be a fucking nightmare. So, uh, that's it. All right. So that's what I would do. I would just say, listen, just support them as a friend and say, dude, if you ever fucking bang another girl without a condom, I am got a, I'm going to disown you.

Speaker 9:          01:41:51       I'm going to disown you because it's killing me. Watching you go through this shit. So just make sure you fuck the abortion. He's not doing it. They haven't the kids. So now what you gotta do is do not marry this woman. Do not marry her. And uh, and that's fucking it. That's it man. That's a brutal, brutal, brutal fucking situation. They are. But for the grace of God, I'm anyways, here we go. Let's read this guy from London, Guy from London, look at us all the way across the fucking pond. Needs advice about girl with STD. Jesus Christ. You guys are fucking killing me this week. I'm a Londoner who just discovered your standup podcasts. I've got to tell you, you one of the best can be. Thank you man. That's fucking awesome. You know great debt is to hear from another country. You make me laugh from the pit of my stomach, which is a pretty special gift to give someone, so thank you.

Speaker 9:          01:42:40       Thank you. All right, let's see if I can help you out of your fucking problem here. Anyway, I'm writing you because I just joined a dating website. I don't know how you feel about online dating, but my opinion has always been that it's fucked up. Who needs to join a website to get laid? Who isn't in some way a fucking lunatic. Right. Um, I think that's the way it was in the beginning, but now it's becoming this phenomenal way of avoiding a cover charge and having to buy somebody a drink and just going right towards the chick you want. Uh, Nino. What's going on? My girl just walked in fucking brutal questions this week. You want to hear that? Just the titles of these questions? Uh, or just one in general? Um, I guess it was just this one friend is going to be a dad trying to get him to kill it.

Speaker 9:          01:43:27       Yeah. Okay. All right. Now I already answered it. I just thought she, you know, that that whole pro choice thing are you pro choice. That choice is really the woman's, you know, if she wants to vacuum it out, like the hoovers getting turned on and, uh, if, if, what, could you not say it like that? When a guy makes a joke like that, even though you've never had a kid, do you still feel a little quivering in there? No, I do not. No, you do not. What other disgusting question. You look really good. Thank you. Good deal. Um, you want it, you want to help me with this one guy from London needs dating advice about girl with this CD. Okay. So anyways, uh, so he, he, he always thought the online dating things for those online dating websites were just filled with a bunch of psychos cause who can't just get laid.

Speaker 9:          01:44:16       But at this point, I think it's normal now. Yeah. It's totally normal now to do online stuff. It's not like, I don't think there's a stigma attached to it anymore. People do it well. I think there's an STD attached to it. Let me read the rest of this. Uh, so I'd avoided it, uh, being more than capable of hooking up in real life. But my problem is that for about two years now, that's all I had been doing, hooking up dating, meeting girls who never do that thing to me. Oh, nobody that he falls in love with. I feel like a Husk, a 31 year old. I don't know what that means. Guys from London. I guess that means like the old guy at the bar, 31 year old and I'm dead inside. Oh, I see. He's dead inside because no girl can make me feel how I used to in the school playground.

Speaker 9:          01:44:57       Oh, with the first crushes star. The thing that makes you want to make pancakes in the morning for a walk through the park or put on some Lionel fucking Richie. All they want to do is come home lately. Uh, I want to do after I come lately is wash her off my dick and bouncer out. Yep. Yeah, I've been there, which is no way to live. What? Nia. I banged a lot of broads before I met you and that was the thing. You were like the second year did you jumped up? You said, hang on a second, let me get, let me, you act like you were getting something for her and you went in and she figured it out when she heard the sink was on too long that you had your Dick and you are washing it up. I say is take the hand fucking soap and it just fucking act like I was jerking off with soap and that's why I have the clean cock I have today.

Speaker 9:          01:45:43       All right. Plowing ahead the thing that makes you want to blah blah, blah, blah, blah blah. Okay. Uh, which is no way to live. I'm actually a romantic guy. I cry at Disney movies at Jesus do it. I don't want to read this shit. I fall, I want to fall in love again. It sounds like lyrics to a Lionel Richie Song. It's 2011 people join these sites. So I made a profile anyways, this is a fucking long ass email. Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Okay. So anyway, she's on this fucking website anyway, after two weeks, I'm probably thinking about shutting down the profile. The only notable exception so far being a divorcee, who does yoga? She invites me to a bar. We have a drink. She complains of being tipsy and needing to drive. I asked what she wants to do. She corks up the bottle. It takes me back to her place and literally takes a run at me.

Speaker 9:          01:46:30       It was nuts to kind of seedy, like she'd watch some porn after this. After the split with her husband decided that that was the way the world was now and decided to emulate it for real. So I'm banging a mature, granted, pretty hot, mature woman who's looking at me with this angry look on her face. That porn star fuck face thing. That makes me feel uneasy all ready while saying things like, do you like that? Huh? That tick is nicer. Warmer my pussy. Huh? Jesus Christ. Are you going? Are you going to blow your nuts right inside this pussy? Yeah. And she's seen it with the English accent too. That's fucking hilarious. And I'm just feeling a bit sad and signed side as I nod.

Speaker 9:          01:47:14       Anyways, this is the thing. I meet this girl 26 beautiful and I made beautiful. She looks like a little Elf or something that just made it creepy and angels smoking and she's smart, funny, Kooky, but in a good hot way. Probably that dangerous going to break your heart way too, but I'm a sucker for that. Anyway, we go for a walk around the zoo. Not really given a shit about the animals because we're too into each other like a, hey, look, an aardvark. Oh, you have really pretty hair. It was great. I'm not the, I'm not a bad person. After all, my heart is beating again for this girl. I feel happy. Whizzy STD thing here. All right, so we leave the zoo, go to the bar for a kiss. It's amazing electricity. Then she goes, I've got to tell you something. Oh Jeez. Here we go.

Speaker 9:          01:47:56       Here we go. You got to admit, at that point you were worried that she had a dick. Right? There's something I have to tell you. Um, I have three nipples and I'm married to seven different men in Iraq. Uh, which is the sentence you don't want to hear on a first date, blah, blah, blah. So she, anyways, oh no, I just looked ahead. Oh, Jesus. Brace yourself. I look at her and I say, go on. And she goes on to tell me that a few months ago she was seeing some guy who went down on her and it turns out she had a cold, he had a cold sore on his mouth and now she has herpes.

Speaker 1:          01:48:35       Ugh.

Speaker 9:          01:48:37       So she's got an incurable STD that can be passed on at any point. What do I do about that? Obviously I get the hell out. I should be running as far from her pussy as I can. Right. But I like her. I haven't liked anyone like this for a long time, but I also never had a disease. I look at my shit in that. I look, I look after my shit in that way. So I'm in a dilemma. I like her, but she's damaged. She's, she's a bit of a skank in the past, possibly. But she did the right thing and laid that on the table for me. What should I do? I'm clouded right now. How much am attracted to her? I need you to help bill. Um, yeah. You get get the fuck out. Get Out. Get Out. Get Out. Yeah, you'll meet another girl too. You don't need to do that. Listen, she fucked up. You didn't fuck up. No, no, no. I, I'm saying my shit. She didn't fuck up. Someone gave her an STD. And how do you don't know how she got the STD? That's just a story she told. Well either way like that should happen. It's not like a, it's on a death sentence and B, you shouldn't judge people because they have an STD. Let me ask you Steve, let me ask you a question. She takes her meds,

Speaker 12:         01:49:48       she is on top of it and make sure that you know, she doesn't have any breakouts. If she does, she does what she needs to do and they use protection the entire time and he goes to his doctor and consult about, listen, my girlfriend has this, I don't want to catch it. What can we do or he finds some of with the clean pussy that makes his heart go pitter patter and all. I don't think it's right to be like no, stay away from her because she has herpes because it's like people have STDs. It's not, listen, if you want to find the right person to life, you got to be selfish and I don't know anybody who has on the list when they think of this soulmate. Nobody has herpes. No, of course not. In an ideal world, you're both clean. Yeah. In an ideal world you don't have sores on your genitalia.

Speaker 12:         01:50:33       I know, but sometimes that shit happens and like this is what they need to do. They need to have a herpes social network and people can just meet each other on the herpes social network and they can just pass it back and forth to each other. They don't have to worry about it. Yeah, and then they can, they can go halvsies on their herpes meds and it's all good. It's all good. Think halvsies is, I'm preaching STD segregation. I'm reaching out separate but equal social website. I think it should be tolerant and I think he should talk to her about it. She probably knows everything that she needs to do in terms of medication. I think you're full of shit. I think if the guy had sores on his dick, he, you'd be like, you'd be like, girl, can you start rolling your head like you're on a talk show?

Speaker 12:         01:51:19       You need to get out debt. Shit, no, I wasn't really like the guy or girl. Then you should just talk about it. You know? What do they say? Like in Manhattan, like one in three people has an STD now please don't quote me on that. I could be wrong, but something insane where like STDs are like through the roof. So obviously you should do everything in your power to protect herself. But again, he's also just dating this girl. He doesn't have to sleep with her right away. Then there's no fucking point. There's no fucking point as a guy, see how it goes and you let me finish. There's no point. There's no point in being with a woman unless you're going to bank. There's no fucking point. Well, I understand that. But they could have like an open conversation about that and go to the doctor together.

Speaker 12:         01:52:00       They can like they can have a mature open line of communication about it. Look, I'm not sure if you actually, if you feel like this girl is the one then, I mean that's pretty powerful. The fact that she has herpes and you're still being like, you know, but I've actually, and he, hey, easy, easy, easy up and down fucking Camden street or any, and he's been careful. He's been careful. He kept his breastplate on, he fucking had his, his condom on can catch an STD, especially through oral sex because how many people are using condoms when they go down on a guy and how many people are using dental dams? Nobody. Can I, can I, can I give some one night happens. So if you're going to be doing that kind of stuff, yes. One needs to be aware that that could happen. All right, I'm going to give some one night stand advice from a dirty, filthy old man.

Speaker 12:         01:52:49       All right, one nice Dan in seven years. So what? So what I saw about it. You don't have it anymore. You're done baby. I got you. It's over all. Wait a minute. This is what you do. One of the first things you want to do is you want to romance to, so you get out, you get, you get out your George Michael, a cassette tape. No, this is the thing, okay? Certain things don't change. Certain things don't change. Okay? One night stand. You never ever, ever repeat. Ever go down on somebody. You don't do anything. Okay? I don't even kiss him. One night stand. You go in, you talk shit. You pull the fucking hair, you bend them over and you put on a condom and you bang them. That's what it is. What am I trying to fucking be a gentleman? We're here to fuck.

Speaker 12:         01:53:38       We are fucking, you do it. Just the way prostitutes, dude. That's why prostitutes, you know that there's no fucking kissing anything. Did you want to bang? You put a condom on and you just do the act. You don't fucking, you don't try to sit there and impress him with, what do you mean in your port on garden gardener gloves. You finger pop them a little bit and this isn't helping this guy. Don't ever, don't ever, I'm trying to help other guys. Don't ever go down on a woman you don't know ever. You shouldn't do it ever and you should wait until you guys are in a serious relationship and then have her get tested and make sure that that that lamb may finish, that you're not going down on a God damn sewer. Yeah. The same thing with the same thing with women guys. What guys stick their dicks.

Speaker 12:         01:54:25       Half them joined frats. They had a fucking ox at some point or some sort of farm animal. You never, oral sex is for someone you're in love with. I didn't give a shit. If you fucking into it, you just, you don't do it. Okay, so you can avoid something like this. So this is what I would say. Listen, if you think this girl is the one then by, I was just trying to be funny. That by all means. I guess, you know, do it, but you're also early, early. You said it, you already said it. I don't need to say it again. People heard it. There's a rewind button. Um, I'm an I'm an I'm an hour. Well go grab it. Grab a Mike. They're right there in the closet. Yeah. Why don't when you walk in here, just come in with a mic and be prepared for the Gig.

Speaker 12:         01:55:05       Um, yeah, don't ever go down on somebody in a one night stand. I really need to make that into a bumper sticker. Um, last question. If you really liked, I said, if you really likes her then, then definitely pursue it. But you know, also, do you want to deal with this shit? You know, it's got understand that you fall in and out of love with somebody in a relationship and when you fallen out of love with her, when you're really getting mad, you're going to be thinking, herpes shit. You fucking cold sore fucking motherfucker. You give me thinking crazy shit. Just don't. I mean if you're gonna pursue her or whatever, don't be using that is in your back pockets a thrown in our face because like I said, anyone can get an STD at any time. It doesn't mean you're a slut or you're a dirty guy

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       that does a bunch of stuff irresponsibly. Sometimes shit happens, it's life and other times you are other times, other times you were filthy fucking whore, a man whore or a female horror and what you do is you got to listen to you. When you got an STD, you're fucking damaged goods. So you got to come up with the fucking story. I just go one time told me she had herpes. She told me she had it on her knee. She said she was in a hot tub. She told me, she told me she was in a hot tub, someone in their hat, she scraped her knee and she just got it on her knee and as long as she didn't in those quadrants of nerves, as long as she didn't stress it wouldn't fucking move. And gradually she starts telling me more of the story and it magically moved up to her fucking VGG.

Speaker 4:          01:56:27       Yeah, she had fucking genital herpes and she didn't fuck it. Tell me. Fortunately I work God damn condom. And the second she told me the nice story, I was like shoving off to buffalo, shoving up the buffalo low. You know everybody, if you're out there that you, you know, you, you run into shit. Okay. But that's why you always wear a fucking condom. Always. Always. And yes, and guidance. A lot of guys out there who can't fucking maintain a fucking erection because they're so used to raw dog and that if you put that on, it feels like they're wearing a winter coat. All right? This is what you gotta do. Don't jerk off for a few days and then try it. Cause then you're just be site. Anything is even remotely touching you down there or rub one out with a conduct. Just get used to it.

Speaker 4:          01:57:09       It sucks. But I'm telling you this, it's gotta be nothing worse than fucking waking up and having that shit. You know, core is, it's terrible. And you, and she probably feels really bad and embarrassed about it, so it's like, I don't know. And she could also be lying how she got it. She could be like him. She could have been a fucking whore going out bang and everything. And that's how she got it. Yeah. Here and you're right. And people need to take responsibility. If you get herpes, you need to take like 50% of it. You're 100% right. But I'm just saying, I would just feel bad if someone was like, oh, I have herpes and nobody, you know, wants to be with me, even though I'm trying. I know you're right. I'm trying. I'm trying to be funny. I'm out trying to find balance to try and give this guy some good advice.

Speaker 4:          01:57:49       Good advice. You know, you don't have to settle in life, but if you feel like this person's the one that definitely pursue it, but don't be fucking just sitting there. You know? The worst way to go into a relationship is if you feel bad for somebody, I feel bad. I want to help them. It's fucking pathetic. You don't want to do that shit. You want someone who's your equal or if not bet aim fucking has was telling this kid he wanted to go to a prom. I go fucking definitely go to your prom and as some girl that you think Saudi eleague, that's how you improve your life. You shoot her. How the fuck did I ended up with you? Yeah, I'm definitely out of here. Oh, I had low self esteem that night and I was just like, ah, fuck it. I'll, Nah, I'm just joking. We are an hour and 23 minutes into this podcast. I haven't even talked about the youtube videos. I got to go. These are the best fucking youtube videos that we've had in a while.

And then for those guys who love to watch a baseball manager yell at an umpire, we have to Wally Backman videos of him just absolutely losing his shit. One of the one's hilarious.

It wasn't even close in. The empire. Just goes, what are you talking about? And he just snapped. What the fuck you're there. What am I talking about? It's awesome.
