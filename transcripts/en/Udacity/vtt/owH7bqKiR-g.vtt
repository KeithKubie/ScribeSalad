Ã¯Â»Â¿Student Brian Yee asks, weÃ¢Â€Â™re using python two in this class but python three exists,

00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:10.426
are we Ã¢Â€Â“ is what weÃ¢Â€Â™re learning outdated? Does it not help us in the real world?

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:12.260
Okay, so fair enough question.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.297
There is a newer version of python and almost everything that weÃ¢Â€Â™ve learned in this class,

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:22.095
it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t matter whether youÃ¢Â€Â™re using python or a Java Script or scheme or C or Java,

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:25.219
any program or language, the basic concepts that weÃ¢Â€Â™ve learned really apply

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.173
to all of those languages in the same way.

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:32.255
Now, developing skills as a programmer is useful to learn different languages

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.801
and different languages have slightly different ways of doing things

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.204
and we talked in the previous question about the pythonic way

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:40.695
being the best way to do something in python to really take advantage of

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:43.942
the design and the style that python programmers expect.

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:49.070
Python three is different from python two and in some ways itÃ¢Â€Â™s not that different.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.005
So almost everything that youÃ¢Â€Â™ve written in this class would work

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.729
in python three and would be the same way to write it in python three,

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.597
some things wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t. And most code today,

00:00:58.597 --> 00:01:02.051
python two is still used more widely than python three.

00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:06.375
There is some incompatibilities in python three that mean itÃ¢Â€Â™s very hard to move libraries

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:09.825
that were written for python two to work in python three

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:12.781
and the infrastructure that weÃ¢Â€Â™re using is all working in python two,

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:16.537
not in python three. So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the real reason that we use python two

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:18.337
for this class instead of python three.

00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:21.468
But essentially everything that youÃ¢Â€Â™ve learned would be the same

00:01:21.468 --> 00:01:24.290
and would be very easy to transfer if you start writing python three code.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.408
Some things will be a little different and probably the most notable thing

00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:29.947
that would be different is print would work differently.

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:33.747
So the code that youÃ¢Â€Â™ve written that uses print would not work in python three,

00:01:33.747 --> 00:01:35.959
youÃ¢Â€Â™d have to add extra parentheses for that.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.381
But otherwise everything would really be the same,

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:43.152
there is no concepts that would be different, itÃ¢Â€Â™s just a matter of different things

00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:47.000
defined slightly differently in different languages.
