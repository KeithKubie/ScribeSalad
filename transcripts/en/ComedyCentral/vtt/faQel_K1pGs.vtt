Okay, is your person a man?

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.747
You know, they might
be gender non-binary.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.084
Okay. You know what, you go.

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:24.590
Okay. Is your person a cis,
straight, white,

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.259
probably skinny-dicked cog
in the machine

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.728
of the suffocating,
heteronormative, patriarchal,

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:32.599
misogynistic, value-driven,
Judeo-Christian,

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.300
military-industrial
complex?

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:40.507
I mean, I don't think
he's white, but I'm not sure.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:41.707
I shouldn't assume.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:42.942

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.011
Yeah. Okay.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.081
Is your person wearing
any sort of accessory?

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:51.884
I mean, are we including
procedures

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:54.553
meant to protect the gender
nonconforming from hate speech

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.256
based solely on appearance?

00:00:57.923 --> 00:00:59.492
I just meant like earrings.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.726
Oh, no.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:04.129
Okay. Yes, baby, two down.
Here we go.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:11.237
Okay, is your person
Hispanic?

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.872
Okay, you know what?
I think we're good here.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.273
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel good.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:16.042
I think we're good.
I feel good. I had Max.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.343
I had Anita, so good game.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.544
