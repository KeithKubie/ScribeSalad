00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.630
Is procrastination ruining your life?

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.910
Don’t worry, science has a solution!

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.519
Hey everyone Crystal here with DNews!

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.000
We’ve all been there.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.580
You procrastinated on writing a paper or studying
for an exam and now your grades are going

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.830
to suffer and there is nothing you can do
about it.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.420
Now it’s true that there may not be any
way to significantly improve your performance

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.590
on a project you procrastinated on, but science
says there is a way to improve your performance

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.730
and reduce your tendency to procrastinate
on studying for your next project.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.390
The solution?

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.390
forgive yourself.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.340
Researchers at Carleton University revealed
that students who reported high levels of

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.870
self-forgiveness for procrastinating when
studying for their first exam, were less likely

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.000
to put off preparing for their next exam.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.210
Procrastination is characterized by short-term
avoidance past the time most likely to produce

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.510
optimum performance or completion of a task
and this study suggests that students who

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.829
self-forgive will be able to “get over”
the fact that they hate studying, and be less

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.650
likely to attempt to improve their mood by
avoiding the task entirely.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.700
Learning to forgive yourself for procrastinating
could also could promote general improvements

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.450
in feelings of your self-worth and positive
mental health.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.010
Which could help switch your behavior from
“avoidance” which is a passive way to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.550
deal with you problems, to “approach”
an active way to attack problems.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.050
Extrapolating further, people who engage in
positive behaviors like forgiveness and positive

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.020
self-talk are more likely to experience reduced
stress and experience good outcomes like goal

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.020
achievement.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.630
So telling yourself “This sucks, I hate
this” instead of “I can do it” is actually

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.520
hurting your chances of doing well on that
test.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.290
A study of self-talk published in the European
Journal of Social Psychology discovered that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.430
even speaking to yourself in the first person
(using “I” statements) is not as effective

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.970
as speaking to yourself in the second-person
(using “you” statements).

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.530
For instance “I can do it” is less effective
at improving task performance than “you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.530
can do it”.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.420
This measured improvement could explain the
observation that we tend to switch into second-person

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.200
language when we are encountering significant
challenges and in more demanding situations.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.399
So how we treat ourselves really matters!
and I guess what I am trying to say is … “You

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.759
can do it”!

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.780
Forgive yourself for watching this video and
get back to work!

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.810
