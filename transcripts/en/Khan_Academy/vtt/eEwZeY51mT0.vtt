00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:01.295
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:03.061
So I'm gonna start talking about curl.

00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:06.256
Curl is one of those very
cool vector calculus concepts,

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.067
and you'll be pretty happy
that you've learned it

00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:09.654
once you have, if for no other reason

00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:11.487
because it's kind of
artistically pleasing.

00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:12.738
And, there's two different versions,

00:00:12.738 --> 00:00:15.420
there's a two-dimensional curl
and a three-dimensional curl.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.739
And naturally enough, I'll start talking

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:17.945
about the two-dimensional version

00:00:17.945 --> 00:00:20.382
and kind of build our
way up to the 3D one.

00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:21.768
And in this particular video,

00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:23.197
I just want to lay down the intuition

00:00:23.197 --> 00:00:25.410
for what's visually going on.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.293
And, curl has to do with the
fluid flow interpretation

00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:29.589
of vector fields.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:30.661
Now this is something
that I've talked about

00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:31.533
in other videos,

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.946
especially the ones on
divergents if you watch that,

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:35.912
but just as a reminder,
you kind of imagine

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:38.125
that each point in space is a particle,

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.293
like an air molecule or a water molecule.

00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:41.836
And since what a vector field does

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:45.010
is associate each point in
space with some kind of vector,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.513
now remember we don't always
draw every single vector,

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.055
we just draw a small sub-sample,

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:51.446
but in principle, every
single point in space

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:52.955
has a vector attached to it.

00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:54.547
You can think of each particle,

00:00:54.547 --> 00:00:56.826
each one of these water
molecules or air molecules,

00:00:56.826 --> 00:01:01.096
as moving over time in such a
way that the velocity vector

00:01:01.096 --> 00:01:03.531
of its movement at any given point in time

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.297
is the vector that it's attached to.

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:06.951
So as it moves to a
different location in space

00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:08.671
and that velocity vector changes,

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.750
it might be turning or
it might be accelerating,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.226
and that velocity might change.

00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:16.393
And you end up kind of a
trajectory for your point.

00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:19.511
And since every single
point is moving in this way,

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:21.277
you can start thinking about a flow,

00:01:21.277 --> 00:01:23.333
kind of a global view of the vector field.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.696
And for this particular example,

00:01:24.696 --> 00:01:26.752
this particular vector
field that I have pictured,

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.630
I'm gonna go ahead and put a blue dot

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.594
at various points in space,

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:32.180
and, each one of these you can think of

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.304
as representing a water
molecule or something,

00:01:34.304 --> 00:01:36.539
and I'm just gonna let it play.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.355
And at any given moment,
if you look at the movement

00:01:39.355 --> 00:01:41.008
of one of these blue dots,

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:43.155
it's moving along the
vector that it's attached to

00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:45.545
at that point, or if that
vector's not pictured,

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:47.110
you know the vector that
would be attached to it

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.697
at that point.

00:01:48.697 --> 00:01:50.686
And as we get kind of a
feel for what's going on

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:52.094
in this entire flow,

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:55.827
I want you to notice a
couple of particular regions.

00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:57.555
First, let's take a look at this region

00:01:57.555 --> 00:01:59.365
over here on the right.

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:00.660
Kind of around here.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.432
And just kind of concentrate
on what's going on there.

00:02:03.432 --> 00:02:04.706
And I'll go ahead

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:07.263
and start playing the animation over here.

00:02:07.263 --> 00:02:09.074
And what's most noticeable
about this region

00:02:09.074 --> 00:02:11.778
is that there's counterclockwise rotation.

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:14.259
And this corresponds to an
idea that the vector field

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.874
has a curl here, and
I'll go very specifically

00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:18.729
into what curl means, but just right now

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:20.629
you should have the idea that in a region

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.573
where there's counterclockwise rotation,

00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:24.808
we want to say the curl is positive.

00:02:24.808 --> 00:02:27.512
Whereas, if you look at a
region that also has rotation,

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:29.657
but clockwise, going the other way,

00:02:29.657 --> 00:02:32.026
we think of that as being negative curl.

00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:33.948
Here I'll start it over here.

00:02:33.948 --> 00:02:35.401
And in contrast, if you look at a place

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:38.195
where there's no rotation,
where like at the center here,

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:40.474
you have some points coming
in from the top right

00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:42.329
and from the bottom
left, and then going out

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.380
from the other corners.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.677
But there's no net rotation.

00:02:44.677 --> 00:02:48.945
If you were to just put like a
twig somewhere in this water,

00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:50.934
it wouldn't really be rotating.

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:52.499
These are regions where you think of them

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.666
as having zero curl.

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:57.483
So with that as a general idea,
clockwise rotation regions

00:02:57.483 --> 00:02:59.025
correspond to positive curl.

00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:01.125
Counterclockwise rotation regions

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:02.309
correspond to negative curl,

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:04.523
and then no rotation
corresponds to zero curl.

00:03:04.523 --> 00:03:06.691
In the next video I'm
gonna start going through

00:03:06.691 --> 00:03:08.545
what this means in terms
of the underlying function

00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:11.093
defining the vector field
and how we can start looking

00:03:11.093 --> 00:03:14.177
at the partial differential
information of that function

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:17.284
to quantify this intuition
of fluid rotation.

00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:19.809
And what's neat is that it's
not just about fluid rotation.

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.760
If you have vector fields in other context

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.017
and you just imagine that
they represent a fluid,

00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:26.201
even though they don't,

00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:28.123
this idea rotation and curling

00:03:28.123 --> 00:03:29.844
actually has certain importance

00:03:29.844 --> 00:03:32.526
in ways that you totally wouldn't expect.

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:34.671
The gradient turns out
to relate to the curl,

00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:36.929
even though you wouldn't
necessarily think the grading

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.695
has something to do with fluid rotation.

00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:41.320
In electromagnetism, this
idea of fluid rotation

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.415
has a certain importance,

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:44.493
even though fluids
aren't actually involved.

00:03:44.493 --> 00:03:47.041
So, it's more general than
just the representation

00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:49.432
that we have here, but
it's a very strong visual

00:03:49.432 --> 00:03:53.078
to have in your mind as
you study vector fields.
