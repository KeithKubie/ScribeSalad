WESLEY CHUN: This
is Wesley Chun.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.170
Here at Google,
we want our tools

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.480
enable you to build
the next killer app.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.090
In this Dev Byte,
I'll introduce you

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.820
to the core components of
the Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.370
I'll also share a few stories
of what others have already

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.189
done with it.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.480
Once you're familiar with
the services in the platform,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.250
you too will be able to leverage
Google's vast resources,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.460
experience, and performance to
help you power that great idea.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.650
At Google, we're always thinking
about scale and innovation.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.150
Here are some of
the research papers

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.120
we published over the
years, many of which

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.910
have led directly to services
in the Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.450
You already know Google Search
and YouTube and Gmail services

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.300
which run at Google scale.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.550
What if you could take
advantage of that kind of scale

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.550
and innovation that's
behind our services,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.410
but for your big idea?

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.880
This is where the Google
Cloud Platform steps in,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.750
enabling you to take your
app to the power of Google.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.416
What is the Google
Cloud Platform?

00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:56.790
Well, in brief,
it's a collection

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.810
of services organized into three
categories-- compute, storage,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.690
and application services
to help your apps scale.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.710
Pick and choose which
services you want,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.070
and only pay for the
resources you use.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.950
We begin with the
compute category,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.400
where we've got Google App
Engine and Google Compute

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.140
Engine.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.930
Let's start with Compute
Engine, our computing solution

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.600
at the infrastructure
as a service layer.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.090
Create Linux virtual
machines and connect to them

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.060
like any other network computer.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.029
They feature persistent disks
with snapshotting, live virtual

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:29.320
machine migration to get
around those pesky maintenance

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.210
periods, networking and
firewalls, load balancing,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.320
and regional zones
for high availability

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.850
to implement your
technology stack and solve

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.650
really big problems with.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.730
How big?

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.895
Well, here's an example
of really big data.

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:44.520
Let's say you were
going to get married

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.530
and you wanted a huge wedding
and needed prepare invitations

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.780
for your closest
15 billion friends

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.420
and relatives, which is roughly
7 billion guests from Earth

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.640
and the other eight
from other planets.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.470
Well, anyway, let's
just say we had that

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.850
and you were organizing the
addresses, roughly about

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.565
100 bytes each,
for the envelopes.

00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:05.440
But to make sure there
aren't any duplicates,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.160
you would need to
sort all of that data.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.210
Well, the MapR did
something similar last year

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.060
using Hadoop on Compute Engine
to set the minute sort record.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.610
Their app was able to take 15
billion 100 byte directors,

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.130
meaning 1.5 terabytes,
or 1,500 gigs of data,

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.140
and sorted it all in
less than a minute.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.460
On top of this, they were
able to reproduce this result

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.520
consistently across multiple
runs and different cluster

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.820
configurations.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.680
Click the link for more details.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.800
The other Compute
solution is App Engine,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.740
our platform as a
service offering.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.870
This solution is for developers
who want to be more hands off

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.480
and don't want to deal that
much with system administration.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.920
So components living between
the hardware and your app,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.020
such as the operating system,
the database, and web servers,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.100
are all managed by Google so
you can focus on your app.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.170
Build your solution
using familiar languages

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.150
like Java, Python, PHP, and Go.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.420
Upload your code and let Google
take care of everything else.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.970
Snapchat is a highly popular
photo sharing service

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.170
which serves more than 350
million photos or snaps a day.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.530
What got them to scale
to where they are today?

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.940
Google App Engine.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.210
Google Cloud Storage is for
your massive data repository.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.610
Store any number of files and
blobs of virtually any size

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.630
securely with controlled
access to users,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.960
as well as apps and other Google
Cloud Platform services that

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.480
can process and
analyze your data.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.240
Song Pop is this
generation's name

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.740
that tune app running
on Google App Engine.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.200
Along with Google Cloud
Storage, their app

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.690
serves more than 18
terabytes a day of music

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.810
to its 80 million users.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.890
Google Cloud SQL is the fully
managed, highly available

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.180
relational database
service in the cloud.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.070
Create, configure, and
use MySQL databases,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.460
but host it in our data centers.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.340
The standard MySQL
wire protocol lets

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.380
you connect to Cloud SQL
from any app anywhere.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.130
And it also supports JDBC.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.430
Free yourself from replication,
encryption, patch management,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.220
and backups so that you
can focus on your solution.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.830
One of its best
features is its pay

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.810
per use model, where customers
can opt to pay for a database

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.870
only when it's being used, and
then for inexpensive storage

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.660
the rest of the time.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.370
Google Cloud Data
Store is the place

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.830
to store your NoSQL
key value data.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.290
It's a fully managed service
which automatically handles

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.700
sharding, replication,
and scaling.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.930
The storage mechanism is
schemeless and supports either

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.530
object based or SQL-like queries
as well as Asset transactions.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.250
Cloud Datastore is
the same technology

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.700
that powers App Engine's
native data store.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.440
Google BigQuery is an
exciting, massive data analysis

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.310
tool that lets you make
queries on data sets

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.000
that were previously impossible,
difficult, or significantly

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.540
time consuming-- data sets such
as baby names for the last four

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.290
decades, every word
written by Shakespeare,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.330
or global historical weather
station data since 1929.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.220
Using BigQuery, you can
analyze terabytes of data

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.420
in mere seconds using
SQL-like queries.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.860
Here in BigQuery's
interactive web console,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.930
you can issue ad hoc queries
against your data set.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.550
Take it for a test drive with
one of these free public data

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.420
sets today, such as the
ones I just mentioned

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.340
or this particular
query, which lets

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.030
you pull up the five top
most updated Wikipedia pages.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.370
Google Cloud Endpoints
enables you to seamlessly

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.600
create APIs or application
endpoints to your service,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.520
allowing you to more easily
add new web or mobile front

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.390
ends to your existing service.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.540
It's the glue between
your app's front end

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.659
clients and your back end.

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.075
Your web or mobile
clients connect

00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:49.750
to Cloud Endpoints
via Google App Engine

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.940
so that you can go back
end services there or have

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.780
skeleton codes sitting on
App Engine for those requests

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.620
to your actual back
end, whether it

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.050
be on Compute Engine or
other external servers.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.970
Security via data
authorization is automatically

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.780
handled between the front
ends and App Engine.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.010
There is even a tool that
generates border plate client

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.200
side code in Java for
Android, Objective C for iOS,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.530
and JavaScript for
generic web access

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.510
to help you get
going even faster.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.410
So that's the Google
Cloud Platform--

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.590
what it's done for others
and most importantly, what

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.810
it can do for you.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.020
We look forward to helping
you with your next big idea.
