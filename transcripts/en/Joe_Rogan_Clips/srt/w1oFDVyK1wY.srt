1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,230
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah. I love Uber.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,800
I wonder how much that's preventing drunk
driving. I just had this conversation.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,940
Yeah. I think what, you know,
mothers against drunk driving mad,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,020
you know, maybe even the government
should like kick in and go like, you know,

5
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:19,690
these guys are saving lives.
Yeah. For sure. If you get,

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,520
cause if you're not doing that, then
you're drinking and driving most likely,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,310
most likely. So it gives you a
real easy option. Yeah. Yeah.

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,190
And it's so quick. It's so convenient.
You don't have to pull cash out. It's,

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,280
it's great. It's kind of a weird
organization of both of them.

10
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:38,430
It's like they're trying to figure
out if their employees, right.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,040
With their contractors.
Yeah.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,100
And then there's like this fact that
you're just getting into someone's car,

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,760
you don't know them. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean you assume that if you get a limo,

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,420
but there's a background check, right.
If you get a cab, you living on the edge.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,130
Right. That's how I was going to say.
If he never know exactly. Robert Deniro,

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,320
a hundred people looking at
me. Yeah. That's all. I'm
going to fucking psychopath.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,330
Right. That's what you'd like. But you
would get like New York City cab driver,

18
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:08,331
he'd get characters and you get either
like a angry white dudes or like a guys

19
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:12,230
who come from other countries. I
can tell you cool stories. Yeah.

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,130
You get like characters, weird smells and
shit. Crazy smells, lots of weird music.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,080
Possibly a Voodoo doll,

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,780
but now you know what you get when
you get in New York City cab driver,

23
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,960
you get advertisements and you'd screens
like they have little laptops facing.

24
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:26,700
Yeah,

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,990
and the play these these credit card
machine back there and they play these,

26
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,260
these videos about things
about restaurants and this
and that shows that's its

27
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,430
own network at this point. Yeah, like
just the cab network. It is kind of right.

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,230
It must be, yeah. I've seen that.

29
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:46,110
Probably has their own little loop that
they pledged Jimmy Fallon and I mean

30
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,780
I've seen him down there
many times doing stuff.

31
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,100
I remember they used to do that HBO
show Taxi Cab Confessions. Yeah.

32
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,060
That was crazy. I enjoyed that. I was
like, Hula Fuck is signing this release.

33
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,710
We've given these people. It's
like, I just want to be on TV.

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,420
And I would say the worst stuff,

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,620
like if you're fucked up on coke and
you get into a a cab and you start just

36
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:12,140
talking shit about all the crazy
sexual stuff that you like, and then,

37
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,580
and then afterwards they're like, hey,
you're going to be on HBO. You're like,

38
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:18,280
fuck yeah, I'm inside that thing. And
then you wake up in the morning. No,

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,690
that's true. Call doing that. This,

40
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,520
this waiver at the right time. Yeah,
that's gold. That's a good move.

41
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,750
How does that work?
Does that mean to you if you're hammered,

42
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,450
I,
there's gotta be some loophole.
