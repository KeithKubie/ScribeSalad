GREGORY RAIZ:
Raizlabs is a company

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.140
that is focused on building
excellence in software,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.790
technology, and design.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.330
We do that through our work
on mobile applications,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.720
and websites, and
technologies in general.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.000
My name is Gregory Raiz, I'm
the CEO and founder of Raizlabs.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.980
We really want to understand
the human problem.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.350
And, oftentimes, the
hard problems in software

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.319
aren't just the technology
problems-- the API,

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:35.860
the how do you
connect these things--

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.484
but really getting
at the heart of what

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:40.920
people are trying to accomplish
and do in their day-to-day.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.420
BEN JOHNSON: My
name is Ben Johnson.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.050
I'm the Managing Director
at Raizlabs in Boston.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.320
We decided to put our hat in the
ring for the Google Certified

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.950
Agency Program.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.280
The first leg is
just having access

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.740
to a lot of what
Google is doing today,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.880
so there is access to design
reviews, invitations to events.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.380
And that's sort
of the base level.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.940
And I think that's
hugely rewarding,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.900
even in and of itself.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.380
Having Google review your
app from a design perspective

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.099
is amazingly helpful.

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:10.140
So that's the first tier.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.570
The second tier comes
with certified status.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.990
There's a long application
process for that.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.520
And once you have
it, it's something

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.320
that you can really say to your
clients that gives them comfort

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.310
that we're a reputable
firm, that we're

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.120
building great software in a
way that Google believes in.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.120
GREGORY RAIZ: The certification
is a higher bar for us

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.770
to really
differentiate ourselves

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.810
from many of the other
companies out there.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.230
It required us to really
dig into what that

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.210
means to be truly world class.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.630
And we wanted to set that
bar for ourselves as well.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.040
JON GREEN: My name is Jon Green.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.150
I'm a VP Creative at Raizlabs.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.880
The Google Developer
Agency Program

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.446
allowed us to have access
to engineers for the map

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:52.320
team, the design team
to figure out, oh, how,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.310
can we actually do
some of these things?

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.226
And we could reach out
to them when we needed.

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:58.100
And also that allowed
us to set up and say,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.160
we can make this success.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.600
They might look
closer at this app

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.933
because we're a part of this
program, which has actually

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:03.840
been super helpful.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.340
GREGORY RAIZ: Some
of the challenges

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.490
in building the Six
Flags app, and which

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.210
touched on some of
these are certainly

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.720
mapping technology and payment
technology, material design,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.400
or the APIs.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.220
Having access to the Google
team to really ascertain

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.170
how we're approaching
certain software

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.540
and ensuring that we're
building technologies

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.610
the right way makes for a
smooth development process.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.110
BEN JOHNSON: We set off
to build the Six Flags app

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.660
with a pretty lofty ambition.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.330
And it was to bring in-park
navigation and commerce

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.080
to the app.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.760
The comfort of
knowing that Google

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.910
is there to help us understand
where they are heading

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.690
as an organization, and that
we're along for that ride,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.210
is a really helpful
thing to know.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.810
And as a business we know
that going forward we're

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.080
going to be at the cutting edge
of whatever Google is doing

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.890
through access to programs,
through collaboration

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.030
with their teams.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.650
It's really helpful
for us to know

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.230
that six months, nine
months down the road,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.930
we'll still be a
part of that process,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.660
and we'll still be working with
them to figure out what's next.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.410
