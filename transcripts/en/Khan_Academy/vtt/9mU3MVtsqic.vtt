00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.180
If you roll a six-sided
die and a four-sided die,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.020
what is the probability
that neither die shows a 1?

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.330
The grid below shows all
the possible outcomes

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.306
of rolling a six-sided
die and a four-sided die.

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:15.180
And we're fairly familiar
with six-sided die.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.884
Those are the cubes that we're
used to from the board games

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.800
that we've been playing
our entire lives, that

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.170
look something like that.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.670
And your roll is
whatever is the face up.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.120
You're probably less
familiar with four-sided die.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.450
These are more like these
triangular pyramids.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.130
They look something like this.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.300
So it has 1, 2, 3, and then
the one side on the bottom.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.880
And here your roll is
actually the face, the side,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.107
that is facing the bottom.

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:41.690
And so what you have
here is a picture

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.200
of all the possible rolls.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.070
They have the six-sided die, the
side that's facing on the top.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.700
And then on the
triangle, this shows

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.140
what is the result of the
roll of the four-sided die.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.620
So this actually would be
the side that's facing down.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's actually try to
answer their question,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.620
because they gave us all of the
possible outcomes of rolling

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.800
a six-sided die and
a four-sided die.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.810
So we want to know,
what is the probability

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.670
that neither dies shows a 1?

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.440
So how many total
outcomes do we have?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.485
Let's see-- 1, 2, 3,
4 by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:13.190
4 times 6, that makes sense.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.990
There's six possible outcomes
for the six-sided die,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.900
four possible outcomes
for the four-sided die.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.556
4 times 6-- so there's 24
total possible outcomes.

00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:24.930
And then how many
of the outcomes

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.050
meet our constraint that
neither died shows a 1?

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.832
So this one.

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:31.290
So anything in this
row isn't going

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.070
to meet our constraint,
because these have a 1

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.462
on the four-sided die.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:36.920
And nothing in this
column is going

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.836
to meet our constraint,
because these have a 1

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:40.290
on the six-sided die.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.710
But all of these,
everything left over,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.330
these are going to
meet our constraints.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.130
These are going to
meet our constraints.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.874
And how many of these
outcomes are there?

00:01:53.874 --> 00:01:54.540
Well, let's see.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.190
There's 3 by 4-- 3 times 4.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.290
So there's 12 possible
outcomes here.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.350
12/24 is the probability.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.490
You could say there's
a 12/24 probability.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.940
But if you wanted to write
it as an equivalent fraction

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.030
that's using lower numbers, this
is the same thing as-- divide

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.295
the numerator and
denominator by 12-- 1/2.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.100
So the probability that
neither die shows a 1 is 1/2.
