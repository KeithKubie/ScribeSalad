00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.275
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:04.100
ELIZABETH KOLBERT: Thanks, Ern.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.770
Thanks for giving
up lunch or whatever

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.560
you're giving up to be here.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.270
I am just going to start by
introducing you to this fellow.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.810
The book is sort of
arranged with 13 species

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.470
as their sort of focal point.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.737
And this guy's at
the end, so I'm

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:25.070
giving away the end of the book.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.650
But it doesn't really
have a surprise ending,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.020
so I think I can do that.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.490
So he's a Hawaiian
crow or an alala.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:42.400
And there used to be several
species of Hawaiian crows,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.187
which probably diverged from the
crows you see around New York

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:48.020
probably several hundred
thousand years ago.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.320
So it's a case a bit
like Darwin's finches

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.730
where a very small
founder population arrived

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.920
on the Hawaiian archipelago.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.400
We don't know how, because
Hawaii is really quite, quite

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.300
distant from the mainland,
thousands of miles.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.940
And then they
speciated, radiated out

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.050
so that they could occupy
the different islands

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.320
and fill different
ecological niches.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.380
But the difference
is that, actually,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.120
most of the species
of Hawaiian crows

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.070
went extinct before
modern times.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.590
And this one is also under
very, very heavy threat.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.330
And in the '80s,
the state of Hawaii

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.320
realized that there
were only very few left.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.162
They took them into captivity
to try to breed them.

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:32.019
Oh, thanks.

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.560
No, I'm good.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.060
Thanks.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.340
Thanks a lot.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.810
And this particular
bird is a male bird

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.410
by the name of Kinohi.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.400
And he was born at
this breeding center,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.580
which is actually on Maui.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.160
The bird is native
to the big island,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.360
but this breeding
center's on Maui.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.660
And he's a very odd
duck, as they say.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.120
He doesn't really think
of himself as a crow.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.530
We're not sure what
he self identifies as.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.580
One woman who takes
care of him told me

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.900
that he once fell in
love with a spoonbill.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.255
So he refused to mate
with any of the females.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:17.310
At the Maui facility,
there's maybe 50 females,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.670
100 birds all together.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.830
And he refused to
mate with any of them.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.180
But his genes are
really important.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.015
So they took him to
the veterinary hospital

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:27.860
at the San Diego Zoo.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.920
And there he came under the
care of a very, very experienced

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.590
reproductive physiologist,
who was really eager to get

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.120
a vial-- let's just put it this
way-- of his genetic material

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.330
to take back to Maui with her.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.970
So every spring, when it's
breeding season on Maui,

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.530
she takes Kinohi on
her lap and strokes him

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.130
in a way that male crows are
supposed to find very, very

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.080
exciting, hoping that he's going
to deliver so that she can take

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.060
a vial of his
ejaculate back to Maui.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.320
But at the time I visited,
he had not yet delivered.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.720
So she was still at it.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.746
And crows are really
smart, as you know.

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:16.520
And Kinohi can
imitate human speech.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.100
And he says, I know.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.900
That's his phrase, which is
really quite extraordinary.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.120
And when I heard that, it
sounds kind of demented.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.000
He has this demented sound.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.720
But it seemed to
really encapsulate

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.700
a lot of the themes of the book.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.370
On the one hand, the
incredible lengths that people

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.510
are going to to try
to save this species.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.390
Meanwhile, though,
all of the forces that

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.650
brought the Hawaiian
crows to this point

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.260
are all still raging, and,
in fact, are being increased.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.482
Because Hawaii-- there's
now avian malaria on Hawaii.

00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:52.940
There didn't used
to be mosquitoes.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.773
Now there are mosquitoes
with avian malaria.

00:03:54.773 --> 00:03:57.486
And as the climate
warms, these mosquitoes

00:03:57.486 --> 00:03:58.860
are moving up the
mountain slope.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.410
So there used to
be refuges for some

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.580
of the native birds on
the tops of Hawaii's very

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.760
tall mountains.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.580
And avian malaria is now
moving up the mountain.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.660
So birds on Hawaii are
really, really in trouble.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.540
So he is sort of the emblem,
in a way, for the whole book.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.890
And he's the animal
that I end it with.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.840
So I guess I'll sort of step
back and say what is the book.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.820
What is the sixth extinction?

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.560
The implication
here, obviously, is

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.550
that there were five
other extinction events.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.800
And that is true.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.320
These are what are
called the big five,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.030
the major mass extinctions of
the last half billion years.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.260
And what you're looking at is
time is running from your left

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.150
to your right in
millions of years.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.140
So 600 million
years ago to today.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.650
And where you see
those dips, you're

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.610
seeing the number
of marine families.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.400
This is from the
marine fossil record.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.880
And you're seeing the number of
marine families on the y-axis.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.160
And if you remember
from intro bio,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.430
a family is the level
right above a genus.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.820
So species, genus, family.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.430
And if even one species made it
through this extinction event,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.450
then this species is
considered a survivor.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.590
So on the species level, the
losses were much, much greater

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.310
than they are even
on the family level.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.170
And mass extinctions are just
defined as moments in time

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.860
when the diversity of life
suddenly and very radically

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.590
contracts.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.925
One British paleontologist,
Michael Benton,

00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:36.520
whom I quote in the
book, uses the metaphor

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.900
of the tree of life.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.340
During a mass
extinction, he's written,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.320
vast swaths of the
tree are cut short as

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.750
if attacked by a crazed,
axe-wielding madman.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.190
So the first, number
one there, that

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.140
occurred about 440
million years ago

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.430
at the end of the Ordovician
Period when most of life

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.920
was still in the sea.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.250
So that was very devastating
to marine organisms,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.280
but not to terrestrial
organisms because there just

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.520
were no terrestrial organisms.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.360
And number five, that's the
most famous, most popular,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.969
if you will.

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.510
And that is the
extinction event that

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.890
did in the dinosaurs and
a lot of other groups

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.050
at the end of the
Cretaceous Period.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.070
And there's a pretty
broad scientific consensus

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.000
that that was caused
by an asteroid impact.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.730
I don't have a photo
I can show you,

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.910
but this is someone's best
guess of what that looked like.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.972
So to say we're in the middle
or on the verge-- some people

00:06:35.972 --> 00:06:37.680
would say we're on
the verge, some people

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.260
would say we're
already pretty deep

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.910
into-- the sixth
extinction is obviously

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.250
a pretty serious claim.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.560
And this claim
arises from the fact

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.620
that we are changing the
world very radically and very,

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.620
very fast, so not unlike
an asteroid impact.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.290
And in fact, I have
heard scientists

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.950
say that right now,
we are the asteroid.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.610
So how are we doing this?

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.680
There are a lot of ways.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.580
I'm just going to touch
on a couple today.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.300
We're changing the atmosphere.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.960
You all know this.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.950
It's really simple stuff.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.420
We drive our cars.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.926
We light our homes.

00:07:21.926 --> 00:07:24.300
And all of this, we're doing
with fossil fuels right now.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.490
And there's 7.2 billion
of us on the planet,

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.370
so it adds up pretty quickly.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.780
And what we're doing when
we are burning fossil fuels

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.790
is we're taking carbon that's
been buried underground

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.680
over hundreds of
millions of years

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.290
and we're shooting it back
into the atmosphere very,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.960
very quickly in a matter of
centuries, quite possibly.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.510
So we're basically running
geological history backward

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.090
and at a very, very high speed.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.040
And so if you were an alien
and you came to earth,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.760
you could actually
easily conclude

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.810
that what we're doing,
that the whole point

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.090
of modern industrialized
society is actually

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.420
to effect this transfer
as quickly as possible,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.270
to see how much carbon we
can get out of the ground

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.770
and how fast we can throw
it back up into the air.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.835
And if the aliens were
measuring this process,

00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:16.270
they'd say we're actually doing
it as well as we possibly can.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.720
We're increasing CO2
levels every year.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.920
These are obviously our
measurements of this process.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.940
I'm sure you're all
familiar with this graph.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.340
This is the Keeling Curve,
measuring CO2 concentrations

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.110
in the air, once
again from Hawaii,

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.250
from the National Weather
Services Observatory

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.539
on Mauna Loa.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:39.720
And that jig-jag pattern,
that seesaw pattern you see,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.130
that's a seasonal signal.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.360
Because when the
trees and plants

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.340
of the northern hemisphere
put out their leaves

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.450
for photosynthesis in the
summer, global CO2 levels fall.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.370
And when they drop their
leaves in the winter,

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.900
then they rise again.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.990
So that's quite a recent
reading, 396 parts per million.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.910
You may recently have
read that CO2 levels hit

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.320
400 parts per million.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.420
They did very briefly at
the end of last winter.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.409
They're going to again
now, this winter.

00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:12.950
And then they're
going to keep rising

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.840
in that seesaw sort of
way until they never

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.920
go below 400 parts per million.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:23.980
Because obviously, we show no
signs of ceasing to emit CO2.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.170
And if we want to see how we're
doing on a longer term way,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.310
then we can look
back at ice cores.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.010
Probably many of you have
seen this graph, too.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.690
What you're looking
at here-- once again,

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.940
we have parts per million
of CO2 on the y-axis, time

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.610
on the x-axis, running
once again from left

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.150
to right, so from 800,000
years ago to the present.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.580
You're looking at actual
bubbles of past atmospheres

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.780
that were extracted from an
ice core taken on Antarctica.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.205
And all that the
Antarctic ice sheet is

00:09:55.205 --> 00:09:58.360
is just layers of snow that
were laid down year after year.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.670
So we can actually
see over time what

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.280
happened to the atmosphere.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.360
And those jig-jag cycles that
you see, those are ice ages.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.550
So when CO2 levels are low,
ice creeps down all the way

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.270
to the island of
Manhattan, which

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.740
was glaciated in
the last ice age.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.090
And then it creeps back
up again into the Arctic.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.420
And you're looking at
eight glacial cycles there.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.150
You see where people emerged
around 200,000 years ago.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.240
And you can see that
CO2 levels were never

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.980
above 300 parts per million
over the last 800,000 years

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.640
until very, very recently.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.090
And now we're going up at what
looks on a scale like this

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.180
to be a vertical line.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.630
And if we want to go
even further back,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.880
we can tease out the
composition of past atmospheres

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.800
by looking at things
like the shells

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.980
of little tiny
marine creatures that

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.772
fell to the bottom of the sea.

00:10:49.772 --> 00:10:52.100
And those have big error bars.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.080
But it seems pretty clear
that to get CO2 levels that

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.590
are significantly
higher than today's, you

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.050
have to go back to
around the Miocene,

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.180
around 20 million years ago.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.220
And at the rate we're going,
we could reach those levels

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.790
by the middle of the century.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.840
And if we keep on going, we
could reach levels probably not

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.540
seen since the Eocene,
around 50 million years ago,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.180
by the end of this century.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.790
So obviously, what's significant
about this is on the one hand,

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.980
CO2 is just a greenhouse gas.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.600
I'm not going to bore you
with a global warming spiel

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.770
because you all know it.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.250
But I am going to just show
you this little video that NASA

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.220
has made.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.420
It's just a re-creation
of global temperatures

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.270
over the last 130 years or so.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.030
And what you need to
know to understand

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.870
it is that as the colors
get warmer-- so more

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.350
orangey and more yellow--
the world is warming.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.886
That signifies
warmer temperatures.

00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:50.051
So here we go.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.472
So that stops in 2011.

00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:20.570
So hopefully they'll
update it soon,

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.570
because it's a very powerful
visual representation.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.633
And so what does that
mean for living things,

00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:33.310
for the creatures
on this planet?

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.760
The polar bear
has sort of become

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.820
the icon of species that are
endangered by climate change.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:44.450
Because the Arctic sea ice is
disappearing very, very fast.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.610
And without minimizing
the problems

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.340
that the polar bears
are facing, what

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.046
I write about it in
the book, actually,

00:12:51.046 --> 00:12:53.420
is that it's actually likely
that climate change is going

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.542
to have an even more profound
effect in the tropics.

00:12:57.542 --> 00:12:59.750
And there are a couple
reasons for this, one of which

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.200
is just that the tropics are
where most things actually

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.400
live.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.800
So in this slide, you're looking
down from about 12,000 feet.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.940
We're in the Andes in Peru.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.380
You're looking down that ridge.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.910
And I went there
with a scientist

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:22.850
from Wake Forest who had
laid out these tree plots.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.450
And each plot was exactly
two and a half acres.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.510
And there were about 20 of
them arrayed down this ridge so

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.400
that each one had a
different elevation

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.380
and each one had a different
average annual temperature.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.610
And they had measured,
tagged, and IDed

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.580
the species of every
tree in these plots.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.735
And so they had come
up with, in this 20 two

00:13:46.735 --> 00:13:50.130
and a half acre plots,
roughly 50 acres,

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.650
over 1,000 species of trees.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.220
So in the entire
Canadian Royal Forest,

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.920
which stretches over
a billion acres,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.410
there are only about
20 species of tree.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.910
So here we see in
50 acres, in an area

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.410
roughly the size of, I
think, like Fort Tryon Park,

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.070
we're seeing 1,000
different species.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.620
So that just shows
you that the topics

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.580
are where most species are.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.730
That pattern is repeated over
most groups of organisms.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.270
And one of the characteristics
of tropical species

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.190
turns out to be that they have
very narrow climatic ranges.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.620
So one of the things this
guy said to me was-- we're

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.970
going down this ridge.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.440
He said, you're going
to see like a leaf

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.860
on the path with an
interesting shape.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.980
Focus on that shape.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.010
Watch as we go down the path.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.590
You're only going to see
that leaf for maybe 100

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.450
meters or so, because that's
the whole range of the tree.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.180
This is the only
place where it lives.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.720
And what they were
looking at was

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.310
as the Andes warm-- and
the Andes are warming

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.300
very quickly-- what
are those trees doing?

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.930
They can't move, obviously,
but they can seed themselves

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.134
at higher and higher elevations.

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:02.300
And that's what's happening.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.250
You do see a lot of
species on the move.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.800
But you also see
a lot of species

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.050
that are not on the move,
that are just sitting there.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.920
So as the climate
changes, these communities

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.950
are going to clearly break down.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.450
And new ones will
presumably form.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.950
And the question
of what will happen

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.210
to all of the organisms that
depend on what's there now,

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.200
all of the birds and all the
insects and all the mammals,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:24.950
is an open one.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.140
It's very hard, obviously,
to track insects.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.370
They don't respond well to
having these little tags nailed

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.720
into them.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.510
But as the scientist, Miles
Silman, pointed out to me,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.510
we're going to find out.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.100
We're in the process
of finding out.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.630
We are running this experiment.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.110
We can only run it once,
but we're running it.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.110
And we're going to find
out the answers to that.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.350
So how else are we
changing the world?

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:57.730
Well, another very big effect
of carbon dioxide emissions

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.660
is the phenomenon known
as ocean acidification.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.240
I suspect everyone
in this room is

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.860
pretty familiar
with how that works.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.720
But I'll just give
you the basics.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.530
And that is that the oceans
have absorbed about a third

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.960
of the CO2 we put up so far.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:19.720
That comes to about 150
billion metric tons every hour.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.804
The oceans absorb another
million metric tons of CO2.

00:16:22.804 --> 00:16:24.970
And the net result is that
the acidity of the oceans

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.340
has increased by 30%.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.570
So when CO2 dissolves in
water, it forms an acid.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.110
That's just pretty
basic chemistry.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.970
It's a weak acid.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.380
You drink it when you drink
a Coke, but it's an acid.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:44.160
And we are changing the pH of
the oceans very, very rapidly.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.270
And what the effects
of that are going to be

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.530
are also not that
easy to anticipate.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.780
Obviously, marine
creatures only interact

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.490
with their outside
world through the water.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.610
But one thing that
seems pretty clear

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.320
is it's going to
impact anything that

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.830
has to build a shell
or an external skeleton

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.230
out the mineral
calcium carbonate.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.630
It really affects the
energetics of doing that.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.480
And lots of things do that.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.859
These are tiny little
marine calcifiers

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.960
called coccolithophores.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.109
You're seeing them under
high magnification here.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:24.060
Common shellfish like clams
are calcifiers-- sea urchins,

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.480
starfish, coral reefs.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.260
So lots and lots
of marine organisms

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.413
depend on the process
of calcification.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.290
A couple of chapters in the
book focus on marine organisms

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.150
and how they will be affected.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.220
A lot of people
trying to figure out

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.000
what the effects of ocean
acidification are going to be.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.740
And this is a really interesting
sort of natural experiment

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.590
that I visited.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.650
Now, you're underwater here.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.000
We're in the Bay of
Naples in this area

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.920
where there's a lot of
volcanic activity, not too far,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.230
actually, from Mount Vesuvius.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.715
And it happens that
there's CO2 bubbling out

00:18:06.715 --> 00:18:11.290
of the bottom of the sea
there and naturally acidifying

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:11.870
the water.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.340
So I went out with a
British marine scientist

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.540
named Jason Hall-Spencer who
had gotten this idea that if we

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.310
looked at what happens
near these volcanic vents,

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.050
we sort of have a window into
the future of the oceans.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.530
And what you're
looking at here--

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.610
I went with a National
Geographic photographer.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.850
And he took this
wonderful picture.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.440
And what you're looking at here
is we're away from the vents.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.360
We're in a pretty ordinary
Mediterranean community.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.660
You see there's a
sea urchin there.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.870
There's all sorts of
this stiff seaweed,

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.080
which is also calcified.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.640
There's calcifying seaweed.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.120
That smear of pink
you see there--

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.030
that's a tiny little
algae that also calcifies.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.250
So you're seeing lots and
lots of different creatures

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.960
there, different species there.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.460
And now we're moving
near the vents.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.660
You see the CO2 bubbling
out of the water.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.120
And you see what it looks like,
that sort of lunar landscape.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.250
So this is when we get
pretty close to the vents.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.450
And in between, he
looked at every sort

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.850
of possible pH between these
two and came to the conclusion

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.590
that at the pH that oceans
are likely to reach,

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.600
all of the oceans
by around 2100,

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.100
if we continue to emit
CO2 at our current rate,

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.860
that about a third of the
species in the Mediterranean

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.440
dropped out at that pH.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.991
They just can't keep up with it.

00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:40.740
So another way we're
changing the planet--

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.300
and this is just the last one
I'm going to touch on today--

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.100
is by moving species
around the world.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.700
Everyone's familiar
with this, the problem

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.040
of invasive species.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.180
Oh, sorry-- I skipped over this.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.740
Coral reefs are a huge concern.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.330
Coral reefs are calcifiers.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.110
This is just a quote from
some British marine scientists

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.400
that it's likely that reefs will
be the first major ecosystem

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.940
in the modern era to become
ecologically extinct.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.690
Because corals turn out
to be pretty sensitive--

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:16.720
many, many species, at least--
to these changes in ocean pH.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.370
So back to our invaders.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.670
This is an Asian carp.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.100
He's much in the news.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.160
Asian carp is actually
several different species.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.210
They're incredibly voracious.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.290
They're filter feeders.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.860
They just eat through
everything in the water column,

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.970
have a terribly devastating
effect on native fish.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.170
There's just a
study that came out

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.740
from the Army Corps of Engineers
about what it would take

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.400
to keep Asian carp-- which are
headed toward the Great Lakes--

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.110
what would it take to keep
them out of the Great Lakes.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:48.560
And the Army Corps of Engineers
put a price tag of $18 billion

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.810
on that one.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.000
These are zebra mussels.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.920
I don't know if people read the
story in yesterday's "Times."

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.860
They're invaders
from Eastern Europe.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.040
They're also voracious,
voracious feeders,

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.700
have done incredible damage,
do commercial damage,

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.600
stick to everything that
they come in contact with.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.570
And really, really have
devastated native mollusk

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.240
populations.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.350
And there was a piece
yesterday about a scientist

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.980
who was trying to find
a biological agent,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.280
like a bacteria-- in this
case, a bacteria-- that

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.560
could potentially
fight zebra mussels.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.430
So we all have-- if
you have a backyard,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.910
you doubtless have plants in
it that are not native species.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.380
Some people have pets that
are not native species.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.600
But most of our
nonnative species

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.420
these days are being
moved around unconsciously

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.560
and inadvertently.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.450
And it's been
estimated, for example,

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.510
that 10,000 species
are being moved

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.470
every day around the world
just in ballast water.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.030
And this is another
way that we're

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.990
sort of running geological
history backward

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.390
and at a very high speed.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.690
So what you're looking at
here is the configuration

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.610
of the continents about
250 million years ago,

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.800
when they all crashed together
and formed one super continent,

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.930
which has become
known as Pangaea.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.600
And then they drifted apart
owing to plate tectonics.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.770
And we got the world
as we have it today.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.060
So all of these things have
been evolving separately.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.430
The species in South America and
Africa and India and Australia

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:25.440
have been evolving separately
for tens of millions of years.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.430
And when we bring
them all together,

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.850
it has the effect of crashing
those continents back together

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:31.350
again.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.430
And you sometimes
hear this phrase

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:39.210
that biologists use that we
are creating the new Pangaea.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:43.170
And oftentimes, this
has no particular result

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.900
when you bring species together
that have been long separated.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.510
And sometimes it has sort of
a not benign result, but not

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.600
very dramatic result.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.760
They just sort of co-exist.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.610
But every once in a while, you
get really disastrous results.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.410
And when you think
about it, if you're

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.130
moving at least 10,000 species
around the world every day,

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.330
you don't need a
very high proportion

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.550
of those interactions
to be disastrous

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.860
before you have
quite a big problem.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.700
So this is actually the species
that I begin the book with.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.530
So we've worked our way sort of
from the end to the beginning.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.570
It's a Panamanian golden frog.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.910
It's a very beautiful
animal, as you can see.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.920
It was considered a
lucky symbol in Panama.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.120
It used to be printed on
lottery tickets, which

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.260
is rather ironic.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.970
Because the golden frog-- and
really, all frogs in Panama--

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.290
started disappearing
in the 1990s.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.740
And scientists
eventually figured out--

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.700
this is sometimes called
the amphibian crisis.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.910
And it truly is a crisis.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.270
And scientists
figured out that they

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.170
were being killed by a fungal
disease that had probably,

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:57.810
almost certainly, been ferried
around the world on frogs

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.040
by people moving animals
around the world.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.820
And one theory which
has not been proved

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.300
is that it was moved around
the world on these frogs called

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.490
African clawed frogs, which were
used as early pregnancy tests.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.010
Because if you inject a
female African clawed frog

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.610
with the urine of a
woman who's pregnant,

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.660
she will lay eggs
within a couple hours.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.630
So obstetricians actually
used to have tanks these frogs

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:27.330
in their office.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.060
And a lot of them were let go.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.615
You now have
naturalized populations

00:24:31.615 --> 00:24:34.260
of African clawed
frogs around the world.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.840
So one theory is that the fungus
moved on African clawed frogs.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.050
And anyway, it was
moving through Panama.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.520
And it was this
interesting moment

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.269
where people could
actually watch it move.

00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:47.480
They actually could see
the frogs disappearing.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.460
And then they realized,
or they hypothesized

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.130
that it was moving east,
sort of along the way

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.130
that the rivers move.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:00.550
And they decided to
try to get a population

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.010
of these particularly
beautiful frogs and also

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.650
some other species native
to central Panama out

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:11.029
of the rainforest and into some
kind of protected facility.

00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:12.820
And they didn't have
any place to put them.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.528
They went out and got
the frogs, but they

00:25:14.528 --> 00:25:16.460
didn't have any place
to put them initially.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.070
And so initially,
the frogs literally

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.760
had to be put up at a hotel.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.370
Then they built this facility.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.540
This is the El Valle
Amphibian Conservation Center.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.105
You might be able to see
some little golden frogs

00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:31.440
in those tanks.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.430
And this is one
of the few places

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.880
that the golden
frogs exist anymore.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.200
They're now extinct in
the wild, like the alala.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.860
There are some in
zoos and there are

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.660
some at this
conservation center.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:53.450
So I'm going to wrap up at
the beginning of the book.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.290
You could, in some ways, say
that this is a heartening

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.380
story.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.670
Like the alala, it
shows that people really

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.980
are concerned about
other species--

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.720
to use the words
of Rachel Carson,

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.555
that they care about what Carson
called the problem of sharing

00:26:09.555 --> 00:26:12.320
our earth with other creatures.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.210
And in the course of
reporting the book,

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.400
I did spend a lot of time
with people who have really

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.220
devoted their lives
to this problem.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.770
A lot of them are
scientists, like the woman

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:28.410
who was trying to get
Kinohi to deliver.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.120
But a lot of them were
also ordinary people.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.880
For example, at the El Valle
Amphibian Conservation Center,

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.900
I met volunteers who had
come down from the States.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.280
They'd paid their own way.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.600
They were using
their vacation days

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.780
to help out because
they wanted to help out.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.480
And obviously, even people
who are not directly involved

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.030
in conservation give a lot of
money to groups like the World

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.020
Wildlife Fund and the
National Wildlife Federation,

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.740
Defenders of Wildlife--
the list goes on and on.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.050
And I'd like to be able to
end on that upbeat note,

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:11.500
that if more of us just got
involved in efforts like this,

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.500
then that would be sufficient.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.680
But I'm going to
be frank with you

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.300
and say that's not really
where I come out in the book.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.200
One of the central
points of the book--

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.600
really the central
point of the book--

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.290
is that our involvement, our
caring is not really the issue.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.990
What's really the
issue are the many ways

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.410
in which we are
changing the planet.

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.340
And this is what makes us
comparable in our impacts

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.100
to an asteroid.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.770
And unfortunately, unless
and until we really

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.230
confront that fact, the
magnitude of the impacts

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:54.460
that we're having, then
I'm afraid we're not really

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.460
fessing up to the problem.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.159
So thanks a lot.

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:00.454
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:08.909
Howdy.

00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:09.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.930
You showed a graph earlier.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.517
It was in animation where you
showed the different parts

00:28:13.517 --> 00:28:15.766
of the world becoming warm
and cold and warm and cold.

00:28:15.766 --> 00:28:20.680
And it ended with the north part
of the globe being very warm.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.310
Was that relative temperature?

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.800
ELIZABETH KOLBERT:
That is off of a median

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.830
that they choose, some year.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.310
I can't remember
exactly the year,

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:34.270
but yes, everything is
temperature deviation

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.650
from this median.

00:28:43.992 --> 00:28:44.700
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.100
Hi.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.141
ELIZABETH KOLBERT: Howdy.

00:28:46.141 --> 00:28:49.860
AUDIENCE: So you talked
about fossil fuel use.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.400
That seems to be the big issue.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.990
But there's also a lot happening
in the world moving away

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.330
from fossil fuels.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.870
So first of all, are
there any other--

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:04.620
we do a lot of other
stuff besides burn fuel.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.880
ELIZABETH KOLBERT: Yeah,
and we burn a lot of fuel.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.180
AUDIENCE: But is that sort
of a hopeful thing, that we

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.424
are starting to use
more green energy?

00:29:14.424 --> 00:29:16.090
ELIZABETH KOLBERT:
It's a hopeful thing.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:21.430
But in terms of
actual numbers, we

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:28.450
can go back to-- we're
using more renewable energy.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.390
We're also using
more fossil fuels.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.230
If you just look at
emissions trends,

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.290
they're not leveling
out worldwide.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.220
They have leveled
out in the States.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.270
But worldwide, they are actually
tracking them, very high end.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.012
There are these scenarios
which people may or may not

00:29:44.012 --> 00:29:44.720
be familiar with.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.620
The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.239
had these scenarios,
like this is

00:29:49.239 --> 00:29:50.780
what the future's
going to look like.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.000
Here's low emissions future,
here's a medium emissions

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.920
future, here's a high
emissions future.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.500
We are tracking the
high emissions future.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:06.369
So until that graph levels
off-- on some level,

00:30:06.369 --> 00:30:07.910
I don't want to say
it doesn't matter

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.240
if we're using more renewable.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.070
Obviously, it does.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.900
It's taking away from what that
trend line would look like.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.010
But until we turn
that around, we

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:23.420
haven't really gotten a
handle on this problem.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.310
So I do think it's very hopeful.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:29.200
Obviously, look, if we
could convert our economy

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.650
to not running on fossil
fuels, that would be huge.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.500
That would be making an impact.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.580
That really would be.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.740
But I don't see signs
that we're really

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.640
on that kind of an actual
transformative course yet.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.490
How's that?

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.080
And I'm not alone.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.750
It's not my pessimism.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:54.395
I don't think anyone see
signs of that at this point.

00:30:54.395 --> 00:30:56.020
AUDIENCE: I know this
was a short talk.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.811
You've talked a lot
about the carbon cycle.

00:30:57.811 --> 00:31:00.710
But do you also talk in
the book about nitrogen,

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.697
some of the things that
agriculture is doing?

00:31:02.697 --> 00:31:05.030
ELIZABETH KOLBERT: I do not
get into the nitrogen cycle,

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.670
but I could have.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:10.472
One of the kind of
interesting things--

00:31:10.472 --> 00:31:11.930
if you want to call
it interesting.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.638
I don't know what the
right adjective is.

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:15.900
I could have chosen
different ways in which we're

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.130
changing the world
on a planetary scale.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.440
And the nitrogen cycle
could have been one of them.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.280
We fix more nitrogen--
I don't know

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.740
if people remember their
high school bio, once again.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.340
But you need to fix nitrogen.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.130
Plants can't use the
nitrogen from the air

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.350
because it's bound
together in N2.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:39.380
So we need nitrogen-fixing
bacteria to transform nitrogen

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.590
into a usable form.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.790
And when people figured
out-- early in this century,

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.300
a German chemist figured out how
to take nitrogen from the air

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.687
and convert it to
ammonia and fix nitrogen.

00:31:50.687 --> 00:31:52.770
And that was the beginning
of nitrogen fertilizer.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.670
It's exactly a
century ago, in fact.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:58.130
We just celebrated a century
of nitrogen fertilizer.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:02.020
We now fix more nitrogen than
all terrestrial ecosystems

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.930
combined.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:06.550
That has huge, huge
impacts on living things.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:10.010
It's why, for example, we
have a dead zone every summer

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.120
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.870
Because all that
fertilizer comes down

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.625
the Mississippi River.

00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:16.760
It fertilizes the Gulf.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.170
You get these huge algae blooms.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.740
The algae dies.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.630
It drops to the bottom.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.430
And you have deoxygenated water.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.280
And dead zones are
increasing worldwide.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.890
And it's all a function of
nitrogen fertilizer runoff.

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.574
So that would be
a whole other way

00:32:31.574 --> 00:32:33.115
that we could have
this conversation.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.780
AUDIENCE: Speaking
of agriculture,

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:46.112
I read that even if we stopped
using fossil fuels for power,

00:32:46.112 --> 00:32:50.580
the agriculture that
we used to produce meat

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.770
would still contribute more than
half of the greenhouse gases.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.740
But not carbon dioxide--
different ones.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.115
Is that accurate?

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.305
ELIZABETH KOLBERT:
I don't think so.

00:33:04.305 --> 00:33:05.810
How's that?

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.870
Our cows and things like
that are burping methane,

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:10.450
for example.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.280
That's one way that
agriculture just produces CO2

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.405
without actually
burning fossil fuels.

00:33:16.405 --> 00:33:18.030
But I think maybe
what you're referring

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:22.130
to is studies have shown that
meat production in general,

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:27.650
which is pretty fuel intensive
and pretty crop intensive,

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.750
obviously.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:33.750
And also has these other
effects of methane emissions.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.840
They are a major
source of emissions.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.710
So a lot of people,
smart people,

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.750
have sort of
advocated that we all

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:45.340
eat either a lot
less meat or no meat.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.179
And that that would have
a significant impact

00:33:48.179 --> 00:33:48.720
on emissions.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.990
And I think it would.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.380
It's not going to
eliminate the problem,

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.915
but it would have an impact.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:00.510
I'm wondering if you've
encountered a lot of climate

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:03.290
change deniers or
human impact deniers.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:08.940
And if you have, what sort of
arguments have swayed them?

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.900
ELIZABETH KOLBERT: Well,
climate change denial

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:22.860
is such a weird sort of
counterfactual world.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.679
Here's a graph
showing you what's

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.070
happening to CO2 levels
in the atmosphere.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:30.480
And if you know CO2's a
greenhouse gas-- which we know.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.920
We've known for
150 years-- and you

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.770
know you're increasing it very
rapidly and very radically,

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:38.440
you'd say, OK, well, I kind of
expect the world to warm up.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.900
So we just have these
ridiculous arguments,

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.210
like it's cold in
New York this week.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:46.920
So there can be
no climate change.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.348
It's impossible.

00:34:49.348 --> 00:34:51.889
Much smarter people than I have
spent a lot of time thinking,

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:56.130
how can you counter such
ridiculous arguments

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.330
at this point?

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:58.200
And it's very hard.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.270
I don't have the
answer for that.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.190
But in terms of
other human impacts,

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.330
interestingly enough,
you very rarely

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:11.580
hear people being ocean
acidification deniers.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:16.699
It's either too complicated
or it's just irrefutable.

00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:20.180
You increase CO2
levels in the air.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.010
Very basic chemistry
tells us you're

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:26.250
going to be increasing carbon
dioxide levels in the oceans.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.470
We can measure it.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:28.610
We are measuring it.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:32.650
The pH of the surface waters
of the ocean is declining.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.350
It's pretty irrefutable.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.110
And once again,
the list goes on.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.810
We're obviously altering
the nitrogen cycle.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:44.440
It's not really
possible to deny that.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:49.010
So the weird way that we're sort
of fixated on climate change,

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:53.140
yes or no, I think is
a complete function

00:35:53.140 --> 00:36:00.630
of a bunch of increasingly
embattled information sources,

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.350
which have been funded by
all the usual suspects.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:07.460
All of that is
true that you read.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.730
Thanks for coming to
speak with us today.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:13.260
That picture of the
stark differences

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.330
in what the ocean looks like is
almost enough to make someone

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:17.360
want to cry.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.370
ELIZABETH KOLBERT:
Yeah, it should be.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.578
AUDIENCE: And I think there
are a lot of smart people

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:22.360
who realize that
change is happening.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.990
But it feels so impossible
to make any change happen.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.950
And I guess my first
question to you would be,

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.700
what could change things?

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.980
But I guess, in thinking
about my question to you,

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.190
it's more a question of do you
think there's anything that'll

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.300
change this trajectory,
and what would that be.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.595
Because it feels almost like
an insurmountable issue.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.160
ELIZABETH KOLBERT: Yes.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.920
Yes, it does feel that way.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.810
I think one of the reasons
I'm glad to be here and then

00:36:52.810 --> 00:37:00.720
talking to you folks at
Google is because there are

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.540
very smart people at Google who
are very aware of this problem

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:09.100
and know what it takes for
transformative technologies

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:13.770
to enter our world
and really change

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:16.270
the way we think about things
and the way we do things.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:20.070
And I think that that
is one possibility.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.970
And there is one possibility--
some gentleman said

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:27.960
before, there are renewable
sources of energy out there

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.970
that are increasingly
being deployed.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.180
And that is true-- not
in a transformative way

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.770
at this point.

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.950
But it seems to
be not impossible

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:40.800
that that could happen if very
smart engineers, like those

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.890
at Google, put
their minds to it.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.960
It seems to me that
that is a possibility.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.190
I am not an engineer,
so I don't claim

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.610
to know what that's going to be.

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:55.110
But there are very, very,
very big forces at work here.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.590
There's 7.2 billion
people on the planet.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:01.840
A lot of people want to raise
their standard of living, which

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.120
unfortunately right now tracks.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.420
Global GDP and global
carbon track each other.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.880
And until and unless we uncouple
those or decide to have a lower

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.540
GDP, we're in this cycle
where emissions are just

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.700
going to keep going up.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.490
Impacts are just going
to keep increasing.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.260
And I certainly
don't claim to have

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.510
the answer of how we're going
to break that connection

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:29.450
or if we're going to
break that connection.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:31.779
But it doesn't seem to
me impossible that that

00:38:31.779 --> 00:38:32.320
could happen.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.030
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about-- besides

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:41.860
domesticated and invasive
species, what kind

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.520
of animals or species are
benefiting from human impact?

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.380
And is that change in
scope or population count,

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.210
is that a big effect relative
to the first-order effects

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:55.689
of human impact?

00:38:55.689 --> 00:38:57.730
ELIZABETH KOLBERT: That's
a really good question.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.755
And I don't have a
great answer for that,

00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:02.380
but it's a really
interesting question.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.760
For example, rats seem
to do really well.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:16.749
All of the species that we know
benefit from human disturbance

00:39:16.749 --> 00:39:17.790
seemed to do really well.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:20.360
So rats have been taken
around the world by people.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.024
They are now on islands,
like the Hawaiian islands

00:39:23.024 --> 00:39:23.940
where they never were.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.090
The Hawaiian islands
had no mammals.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:30.340
They're on really
tiny distant islands

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.479
in the Alaskan peninsula,
where people never

00:39:34.479 --> 00:39:35.270
bothered to settle.

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:38.342
But they left rats behind.

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:39.300
So rats are everywhere.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.400
And one of the guys
that I went out

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.054
with in the book, a
British geologist, sort of

00:39:45.054 --> 00:39:46.720
speculated-- and it
was tongue in cheek,

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.810
but only half tongue
in cheek-- that rats

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.550
will inherit the
earth, that that

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:55.442
will become a dominant group.

00:39:55.442 --> 00:39:57.400
But I think it is a really
interesting question

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.280
because clearly, yes.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.680
Ecospace that's being
emptied by other species

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.120
may or may not be being
taken up by species

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.590
that benefit from
human disturbance.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.210
It's not clear that your
total biomass is always

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.080
going to remain constant.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.980
So I'm sure there are people
doing interesting work on that.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:22.700
But I can't give you any
great statistics on it.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.380
Clearly, also,
domesticated animals

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.820
now make up a
phenomenal proportion

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.945
of the world's biomass.

00:40:29.945 --> 00:40:32.070
MALE SPEAKER: Well, if
there are no more questions,

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.390
let's thank the speaker again.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:35.923
ELIZABETH KOLBERT: Thanks a lot.

00:40:35.923 --> 00:40:37.040
Thank you.
