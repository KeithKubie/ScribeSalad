Scripts are strongly connected to current theories of human cognition.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.672
In fact one recent theory says that brain is a predictable machine. We do

00:00:09.672 --> 00:00:13.704
very quick bottom up processing followed by mostly top down processing with

00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:18.890
general expectations of the world. Then we act on those expectations. This idea

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.670
in fact is so strong, that when it fails it leads to amusement, or surprise, or

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.575
anger. If I violate the expectations of your script, you might find it funny or

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:33.690
surprising or you might be upset about it. An interesting and open question is,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.590
whether we carry the scripts in our hear or do we generate them at run time?

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.810
Scripts are also current with the notion of mental models. You and

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.300
I have mental models, or scripts. Not just about social situations like going to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
a restaurant, going to a movie, but also about how the computer program works,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.580
how the economy works, how the car engine works, your physical, social, economic

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.660
works. Note that scripts can be culture specific. In the U.S. for example,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.630
going to a restaurant typically involves leaving a tip. But in many countries,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.550
this is not the case. In fact in some countries, tipping is considered

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.200
insulting. So scripts presumably evolved through cultural interaction over long

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.050
periods of time. But once there, they're a very powerful source of knowledge.
