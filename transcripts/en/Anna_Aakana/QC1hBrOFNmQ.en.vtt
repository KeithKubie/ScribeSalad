It's kitten season!

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.000
And that means your local shelters are overflowing with cuteness and can use all the help that they can get.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.340
I work with Sante D'or Foundation here in Atwater a lot

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.220
and I'm currently fostering a mom and her 5 babies!

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.800
Please meet Anime Wong, Lucy Lu, Jet Lee, Jackie Chan and John Choo whos actually not here today

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.640
Because it got adopted yesterday! YAYYYY

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.560
This mama and her babies and so many more are available for adoption now

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.000
So please don't let them down.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.660
And if you can't adopt for whatever reason, shelters always need help fostering

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.500
And since it is kitten season, this is the cutest time to foster!

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.620
I wanna say thank to audible for sponsoring today's video

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.604
especially because all the proceeds are gonna go to Sante D'or Foundation

00:01:14.604 --> 00:01:18.680
and help all the baby kitties and the mama kitties and the adult kitties that they have there

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.600
So, I'll let them say how thankful they are

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.280
