00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.630
Is laughter the best medicine for depression?

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:09.630
Hello everyone, Crystal here for DNews!

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.820
Nitrous oxide, better known as laughing gas,
is a molecule composed of two nitrogen and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.850
one oxygen atoms that is best known for making
us laugh!

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.310
The gas has a lot of medical applications
due to its analgesic as well as its anesthetic

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.310
properties.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.859
That means it can relieve our pain and cause
us to lose consciousness.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.479
You might have already encountered this ubiquitous
gas in your dentist’s chair, or at that

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.910
party that one time where you were “trying
to figure out how to use the pressurized whip

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.860
cream maker” and “accidentally” inhaled
gas from a canister.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.200
Humans exposed to laughing gas report feeling
dizziness, euphoria, and well … feeling

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.200
happy!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.420
This is probably obvious from the side effect
that gives the gas its common name: laughing.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.170
These known side effects of nitrous oxide
exposure got researchers at the Washington

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.090
University in St. Louis thinking.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.079
Why not use laughing gas to treat depression?

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.940
In a study published recently in the journal
Biological Psychiatry, patients diagnosed

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.770
with treatment resistant clinical depression
received two therapeutic exposures to gas.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.049
In the first treatment session, patients were
given gas that was half oxygen and half nitrous

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.729
oxide, similar to what you’re given at the
dentist.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.100
In the second session, the patients were given
gas that was a only mixture of oxygen gas

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.460
and nitrogen gas, (so basically air).

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.350
The study participants were asked to answer
questions about their depressive symptoms,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.469
like insomnia, sadness, anxiety, and suicidal
thoughts, 2 h, and again 24 h, after the treatment.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.590
24 h after nitrous oxide exposure, patients
reported “mild” or “significant” improvement

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.240
in their depressive symptoms.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.150
Three of the twenty study participants reported
that their symptoms had disappeared almost

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.150
completely!

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.110
But it should be noted that researchers observed
some placebo effects in those who received

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.020
the gas mixture that did not contain nitrous
oxide.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.249
Five patients reported mild improvement, and
two reported that they felt significantly

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:55.249
better.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:59.389
Additionally, the researchers only analyzed
the effects of nitrous oxide exposure after

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:04.579
24 h which is not a lot of time to see “prolonged
effect” and certainly too short of a time

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.170
after treatment to be able to say that depression
was “cured”.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.860
And there are a few other things to keep in
mind.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.250
This was a proof of concept study, and only
20 people participated.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.700
A much more statistically robust study with
possibly hundreds of participants would be

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.390
needed to make any conclusions about the effectiveness
of nitrous oxide treatments on those with

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.390
clinical depression.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.620
But these results are still encouraging!

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.700
If nitrous oxide does cause short term improvements
in depressive symptoms, it could be a good

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.850
way to treat immediate effects of the disease
while patients and their doctors wait for

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.950
prescribed psychiatric medications to take
effect.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.750
It can take weeks for patients starting on
conventional psychotropic drugs to experience

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.020
relief of their symptoms, and patients can
continue to suffer while the drugs build to

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.650
full potency.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.830
Obviously more research is needed, but even
if laughing gas doesn’t “cure” depression

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.140
it could be a tool for doctors to use on critical
patients who need immediate help.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.210
What do you think?

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.600
Does this study give you hope for treating
depression?
